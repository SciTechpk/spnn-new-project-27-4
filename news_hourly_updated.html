<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#indias-aviation-accident-history" id="indias-aviation-accident-history" title="Permalink"></a>India‚Äôs aviation accident history</h2>
<p>In August 2020, an Air India Express plane <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1573123">crash-landed</a> at Kerala‚Äô state‚Äôs Kozhikode airport, claiming the lives of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1646086">21 people</a>, including 19 passengers and the flight‚Äôs two pilots, and injuring 76.</p>
<p>In 2010, an Air India Express jet crashed and burst into flames at Mangalore airport in southwest India, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/912968/plane-crashes-in-south-india-159-dead">killing 158</a> of the 166 passengers and crew on board.</p>
<p>In one of the worst aviation disasters in India, two passenger planes collided mid-air near New Delhi in 1996, with the loss of all 349 on board both flights.</p>
<p>Decades earlier, an Air India Boeing 747 flying from Montreal to London in June 1985 crashed into the sea off Ireland with 329 people on board and leaving no survivors.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs airline industry has boomed in recent years, International Air Transport Association (IATA) Director General Willie Walsh last month calling growth ‚Äúnothing short of phenomenal‚Äù.</p>
<p>The growth of its economy has made India and its 1.4 billion people the world‚Äôs fourth-largest air market ‚Äî domestic and international ‚Äî with IATA projecting it will become the third biggest within the decade.</p>
<p>Air India ordered 100 more Airbus planes last year after a giant contract in 2023 for 470 aircraft ‚Äî 250 Airbus and 220 Boeing.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs domestic air passenger traffic reached a milestone last year by ‚Äúsurpassing 500,000 passengers in a single day‚Äù, according to India‚Äôs Ministry of Civil Aviation.</p></p>
