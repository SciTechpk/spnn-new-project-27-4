                <h2>India‚Äôs top general admits losses in conflict with Pakistan</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Chauhan curious why their jets were downed<br />
‚Ä¢ Claims conflict never came close to a nuclear war<br />
‚Ä¢ Says ‚Äòchannels of communication‚Äô with Islamabad were open<br />
‚Ä¢ BJP leader says PAF shot down five Indian aircraft</p>
<p>NEW DELHI: A day after a BJP politician and staunch critic of Prime Minister Nare¬≠ndra Modi, Subrahmanyam Swamy, claimed Pakistan had downed five Indian planes in the recent military escalation, India‚Äôs top military general admitted losses.</p>
<p>In an interview with <em>Bloomberg</em> on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue on Saturday, Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan admitted losses but dismissed Pakistan‚Äôs claims that it shot down six Indian jets, including four Rafales, as ‚Äúabsolutely incorrect‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat is important is that, not the jet being down, but why they were being down‚Ä¶ Why they were down, what mistakes were made ‚Äî that are important. Numbers are not important,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>In a separate interview to <em>Reuters</em>, Gen Chauhan said the losses India suffered were in the initial stages, on May 7, when it launched Operation Sindoor.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat I can say is that on May 7, in the initial stages, there were losses‚Ä¶ What was important is why these losses occur and what we will do after that,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>However, the chief of defence staff said the armed forces were quick to analyse the ‚Äútactical mistakes‚Äù, remedy them, and again target Pakistan on May 8 and May 10.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe good part is that we are able to understand the tactical mistake which we made, remedy it, rectify it, and then implement it again after two days and flew all our jets again, targeting at long range,‚Äù <em>India Today</em> quoted Gen Chauhan as saying.</p>
<p>It may be recalled that Pakistan military says India did not fly its fighter jets again in the conflict after suffering losses on May 7.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, former law minister Swamy became the most candid Indian to admit that Pakistan Air Force had shot down five Indian planes, including French-made Rafales. Speaking in an online interview, Dr Swamy blamed the French planes as being responsible for the losses, implying that the deal the prime minister had made for them was to blame. The interview came as Mr Modi went about holding mammoth meetings in Gujarat and other states claiming victory and threatening more dire conflict with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Gen Chauhan‚Äôs remarks were the most direct by the army so far on losses suffered during the hostilities, which came as India attacked nine alleged terror camps deep inside Pakistan. It was in response to the horrific Pahalgam attack, which left at least 25 tourists dead.</p>
<p>As Pakistan retaliated by launching a wave of drone attacks targeting Indian military facilities and border towns, the armed forces struck 11 vital airbases with long-range BrahMos missiles, India Today reported.</p>
<p>Previously, the armed for¬≠ces had deflected questions abo¬≠ut Indian jets being shot down by Pakistan. Addressing a press conference, Air Mar¬≠shal A.K. Bharti, Director Gen¬≠e¬≠ral of Air Operations, said ‚Äúlosses are a part of any combat scenario‚Äù. However, he said all Indian pilots ‚Äúwere back‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are in a combat scenario and losses are a part of it. Question is, have we achieved our objective? Answer is a thumping yes. At this time, I would not like to comment on that (loss of jets) as we are still in combat and give advantage to adversary. All our pilots are back home,‚Äù he claimed.</p>
<p>The chief of defence staff also claimed that the conflict never came close to a nuclear war, while underscoring that ‚Äúchannels of communication‚Äù with Pakistan were always open to control the situation.</p>
<p>This flies in the face of US President Donald Trump‚Äôs repeated assertion that he avoided a potential nuclear disaster by mediating the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, the news report said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI personally feel that there is a lot of space between conduct of conventional operations and the nuclear threshold,‚Äù Gen Chauhan told <em>Bloomberg</em>.</p>
<p>During the hostilities, Indian missiles and jets were able to bypass Chinese-supplied air defence systems to target Pakistani military sites, the report said.</p>

                <h2>Govt to intensify crackdown on illegal foreign nationals</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The government has decided to ramp up operations against foreign nationals unlawfully residing in Pakistan, a month after the expiry of a deadline set for around 44,000 Afghan nationals approved for relocation to a third country.</p>
<p>The decision was taken at the third meeting of the Counter-Terr¬≠orism Committee and Har¬≠den the State Commi¬≠ttee held here under the chairmanship of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday.</p>
<p>The government had already announced it would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902083">deport</a> thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting resettlement in the West if the prospective host countries didn‚Äôt relocate them by April 30. Tens of thousands of Afghans came to Pakistan fearing retribution after the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, following the withdrawal of US-led forces.</p>
<p>![ .](<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/18835540">https://www.dawn.com/news/18835540</a></p>
<p>An official told <em>Dawn</em> that so far 1.023 million Afghans had been repatriated. He said 135,865 had been repatriated in April and another 65,057 in May. On May 30 alone, 1,483 individuals had been repatriated.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Naqvi asks all institutions to coordinate for implementation of one-document regime</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, the interior minister said the federal and provincial agencies must coordinate their efforts to eli¬≠m¬≠inate the illegal spectrum undermining nat¬≠io¬≠nal security, emph¬≠asising that all institutions must work together to fully implement the ‚Äúone-document regime‚Äù.</p>
<p>He said that Nadra would provide live data verification facilities at exit points.</p>
<p>Referring to the beggar mafia, Mr Naqvi said they must be dealt with strictly as they were tarnishing the country‚Äôs image. He highlighted the need to declare begging a non-bailable offence.</p>
<p>As a nationwide crackdown on power theft continues, the meeting was informed by a representative of the power division that Rs142 billion was recovered with the cooperation of the interior ministry and provincial governments. The minister said every possible support was being provided to the Ministry of Energy and provincial governments to prevent electricity theft.</p>
<p>The meeting also reviewed progress on anti-encroachment operations.</p>
<p>Regarding maintenance of law and order, the meeting was briefed that more than 250 intelligence-based operations were being conducted on a daily basis.</p>
<p>It also reviewed progress on the establishment of the Pakistan Port Authority, ‚ÄòGwadar Safe City Project‚Äô, besides the construction of a protection wall was also discussed.</p>
<p><strong>Digital transformation</strong></p>
<p>Also, progress on the digitalisation of petrol pumps to curb the sale of illegal and smuggled fuel came under review. According to new rules, customs officers and the relevant deputy commissioner will have the authority to seal petrol pumps and seize vehicles in case of violations.</p>
<p>During the briefing, it was stated that digital enforcement stations were being set up on the Indus River, while work on an Intelligent Trans¬≠portation System (ITS) was also underway for effective motorway and highway monitoring.</p>
<p>Besides Minister of State for Interior Moha¬≠m¬≠mad Tallal Chaudhry, Punjab Law Minister Soh¬≠aib Ahmed Bharti, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Information Adviser Bar¬≠rister Mohammad Ali Saif and Gilgit-Bal¬≠t¬≠istan Home Minister Sha¬≠msul Haq Lone, federal interior secretary, home secretaries of all provinces as well as Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Federal Inves¬≠tigation Agency director general, Nacta‚Äôs national coordinator, Islamabad chief commissioner, coordinator for the National Action Plan and senior officials from security agencies also attended the meeting.</p>
