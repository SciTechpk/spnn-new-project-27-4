            <p><p>At least 13 people died, including nine children, and three were injured over the last 48 hours in monsoon rain-related incidents across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the provincial disaster management authority (PDMA) said in a damage report on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities.</p>
<p>The monsoon death toll since the end of June <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930">surged</a> to 234, according to the National Disaster Mana­gement Authority (NDMA). Heavy rains triggered flash floods in several districts of KP and Gilgit-Baltistan, damaging homes and increasing water levels in rivers and streams.</p>
<p>Over the last 48 hours, Swat has recorded the highest toll as six children and one woman died owing to flash floods and a house collapsing, while a woman and child were injured, the KP PDMA report said.</p>
<p>Three people died in Buner, which experienced heavy rain with thunder and lightning. A woman and her child died in a thunder strike, while an eight-year-old boy was swept away. “The dead body has been recovered by the locals,” the PDMA said.</p>
<p>Incidents caused by heavy rains in Bajaur claimed the lives of a man and a child. The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925908#:~:text=In%20Bajaur%20tribal%20district%2C%20two%20brothers%20died%20after%20being%20swept%20away%20by%20downpour%2Dinduced%20floods%20in%20the%20Lowi%20Mamund%20tehsil.">victims</a> were brothers, aged 21 and five.</p>
<p>“Their mother was successfully rescued while the bodies of both brothers were recovered,” the PDMA quoted the Bajaur Deputy Commissioner’s Office as saying.</p>
<p>Per the report, a woman also died in Upper Kohistan, while a child was injured in Torghar as heavy rains caused a roof to collapse. A total of 19 houses had been damaged due to the heavy downpour, out of which two were completely destroyed and 17 sustained partial damage.</p>
<p>“The current spell of heavy rains is likely to continue intermittently until July 25,” the report said.</p>
<p>“The PDMA has already sent a letter to all district administrations to take precautionary measures in view of the weather situation, and has directed that relief activities be intensified in affected districts to provide immediate relief to all victims,” it said.</p>
<p>The authority directed that all tourists be apprised of the weather and to take precautionary measures.</p>
<p>“The public should contact the free helpline 1700 for any untoward incident, weather situation updates and information,” the report added.</p>
<p>On Monday, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925684/cm-orders-officials-to-remain-vigilant-as-more-rains-forecast">directed</a> the district administration to remain on high alert after forecasts indicated more monsoon rains in the province.</p>
<p>He instructed all relevant departments to take precautionary measures to deal with potential risks such as floods and landslides.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829">warned</a> of a heightened risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as over 200 stranded tourists were rescued from GB’s Diamer district as heavy floods battered the region.</p>

<p>He said the search operation for those who were missing is still ongoing.</p>
<p>“The Karakoram Highway has been closed again at one or two points, which has left thousands of travellers stranded at various places across the highway,” Faraq said.</p>
<p>He noted that local private hotel owners, as well as the government, have arranged for free accommodation for tourists.“</p>
<p>Work is underway to restore the Silk Road up to Bisham, Faraq said.</p>
<p>He added that GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan would visit the affected area of ​​Babusar Highway today to personally review the damage caused by flooding and see the problems faced by tourists.</p>
<p>The spokesperson also said that the chief minister will issue important orders regarding flood disasters and rehabilitation of the victims.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926044/noor-mukadam-case-convict-zahir-jaffer-files-review-plea-in-sc' target='_blank'><strong>Noor Mukadam case: Convict Zahir Jaffer files review plea in SC</strong></a>
            <p><p>Zahir Zakir Jaffer on Tuesday sought a review of the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912155">verdict</a> that upheld his death sentence for the gruesome <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636267">2021 murder</a> of Noor Mukadam in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636764">tortured</a> by him before being beheaded. Zahir’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810">death sentence</a> by the trial court had already been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1741974">upheld</a> by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).</p>
<p>The 47-page review petition, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, was filed by Advocate Khawaja Haris on behalf of Zahir under <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part7.ch2.html#:~:text=Review%20of%20Judgments%20or%20Orders%20by%20the%20Supreme%20Court" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Article 188</a> of the Constitution (review of judgments or orders by SC). The state and Noor’s father, Shaukat Ali Muqadam, were made the respondents.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The petition contended that the issue of Zahir’s alleged “unsoundness of
mind or mental capacity” that was raised before the SC in an application had not been addressed and was “given short shrift”.</p>
<p>It further said that “hype created on social media […] constantly created hatred towards the petitioner throughout the investigation and the trial (and even at appeal stage)”, which breached Zahir’s right to fair trial and due process.</p>
<p>“In [the] process of hurry, mistakes were made in the investigation and during trial,” the petition quoted a verdict from another case.</p>
<p>On the rape charges, the review plea argued that it was “apparent from the record that there is no evidence on the record in proof of this allegation”.</p>
<p>The SC had commuted Zahir’s death sentence on the rape charge to life imprisonment, as decided by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810#:~:text=sentenced%20to%2025%20years%20of%20rigorous%20imprisonment%20along%20with%20a%20fine%20of%20Rs200%2C000%20under%20Section%20376%20(punishment%20for%20rape)%20of%20the%20PPC">trial court</a>, but did not acquit him of it. While he was acquitted of the 10-year sentence for kidnapping, a one-year term was handed down for wrongful confinement under <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part3.ch1.html#:~:text=President%27s%20power%20to%20grant%20pardon%2C%20etc." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Section 342</a> of the Pakistan Penal Code, according to the SC verdict.</p>
<p>Zahir’s review plea argued that the video recordings based on which the SC upheld the death sentence had not been proved during the trial and were not provided to any of the accused.</p>
<p>It said the apex court ruling was extensively based on video recordings stored in a digital video recorder (DVR) and on clips that the prosecution said were transferred from the DVR to a hard disk, providing the “most essential link in the chain of circumstances” on which the SC gave its verdict.</p>
<p>“Portions of these so-called recordings, on the basis whereof the inference of ‘last seen’ has been drawn against the petitioner, were never played during the trial, rather, only hearsay evidence thereof was led by the prosecution,” the plea stated.</p>
<p>The SC, in its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916426">detailed verdict</a>, had stressed the significance of digital evidence by declaring that footage can be admissible as primary evidence under the “silent witness theory” — a rule of evidence that allows for photog­r­a­­phic video or other recorded evidence to be admitted as substantive proof of what it depicts, without the need for an eyewitness’s testimony.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Justice Muhammad Hashim Kakar, who led the three-member bench, observed that the silent witness theory of authentication had developed in almost all jurisdictions over the last 25 years to allow photos to substantively “speak for themselves”.</p>
<p>The SC had also noted that Zahir neglected to provide any explanation for the victim’s presence at his residence and the ensuing recovery of her body from the premises.</p>
<p>Zahir is also contemplating <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925457">filing a mercy petition</a> before President Asif Ali Zardari, with a letter by jail authorities seeking the formation of a medical board so its opinion could be included in the plea. A presidential pardon under <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part3.ch1.html#:~:text=President%27s%20power%20to%20grant%20pardon%2C%20etc." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Article 45</a> of the Constitution could provide Zahir pardon or reprieve, or remit, suspend or commute his sentence.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#sc-verdict" id="sc-verdict" title="Permalink"></a>SC verdict</h2>
<p>A three-member bench, led by Justice Kakar and including Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Ali Baqar Najafi, heard Zahir’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1747988/noor-mukadam-murder-zahir-jaffar-approaches-sc-against-ihc-verdict-upholding-death-sentence">appeal</a> against his death sentence.</p>
<p>The bench upheld Zahir’s death sentence handed by two courts previously over the murder charges under Section 302(b) (premeditated murder) of the PPC.</p>
<p>However, it converted the IHC’s decision of a second death penalty over rape charges into a life sentence. The high court had turned Zahir’s 25 years of rigorous imprisonment under Section 376 of the PPC into a death sentence.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>While the 10-year jail term for kidnapping in order to murder under Section 364 of the PPC was overturned, Zahir was handed one year of imprisonment for wrongfully confining Noor.</p>
<p>The apex court maintained the earlier orders to Zahir to pay Rs0.5 million to Noor’s legal heir.</p>
<p>The appeals of two co-accused — watchman Mohammad Iftikhar and gardener Jan Mohammad — against their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810#:~:text=Iftikhar%20and%20Mohammad%20Jan%2C%20meanwhile%2C%20were%20each%20sentenced%20to%2010%20years%20of%20rigorous%20imprisonment%20and%20a%20fine%20of%20Rs100%2C000">10-year sentences</a> were also taken up by the SC.</p>
<p>The watchman and gardener’s sentences were reduced, with the bench deciding their detention so far was sufficient and allowing them to be released.</p></p>

            <p><p>• Leaders say millions of farmers are ready to court arrest, but will not pay the tax<br />
• Sindh Chamber of Agriculture vows to move court or go for some other crops</p>
<p>HYDERABAD: Sindh Chamber of Agriculture (SCA) has announced that it will challenge the 45pc <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889589">agricultural income tax</a> in court. It described the tax as ‘unconstitutional, illegal and unethical’, and asked its members and farmers across Sindh to boycott wheat cultivation this year.</p>
<p>The decision was taken at meeting of the chamber held here on Tuesday under the chairmanship of its patron-in-chief, Dr Syed Nadeem Qamar.</p>
<p>The meeting rejected the tax and claimed that it was imposed under directives of the Inter­national Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>The farmers who attended the meeting argued that they were not receiving fair prices for their produce and, as such, there was no justification for the imposition of such a tax.</p>
<p>The meeting asked farmers across Sindh not to pay the tax, and warned that if government resorted to arrest them for on this disobedience, millions of other farmers would also court arrest. “We are ready to face imprisonment, but will not pay the agricultural income tax,” farmers’ leaders at the meeting declared.</p>
<p>The participants announced a complete boycott of agricultural income tax and asked the government for the exemptions similar to those given to industrialists.</p>
<p>The SCA told farmers to boycott wheat cultivation for the 2025-26 season on the ground that they were not getting adequate support prices.</p>
<p>The farmers vowed to go for growing alternative crops, such as mustard, nigella (kalonji), sunflower and other oilseeds instead. They said that due to very low wheat prices, they could not even recover the cost of production, and this year will be marked as a ‘boycott year’ for wheat cultivation.</p>
<p><strong>Decline in cotton production</strong></p>
<p>The chamber expressed its deep concern over 40pc decline in cotton production, estimating that the yield would not exceed four million bales. It said farmers were receiving only Rs6,500 per maund for cotton although the Sindh agriculture minister had promised Rs11,000 per ma­und which did not materialise.</p>
<p>SCA demanded withdrawal of the 18pc local <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902837">tax</a> on cotton and imposition of a 25pc tax on imported cotton to discourage imports this promoting local production. It expressed its concern over rising cost of agricultural inputs, citing a Rs22 per liter increase in diesel prices and Rs600 per bag increase in DAP fertiliser over the last 15 days.</p>
<p>It said that skyrocketing prices of essential agricultural inputs were crippling farmers, especially since they were not receiving fair prices for their produce. These developments, it warned, indicated a deliberate destruction of agricultural sector. It demanded immediate rollback of increased prices of diesel, fertilisers, seeds, pesticides and other agricultural inputs.</p>
<p>The chamber urged farmers to contact their respective mukhtiarkars (administrative officers) and related officials to get themselves registered for the Benazir Hari Card. It demanded that the subsidy of Rs10,000 per acre, currently available to sunflower and canola crops, be extended to mustard and rapeseed crops as well.</p>
<p>The meeting was attended by Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority Chairman Kabool Khatian, general secretary Zahid Bhurgari, Nabi Bux Sathio, Shahnawaz Khan Jamali, Asghar Khan Noonari, Murad Ali Khan Nizamani, Sikander Ali Sariwal, Bilal Khan Laghari, Abdul Karim Talpur and others.</p>
