                <h2>Trump threatens Canada with 35pc tariff rate starting Aug 1</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Canada will face a 35 per cent tariff on exports to the United States starting August 1, President Donald Trump said Thursday in a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney.</p>
<p>It was the latest of more than 20 such letters issued by Trump since Monday, as he continues to pursue his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922611">trade war</a> threats against dozens of economies.</p>
<p>Canada and the US have been locked in trade negotiations in hopes of reaching a deal by July 21, but the latest threat appeared to have shifted that deadline.</p>
<p>Both Canada and Mexico are trying to find ways to satisfy Trump so that the free trade deal uniting the three countries — known as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1448743">USMCA</a> — can be put back on track.</p>
<p>“Throughout the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses. We will continue to do so as we work towards the revised deadline of August 1,” Carney posted on the social media platform X Thursday night.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement replaced the previous NAFTA accord in July 2020, after Trump successfully pushed for a renegotiation during his first term in office.</p>
<p>It was due to be reviewed by July next year, but Trump has thrown the process into disarray by launching his trade wars after he took office in January.</p>
<p>Canadian and Mexican products were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896198">initially</a> hard hit by 25pc US tariffs, with a lower rate for Canadian energy.</p>
<p>Trump targeted both neighbours, saying they did not do enough on illegal immigration and the flow of illicit drugs across borders.</p>
<p>But he eventually announced exemptions for goods entering his country under the USMCA, covering large swaths of products.</p>
<p>The letter on Thursday came despite what had been warming relations between Trump and Carney, who has been faced with his counterpart’s regular musings that Canada should become the 51st US state.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#reciprocity" id="reciprocity" title="Permalink"></a>Reciprocity</h2>
<p>The Canadian leader came to the White House on May 6 and had a cordial <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908949">meeting</a> with Trump in the Oval Office.</p>
<p>They met again at the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920819/g7-agrees-to-avoid-higher-taxes-for-us-companies">G7 summit</a> last month in Canada, where leaders pushed Trump to back away from his punishing trade war.</p>
<p>Canada also agreed to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920614/trump-ends-trade-talks-with-canada-over-tax-on-us-tech-firms">rescind</a> taxes impacting US tech firms that had prompted Trump to retaliate by calling off trade talks.</p>
<p>Separately, Trump announced in an interview with <em>NBC</em> that he was also thinking of slapping blanket tariffs of between 15pc and 20pc on August 1 on countries that had not yet received one of his letters.</p>
<p>The letters announce tariff rates of as much as 50pc in the case of Brazil to kick in on August 1 unless better terms can be found before then.</p>
<p>Trump told <em>NBC</em> that the letter to the 27-country European Union, the US’s biggest trading partner, would be sent “today or tomorrow (Friday).”</p>
<p>Brazilian President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva said on Thursday that he is willing to negotiate with the United States after Trump said he would hit the country with his tough tariff.</p>
<p>He, however, reiterated that the Brazilian government is evaluating reciprocity measures. In his letter addressed to Lula, Trump criticised the treatment of his right-wing ally Jair Bolsonaro.</p></p>

                <h2>Armed men kidnap and kill nine passengers in Balochistan</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>QUETTA: At least nine passengers travelling on two Punjab-bound coaches were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923342/passengers-kidnapped-in-sardhaka-rescue-operation-underway-balochistan-govt">abducted</a> and killed by unidentified armed men in Sur-Dakai area, on the border between Balochistan’s Zhob and Loralai districts, on Thursday night.</p>
<p>“Nine people abducted from both coaches have been killed, and their bodies have been recovered,” said Zhob Assistant Comm­issioner Naveed Alam, adding that the bodies were being transported to Rak­hni for dispatch to their native towns in Punjab.</p>
<p>Shahid Rind, the Balo­chistan government’s spo­kes­­person, confirmed the incident and said that Fitna al Hindustan — a term used for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan — had carried out attacks at three different places — Kakat, Mastung and Sur-Dakai.</p>
<p>“There are reports about the kidnapping of some passengers from Sur-Dakai area,” he said, adding that security forces had launched a search operation to safely recover any remaining kidnapped passengers.</p>
<p>According to sources, two passenger coaches en route to Punjab were intercepted in the Sur-Dakai area near the N-70 highway, close to Dab — a place along the Loralai-Zhob border. A group of armed men had blocked the road and stopped the two vehicles.</p>
<p>The armed assailants boarded the coaches, checked the identity cards of passengers and forced 10 persons off the vehicles at gunpoint.</p>
<p>“They dragged out 10 passengers — seven from one coach and three from the other — and took them away (to an unknown place),” a surviving passenger told Levies. “I don’t know what they did to them, but I heard gunfire as we were leaving.”</p>
<p>After abducting the nine passengers, the assailants allowed both coaches to leave the area.</p>
<p>Security forces suspended traffic on the highway and began a large-scale search operation to locate the perpetrators.</p>
<p>According to sources, the attackers checked the CNICs of all passengers and specifically targeted individuals with Punjab addresses. They also opened fire on the coaches during the abduction to prevent any escape.</p>
<p>“There are reports about the killing of nine passengers who were kidnapped by the armed men,” a senior police official told <em>Dawn</em>.</p>
<p>The Balochistan Liberation Front, a banned outfit, later claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group said they had killed the nine individuals after blocking the highway between Musakhail-Makhtar and Khajuri.</p>
