                <h2>Interior minister rebuts rumours about President Zardari ‘resigning’ from office</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Thursday rebutted rumours of President Asif Ali Zardari being asked to resign, terming it a “malicious campaign”.</p>
<p>“We are fully aware of who is behind the malicious campaign targeting President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and the chief of army staff,” Naqvi <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MohsinnaqviC42/status/1943211206371602592" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X.</p>
<p>“I have categorically stated that there has been no discussion, nor does any such idea exist about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency,” he asserted.</p>

<p>“The president of Pakistan enjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces,” the minister said.</p>
<p>He quoted President Zardari as having “clearly” stated: “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”</p>
<p>Naqvi stressed that the “sole focus” of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was Pakistan’s strength and stability, and “nothing else”.</p>
<p>“To those involved in this narrative, do whatever you wish in collaboration with hostile foreign agencies. As for us, we will do whatever is necessary to make Pakistan strong again, InshAllah,” Naqvi added.</p>
<p>Speaking on <em>Geo News’</em> programme “Geo Pakistan” today, PML-N Senator Irfanullah Siddiqui also denied reports of Zardari’s resignation.</p>
<p>“Reports that Zardari is resigning, Imran’s sons are coming, Nawaz Sharif is going to Adiala … these are not news. They are bogus, table stories.”</p>
<p>Siddiqui said, “Zardari has not created any difficulties for the government, and understands his constitutional responsibilities as head of state”.</p>
<p>He said the PML-N had “no trouble” working with the president and there was no credible reason to remove him from office.</p>
<p>“We have a coalition with the PPP. Why would we bring down this system?” he questioned.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, social media campaigns against the army have escalated, reflecting broader tensions within the country’s political and social fabric.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856908">government</a>, as well as the military, have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1876905">repeatedly</a> warned about “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=fake%20news%20and%20propaganda%20have%20become%20so%20common%20and%20there%20is%20no%20accountability%20for%20it.%E2%80%9D">fake news and propaganda</a>” proliferating on social media, with military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=theories%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20added.-,%E2%80%98Digital%20terrorism%E2%80%99,-Questioned%20about%20criticism">digital terrorism</a>” under the laws.</p>
<p>In May, President Zardari and PM Shehbaz formally decorated Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Syed Asim Munir with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912748/president-pm-decorate-coas-munir-with-rank-of-field-marshal">rank of field marshal</a> for his “sagacious leadership and exceptional strategy” during the recent conflict with India.</p>
<p>In a subsequent dinner hosted by the army chief, Field Marshal Munir lauded the political leadership for their “strategic foresight” during <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> against India.</p>

<p>The next month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who belongs to PM Shehbaz’s PML-N, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918558/whats-behind-khawaja-asifs-praise-for-hybrid-system">hailed</a> the “existing hybrid model of governance” in the country. In a separate interview, he also termed it as a “practical necessity” for Pakistan, saying the system was “doing wonders”.</p>
<p>In May 2024, the army chief and President Zardari had expressed their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1825461">concern</a> over “baseless and unsubstantiated allegations levelled by a specific political party and its few individuals” against the army for their political interests.</p></p>

                <h2>Pakistan eyes $1 billion valuation in Roosevelt Hotel redevelopment plan, source says</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan is seeking a valuation of at least $1 billion for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894237">Roosevelt Hotel</a> it owns in New York and is ready to part with a minority stake in the prime Manhattan property as it scouts for a redevelopment partner, a senior government official said.</p>
<p>Named after former US President Theodore Roosevelt, the century-old property in midtown Manhattan is seen as one of Pakistan’s most valuable foreign assets, which it acquired in 2000. Faced with mounting losses, the over 1,000-room hotel was shut in 2020, and has also operated briefly as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1778831/roosevelt-once-a-swanky-manhattan-hotel-now-a-refugee-shelter">migrant shelter</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the government’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860850">$7bn IMF-backed</a> privatisation push, Pakistan’s government approved a “transaction structure for the Roosevelt Hotel” on Tuesday, saying it won’t do an outright sale but has decided to adopt a joint venture model to maximise long-term value. It gave no further details.</p>
<p>The senior Pakistani official said the government will retain ownership in the project through an equity partnership, but declined to disclose the size of the stake being offered to any potential JV partner.</p>
<p>The official declined to be named since the process is confidential. JLL, or Jones Lang LaSalle, will run the process and the government is eyeing a valuation of over $1bn for the 42,000 square feet property it hopes could be redeveloped for residential-cum-office use, the official said.</p>
<p>“It is among the best pieces of land in NY real estate … The process begins immediately and is expected to be completed in the next six-nine months,” said the official.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s Privatisation Ministry and state-owned Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), which owns the hotel through its investment arm, did not respond to request for comments, and neither did JLL.</p>
<p>Pakistan this week also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922858/govt-approves-four-potential-bidders-for-struggling-pia">approved</a> four parties to bid for a stake in debt-ridden PIA.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The hotel is located near marquee New York destinations such as Grand Central Terminal, Times Square, and Fifth Avenue, placing it in one of Manhattan’s most valuable commercial zones.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s government is estimating the redevelopment will take 4–5 years, the official said, adding the “interest level is extremely high”.</p>
<p>In June, the government said it expects $100 million in the initial payment from the joint-venture partnership by June 2026.</p></p>
