                <h2>Bodies of slain passengers in Balochistan bus killing sent to Punjab hometowns: official</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The bodies of nine bus passengers who were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923411/armed-men-kidnap-and-kill-nine-passengers-in-balochistan">kidnapped and killed</a> in Balochistan‚Äôs Sardhaka area last night were recovered and transported to their hometowns in Punjab on Friday morning, officials said.</p>
<p>On Thursday night, at least nine passengers travelling on two Punjab-bound coaches were abducted and killed by unidentified armed men in the Sur-Dakai area, situated on the border between Balochistan‚Äôs Zhob and Loralai districts, Assistant Comm¬≠issioner Naveed Alam said a day ago.</p>
<p>Provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind also confirmed the incident and said that <em>Fitna-al-Hindu¬≠stan</em>  ‚Äî a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">term</a> the government uses for terrorist organisations in Balo¬≠chistan ‚Äî had carried out attacks at three different places ‚Äî Kakat, Mastung, and Sur-Dakai.</p>
<p>The Balochistan Liberation Front, a banned outfit, later claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group said it had killed the nine individuals after blocking the highway between Musakhail-Makhtar and Khajuri.</p>
<p>Alam told <em>Dawn.com</em> on Friday that the bodies of all nine passengers were handed over to a political agent in the Sakhi Sarwar district of Dera Ghazi Khan to be handed over to their families.</p>
<p>He said that seven of the passengers had been identified but two could not be identified due to a lack of documents.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe terrorists must have taken the passengers‚Äô identification documents with them,‚Äù AC Alam said.</p>
<p>Of the seven passengers identified, two were residents of Lodhran, while one passenger each were residents of Dera Ghazi Khan, Gujrat, Attock, Khanewal and Gujranwala.</p>

<p>The country‚Äôs top leaders strongly condemned the incident and vowed action against the perpetrators ‚Äúat all costs‚Äù.</p>
<p>In a statement today, President Asif Ali Zardari said: ‚ÄúThis barbarity is part of <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>‚Äôs evil conspiracy to spill blood in Pakistan,‚Äù state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed commitment to ‚Äúclear the land of <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> and its facilitators at all costs‚Äù.</p>
<p>Similarly, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in a statement issued by his office: ‚ÄúWe will deal with terrorists with full force. The blood of innocent people will be avenged.‚Äù</p>
<p>The premier added that the killing of unarmed civilians was a blatant act of terrorism by <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith resolve, unity, and strength, we will confront the scourge of terrorism and uproot it completely,‚Äù the prime minister said.</p>
<p>Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also strongly condemned the incident, calling it ‚Äúblatant terrorism‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe killing of innocent civilians based on Pakistani identity is an unforgivable crime,‚Äù Bugti said, vowing that the response would be ‚Äúsevere‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe terrorists have proven that they are not human beings, but cowardly beasts,‚Äù he said, adding that the state ‚Äúwould not even let these murderers hide underground.‚Äù</p>
<p>The chief minister added: ‚ÄúAll networks of terrorists who are the sponsors of <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> will be destroyed.‚Äù</p>
<p>Noting that this was a ‚Äústate war‚Äù, he vowed decisive action.</p>
<p>CM Bugti further vowed to crush ‚Äúevery plan of terrorism‚Äù with strength, determination and unity. ‚ÄúBalochistan will become a graveyard for enemies.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MOIofficialGoP/status/1943412958844829757" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on X late last night, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident, saying: ‚ÄúWe will chase and eliminate Indian-sponsored terrorists who target innocent passengers.‚Äù</p>

<p>According to sources, two passenger coaches en route to Punjab were intercepted in the Sur-Dakai area near the N-70 highway, close to Dab ‚Äî a place along the Loralai-Zhob border. A group of armed men had blocked the road and stopped the two vehicles.</p>
<p>The armed assailants boarded the coaches, checked the identity cards of passengers and forced 10 persons off the vehicles at gunpoint.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey dragged out 10 passengers ‚Äî seven from one coach and three from the other ‚Äî and took them away (to an unknown place),‚Äù a surviving passenger told Levies. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what they did to them, but I heard gunfire as we were leaving.‚Äù</p>
<p>After abducting the nine passengers, the assailants allowed both coaches to leave the area.</p>
<p>Security forces suspended traffic on the highway and began a large-scale search operation to locate the perpetrators.</p>
<p>According to sources, the attackers checked the national identity cards of all passengers and specifically targeted individuals with Punjab addresses. They also opened fire on the coaches during the abduction to prevent any escape.</p>

<p>In May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna-al-Hindu¬≠stan</em>.</p>
<p>Balochistan has witnessed a spate of attacks targeting those hailing from Punjab. In two separate incidents in April 2024, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1827193">nine people</a> were killed after being forced off a bus near Noshki, while <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1830243">two labourers</a> from Punjab were shot in Kech.</p>
<p>In February, seven Punjab-bound passengers were offloaded from a bus and shot dead in Barkhan district. The incident came days after 12 were killed in a blast targeting a bus carrying coal miners in Harnai.</p>
<p>In May last year, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832433">seven barbers</a> from Punjab were shot dead near Gwadar, while August saw <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854830">23 travellers</a> offloaded from trucks and buses and shot in the Musakhail district.</p></p>

            </a>
            <p><p>At least five people died and four others were injured when a pickup vehicle plunged into a deep gorge in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Kurram district on Friday morning, police said.</p>
<p>Kurram Deputy Commissioner Ashfaq Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>: ‚ÄúThe accident occurred in the Para Chamkani Gondal, where five people died and four others sustained injuries.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said the vehicle was on its way to Sadda Bazaar Lower Kurram from Spin Ghar Manro when the incident occurred.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe vehicle lost control on a narrow and dangerous bend and fell off the road, as a result of which five people died on the spot while four were seriously injured,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>The deceased were identified as Gul Wali, son of Abdul Hanan (driver); Naimatullah, son of Gul Khan; Naseeb, son of Hamad Jan, residents of Manro; Dolly Khan, son of Islam; and Riazuddin, son of Zahiruddin, residents of Kimal Baza Zangi.</p>
<p>According to the deputy commissioner, locals voluntarily started relief operations to rescue the injured and recover the bodies soon after the incident.</p>
<p>The injured were immediately taken to the Sadda Hospital with the help of locals, where the condition of some of the injured is said to be critical, he said.</p>
<p>Fatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain and poor infrastructure.</p>
<p>A day earlier, at least five people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1923273">killed</a> in a collision between a car and a truck on Chashma Road in Dera Ismail Khan district, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>Eight members of a family <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907788">died</a> on May 1 when a Rawalpindi-bound car plunged into a deep ravine in the Matta Banda area of Lower Kohistan district, police said.</p>
<p>At least 10 people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904404">died</a> and nine others were injured on April 15 when a speeding trailer ran over a Peshawar-bound van on the Indus highway in KP‚Äôs Karak district.</p>
<p>Five people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902737">killed</a> when a three-wheeler fell into a canal in the Gohati area of KP‚Äôs Swabi on April 7.</p></p>
