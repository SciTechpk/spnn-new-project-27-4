                <h2>PSX reaches new intraday peak of 138,000 points</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday continued its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924716/psx-rebounds-on-hopes-of-ratings-upgrade">renewed</a> bullish momentum as it crossed the 138,000 points during intraday trade.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,785.25 points, or 1.31 per cent, to stand at 138,165.21 points at 11:57am, from the previous close of 136,379.96 points.</p>
<p>The PSX had staged a modest recovery yesterday as investors resumed buying, encouraged by the formation of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924499">high-level committee</a> to address the business community‚Äôs concerns over the recently introduced taxation measures.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The development has helped the KSE-100 index gain momentum despite the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924723/businesses-gear-up-for-nationwide-strike">July 19 strike call</a> by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry to protest against the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917240">powers</a> to arrest and prosecute businessmen introduced in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292">federal budget</a>.</p>
<p>Investor confidence was also reinforced by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb‚Äôs recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924444">briefing to Moody‚Äôs</a> on Pakistan‚Äôs improved macroeconomic outlook and financial stability, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924716/psx-rebounds-on-hopes-of-ratings-upgrade#:~:text=bolstered%20optimism%20for%20a%20potential%20ratings%20upgrade%20in%20Moody%E2%80%99s%20upcoming%20review.">bolstering optimism</a> for a potential ratings upgrade in the credit rating agency‚Äôs upcoming review.</p>
