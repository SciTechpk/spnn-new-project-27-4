            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909677/psx-limps-to-recovery-after-day-of-historic-losses' target='_blank'><strong>PSX limps to recovery after day of historic losses</strong></a>
            <p><p>Shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) recovered more than 700 points on Friday after the index suffered its largest-ever <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909591/psx-takes-record-plunge-amid-security-unrest">plunge</a> a day earlier, causing losses to the tune of Rs820 billion loss to equity investors following Indian <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909566/indian-kamikaze-drones-intercepted">drone attacks</a> in major cities across the country.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index climbed 799.65, or 0.77 per cent, to stand at 104,326.46 from the previous close of 103,526.81 at 11:06am.</p>
<p>Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, said that after falling sharply by 6pc yesterday, the stocks have recovered and were “up 2pc in the first 30 minutes of trading” today.</p>
<p>“So far, there has been no news of any major escalation which helped restore confidence,” he said.</p>
<p>Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, noted, “Stocks on the PSX remained volatile today, opening higher as participants increasingly factored in that an all-out war with India is unlikely.</p>
<p>“Some investors have begun accumulating stocks trading at highly attractive valuations following the sharp drawdown over the past week,” he added.</p>
<p>“Technical analysts also noted this morning that the market had entered oversold territory,” Farooq said.</p>
<p>On yesterday’s decline, he stated it was primarily “driven by individuals unwinding leveraged positions and redemptions from mutual funds”.</p>
<p>“Such corrections and short-term volatility are a normal feature of equity markets,” he said, adding that they continued to “advise that only long-term investors participate in the market, maintaining discipline during periods of uncertainty and gradually building their portfolios over time”.</p>
<p>“Market attention now remains on developments in Pakistan-India tensions and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909585/imf-board-meets-today">IMF board meeting scheduled for today</a>, where Pakistan’s next tranche will be considered,” he said.</p>
<p>Sana Tawfik, head of research at Arif Habib Limited, noted that the primary reason behind the recovery was investor optimism regarding the International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting today.</p>
<p>“Most likely, the Executive Board will approve the tranche today,” she said.</p>
<p>The Fund is set to meet today to approve the immediate disbursement of about $1bn to Pakistan under the ongoing Extended Fund Faci­li­ty and allow an additional arrangement for the $1.3bn Resilience and Sus­tainability Facility (RSF).</p>
<p>Furthermore, she highlighted that the market now provided “attractive valuations” due to yesterday’s market dip.</p>
<p>“Lastly, fears of a major escalation have been placated due to no major development on that front,” she added.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said that the “panic triggered by yesterday’s drone attacks from the Indian side is subsiding, as the Pakistan Armed Forces demonstrated ability to intercept the threats has reassured investors”.</p>
<p>“The recent market correction following the onset of the escalation has presented investors with a valuable opportunity to build their portfolios at more attractive valuations,” he added.</p>
<p>The market capital had lost Rs1.3 trillion in value in the previous three sessions as jittery investors preferred to exit the market amid growing uncertainty about the economic outlook as geopolitical tensions turned into a military standoff after India hit three cities with missiles in the wee hours of Wednesday, martyring over 31 innocent civilians. Pakistan’s armed forces responded with the downing of five Indian fighter planes.</p>
<p>The market crash followed alarming geopolitical developments after ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390/25-israeli-made-drones-used-by-india-in-attempt-to-attack-pakistan-all-shot-down-ispr">announced</a> that Pakistani forces had neutralised 25 drones sent by India since last night. He also confirmed that four army personnel were injured after one drone managed to partially strike a military target, despite the majority being intercepted.</p>

            <p><p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">dogfight</a> between Chinese-made Pakistani jets and French-made Indian Rafale fighters will be closely scrutinised by militaries seeking insights that could offer an edge in future conflicts.</p>
<p>A Chinese-made Pakistani fighter plane shot down at least two Indian military aircraft on Wednesday, two US officials told <em>Reuters</em>, marking a potential major milestone for Beijing’s advanced fighter jet.</p>
<p>The aerial clash is a rare opportunity for militaries to study the performance of pilots, fighter jets and air-to-air missiles in active combat, and use that knowledge to prepare their own air forces for battle.</p>
<p>Experts said the live use of advanced weapons would be analysed across the world, including in China and the United States which are both preparing for a potential conflict over Taiwan or in the wider Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>One US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told <em>Reuters</em> there was high confidence that Pakistan had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to launch air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets.</p>
<p>Social media posts focused on the performance of China’s PL-15 air-to-air missile against the Meteor, a radar-guided air-to-air missile produced by European group MBDA. There has been no official confirmation these weapons were used.</p>
<p>“Air warfare communities in China, the US, and a number of European countries will be extremely interested to try and get as much ground truth as they can on tactics, techniques, procedures, what kit was used, what worked and what didn’t,” said Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.</p>
<p>“You have arguably China’s most capable weapon against the West’s most capable weapon, if indeed it was being carried; we don’t know that,” Barrie said. The French and Americans would likely be hoping for similar intelligence from India, Barrie said.</p>
<p>“The PL-15 is a big problem. It is something that the US military pays a lot of attention to,” a defense industry executive said.</p>
<p>Rafale manufacturer Dassault Aviation declined comment and the MBDA consortium could not immediately be reached for comment on a French public holiday.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#scant-details" id="scant-details" title="Permalink"></a>Scant details</h2>
<p>Western analysts and industry sources said crucial details remained unclear including whether the Meteor was carried and the type and amount of training the pilots had received. Arms firms would also be anxious to separate technical performance from operational factors, analysts said.</p>
<p>“There will be audits of what works and what doesn’t work, but I think the other overlay is the proverbial fog of war,” said Byron Callan, a Washington-based defense expert and managing partner of Capital Alpha Partners.</p>
<p>US arms companies are getting constant feedback about how their products are working in the war in Ukraine, he said.</p>
<p>“So I absolutely expect the same to be the case with India’s European suppliers, and Pakistan and China are probably sharing the same feedback. If the PL-15 is working as advertised or better than expected, the Chinese would like to hear that.”</p>
<p>A defense industry source from a Western country operating the Meteor said an online picture of a seeker appeared to feature the component of a missile that had missed its target.</p>
<p>There are conflicting reports on whether Pakistan has the domestic version of the PL-15 from the PLAAF, China’s air force, or the lower-range export version publicly unveiled in 2021.</p>
<p>Barrie, who has written extensively on the missile, said he believed that Pakistan most likely has the export version.</p>
<p>A Western industry source dismissed claims that the rocket-powered PL-15 had longer range than the air-breathing Meteor but acknowledged that its capability “may be greater than was thought.” The Meteor’s range has not been officially published. “At the moment it’s not possible to judge anything. We know so little,” the industry source said.</p>
<p>The PL-15’s range and performance have been a focus of Western interest for years. Its emergence was seen as one of many signals that China had moved well beyond reliance on Soviet-era derivative technology.</p>
<p>The United States is developing the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile via Lockheed Martin partly in response to the PL-15 and its beyond-visual-range performance — part of a broader reset of Western priorities toward China.</p>
<p>European nations are exploring a mid-life upgrade for Meteor, which specialist publication Janes says could involve propulsion and guidance, but analysts say progress has been slow.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump in March awarded Boeing the contract to build the US Air Force’s most sophisticated fighter jet yet, which would likely include stealth, advanced sensors and cutting-edge engines.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has decided to suspend the remainder of the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 “with immediate effect for one week”, according to a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>An IPL match on Thursday was <a class="link--external" href="http://dawn.com/news/1909542/ipl-match-in-dharamsala-called-off-midway" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">abandoned</a> midway after fighting began in India’s border regions, but the cricket board attributed the disruption to a power failure at the stadium in the hill city of Dharamsala.</p>
<p>“Further updates regarding the new schedule and venues of the tournament will be announced in due course after a comprehensive assessment of the situation in consultation with relevant authorities and stakeholders,” said the statement from BCCI Honorary Secretary Devajit Saikia, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>“The decision was taken by the IPL Governing Council after due consultation with all key stakeholders following the representations from most of the franchisees, who conveyed the concern and sentiments of their players, and also the views of the broadcaster, sponsors and fans; while the BCCI reposes full faith in the strength and preparedness of our armed forces, the Board considered it prudent to act in the collective interest of all stakeholders.</p>
<p>“At this critical juncture, the BCCI stands firmly with the nation. We express our solidarity with the Government of India, the Armed Forces and the people of our country,” the statement said.</p>
<p>“While cricket remains a national passion, there is nothing greater than the nation and its sovereignty, integrity, and security of our country. The BCCI remains firmly committed to support all efforts that safeguard India and will always align its decisions in the best interest of the nation,” the statement added.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the Press Trust  of India <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ptinews.com/stories-detail/sports/IPL-suspended-indefinitely-amid-escalating-tensions-between-India-and-Pakistan/2540747/0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that “a cloud of uncertainty had loomed over the future of the ongoing edition since the cancellation of Thursday’s match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals in Dharamsala midway following air raid alerts in neighbouring cities of Jammu and Pathankot.”</p>
<p>“It does not look nice that cricket goes on while the country is at war,” a BCCI official told <em>PTI</em>, confirming the suspension of the league, which was to wind up on May 25 in Kolkata.</p>

<p>The world’s richest cricket tournament began its current season on March 22, and the final fixture was scheduled to be played on May 25, with matches being spread over 13 venues across the country.</p>
<p>According to <a class="link--external" href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ipl-2025-suspended-over-india-pakistan-border-tensions-1485448" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ESPN Cricinfo</a>, IPL 2025 was 58 games old, including the abandonment in Dharamsala. There were 12 games left to play in the group stage, scheduled for Lucknow (2), Hyderabad, Ahmedabad (3), Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru (2), Mumbai, Jaipur, followed by the playoffs, to be played in Hyderabad and Kolkata.</p>
<p>Pakistan and India have been locked in conflict since Wednesday, when India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390/25-israeli-made-drones-used-by-india-in-attempt-to-attack-pakistan-all-shot-down-ispr">targeted</a> multiple locations in Pakistan, claiming they were “terrorist infrastructure” in response to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917">deadly attack in occupied Kashmir</a> last month.</p>
<p>New Delhi named two Pakistani nationals as suspects and accused Islamabad of being involved in the attack, a charge Pakistan denied. Subsequently, Islamabad sought an independent probe.</p></p>
