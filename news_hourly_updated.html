                <h2>2 dead, 11 injured as blast rips through market in Balochistan‚Äôs Qila Abdullah: officials</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Two people were killed and at least 11 were injured after an explosion ripped through a market in Balochistan‚Äôs Qila Abdullah district on Sunday evening, officials said.</p>
<p>Deputy Commissioner Qila Abdullah Riyaz Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>, ‚ÄúTwo people were killed while 11 were injured in the explosion.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the initial investigation, the explosives were planted in a vehicle, DC Khan said, adding that the bomb disposal squad and law enforcement officials were summoned and an investigation was launched.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAn emergency was declared at the District Health Headquarters in Qila Abdullah, where medical assistance was being provided to the injured,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>In a separate statement given to <em>Dawn.com</em>, Qila Abdullah Levies Risaldar Gulab Khan said, ‚ÄúThe blast took place near the Abdul Jabbar Market in the Gulistan area of Qila Abdullah district, resulting in the death of two people and injuries to 11 others.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter the explosion, Levies personnel and people present at the scene immediately rescued the injured, who were then moved to the District Health Headquarters Chaman for treatment.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the official, officers began an investigation after collecting evidence from the scene.</p>
<p>Condemning the blast, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said he shared the grief of the families of the deceased.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe war against terrorism is undoubtedly a war of national security,‚Äù CM Bugti said in a statement, adding war against terrorism will continue until the last terrorist is eliminated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe elements involved in the Gulistan blast will be brought to an end soon,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind said security forces were present at the spot, the area was being cordoned off, and evidence was being collected.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe state is taking steps to protect the people by utilising all resources,‚Äù Rind said.</p>
<p>The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897969">Balochistan Liberation Army</a>, in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.</p>
<p>In March, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419/jaffar-express-hijacking-state-media-reports-190-rescued-2nd-day-of-operation-underway-in-balochistan">Jaffar Express train</a> was hijacked near Balochistan‚Äôs Sibi area, resulting in the deaths of 26 hostages, including 18 security personnel. Five more security personnel were martyred during the operation.</p></p>

            <p><p>A child lost his life, while 11 others were injured in different areas of Khyber Pakhtunkwa after trees and signboards fell due to strong winds and storms, officials said.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmad Faizi said, ‚ÄúA storm hit several KP areas, including Charsadda, Nowshera, Peshawar and Mardan on Sunday evening.‚Äù</p>
<p>The storm also hit parts of the capital Islamabad.</p>
<p>Faizi said a 10-year-old boy, Mohammad Hamad, died when a wall of a house collapsed in the Najib Abad area of Charsadda, adding that the injured were moved to the respective areas‚Äô hospitals.</p>
<p>Due to the storm, the electricity supply was suspended in many areas of the city, due to which citizens had to face severe difficulties, he said.</p>
<p>He said that the Disaster Response Team of Rescue 1122 was immediately dispatched to the affected areas and work was underway to remove fallen trees from the roads.</p>
<p>At least three people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904713">killed</a> in Rawalpindi and Gujar Khan last month after an intense hailstorm, accompanied by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904758">heavy rain</a> and gusty winds, battered the region.</p>
<p>Heavy hailstorms <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904643">struck</a> Islamabad and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, causing widespread damage to vehicles, windscreens, and solar panels, while also triggering flash floods following intense rainfall.</p></p>
