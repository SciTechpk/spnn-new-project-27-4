<p>• CM Gulbar says region lacks funds to tackle flood damage<br />
• Seven districts affected; Diamer worst hit by daily flash floods<br />
• Villagers flee Rajanpur, Bhakkar, Layyah, Muzaffargarh as low-lying districts in Punjab submerged</p>
<p>GILGIT / LAHORE / DERA GHAZI KHAN: Gilgit-Balti­stan Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan on Saturday appe­aled to the federal government for Rs7 billion in emergency funds to deal with climate-induced <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926487/at-least-9-dead-as-floods-landslides-continue-to-ravage-gb-officials">disasters</a> that have caused damages exceeding Rs20bn across the region.</p>
<p>Speaking at a press conference at the CM House in Gilgit, the chief minister said the GB government lacks the financial capacity to handle the unprecedented disasters.</p>
<p>CM Khan was accompanied by GB Home Minister Shams Lone, GB Assembly member Jamil Ahmed, Special Assi­stant on Infor­mation Eman Shah and Special Assistant on GB Disaster Management Auth­ority Muhammad Ali Quaid.</p>
<p>He said unprecedented floods had impacted seven districts, with Diamer being the worst affected. “People in GB are facing daily flood events. At least one flood occurs every day,” he said.</p>
<p>He said that so far, 10 fatalities and four injuries have been reported. Seven deaths were reported from Babusar, two from Thore Valley (Dia­mer) and another from Astore district.</p>
<p>The chief minister said that 300 homes were destroyed, 200 were partially damaged, 40 water channels in 30 villages were swept away and 15 kilometres of roads, bridges, agricultural land, crops and public and private infrastructure were severely damaged.</p>
<p>He noted that only Rs1bn was allocated in the GB budget for emergencies and that the local government is also burdened with Rs3bn in liabilities from past disaster rehabilitation efforts.</p>
<p>“I appeal to the prime minister of Pakistan to immediately release at least Rs7bn to restore roads, electricity, water channels and to undertake other essential relief efforts,” the chief minister said and requested the premier to visit the region.</p>
<p>He recalled that the federal government provided Rs3bn during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921651">2022 floods</a>, but criticised the previous GB administration for misusing the funds, with the exception of a model village established for flood victims in Ghizer’s Bubor area.</p>
<p>“This year’s disasters are beyond our resources. I urge the federal government to help the people of GB,” he added, while also appealing to non-governmental and international organisations for support. A formal request has been sent to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Karakoram Highway, which was blocked at Chilas on Saturday, was reopened for traffic on Sunday. However, flash flood events continued to be reported across GB.</p>
<p>In Fairy Meadows near Nanga Parbat, a flash flood swept away over 200 goats, sheep and surrounding greenery. Rescue 1122 reported multiple flash floods in the Shigar district on Saturday, affecting crops and infrastructure in Qaimabad Tisar, Chatron and Garam Chashma.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Residents said flash floods disrupted road access, mobile networks and electricity. In Kondus village of Ghanche district, a devastating landslide destroyed over 50 homes. Survivors are in dire need of shelter, food, medical care and internet access.</p>
<p>Flood-affected communities in Diamer and elsewhere are facing severe shortages of clean drinking water and essential supplies.</p>
<p><strong>Punjab grapples with flooding</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, thousands of residents across several districts in Punjab were displaced on Saturday as widespread flooding inundated low-lying areas. In some regions, such as Rojhan tehsil of Rajanpur, residents resorted to hiring private boats after failing to receive government assistance.</p>
<p>Several villagers in Bhakkar, Layyah, Multan and Muzaffargarh also had to leave due to a medium-level flood. All their crops were damaged due to the flood, and their houses were also surrounded by water.</p>
<p>The hundreds of people living in the catchment areas of the rivers Sindh and Chenab also had to migrate on their own, along with their cattle, struggling to find fodder and shelter. They protested the government’s lack of relief efforts.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In Layyah, the third flood wave in the Indus River raised water levels to 450,000 cusecs. A protective embankment near the under-construction Taunsa Bridge collapsed, submerging adjacent villages and farmlands. Rescue machinery, including a multimillion-rupee excavator, was at risk of being lost.</p>
<p>Dera Ghazi Khan Commissioner Chaudhry Ashfaq told <em>Dawn</em> that the situation was under control and that the excavator would be recovered once the water receded. Relief camps have been set up in Karor tehsil of Layyah at several locations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dera Ghazi Khan Deputy Com­missioner Usman Khalid said water levels were expected to remain stable by evening and noted that seven relief camps had been established in Taunsa. He confirmed that no mass evacuations had occurred yet.</p>
<p>Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb visited flood-hit areas in Pindi Bhattian and Hafizabad, where dozens of villages were submerged due to heavy rains. She met with residents, announced one-month rations for affected families and inspected medical and livestock camps.</p>
<p>She said a survey had been conducted to assess flood damage and pledged to provide financial assistance in a transparent manner. Emergency measures have been implemented in affected areas, with residents advised to relocate from dilapidated structures.</p>
<p>Earlier, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Punjab issued flood warnings for the Chenab and Jhelum rivers and their tributaries, anticipating rising water levels from July 28 to 31.</p>
<p>Punjab’s Relief Com­missioner Nabil Javed directed local officials and departments, including agriculture, irrigation, health, livestock and transport, to remain on high alert and ensure that emergency arrangements, including food, shelter and clean water, were in place.</p>
<p>PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia urged the public to follow safety advisories and cooperate with authorities during emergency evacuations. He assured that the government would provide full support to both people and their livestock.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926836/five-militants-killed-in-kp-operations' target='_blank'><strong>Five militants killed in KP operations</strong></a>
            <p><p>SWAT/KO­HAT/LAKKI MAR­WAT: Three key militants were killed on Friday evening during an intelligence-based joint operation by Swat police and the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), while one militant each was killed in separate encounters in Kohat and Karak, officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>According to Swat police, the operation was launched following credible intelligence regarding the presence of high-profile militants in the area. When law enforcement personnel moved in, the suspects opened fire, prompting a retaliatory response. All three militants were killed in the ensuing exchange.</p>
<p>Among the deceased was Ajmal alias Waqas, a resident of Malook Abad, wanted in at least nine terrorism-related cases. The second was identified as Matiullah alias Ishaq and Junaid, son of Ibrat Shah from Dabb Sar Martung in Shangla district, wanted in two cases.</p>
<p>The third, Rahimullah Rehmani alias Rohullah, son of Amanullah and a resident of Sheray, Nuristan, in Afghanistan, was also wanted in two separate terrorism cases.</p>
<p>Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Umar Khan told reporters that search and strike operations would continue across the district.</p>
<p>He added that security had been intensified at all entry and exit points to prevent the infiltration of miscreants. “We will not allow the peace and stability of Swat to be disturbed at any cost,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Militant killed by own accomplices</strong></p>
<p>In a separate incident in Kohat district, an alleged militant involved in an earlier attack on the Hangu DPO was killed on Friday night, reportedly by fire from his own group during a police operation.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The militant, identified as Shahzeb, had previously escaped after being injured during an attack on the Hangu DPO’s convoy last Saturday. DPO Khalid Khan and SHO Nabi Khan were injured in the attack. Shahzeb was later arrested near Naryab Dam within the Doaba police jurisdiction.</p>
<p>During interrogation, he revealed the presence of militant commander Umer alias Abu Bakr in the area. Acting on this intelligence, police from Doaba and Thall tehsils launched an operation towards Tora Warai, where they were again ambushed.</p>
<p>SHO Doaba Imranud Din, who was transferred from Kohat a few days ago, and his team engaged the militants in a two-hour gun battle. During the exchange, Shahzeb was fatally struck by a bullet allegedly fired by his accomplices.</p>
<p><strong>Karak operation</strong></p>
<p>In Karak, an alleged militant was killed during an exchange of fire with police in the Shah Slaim area on Saturday.</p>
<p>A police official said a team assisted by CTD commandos was dispatched after intelligence reports indicated that a group of militants was heading towards the Abbas Khattak area in Lakki Marwat district.</p>
<p>During a search operation in Shah Slaim, security forces encountered the group, resulting in a fierce gun battle.</p>
<p>“The gunfight continued for some time before the terrorists fled into difficult mountainous terrain,” he claimed.</p>
<p>During the subsequent search, police recovered the body of a militant identified as Fidaullah, a resident of Nagri.</p>
<p>“The cops also seized an assault rifle, two hand grenades, magazines and ammunition from the place and shifted the terrorist’s body to a nearby hospital,” the police official added.</p>
<p>The official said that the killed militant was involved in various sabotage activities, including the Friday’s militant attack in the Koh-i-Maidan area in which a police constable Saeed Nawaz was martyred.</p>
<p>He said that police also destroyed the hideouts of militants in a separate action.</p>
<p>“The police, with the help of CTD personnel, launched a search and strike operation against the gang of terrorists led by Sanaullah Jalali and Attaullah,” he maintained, claiming that the group has been involved in launching attacks on law enforcement personnel in the Karak district.</p>
<p>He said that, along with destroying safe havens in the mountains, the law enforcers also cut off the supply line of the militants.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926834/imran-approaches-sc-to-challenge-bail-denial-in-may-9-cases' target='_blank'><strong>Imran approaches SC to challenge bail denial in May 9 cases</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Petition says prosecution has no ‘convincing’ evidence connecting ex-PM to violence<br />
• Aleema claims jail authorities denied lawyers entry to plead Toshakhana case</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: PTI founding chairman and ex-premier Imran Khan has filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the rejection of his bail by lower courts.</p>
<p>On June 24, the Lahore High Court (LHC) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919592">denied</a> post-arrest bail to the incarcerated PTI leader in eight cases related to May 9 violence, including an attack on the house of Lahore corps commander. Mr Khan had moved the LHC after an anti-terrorism court denied bail to the former prime minister in these eight cases.</p>
<p>The petition, filed through senior counsel Salman Safdar on Saturday, claimed Mr Khan has been accused of conspiring and abetting violence on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9.</a></p>
<p>However, at the time of the alleged offence, Mr Khan was in the custody of NAB. Therefore, his involvement in violence was “impossible,” the petition argued.</p>
<p>The appeal was filed a day after Mr Khan’s sister, Aleema, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926662">accused</a> the Adiala jail authorities of trying to sabotage the case by confiscating documents required to submit the petition.</p>
<p>The fresh appeal contended the PTI founder had been subjected to an “unprecedented campaign of political victimisation” since his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1684168">ouster</a> as prime minister two years ago.</p>
<p>The present case is yet another attempt by the state and the police to “implicate” Mr Khan in a criminal matter, based solely on “vague and unsupported allegations of abetment”.</p>
<p>The prosecution has no “convincing” evidence connecting Mr Khan to the alleged occurrence, the petition claimed.</p>
<p>After Mr Khan’s “unlawful and invalid” <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">arrest</a> from the premises of the Islamabad High Court on May 9, 2023, multiple FIRs were registered in Lahore and Islamabad, the petition contended, adding none of these complaints contained any specific allegations or details regarding the purported conspiracy.</p>
<p>At a later stage in these cases, the prosecution introduced supplementary statements by police officials in an apparent attempt to “falsely implicate” Mr Khan.</p>
<p>If, as per the prosecution’s claim, the police allegedly knew about the conspiracy to orchestrate violence as early as May 7, why did they not take any action to prevent the attacks, the petition questioned.</p>
<p>This was “highly illogical” and further exposed the “malafide and politically motivated nature of the proceedings”.</p>
<p>The appeal alleged Mr Khan had been “maliciously implicated” in these cases as part of a “calculated and politically motivated design to prolong his incarceration”, harass him and tarnish his public image.</p>
<p>Mr Khan’s arrest was “never genuinely required” in cases pertaining to May 9 violence, the petition pleaded.</p>
<p>It added the police took no action to arrest Mr Khan for over five months after his bail applications were dismissed by an Anti-Terrorism Court in Lahore on Aug 11, 2023.</p>
<p>Despite knowing Mr Khan’s whereabouts — Adiala jail where he was confined — the police “made no meaningful attempt to effect his arrest”.</p>
<p>“This lack of urgency or interest on part of the investigating agency strongly supports the inference that the arrest was not necessitated by the merits of the case, but rather was a tool of oppression, thereby further justifying the grant of post-arrest bail,” the petition said.</p>
<p><strong>LHC decision</strong></p>
<p>The petition claimed the LHC declined Mr Khan’s request for post-arrest bail by relying on “engineered and fabricated evidence” which included “stale, discredited and delayed statements of police officials”.</p>
<p>The high court also failed to note the prosecution had been “consistently shifting its stance” by continually changing the case’s narrative.</p>
<p>“Each new version was introduced only after the preceding one failed to withstand before the courts of law, thereby rendering the prosecution’s case doubtful and entitling the petitioner to the benefit of further inquiry.”</p>
<p>These contradictions clearly make a case for Mr Khan to be granted bail under Section 497(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>
<p>The said section, which allows bail in non-bailable offences, states: “If it appears to such officer or Court … that there are not reasonable grounds for believing that the accused has committed [a non-bailable offence], but that there are sufficient grounds for further inquiry into his guilt, the accused shall, pending such inquiry, be released on bail…”.</p>
<p><strong>Legal team denied entry</strong></p>
<p>Also on Saturday, Ms Aleema, the PTI founder’s sister, claimed his legal team was not allowed inside the Adiala Jail to attend the proceedings of the Toshakhana 2 case.</p>
<p>While talking to reporters outside the prison, Ms Aleema said she and the lawyers were waiting but neither was allowed to enter the prison.</p>
<p>“We were told that only one lawyer can go inside the jail but the lawyer asked how he would [plead the case] without his legal team,” Ms Aleema said.</p>
<p>She claimed the jail authorities violated the judge’s orders, who “time and again said the lawyers of Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi be allowed to enter”.</p>
<p>Ms Aleema said no one was listening to judges “because of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866480">26th Constitutional Amendment</a>”.</p>
<p>She added her brother has already given a call to launch a protest campaign and raise a voice against the amendment.</p>
