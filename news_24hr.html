            <p><p>Balochistan government spokesman Shahid Rind on Friday said that mobile data services in the province have been suspended until August 31 over “security reasons”.</p>
<p>In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925001">worsened</a>, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419/jaffar-express-hijacking-state-media-reports-190-rescued-2nd-day-of-operation-underway-in-balochistan">attacks</a>. In February, nearly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896269/62pc-of-deaths-from-terror-attacks-in-balochistan">62 per cent</a> of the total terrorism-related deaths in the country occurred in Balochistan.</p>
<p>The move came after a notification issued by the Balochistan Home Department on Aug 6, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, ordered the immediate suspension of data services until Aug 31, citing the “peculiar law and order situation” in the province.</p>
<p>“It is, therefore, requested to please direct the concerned authorities for suspension/closure of 3G and 4G services in the entire province … to avoid any untoward incident,” the notification read.</p>
<p>“The service has been suspended because they (militants) use it for coordination and sharing information,” Rind said, according to <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>The suspension follows the government announcement from last month <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927007">banning</a> Pakistani Zaireen (pilgrims) from travelling by road from Quetta to Iran and Iraq due to national security concerns.</p>

<p>On March 11, the Pesha­war-bound Jaffar Express train became the target of an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897237/rescue-operation-for-hostages-underway-after-terrorists-attack-jaffar-express-in-balochistan">unprecedented hijacking</a>, when terrorists fired on the locomotive and took over 400 passengers hostage.</p>
<p>Media reports said that security forces had surrounded the area and launched a clearance operation to rescue all passengers. <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported that security forces had rescued 80 hostages held by the terrorists.</p>
<p>Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on March 12 that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419">clearance operation</a>, launched after the train’s unprecedented hijacking in Balochistan, ended with all 33 terrorists being killed.</p></p>

            <p><p>Two terrorists planning to attack the police in Punjab’s Mianwali district were killed during an operation, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) said on Friday.</p>
<p>The CTD regularly carries out operations across the province to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence. Operating under the provincial police department, the Punjab CTD plays a key role in maintaining internal security and countering terrorism within the country.</p>
<p>In a statement today, the law enforcement agency said, “Punjab CTD killed two terrorists during an operation near Kundian in Mianwali.”</p>
<p>It said that the CTD acted on a tip-off after receiving intelligence that the terrorists were planning to attack police and other institutions.</p>
<p>“During the operation, the CTD and terrorists engaged in an exchange of fire, as a result of which two terrorists were killed by their own accomplices, while six of them managed to escape.”</p>
<p>According to the statement, the CTD recovered “explosive materials, two rifles, hand grenades and bullets” from the terrorists.</p>
<p>“The terrorists had completed their plans to target the police and other institutions,” it said.</p>
<p>The CTD spokesperson said that the process of identifying the two terrorists was underway, while a search operation was launched to arrest the terrorists who escaped.</p>
<p>Punjab CTD was “diligently pursuing its goal of a safe Punjab and is committed to uprooting the menace of terrorism”, the statement added.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>The country <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">ranked</a> second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>
<p>Last month, Punjab CTD killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922297/5-terrorists-killed-as-punjab-ctd-foils-major-terror-attack-in-taunsa-sharif">five terrorists</a> and successfully thwarted a terror plot in Taunsa Sharif in a “major counter-terrorism breakthrough”.</p>
<p>In April,  the law enforcement agency foiled major attacks by arresting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904191">10 terrorists</a> belonging to banned organisations during 189 operations in different areas of Punjab.</p></p>

            <p><p>A year ago to the day, Arshad Nadeem stunned the world with a monstrous javelin throw that propelled him to global stardom and salvaged Pakistan’s plummeting sports glory with its first individual <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850946">gold medal</a> at the Paris 2024 Olympics.</p>
<p>The javelin star sweetened the deal when his 92.97m throw shattered the Olympic record — not once, but twice, to the delight of a roaring crowd at Paris’ Stade de France.</p>
<p>But a year on from the historic triumph, Arshad is undergoing physiotherapy in London following <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926307">surgery</a> on his calf muscle.</p>
<p>The two upcoming Diamond League championships he was set to compete at this month have been scrapped from his sports calendar as he recovers in time for the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo in September.</p>
<p>But there is no disappointment from Arshad or his coach Salman Butt, who doubles as his mentor, manager, and much more.</p>
<p>“Things are looking good for Tokyo,” he told <em>Dawn.com</em> in a call from London. “We’re hoping to accomplish a lot there.”</p>
<p>A gold medal at the World Championships will complete his trifecta after his gold in the Paris Olympics and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1703858">2022 Commonwealth Games</a>. Arshad made this year’s international debut in style when he won <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914503">gold</a> with an 86.40m throw at the Asian Athletics Championship in Gumi, South Korea, in May.</p>
<p>Butt acknowledged that the scratched competitions are not ideal, and the aim was to compete at least four or five times ahead of the world championships.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>“The thing is, sports and injury go together. That’s just how it is.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He emphasised the importance of rectifying the recurring injury as they flew to Cambridge and underwent surgery within six days.</p>
<p>Contrary to any doom and gloom, Arshad is now pain-free and going full steam ahead with his training in London as he wraps up his last few physiotherapy sessions.</p>
<p>He’ll return to Pakistan soon, where he’ll continue training for the next six weeks before heading to Tokyo in an attempt to make history once again.</p>

<p>The Pakistan High Commission in London honoured Arshad with a shield to commemorate one year since his Olympic triumph.</p>
<p>“All officers and staff of [the high commission] were present to honour our national hero,” it said in a post on X.</p>
<p>High Commissioner Dr Muhammad Faisal said: “Arshad Nadeem’s achievement has highlighted the importance of track &amp; field athletics to the youth of Pakistan.”</p>
