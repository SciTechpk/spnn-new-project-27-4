            <p><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Thursday rebutted rumours of President Asif Ali Zardari being asked to resign, terming it a “malicious campaign”.</p>
<p>“We are fully aware of who is behind the malicious campaign targeting President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, and the chief of army staff,” Naqvi <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MohsinnaqviC42/status/1943211206371602592" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X.</p>
<p>“I have categorically stated that there has been no discussion, nor does any such idea exist about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency,” he asserted.</p>

<p>“The president of Pakistan enjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces,” the minister said.</p>
<p>He quoted President Zardari as having “clearly” stated: “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”</p>
<p>Naqvi stressed that the “sole focus” of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was Pakistan’s strength and stability, and “nothing else”.</p>
<p>“To those involved in this narrative, do whatever you wish in collaboration with hostile foreign agencies. As for us, we will do whatever is necessary to make Pakistan strong again, InshAllah,” Naqvi added.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, social media campaigns against the army have escalated, reflecting broader tensions within the country’s political and social fabric.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923261/pakistan-china-agree-on-joint-media-cooperation-against-fake-news' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, China agree on joint media cooperation against fake news</strong></a>
            <p><p>Pakistan and China on Thursday agreed to further enhance ties and joint broadcasting projects between their state broadcasters to tackle fake news and disinformation, <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/10-07-2025/pakistan-china-agree-to-enhance-ties" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Radio Pakistan</em></a> reported.</p>
<p>Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation, and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors, including trade, energy, infrastructure, and media collaboration, with initiatives like the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879166">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)</a> symbolising a shared vision for development.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1831125">government</a> as well as the military have previously warned about “fake news and propaganda” proliferating on social media, with Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850240">saying</a> that not enough was being done against “digital terrorism” under the law.</p>
<p>The decision was made during a meeting in Beijing between Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar and Cao Shumin, Deputy Head of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Minister and Party Secretary of the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA).</p>
<p>“Both leaders also agreed on a joint narrative against fake news and emphasised technical training and institutional collaboration,” the report said. “They described the ongoing partnership in the media as a reflection of mutual trust and longstanding friendship.”</p>
<p>It added that the two sides also held talks related to a proposed agreement between <em>China Central Television (CCTV)</em> and <em>Pakistan Television (PTV)</em> to promote the exchange of information and cooperation.</p>
<p>The information minister said Pakistan was ready to translate bilateral media cooperation into practical steps and that state-run media entities — <em>PTV</em>, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> and <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> — were playing a crucial role in communicating stories of China’s development, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856317">Belt and Road Initiative</a>, CPEC, cultural ties, and bilateral cooperation to the people of both countries.</p>
<p>Per the report, Tarar said <em>PTV</em> was building intellectual and cultural bridges between the two nations by broadcasting Chinese programmes, documentaries and news reports in Urdu.</p>
<p>He said <em>APP’s</em> “China News Service” had crossed a significant milestone in effectively conveying Pakistan’s narrative to Chinese readers.</p>
<p>Referring to the recent Pakistan-India tensions, the information minister said the youth of China and Pakistan expressed strong solidarity with each other, which went viral on social media.</p>
<p>The meeting also discussed exchange visits of digital influencers from both Pakistan and China. Tarar said in the digital age, exchanges between influencers and social media representatives of both countries can inject new energy into bilateral relations.</p>
<p>Shumin said China considered Pakistan a trustworthy partner. “Media organisations of Pakistan and China can come closer through the exchange of experiences,” she was quoted as saying in the report.</p>
<p>Both sides agreed that media, culture, and people-to-people relations can introduce new dimensions to the Pakistan-China friendship, and these efforts will be further strengthened under a joint strategy.</p>
<p>In February, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan, Jiang Zaidong <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pak-china-cooperation-in-education-media-to-be-expanded-chinese-ambassador/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>, “We are ready to expand cooperation with Pakistan in education, media, think tanks, youth exchanges, and the film and television industries, to foster mutual learning between civilisations and strengthen cultural and people-to-people ties.”</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923264/india-electoral-roll-revision-sparks-fear-and-fury' target='_blank'><strong>India electoral roll revision sparks fear and fury</strong></a>
            <p><p>Indian election officials have given voters in Bihar state just weeks to prove their citizenship, requiring documents that few possess in a registration revamp set to be applied nationwide, triggering disenfranchisement fears.</p>
<p>The Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the revision of the voter rolls in June ahead of upcoming polls in the eastern state.</p>
<p>It said the exercise will later be replicated across the nation of 1.4 billion people.</p>
<p>According to the ECI, the “intensive revision” was needed in part to avoid the “inclusion of the names of foreign illegal immigrants”.</p>
<p>Members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have long claimed that large numbers of undocumented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920561">Muslim migrants</a> from neighbouring Bangladesh have fraudulently entered India’s electoral rolls.</p>
<p>Critics say the overhaul could render vast numbers of Indian citizens unable to vote.</p>
<p>“You are being asked to produce documents that very few people have,” said Asaduddin Owaisi, a prominent Muslim lawmaker.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“It will lead to mass disenfranchisement.”</p>
<p>Opposition lawmakers say it will impact minorities the hardest, including <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891144">Muslims</a> and Dalit communities, those on the bottom rung of India’s rigid caste hierarchy.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#engineered-exclusions" id="engineered-exclusions" title="Permalink"></a>‘Engineered exclusions’</h2>
<p>All potential voters in Bihar will have to provide proof of citizenship by July 25.</p>
<p>Those registered in 2003, the last time scrutiny of the voter list took place in Bihar, can submit a copy of that.</p>
<p>The rest — around 30 million people, according to the ECI’s estimates — have to provide evidence of their place and date of birth.</p>
<p>And those born after 1987 must also furnish proof of their parents’ Indian citizenship.</p>
<p>The requirement affects more than a third of potential voters in Bihar, India’s third most populous state and its poorest.</p>
<p>It is also a crucial election battleground as the only state in India’s northern Hindi-speaking belt where Modi’s BJP has only ever governed in a coalition.</p>
<p>Bihar’s main opposition party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, has challenged the election commission in the Supreme Court, along with other parties and activists.</p>
<p>“It is being used to justify aggressive and opaque revisions of electoral rolls that disproportionately target Muslim, Dalit and poor (Indian) migrant communities,” the court petition read.</p>
<p>“They are not random patterns but… engineered exclusions.” Unlike many other countries, India does not have a unique national identity card.</p>
<p>The widely used biometric-linked “Aadhaar” identity card is not among the documents listed by the ECI as acceptable proof.</p>
<p>Documents that can be used include birth certificates, passports and matriculation records.</p>
<p>Of these, most people are likely to rely on their matriculation certificates.</p>
<p>But even those are in short supply in Bihar, where literacy rates are among the lowest in India.</p>
<p>According to an analysis published in <em>The Indian Express</em> newspaper, only 35 per cent of people in the state hold such a document.</p>
<p>“In Bihar, where literacy is not very high, many people are not likely to have the kind of documents the ECI has demanded,” said Jagdeep Chhokar from the
New Delhi-based Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR).</p>
<p>“The poor, poorly educated, uneducated, and minorities will be the most impacted.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#foreign-infiltrators" id="foreign-infiltrators" title="Permalink"></a>‘Foreign infiltrators’</h2>
<p>Detractors say the drive is unprecedented because “documentary proof has never been demanded” of people to vote in India.</p>
<p>“Only those who especially wanted their name inserted needed to fill a form,” said political activist and academic Yogendra Yadav. “For the rest, someone would come to their house and get their names registered.”</p>
<p>“The onus in India was never on the voter but on the ECI officials,” he added.
In previous verification drives, modifications were made to the existing rolls, Yadav said.</p>
<p>Now, a list is being drawn from scratch.</p>
<p>Yadav said the drive was a “de facto” implementation of an earlier plan to put together a list of Indian citizens.</p>
<p>The National Register of Citizens (NRC), which was compiled in the eastern state of Assam in 2019, left out almost two million people. Many of them were Muslims.</p>
<p>The BJP had said the NRC would be replicated nationwide as it was necessary to detect “foreign infiltrators”, but was forced to backtrack after furious protests.</p>
<p>“Everyone has to now prove that they are citizens of India,” said Yadav.</p>
<p>“That is exactly what the NRC is… this is NRC by the backdoor. “</p></p>
