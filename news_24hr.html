            <p><p>• Shehbaz meets Erdogan, expresses gratitude for Ankara’s support during tensions with India<br />
• Both sides reaffirm principled support for ‘core concerns’, including Kashmir dispute; call for Gaza ceasefire<br />
• Premier advocates investments in renewable energy, IT, defence production, agriculture</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: In the first leg of his four-country tour, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday arrived in Turkiye, where he met President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to not only thank Ankara for its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909193/erdogan-conveys-turkiyes-solidarity-to-pm-shehbaz-amid-india-escalation">support</a> during recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tensions</a> with India but also cement bilateral economic cooperation.</p>
<p>“Both leaders reaffirmed their principled support for each other’s core concerns, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute,” said an official press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on Sunday.</p>
<p>In his meeting with President Erdogan, the PM advocated joint ventures and enhanced bilateral investment, highlighting key sectors, including renewable energy, information technology, defence production, infrastructure development, and agriculture as potential areas of mutual interest.</p>
<p>The two leaders also conducted a comprehensive review of the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and reiterated their resolve to elevate the strategic partnership. They also followed up on the implementation of key decisions taken during the 7th session of the High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council (HLSCC), <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891812">held</a> in Islamabad on Feb 13 this year. Both sides agreed to take steps to achieve the $5 billion annual bilateral trade target agreed earlier by the two leaders.</p>

<p>In addition to bilateral issues, Prime Minister Shehbaz and President Erdogan discussed pressing regional and international developments. They also expressed concern over the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza, urgently calling for an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian access to the affected Palestinian population.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz, who was accompanied by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, expressed heartfelt gratitude to the government and people of Turkiye for their unwavering support to Pakistan during the recent developments in South Asia. He lauded Turkiye’s principled stance and the outpouring support of goodwill of the Turkish people for Pakistan and termed it as a source of great comfort and strength for Pakistan.</p>

<p>The premier highlighted the commitment, courage and the spirit of sacrifice of the armed forces of Pakistan and the resolute patriotism that was demonstrated in an unprecedented manner, which contributed to Pakistan’s victory in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566/marka-i-haq-pakistan-army-names-period-of-conflict-with-india-since-april-22-may-10">Marak-i-Haq</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909913/govt-terms-new-retaliatory-operation-against-india-bunyan-um-marsoos-state-media">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a>.</p>
<p>According to state-run <em>PTV News</em>, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Information Minis­ter Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant Syed Tariq Fatemi also participated in the meeting.</p>
<p>Moreover, both leaders also presided over a delegation-level meeting between the two sides.</p>
<p>Earlier, on his arrival at the airport, the PM was received by Defence Minister Yashar Guler, Istanbul Deputy Governor Erdogan Turan Ermis, Pakistan’s ambassador in Turkiye Yousaf Junaid, Consul General Istanbul Nouman Aslam, and other diplomats.</p>
<p>After the two-day Turkiye visit, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will also visit Iran, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan during this week.</p>
<p>During the visits, he is expected to hold “wide-ranging discussions” with the nations while acknowledging their support during Pakistan’s recent escalation with India.</p>
<p>According to <em>Dawn.com</em>, in Tajikistan — likely the last leg of his tour — the premier will also attend the International Confe­rence on Glaciers being held in its capital, Dus­hanbe, on May 29 and 30.</p>

<p>The visit comes a fortnight after Pakistan and India reached a US-brokered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> following a brief military confrontation. During the conflict, the Iranian foreign minister visited both nations to act as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">mediator</a>. According to the FO’s statement, the PM will have “wide-ranging discussions” with the leaders of the four countries on issues including bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance.</p>
<p><strong>Pakistan, Uzbekistan ties</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Mini­ster Mohammad Ishaq Dar and Uzbekistan’s Foreign Minister Saidov Bakhtiyor Odilovich discussed bilateral relations and the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894417/pakistan-and-uzbekistan-agree-to-expand-bilateral-trade-to-2bn#:~:text=%E2%80%98Detailed%20negotiations%E2%80%99%20held%20on%20joint%20railway%20project">Railway Line Project</a> in a phone call on Sunday, the Foreign Office said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1926519844997927089" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>During the conversation, the two leaders expressed optimism about the early finalisation of the framework agreement for the regional connectivity project.</p>
<p>The ministers also exchanged views on the regional situation, according to the statement.</p>

            <p><p>KHUZDAR: Another wounded student of the Army Public School (APS) in Khuz­dar died during treatment at hospital, bringing the death toll in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912542/pm-vows-strong-action-against-perpetrators-after-school-bus-blast-in-khuzdar">suicide attack</a> on the school bus to 10, officials confirmed on Sunday.</p>
<p>The latest victim, Sheema Ibrahim, was undergoing treatment at Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Quetta, where she died of her injuries. She was the daughter of a Levies official and had been in critical condition since the explosion.</p>

<p>The fatalities now include eight APS students, seven girls and one boy, along with two adults. On the day of the attack, three students — Saniya Soomro (Grade 6), Hafza Kausar (Grade 7) and Ayesha Saleem (Grade 10) — died on the spot. In the days that followed, Haider, Mala­ika and Sehr Saleem succumbed to their injuries while undergoing treatment. The identity of one more student could not be ascertained.</p>
<p>Security officials have condemned the assault, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912572">alleging</a> foreign involvement in the targeted attack on schoolchildren. “Eight innocent lives have fallen victim to India’s campaign of terrorism within Pakistan,” a senior security official said.</p>

            <p><p>LAHORE: Sikandar Raza ran off in celebration — punching the air in delight, his partner Kusal Perera in tow as fireworks exploded in the background. Lahore Qalandars were Pakistan Super League champions again, sealing their third title in four seasons after pulling off a remarkable chase.</p>
<p>Quetta Gladiators had been in the ascendancy in Sunday’s final, headed towards what they believed was their destiny — a second PSL crown — having <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1470221">clinched</a> their first six long years ago. They had tightened the noose around the Qalandars, who, in their chase of 202, needed 57 runs to win off the last 20 deliveries when Raza joined Perera at the crease.</p>
<p>But the Qalandars found inspiration, as Gladiators lost theirs; Perera played a masterful knock of an unbeaten 31-ball 62 featuring four sixes and five fours, with Raza providing the ideal foil with 22 off seven balls to take their side home with a ball to spare. As their teammates ran onto the pitch in jubilation, the Gladiators sank to the ground, left wondering what could have been.</p>

<p>Raza, who had flown in from England after featuring for Zimbabwe in a four-day Test that only <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913148/bashirs-six-wickets-seal-dominant-england-win-over-zimbabwe">ended</a> on Saturday and only arrived 10 minutes before the toss for the final, began the recovery when he deposited the first two balls he faced for a four and a six. The hits, both in the mid-wicket region, came immediately after Mohammad Amir had dismissed Bhanuka Rajapaksa to put the Gladiators on top.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Perera, Raza star in nerve-jangling last-over victory against Quetta Gladiators to seal third title in four seasons</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perera launched the offensive from the other end; the left-hander — who only came into the Qalandars’ side after the PSL was halted with eight games to go due to Pakistan-India skirmishes — hit Khurram Shahzad for two sixes and then punished Amir in the penultimate over for two fours and a slog-sweep for six.</p>
<p>That left Qalandars needing 13 off the final over and Raza came to the fore after Hasan Nawaz, who had earlier scored 76 for Gladiators, acrobatically saved a boundary. The Zimbabwean slashed an audacious six over point and then used his wrists to spark Qalandars’ celebrations in front of a partisan home crowd.</p>
<p>Qalandars skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi ran to lift Raza on his shoulders. The pacer — who was the pick of Lahore’s bowlers with 3-24 — had given his side the ideal start in the final when he dismissed his Gladiators counterpart Saud Shakeel early on. Saud’s opening partner Finn Allen departed in the third over, but Hasan checked Qalandar’s building momentum.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>On the first six balls he faced, Hasan got two fours and a massive six over long-on. Rilee Roussow, at the other end, was also dealing in boundaries; his first three scoring shots being two fours and a pull off Haris Rauf for six. The left-hander then found joy on the off side, getting two fours in the sixth over by Salman, and the Gladiators ending the powerplay at 57-2. Rossouw, however, fell soon after, with Raza striking as the South African found Shaheen at short cover.</p>
<p>Losing his partner didn’t stop Hasan, though. Rishad Hossain was belted for two fours off the first three balls of the eighth over. Raza was then deposited for six in the next over before Hasan took Rishad to the cleaners in the 10th with 6, 4, 4 off the first three balls to raise his 50 off just 21 balls as Gladiators got to 100-3 at the midway point of their innings.</p>
<p>Avishka Fernando (29) hit five fours before becoming Rishad’s first victim, but Hasan — seemingly struggling with an injury — kept going on, using brute force to dispatch Raza over his head for six more and he got lucky when he was spilled by Fakhar Zaman two overs later.</p>
<p>Dinesh Chandimal chipped in with 22, hitting two sixes, before holing Shaheen to substitute Mohammad Azab on the second ball of the 18th over with Hasan’s 43-ball knock ending four deliveries later when he found Raza at wide long-on.</p>
<p>Haris returned to dismiss Amir and Abrar Ahmed as Gladiators seemed to crumble late on, but Faheem Ashraf (28 not out) pulled and flicked Salman for three sixes in the final over to take his side to 201-9.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Mohammad Naeem (46) got Qalandars off to a flier in their chase, bludgeoning Faheem for two sixes, but just when he was threatening to take it away from the Gladiators single-handedly, he saw his partner Fakhar trapped lbw by Abrar.</p>
<p>Naeem survived after Usman Tariq dropped a sitter and with Abdullah Shafique crunching a glorious late cut for four off Abrar, Qalandars reached 56-1 by the end of the powerplay. Naeem hit six sixes in his 27-ball innings, which ended when Faheem had him caught at deep square, bringing Perera to the crease.</p>
<p>Abdullah made 41 off 28 with four fours and a six, but after he top-edged Usman to be caught in the 13th over, the Gladiators seemed to have reined in the Qalandars, who needed 71 off the last five overs. Rajapaksa never got going, but his dismissal only paved the way for Qalandars’ stunning late charge.</p>
