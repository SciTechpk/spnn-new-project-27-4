                <h2>Security forces kill 33 terrorists in Balochistan‚Äôs Zhob district: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Security forces killed 33 terrorists attempting to infiltrate across the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on Friday, the military‚Äôs media wing said in a statement.</p>
<p>According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), a large group of terrorists belonging to the ‚ÄúIndian proxy <em>Fitna al Khwaraj</em>‚Äù, were trying to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border when they were detected by the security forces in the Sambaza area of Balochistan‚Äôs Zhob district on the night of August 7 and 8.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna"><em>Fitna al Khawarij</em></a> is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>The statement added that the troops effectively engaged and thwarted their attempt to infiltrate, adding, ‚ÄúAs a result of precise, bold and skilful engagement, thirty three Indian sponsored <em>khwarij</em> were sent to hell.‚Äù</p>
<p>A large cache of weapons, ammunition and explosives was also recovered, it added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe security forces of Pakistan remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation‚Äôs frontiers and to eradicate the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,‚Äù the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The country ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025.</p>
<p>Last month, 30 terrorists of an ‚ÄúIndian proxy‚Äù outfit were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922039/30-terrorists-killed-in-north-waziristan-as-bid-to-infiltrate-via-pak-afghan-border-thwarted-ispr">killed</a> as they attempted to infiltrate through the Pak-Afghan border in Hassan Khel tehsil of KP‚Äôs North Waziristan district.</p></p>

                <h2>PTI‚Äôs leaders of opposition in NA, Senate removed from posts</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>PTI‚Äôs Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan and Opposition Leader in the Senate Shibli Faraz, were removed from their seats, according to notifications by the respective houses‚Äô secretariats that came to light on Friday.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928901">disqualified</a> the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders, Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza and other PTI lawmakers following their convictions in cases related to the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>According to the notification by the National Assembly Secretariat dated August 7, ‚Äú Consequent upon disqualification and de-notification of Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub Khan from being a member of the National Assembly (NA-18 Haripur) under Article 63 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan ‚Ä¶ the office of the Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly has become vacant with effect from August 5th, 2025.‚Äú</p>
<p>A similar notification for Faraz was issued by the Senate Secretariat: ‚ÄúConsequent upon disqualification and de-notification of Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Senator Syed Shibli Faraz, from being a member of the Senate under Article 63 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan ‚Ä¶ the office of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has become vacant with effect from 5th August‚Äù.</p>
<p>The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Wednesday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929106">halted</a> ECP from taking any action against PTI leaders Faraz and Ayub.</p>
<p>A notification from the ECP had said Faraz, Ayub, Kharal, Raza, MNA Rai Hassan Nawaz Khan, Gul, MPA Muhammad Ansar Iqbal, MPA Junaid Afzal Sahi and MPA Rai Muhammad Murtaza Iqbal were now disqualified under Article 63(1h) (a person shall be disqualified from being elected [if] ‚Ä¶ he has been, on conviction for any offence involving moral turpitude, sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years) of the Constitution and their seats were vacant.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">arrest</a>, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">attacking</a> the Lahore corps commander‚Äôs residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.</p>
<p>Last month, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Faisalabad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">senten¬≠ced</a> over 100 leaders and workers of the PTI, including several key opposition figures, to jail terms of up to 10 years in connection with the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>NA Opposition Leader Khan, Senate Opposition Leader Faraz, MNA Zartaj Gul, Raza, Sheikh Rashid Shafique (nephew of former interior minister Sheikh Rashid), Kanwal Shauzab, Farah Agha, Rai Haider Kharal and Muhammad Ahmad Chattha were among those sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment.</p>
<p>Ayub had lambasted the ATC‚Äôs ‚Äúbogus verdict‚Äù in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/OmarAyubKhan/status/1952737607013576874" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, saying that he would contest it and the ECP‚Äôs disqualification in court.</p>
<p>He also posted a video of himself at the Peshawar High Court with other PTI leaders and lawyers, saying the court had given him a few days and bail would be granted to him on filing his appeal.</p>
<p>The ECP disqualification followed other recent disqualifications of PTI leaders and lawmakers.</p>
<p>On July 29, the ECP had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927477/haste-raises-eyebrows-as-ecp-disqualifies-another-pti-lawmaker">disqualified</a> MNA Abdul Latif from the NA-1 constituency (Upper and Lower Chitral), raising questions over the haste with which a flurry of similar decisions were taken in recent days.</p>
<p>On July 28, the commission had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927202">disqualified</a> Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, MNA Mohammad Ahmed Chatta and MPA Ahmad Khan.</p>
<p>On December 21 and 26 last year, a military court had sentenced over 50 PTI leaders and activists, including Imran Khan‚Äôs nephew Hassaan Niazi, to up to 10 years for their involvement in the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>The ATCs have been hearing May 9-related cases daily to meet a deadline set by the Supreme Court for the conclusion of trials by August.</p></p>
