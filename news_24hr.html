            <p><p>Lt General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, director general of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), has lauded Iran’s peace efforts in the recent Pakistan-India conflict and warned of “forces” seeking to create a rift among brotherly countries.</p>
<p>Just two days after India, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">without</a> any evidence, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack">blamed</a> Pakistan over last month’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, Iran had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">offered to mediate</a> between the two as tensions escalated.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is fully grateful to the international community, and we are especially grateful to brotherly countries, including the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Gen Chaudhry told <em>IRNA</em> in an <a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85835207/Exclusive-Pakistani-military-spokesperson-Islamabad-appreciates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> published today — the first by any Pakistani armed forces’ spokesperson to an Iranian outlet.</p>
<p>“We should be aware that there are forces in the region that, with the help of external factors, are seeking to create misunderstanding and confusion among brotherly countries in the region and want to create a rift between friends and brothers,” the DG ISPR added.</p>

<p>According to <em>IRNA</em>, Lt Gen Chaudhry spoke about the latest developments in South Asia as well as the “importance of regional and international diplomacy to help de-escalate tensions”. He also “focused” on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">recent visit</a> of Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to Islamabad, the report added.</p>
<p>During his visit to Islamabad, Araghchi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">met with</a> Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir. He later also made a trip <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909355/irans-foreign-minister-repeats-call-for-restraint-in-india-pakistan-standoff">to New Delhi</a>, reiterating his call for restraint.</p>

<p>The DG ISPR appreciated Tehran’s efforts and support to help de-escalate tensions in the region.</p>
<p>“We are pleased with all the efforts of the international community and brotherly countries, especially Iran, which played a role in reducing tensions,” he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as tensions over the Pahalgam attack continued to build up. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting drones</a> sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, for both sides to finally drop their guns as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> was reached.</p>
<p>The Pakistani army spokesman emphasised that Iran and Pakistan “have very historical and brotherly relations and have always stood by each other in all challenges and trials”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry highlighted that the two nations were “neighbouring and friendly countries that are in contact with each other on many issues and fields”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is eager and pursues that the borders of the two countries are the borders of peace and friendship, and we look forward to it,” the DG ISPR told <em>IRNA</em>.</p>
<p>The military’s spokesperson stressed that Tehran and Islamabad were “cooperating together for lasting peace and stability in the region”.</p>

<p>Separately, the ISPR said President Asif Ali Zardari visited Gujranwala Cantonment today where he lauded the “exemplary conduct and professional excellence” of the military in the successful execution of Marqa-i-Haq, acknowledging their “resolute determination and unshakable courage in the face of unprovoked aggression”.</p>
<p>“He paid solemn tribute to the military and civilian martyrs who laid down their lives in defence of the motherland, affirming that their sacrifice remains a sacred trust and a source of enduring national pride. He underscored that the sons of the soil, fortified by the enduring spirit of the nation, stood with unwavering resolve to defend the motherland and thwarted hostile designs with exceptional valour and operational acumen.”</p>
<p>The president said history would bear witness to how, “within a matter of hours, the Pakistan Armed Forces repelled aggression with unmatched precision and resolve, sending an unequivocal message” of the country’s strength, resilience and national unity.</p>
<p>During his interaction with officers and troops, the president commended their “exemplary morale, combat readiness and devotion to duty”.</p>
<p>The ISPR added that he extended congratulations on the successful culmination of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, and expressed “profound pride in the defenders of the nation, affirming that the people of Pakistan hold their brave soldiers in the highest esteem as the true custodians of national honour and sovereignty”.</p>

<p>Separately, PML-N President and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif praised the armed forces and parliament for national unity.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the PML-N said Nawaz lauded the professionalism and bravery of the armed forces, saying they “defended the motherland like an iron wall against Indian aggression”.</p>
<p>“We offer our deepest gratitude to God for granting us success,” he was quoted as saying during a meeting with PML-N Parliamentary Leader in the Senate and Chairman of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Senator Irfan Siddiqui, who called on him in Raiwind.</p>
<p>Nawaz also lauded the role of parliament, saying that “setting aside all political differences and speaking with one voice for the sake of national security” was a welcome and commendable step.</p>
<p>“By reflecting the emotions of 240 million citizens, the people’s representatives boosted the spirit of the brave armed forces,” he said.</p>
<p>He also commended Pakistani media for “presenting the truth before the world and exposing the enemy’s falsehoods”.</p>
<p>Senator Siddiqui briefed the PML-N president on the parliamentary party’s performance during the session. Nawaz underscored the importance of institutional collaboration, stating that parliament’s unified stance had reinforced national resolve and showcased Pakistan’s democratic maturity in times of crisis.</p>
<p>The statement concluded that the meeting underscored the PML-N’s commitment to upholding state interests and its confidence in democratic institutions.</p>

            <p><p>Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused Donald Trump on Saturday of lying when the US president said during his Gulf tour this week that he wanted peace in the region.</p>
<p>On the contrary, said Khamenei, the United States uses its power to give “10-ton bombs to the Zionist (Israeli) regime to drop on the heads of Gaza’s children”.</p>
<p>Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One after departing the United Arab Emirates on Friday that Iran had to move quickly on a US proposal for its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911291/trump-claims-n-deal-with-iran-likely-hopes-to-avoid-military-action">nuclear programme</a> or “something bad’s going to happen”.</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Trump speaks about peace while simultaneously making threats.</p>
<p>“Which should we believe?” Pezeshkian said at a naval event in Tehran.</p>
<p>“On the one hand, he speaks of peace and on the other, he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901324">threatens</a> with the most advanced tools of mass killing.”</p>
<p>Tehran would continue Iran-US nuclear talks but is not afraid of threats.</p>
<p>“We are not seeking war,” Pezeshkian said.</p>
<p>His remarks, said Khamenei, “aren’t even worth responding to.”</p>
<p>They are an “embarrassment to the speaker and the American people,” Khamenei added.</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly, the source of corruption, war, and conflict in this region is the Zionist regime — a dangerous, deadly cancerous tumour that must be uprooted; it will be uprooted,” he said at an event at a religious centre in Tehran, according to state media.</p>
<p>While Trump said on Friday that Iran had a US proposal about its nuclear programme, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi in a post on X said Tehran had not received any such proposal.</p>

<p>“There is no scenario in which Iran abandons its hard-earned right to (uranium) enrichment for peaceful purposes…” he said.</p>
<p>Araqchi warned on Saturday that Washington’s constant change of stance prolongs nuclear talks, state TV reported.</p>
<p>“It is absolutely unacceptable that America repeatedly defines a new framework for negotiations that prolongs the process,” the broadcast quoted Araqchi as saying.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian said Iran would not “back down from our legitimate rights”.</p>
<p>“Because we refuse to bow to bullying, they say we are source of instability in the region,” he said.</p>
<p>A fourth <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1910194'">round</a> of Iran-US talks ended in Oman last Sunday.</p>
<p>A new round has not been scheduled yet.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911613/moodys-cuts-americas-pristine-credit-rating-citing-rising-debt' target='_blank'><strong>Moody’s cuts America’s pristine credit rating, citing rising debt</strong></a>
            <p><p>Moody’s downgraded the US sovereign credit rating on Friday due to concerns about the nation’s growing $36 trillion debt pile in a move that could complicate President Donald Trump’s efforts to cut taxes and send ripples through global markets.</p>
<p>Moody’s first gave the United States its pristine “Aaa” rating in 1919 and is the last of the three major credit agencies to downgrade it.</p>
<p>“Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” Moody’s said on Friday, as it changed its outlook on the US to “stable” from “negative”.</p>
<p>The announcement drew criticism from people close to Trump.</p>
<p>Stephen Moore, former senior economic adviser to Trump and an economist at Heritage Foundation, called the move “outrageous”. “If a US backed government bond isn’t triple A-asset then what is?” he told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>White House communications director Steven Cheung reacted to the downgrade via a social media post, singling out Moody’s economist, Mark Zandi, for criticism. He called Zandi a political opponent of Trump.</p>
<p>Zandi declined to comment. Zandi is the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, which is a separate entity from the credit ratings agency Moody’s.</p>
<p>Since his return to the White House on January 20, Trump has said he would balance the budget while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has repeatedly said the current administration aims to lower US government funding costs.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>But the administration’s attempts to raise revenue and cut spending have so far failed to persuade investors.</p>
<p>Trump’s attempts to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1890966">cut spending</a> through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have fallen far short of its initial goals. And attempts to raise revenue through tariffs have sparked concerns about a trade war and global slowdown, roiling markets.</p>
<p>Left unchecked, such worries could trigger a bond market rout and hinder the administration’s ability to pursue its agenda.</p>
<p>The downgrade, which came after market close, sent yields on Treasury bonds higher, and analysts said it could give investors a pause when markets re-open for regular trading on Monday.</p>
<p>“It basically adds to the evidence that the United States has too much debt,” said Darrell Duffie, a Stanford finance professor who was formerly on Moody’s board. “Congress is just going to have to discipline itself, either get more revenues or spend less.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#focus-on-deficits" id="focus-on-deficits" title="Permalink"></a>Focus on deficits</h2>
<p>Trump is pushing lawmakers in the Republican-controlled Congress to pass a bill extending the 2017 tax cuts that were his signature first-term legislative achievement, a move that nonpartisan analysts say will add trillions to the federal government’s debt.</p>
<p>The downgrade came as the tax bill <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911508/republicans-reject-trump-tax-cut-bill-after-president-calls-for-unity">failed to clear</a> a key procedural hurdle on Friday, as hardline Republicans demanding deeper spending cuts blocked the measure in a rare political setback for the Republican president in Congress.</p>
<p>Moody’s said the fiscal proposals under considerations were unlikely to lead to a sustained, multi-year reduction in deficits, and it estimated the federal debt burden would rise to about 134 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035, compared with 98pc in 2024.</p>
<p>“Moody’s downgrade of the United States’ credit rating should be a wake-up call to Trump and Congressional Republicans to end their reckless pursuit of their deficit-busting tax giveaway,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>“Sadly, I am not holding my breath.”</p>
<p>The cut follows a downgrade by rival Fitch, which in August 2023 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1788563">also cut</a> the US sovereign rating by one notch, citing expected fiscal deterioration and repeated down-to-the-wire debt ceiling negotiations that threaten the government’s ability to pay its bills.</p>
<p>Fitch was the second major rating agency to strip the US of its top triple-A rating, after Standard &amp; Poor’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/649765/us-loses-aaa-credit-rating-from-standard-poors">did so</a> after the 2011 debt ceiling crisis.</p>
<p>“They have got to come up with a credible budget agreement that puts the deficit on a downward trajectory,” said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College, referring to Republican lawmakers.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#market-fragility" id="market-fragility" title="Permalink"></a>Market fragility</h2>
<p>Investors use credit ratings to assess the risk profile of companies and governments when they raise financing in debt capital markets. Generally, the lower a borrower’s rating, the higher its financing costs.</p>
<p>“The downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody’s is a continuation of a long trend of fiscal irresponsibility that will eventually lead to higher borrowing costs for the public and private sector in the United States,” said Spencer Hakimian, chief executive at Tolou Capital Management, a hedge fund.</p>
<p>Long-dated Treasury yields, which rise when bond prices decline, could go higher on the back of the downgrade, said Hakimian, barring news on the economic front that could increase safe-haven demand for Treasuries.</p>
<p>The downgrade follows heightened uncertainty in US financial markets as Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on key trade partners has over the past few weeks sparked investor fears of higher price pressures and a sharp economic slowdown.</p>
<p>“This news comes at a time when the markets are very vulnerable and so we are likely to see a reaction,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors.</p></p>
