<p>A statement issued by the Presidency said the two held a meeting today at the President House.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe meeting involved discussions on the country‚Äôs political, economic, and security situation. The state of law and order in the country and measures against terrorism were also discussed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prime minister briefed the president on the government‚Äôs measures to improve the economy. Both leaders reiterated their commitment to work together for the country‚Äôs stability, development, and prosperity,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>The meeting was also attended by Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Law  Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Interior  Minister Mohsin Naqvi and PM‚Äôs Adviser on Political and Public Affairs Rana Sanaullah.</p>

<p>The meeting comes in the wake of growing speculation about the upcoming 27th constitutional amendment and it being claimed that President Zardari may soon step down, potentially paving the way for the army chief to assume the country‚Äôs presidency.</p>
<p>The reports on social media claim that work is underway to replace the current parliamentary system with a presidential form of government. Some reports also claim that President Zardari has set one condition for his exit ‚Äî a key role for his son Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in the new dispensation.</p>
<p>Naqvi said earlier this month that there were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922412/dar-naqvi-allay-fears-over-breach-in-coalition">no plans</a> to remove President Zardari and dismissed the reports about any such move.</p>

<p>He had to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923413/mohsin-naqvi-rubbishes-reports-about-presidential-system">dismiss the reports again</a> last week, claiming that the country was shifting to a presidential system and that Field Marshal Asim Munir would replace Zardari as head of state.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are fully aware of who is behind the malicious campaign targeting President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the chief of army staff (COAS). I have categorically stated that there has been no discussion ‚Äî nor does any such idea exist ‚Äî about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency,‚Äù Naqvi had posted on X.</p>
<p>He said the president enjoyed a strong and respe¬≠ctful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces. ‚ÄúI know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>Dar slams Israel, US attacks against fellow SCO member Iran as ‚Äòunacceptable‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday slammed last month‚Äôs attacks by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/tel-aviv-in-smoke-as-iran-launches-missiles-under-operation-true-promise-3-after-day-long-israeli-attacks">Israel</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">United States</a> on Iran as ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù as he attended a ministerial meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in China‚Äôs Tianjin.</p>
<p>The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. The group‚Äôs foreign ministers meet as a precursor to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1864831">annual summit</a> of its leaders, which will be hosted <a class="link--external" href="https://www.chinadailyasia.com/hk/article/615887" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by China</a> this autumn in Tianjin.</p>
<p>On June 13, Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign on Iran that targeted military and nuclear sites as well as residential areas, and killed senior military commanders, nuclear scientists and civilians. The attacks began days before a planned meeting between Tehran and Washington aimed at reviving nuclear negotiations. The US, which had been in talks with Iran since April 12, joined Israel in carrying out its own strikes on June 22, targeting Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz. Iranian authorities say the Israeli strikes killed at least 1,060 people.</p>
<p>Addressing the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers today, Dar said: ‚ÄúWe have strongly condemned the unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran and the US strikes on its nuclear facilities. Such illegal actions directed against SCO member states are unacceptable.‚Äù</p>
<p>Continuing his criticism of Israel, he said: ‚ÄúIsrael has shown a reckless disregard for international norms and humanity through its relentless and disproportionate use of force in Gaza, resulting in the death of tens of thousands of civilians causing the worst humanitarian crisis in Gaza. We call for immediate halt to Israel‚Äôs atrocities. The only viable remedy to Palestine dispute is the realisation of two-state solution which includes the establishment of Palestine as a viable, secure and contiguous state on the basis of pre-1967 borders with Al Quds as its capital.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUnilateral and illegal measures to change the status of disputed territories in violation of UN Security Council resolutions must be strongly condemned and opposed by all.‚Äù</p>

<p>Dar said Pakistan was ‚Äúincreasingly concerned at the trends of using aggression as a tool of policy.‚Äù</p>
<p>Instead, he called for the resolution of longstanding disputes through peaceful means, dialogue, diplomacy and according to the principles of international law, justice and fairness.</p>

<p>On regional issues, FM Dar said Pakistan sought a relationship of peace and stability with all its neighbours.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, the last three months witnessed extremely disturbing developments in South Asia. It is most unfortunate that the attribution of the Pahalgam Attack to Pakistan ‚Äî without a credible investigation or verifiable evidence ‚Äî brought the two nuclear-armed states to the brink of a major conflict. In the wake of mounting tensions, Pakistan‚Äôs restrained and responsible approach was met with legal transgressions, rhetorical belligerence, and strategic recklessness.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan remains steadfast in its commitment to the ceasefire and the cultivation of a stable regional equilibrium. However, we cannot accept that the arbitrary use of force is normalised. We believe that disputes and differences are resolved through dialogue and diplomacy, instead of conflict and coercion. In that backdrop, initiation of a comprehensive and structured dialogue can meaningfully address the full spectrum of issues that have long bedevilled the peace and security in South Asia. Strict adherence to bilateral agreements would be equally important in this regard.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said the events unfolding in the region since the April 22 terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam reaffirmed a ‚Äúcentral truth‚Äù of South Asian geopolitics: the peaceful settlement of longstanding unresolved disputes was ‚Äúimperative for an enduring peace‚Äù in the region.</p>
<p>Dar added that enduring peace and stability in Afghanistan also constituted a cornerstone of the SCO members‚Äô shared aspiration. He pointed out that the revival of the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group could serve as a valuable platform for pragmatic and results-oriented cooperation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTerrorism is the common concern of humanity that threatens global security. All forms of terrorism, including state terrorism are condemnable. We must shun the use of terrorism for political purposes and combat this menace through a cooperative approach, including addressing its root causes.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said the SCO was a vital platform for realising the benefits of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), pointing out that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a flagship BRI project, not only supplemented the SCO‚Äôs vision of regional connectivity and economic integration but also complemented its common objective of shared development and prosperity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe need to take concrete steps within existing SCO‚Äôs mechanisms for trade and development and promote the use of national currencies for mutual settlement within SCO region to avoid international financial shocks. We support the proposal to create SCO alternative development funding mechanism to give needed impetus to various stalled development initiatives.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs the permanent chair of the SCO‚Äôs Special Working Group dedicated to combatting poverty, Pakistan is fully committed to providing the necessary momentum to our collaborative endeavours to address poverty.‚Äù</p>
<p>Dar called on the SCO members to also collectively address the ‚Äúexistential threat‚Äù of climate change.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúAt a time when the global order is experiencing profound challenges, SCO has emerged as a stabilising force. Its inclusive approach underscoring the sovereign equality of states and seeking peaceful resolutions to disputes, offers a compelling alternative to aggression, confrontation and zero-sum rivalries. The SCO‚Äôs commitment to consensus, development, and mutual respect is a beacon of hope for building a better and equitable world.‚Äù</p>
<p>Stressing Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to the organisation and its principles, Dar said: ‚ÄúIn our pursuit to peace and security, we believe in non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, non-use of force or threat of its use in international relations, as well as seeking no unilateral military superiority in the region.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a post on X after the meeting, Dar said: ‚ÄúAt the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers meeting today, we reaffirmed our shared commitment to multilateralism, mutual respect and regional stability. The Shanghai Spirit continues to guide us towards dialogue, mutual trust and the pursuit of a more just and inclusive international order.‚Äù</p>
