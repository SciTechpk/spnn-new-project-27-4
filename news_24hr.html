            <p><p>Nasa retiree turned private astronaut Peggy Whitson was launched on the fifth flight to orbit of her career early on Wednesday, joined by crewmates from India, Poland and Hungary heading for their countries’ first visit to the International Space Station (ISS).</p>
<p>The astronaut team lifted off from Nasa’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, at about 2:30am EDT (11:30am PKT), beginning the latest mission organized by Texas-based startup Axiom Space in partnership with Elon Musk’s rocket venture <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918299">SpaceX</a>.</p>
<p>The four-member crew was carried aloft on a towering SpaceX launch vehicle consisting of a Crew Dragon capsule perched atop a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
<p>Live video showed the towering spacecraft streaking into the night sky over Florida’s Atlantic coast trailed by a brilliant yellowish plume of fiery exhaust.</p>

<p>Cameras inside the crew compartment beamed footage of the four astronauts strapped into their pressurized cabin, seated calmly side by side in helmeted white-and-black flight suits as their spacecraft soared toward space.</p>
<p>“We’ve had an incredible ride uphill,” Whitson radioed back to the SpaceX mission control near Los Angeles as Falcon’s upper stage delivered the crew capsule to its preliminary orbit about nine minutes after launch.</p>
<p>Dubbed “Grace” by the Axiom crew, the newly built Crew Dragon launched on Wednesday was making its debut flight as the fifth vehicle of its kind in the SpaceX capsule fleet.</p>
<p>It also marked the first Crew Dragon flight since Musk briefly threatened to decommission the spacecraft after United States President Donald Trump threatened to cancel Musk’s government contracts in a high-profile political <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915756">feud</a> earlier this month.</p>

<p>Axiom 4’s autonomously operated Crew Dragon was expected to reach the ISS after a flight of about 28 hours, then dock with the outpost as the two vehicles soar together in orbit some 400 kilometres above Earth.</p>
<p>If all goes according to plan, the Axiom 4 crew will be welcomed aboard the orbiting space laboratory Thursday morning by its seven current resident occupants — three astronauts from the US, one from Japan and three cosmonauts from Russia.</p>
<p>Whitson, 65, and her three Axiom 4 crewmates — Shubhanshu Shukla, 39, of India, Sawosz Uznaski-Winiewski, 41, of Poland, and Tibor Kapu, 33, of Hungary — are slated to spend 14 days aboard the space station conducting microgravity research.</p>
<p>The mission stands as the fourth such flight since 2022 arranged by Axiom as the Houston-headquartered company builds on its business of putting astronauts sponsored by private companies and foreign governments into Earth orbit.</p>
<p>For India, Poland and Hungary, the launch marked a return to human spaceflight after more than 40 years and the first mission to send their astronauts to the ISS.</p>
<p>The Axiom 4 participation of Shukla, an Indian air force pilot, is seen by India’s own space program as a kind of precursor to the debut crewed mission of its Gaganyaan orbital spacecraft, planned for 2027.</p>
<p>The Axiom 4 crew is led by Whitson, who retired from Nasa in 2018 after a pioneering career that included becoming the US space agency’s first female chief astronaut, and the first woman to command an ISS expedition.</p>
<p>Now a consultant and director of human spaceflight for Axiom, she has logged 675 days in space, a US record, during three Nasa missions and a fourth flight to space as commander of the Axiom 2 mission in 2023.</p>

<p>Wednesday’s blast-off marked SpaceX’s 18th human spaceflight since Musk’s privately funded rocket company ushered in a new era for Nasa five years ago, providing American astronauts their first rides to space from US soil since the end of the space shuttle era in 2011.</p>
<p>Axiom, a nine-year-old venture co-founded by Nasa’s former ISS program manager, is one of a handful of companies developing a commercial space station of its own intended to eventually replace the ISS, which Nasa expects to retire around 2030.</p>
<p>Nasa, besides furnishing the launch site at Cape Canaveral, assumes responsibility for astronauts venturing to the space station once they rendezvous with the orbiting outpost.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920005/us-strikes-failed-to-destroy-irans-nuclear-sites-intelligence-report-says' target='_blank'><strong>US strikes failed to destroy Iran’s nuclear sites, intelligence report says</strong></a>
            <p><p>US airstrikes did not destroy Iran’s nuclear capability and only set it back by a few months, according to a preliminary US intelligence assessment, as a shaky <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919798">ceasefire</a> brokered by US President Donald Trump took hold between Iran and Israel.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, both Iran and Israel signaled that the air war between the two nations had ended, at least for now, after Trump publicly scolded them for violating a ceasefire he announced at 5am GMT (10am PKT).</p>
<p>As the two countries lifted civilian restrictions after 12 days of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">war</a> — which the US joined with an attack on Iran’s uranium-enrichment facilities — each sought to claim victory.</p>
<p>Trump said over the weekend that the US deployment of 30,000-pound bombs had “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842#:~:text=The%20US%20strikes%20included%2014%20bunker%2Dbuster%20bombs%2C%20more%20than%20two%20dozen%20submarine%2Dlaunched%20Tomahawk%20missiles%20and%20over%20125%20military%20aircraft%2C%20the%20top%20general%20added.">obliterated</a>” Iran’s nuclear programme.</p>
<p>But that claim appeared to be contradicted by an initial assessment by one of his administration’s intelligence agencies, according to three people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>One of the sources said Iran’s enriched uranium stocks had not been eliminated, and the country’s nuclear programme, much of which is buried deep underground, may have been set back only a month or two.</p>
<p>Iran says its nuclear research is for civilian energy production.</p>
<p>The White House said the intelligence assessment was “flat out wrong”.</p>
<p>According to the report, which was produced by the Defence Intelligence Agency, the strikes sealed off the entrances to two of the facilities, but did not collapse underground buildings, said one of the people familiar with its findings.</p>
<p>Some centrifuges still remained intact after the attacks, the <em>Washington Post</em> said, citing an unnamed person familiar with the report.</p>
<p>Trump’s administration told the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday that its weekend strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities had “degraded” Iran’s nuclear programme, short of Trump’s earlier assertion that the facilities had been “obliterated”.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that the attack on Iran had removed the threat of nuclear annihilation and was determined to thwart any attempt by Tehran to revive its weapons programme.</p>
<p>“We have removed two immediate existential threats to us: the threat of nuclear annihilation and the threat of annihilation by 20,000 ballistic missiles,” Netanyahu said. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said his country had successfully ended the war in what he called a “great victory,” according to Iranian media.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian also told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that Tehran was ready to resolve differences with the US, according to official news agency <em>IRNA</em>.</p>
<p>Israel launched the surprise air war on June 13, attacking Iranian nuclear facilities and killing top military <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">commanders</a> in the worst blow to the Islamic Republic since the 1980s war with Iraq.</p>
<p>Iran, which denies trying to build nuclear weapons, retaliated with barrages of missiles on Israeli military sites and cities.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#great-victory" id="great-victory" title="Permalink"></a>‘Great victory’</h2>
<p>Israel’s military lifted restrictions on activity across the country at 8pm local time (10pm PKT), and officials said Ben Gurion Airport, the country’s main airport near Tel Aviv, had reopened.</p>
<p>Iran’s airspace likewise will be reopened, state-affiliated <em>Nournews</em> reported.</p>
<p>A White House official said Trump brokered the ceasefire deal with Netanyahu, and other administration officials were in touch with the Iranian government.</p>
<p>The truce appeared fragile: Both Israel and Iran took hours to acknowledge they had accepted the ceasefire and accused each other of violating it.</p>
<p>Trump scolded both sides but aimed especially stinging criticism at Israel, telling the close US ally to “calm down now.”</p>
<p>He later said Israel called off further attacks at his command.</p>
<p>Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, said he told his US counterpart, Pete Hegseth, that his country would respect the ceasefire unless Iran violated it.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian likewise said Iran would honour the ceasefire as long as Israel did, according to Iranian media.</p>
<p>Whether the Israel-Iran truce can hold is a major question given the deep mistrust between the two foes. But Trump’s ability to broker a ceasefire showed Washington retains some leverage in the volatile region.</p>
<p>Israeli armed forces chief of staff Eyal Zamir said a “significant chapter” of the conflict had concluded but the campaign against Iran was not over. He said the military would refocus on its war against Hamas in Gaza.</p>
<p>Iran’s military command also warned Israel and the US to learn from the “crushing blows” it delivered during the conflict.</p>
<p>Iranian authorities said 610 people were killed in their country by Israeli strikes and 4,746 injured. Iran’s retaliatory bombardment killed 28 people in Israel, the first time its air defences were penetrated by large numbers of Iranian missiles.</p>
<p>Oil prices plunged and stock markets rallied worldwide in a sign of confidence inspired by the ceasefire, which allayed fears of disruption to critical oil supplies from the Gulf.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#ceasefire-violations" id="ceasefire-violations" title="Permalink"></a>Ceasefire violations?</h2>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Trump admonished Israel with an obscenity in an extraordinary outburst at an ally whose air war he had joined two days before by dropping massive bunker-buster bombs on Iran’s underground nuclear sites.</p>
<p>Before departing the White House en route to a Nato summit in Europe, Trump told reporters he was unhappy with both sides for the ceasefire breach but particularly frustrated with Israel, which he said had “unloaded” shortly after agreeing to the deal.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to get Israel to calm down now,” Trump said. Iran and Israel had been fighting “so long and so hard that they don’t know what the f*** they’re doing.”</p>

<p>Netanyahu’s office acknowledged Israel bombed a radar site near Tehran in what it said was retaliation for Iranian missiles fired three-and-a-half hours after the ceasefire was due to begin.</p>
<p>It did not explicitly say whether the strike on the radar site took place before or after they spoke. The Islamic Republic denied launching any missiles and said Israel’s attacks had continued for an hour-and-a-half beyond the time the truce was meant to start.</p>
<p>“Who mediated or how it happened doesn’t matter,” said Reza Sharifi, 38, heading back to Tehran from Rasht on the Caspian Sea, where he had fled with his family.</p>
<p>“The war is over. It never should have started in the first place.”</p></p>
