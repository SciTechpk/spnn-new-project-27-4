                <h2>US hopes that India‚Äôs response to Pahalgam attack doesn‚Äôt lead to broader regional conflict: Vance</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday Washington hoped that India‚Äôs response to the recent attack in occupied Kashmir does not lead to a broader regional conflict.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">civilian</a> and military leadership have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">rejected</a> the accusation and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur hope here is that India responds to this terrorist attack in a way that doesn‚Äôt lead to a broader regional conflict,‚Äù Vance said in an <a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6372190741112" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> on <em>Fox News</em>‚Äô ‚ÄòSpecial Report with Bret Baier‚Äô show.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd we hope, frankly, that Pakistan, to the extent that they‚Äôre responsible, cooperates with India to make sure that the terrorists sometimes operating in their territory are hunted down and dealt with,‚Äù Vance added.</p>
<p>Top US leaders, including President Donald Trump, have condemned the attack, calling it ‚Äúterror‚Äù and ‚Äúunconscionable,‚Äù while expressing support for India without directly blaming Pakistan.</p>
<p>India is an important US partner as Washington aims to counter China‚Äôs rising influence. Pakistan remains Washington‚Äôs ally even as its importance diminished after the 2021 US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1643653">withdrawal</a> from neighbouring Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In recent days, Washington <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907094/us-in-touch-with-india-and-pakistan-urges-work-toward-responsible-solution">urged</a> India and Pakistan to work with each other to de-escalate tensions and arrive at a ‚Äúresponsible solution.‚Äù India has blamed Pakistan for the attack. Islamabad denies responsibility and is calling for a neutral probe.</p>
<p>The US State Department has said it was in touch with the nuclear-armed neighbours at multiple levels and Secretary of State Marco Rubio held calls on Wednesday with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis government is in constant communication,‚Äù State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters at her daily news briefing</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are asking for a responsible resolution from both parties.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs the President articulated to Prime Minister Modi last week, the US stands strong with India against terrorism, and Prime Minister Modi has our full support,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>Bruce said Secretary Rubio encouraged both countries to work toward a responsible solution that maintains long-term peace and regional stability in South Asia.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe continue to be in touch with the governments of both countries, as I mentioned, at multiple levels.‚Äù</p>
<p>Hindu nationalist Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1907470">vowed</a> to punish those responsible and Jaishankar has told Rubio that the perpetrators should be brought to justice. Pakistan says military action by India was imminent.</p>
<p>After the attack, India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274">suspended</a> the Indus Water Treaty, and both countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907663#:~:text=PAF%E2%80%99s%20prompt%20response.-,Airspace%20concerns,-With%20tensions%20running">closed airspace</a> to each other‚Äôs airlines.

<p>Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations, Asim Iftikhar Ahmad met UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday and discussed the latest developments in the region.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe discussion focused on the evolving security situation in South Asia as well as the imperative of de-escalation and the efforts being made to that effect,‚Äù a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PakistanUN_NY/status/1918037479095189670" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> issued by the Pakistan Mission to the UN said.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric was asked at a UN briefing whether Guterres planned on travelling to India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Dujarric replied that the UN chief had offered his good offices during his phone calls to PM Shehbaz and Jaishankar in the wake of the attack.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo I don‚Äôt think there would be any travel until there‚Äôs a clear message that, as in any instance where we have high tensions between two countries, that they‚Äôve both accepted his good offices,‚Äù he added.</p></p>

‚Ä¢ Govt orders religious seminaries to shut for 10 days<br />
‚Ä¢ Sections of Karachi, Lahore airspace will remain closed for eight hours daily throughout the month of May</p>
<p>MUZAFFARABAD / RAWALPINDI: With the threat of an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">Indian escalation</a> looming over Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), its prime minister indicated on Thursday that his government was considering imposing an emergency in the territory if something untoward happens.</p>
<p>Also on Thursday, authorities stopped tourists from entering Neelum Valley and other sensitive areas near the Line of Control (LoC) in view of the security situation.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>The government has ordered all religious seminaries in the region to remain closed for 10 days, while the owners of hotels, guesthouses, restaurants, and marriage halls have pledged to place their establishments at the military‚Äôs disposal in case India launches an attack.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pakistan announced that certain sections of airspace over the two largest cities ‚Äî Karachi and Lahore ‚Äî will remain closed for eight hours a day throughout the month of May.</p>
<p>In addition, flights to and from destinations in Gilgit-Baltistan continued to face disruptions due to the closure of airspace in that region.</p>
<p><strong>Preparedness plans</strong></p>
<p>Speaking during a session of the Legislative Assembly on Thursday, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq said his administration was monitoring the situation on the Indian frontier.</p>
<p>He assured the House that his government had made arrangements to ensure the availability of food, medicines, and other basic necessities in the 13 constituencies located along the LoC.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have established an Emergency Response Fund and transferred Rs1bn into it‚Ä¶ arrangements have been made to ensure food, medicines, and other essential supplies,‚Äù he said, adding that administrations and residents in the border areas had been directed to stock rations for two months.</p>
<p>In addition, official and private machinery was being deployed to keep roads open in the LoC constituencies of Neelum, Jhelum, Poonch, Haveli, Kotli and Bhimber.</p>
<p>Additionally, the State Disaster Management Authority, Rescue 1122, and Civil Defence had been directed to remain prepared for any emergency.</p>
<p>Stating that India had been exposed before the world as a terrorist state, Mr Haq urged the nation to remain vigilant, warning that the ‚Äúvile adversary could resort to any ghastly act.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI assure you that if India commits any kind of aggression, the government, the people, and all political and religious parties and leaders are fully prepared to respond to its aggressive designs,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Mr Haq added that Indian occupation forces had resorted to unprovoked firing along the LoC on Thursday and had been given a strong and timely response by the army.</p>
<p>Later in the day, PM Haq hosted a multi-party meeting at his official residence, where participants, including leaders from outside the Legislative Assembly, ren¬≠ewed the resolve to teach India a befitting lesson in the event of any aggression.</p>
<p><strong>Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>Also on Thursday, authorities began stopping tourists from entering the Neelum Valley and other sensitive areas near the LoC.</p>
<p>Many visitors who were unaware of the fresh restrictions were turned back from the Marbal checkpost, and even AJK residents who were not local to these areas were stopped from proceeding further.</p>
<p>In Leepa Valley, officials advised residents to avoid areas near the LoC and urged them to cooperate with law enforcement agencies to ensure their safety.</p>
<p>Separately, the government ordered all religious seminaries to remain closed for 10 days, citing a heatwave.</p>
<p>However, official sources indicated that the decision was based on intelligence rep¬≠orts suggesting India mi¬≠ght target such institutions, under the pretext</p>
<p>of hitting militant training centres. ‚ÄúWe are dealing with such a cunning, cruel, and conspiratorial enemy that no vile act can be ruled out,‚Äù said Minister for Law Mian Abdul Waheed.</p>
<p>In a related development, the Joint Action Committee of Hotels, Guesthouses, Restaurants, and Marriage Halls of AJK held an emergency meeting to express solidarity with the army.</p>
<p>Chaired by Raja Ilyas, the meeting included members from Kotli, Mirpur, Bagh, Rawalakot, and Neelum, some of whom joined via video link.</p>
<p>Participants pledged to hand over their establishments to the Pakistan Army through the AJK prime minister if India launched an attack.</p>
<p><strong>Airspace closures</strong></p>
<p>Pakistan has also decided to close certain sections of the airspace over Karachi and Lahore between 8am and 4pm (local time) for the month of May ‚Äúdue to operational reasons‚Äù.</p>
<p>The restrictions will not be applicable on Sundays.</p>
<p>New Delhi had earlier closed its airspace to Pakistani planes on Wed¬≠nesday, a few days after Islamabad banned Indian planes from overflying.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAffected routes are located between flight levels 9,000 and 25,000 feet,‚Äù according to the latest Notice to Airmen (Notam) issued by the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA).</p>
<p>The decision affects selected corridors within the FIRs rather than a complete shutdown, and is being implemented as a precautionary security measure, officials added.</p>
<p>Although authorities say the closure will not significantly disrupt commercial flight operations, as aircraft will be rerouted via alternative flight paths during the restricted hours, these hours are considered peak times for domestic flights.</p>
<p>The closure comes in addition to restrictions already in place in the skies over Gilgit-Baltistan, as PIA flights from Islamabad to Gilgit-Skardu were cancelled for a second day on Thursday. The airspace was unavailable between 1:30am and 10pm on Thursday.</p>
<p>Separately, rain and windstorms in northern parts of Pakistan disrupted the flight schedule, with as many as five international and domestic flights delayed and diverted to other cities due to bad weather in Islamabad.</p>
