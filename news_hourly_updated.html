            </a>
            <p><p>A search operation for tourists who went missing after rain-induced floods in Gilgit-Baltistan‚Äôs (GB) Babusar area concluded on Monday after 14 days, while their funeral prayers were held in absentia.</p>
<p>Pakistan has been grappling with severe flooding caused by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">glacial lake outburst floods</a> (Glofs) and intense monsoon rains since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919360">June</a>. These extreme weather events have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930">resulted</a> in several deaths and injuries across the country, with the GB region among the hardest hit.</p>
<p>After deadly floods <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> across GB‚Äôs Babusar area on July 21, the deaths of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=Seven%20deaths%20were%20reported%20from%20Babusar">seven people</a> had been confirmed but 12 remained missing. Besides the missing, the region‚Äôs death toll <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20so%20far%2C%2010%20fatalities%20and%20four%20injuries%20have%20been%20reported">stands at 10</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Firaq said, ‚ÄúThe funeral prayers of the missing persons were offered in absentia in Babusar.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that the search operation on Babusar Highway, which had continued for 14 days, has now ended. ‚ÄúAll vehicles have been removed from the debris, but no trace of the missing persons could be found,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚Äú[The] hopes of the missing persons being rescued in the flood-hit area have been dashed,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Last week, the GB government had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927377/gb-govt-promises-to-compensate-flood-affected-people-says-rehabilitation-work-underway">intensified</a> the search operations on Babusar Highway.</p>
<p>Diamer police, GB Scouts, Pakistan Army personnel, Rescue 1122 and local volunteers took part in the search efforts. Drone camps, modern equipment, sniffer dogs, technical mechanisms, heavy machinery and human resources were used for the operation.</p>

<p>According to Ghizer Rescue 1122‚Äôs media coordinator, Shakraiz, a lightning strike washed away the road connecting the flood-hit area on the evening of July 31, causing five members of a family to be stranded on the other side of a river in Gopus Khatam village.</p>
<p>‚ÄúToday, the team rescued all the members and moved them to a safe place by boat,‚Äù Shakraiz told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFood was also delivered to other affected families during the operation. Sixty-two houses, water supply and electricity systems, along with health and education centres, were severely affected by the flood in the Ishkoman and Gopus valleys of Ghizer.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to local political leader Zafar Muhammad Shadamkhel, lightning struck at eleven places simultaneously, causing severe damage to houses, buildings, schools, roads and power plants. He added that 600 people have been deprived of drinking water.</p>
<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927955">cloudburst-induced floods</a> in Ghizer and Hunza districts caused significant damage to the irrigation channel in Ghalapan village in upper Hunza‚Äôs Gojal, which provides water for over 50,000 forest trees, according to residents.</p>

                <h2>PM Shehbaz chairs high-level meeting in Gilgit to review monsoon damages</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) on Monday and chaired a high-level meeting to review the flood damages from the recent monsoon rains and distribute relief funds to the affected people.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate cha¬≠nge became more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921009/at-least-8-dead-13-injured-in-rain-related-incidents-across-gb-punjab-and-sindh-officials#:~:text=two%20sisters%20died%20after%20being%20swept%20away">late June</a>. Situation worsened when deadly floods <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20so%20far%2C%2010%20fatalities%20and%20four%20injuries%20have%20been%20reported.%20Seven%20deaths%20were%20reported%20from%20Babusar%2C%20two%20from%20Thore%20Valley%20(Dia%C2%ADmer)%20and%20another%20from%20Astore%20district.">10 people</a>, mostly tourists, have lost their lives, with between 10 and 15 tourists still missing.</p>
<p>Addressing a review meeting on the damages caused by the recent monsoon rains, PM Shehbaz termed the destruction caused by cloodbursts in Diamer and other areas as ‚Äúunfortunate‚Äù. He prayed for those who lost their lives and for the speedy recovery of the injured.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan‚Äôs contribution to global emissions is negligible, but despite this, it is among the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891272">top 10 countries</a> that are facing destruction and losses due to global warming,‚Äù the premier noted.</p>

<p>Recalling the devastating <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1724134">2022 floods</a>, he said, ‚ÄúAfter that, each year such destruction comes in less or greater intensity.‚Äù</p>
<p>In 2022, the country witnessed the most devastating floods in its history, which killed 1,700 people, affected 33 million people, washed away swathes of agricultural lands, and incurred <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1721343">losses</a> worth $30 billion, according to governmental estimates.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz hailed the work of various federal authorities ‚Äî including the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the ministries of communication, water, GB, climate change, and international coordination ‚Äî in assisting with the relief work.</p>
<p>He stressed that he had issued ‚Äúclear‚Äù directives to Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik and his team to work on the matter. He highlighted that Malik has attended various conferences on climate change and secured funds for resilient infrastructure in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Highlighting that the ministry had a key role in ‚Äúmitigating the changes arising from climate change‚Äù across the country, the premier noted that the NDMA was originally established for relief, rescue and rehabilitation work once a disaster strikes.</p>
<p>He recalled that the communication secretary had spent six days in GB as he oversaw the restoration of roads damaged by the rains.</p>
<p>The prime minister vowed to visit GB once the monsoon rains end to lay the foundation stone of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1822414">Daanish Schools</a> he had promised. ‚ÄúWe will also discuss other development projects with you and decide on them,‚Äù he assured the GB government.</p>
<p>He said the solar power project, which he was personally overseeing, had been greenlit by the Central Development Working Party and awaited approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will try to ensure this project‚Äôs completion as soon as possible under my own monitoring.‚Äù</p>

<p>During his day trip, PM Shehbaz held separate meetings with the GB governor and chief minister to discuss the region‚Äôs flood damages, among other matters.</p>

<p>During the meeting, prayers were offered for those who lost their lives in the recent rains and floods.</p>
<p>The governor also updated the premier on the region‚Äôs overall law and order situation. Recently, GB‚Äôs Tangir district witnessed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928201/gb-awami-action-committee-leader-woman-killed-in-name-of-honour">two honour killing incidents</a> within a week, taking the lives of four people.</p>
<p>In his meeting, CM Gulbar informed PM Shehbaz about the rescue and relief activities in the wake of the monsoon rains, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/04-08-2025/pm-gb-cm-discuss-progress-on-development-projects" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Gulbar, an estranged member of the PTI who was backed by the PML-N and PPP during his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1764488">election as chief minister</a>, appreciated the premier‚Äôs decision to establish Daanish schools in GB.</p>
<p>They also discussed the law and order situation in GB and progress on development projects.</p>

<p>The visit comes after PM Shehbaz chaired a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928144">high-level meeting</a> last week to review the monsoon damage, where he reaffirmed the federal government‚Äôs full support for relief and recovery efforts in GB and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).</p>
<p>Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik, Kashmir Affairs and GB Minister Amir Muqam, Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Inter-Provincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, and PM‚Äôs coordinator on GB Shabbir Ahmed Usmani are accompanying the premier.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prime minister will meet with the victims of rains and floods in Gilgit and distribute relief funds,‚Äù <em>PTV</em> said.</p>
<p>In a statement on the occasion, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said, ‚ÄúThe hopes of flood affectees are attached to the prime minister.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGB has faced losses worth more than Rs20 billion due to the worst destruction caused by the floods,‚Äù Faraq highlighted.</p>
<p>As floods and landslides hit GB in late July, CM Gulbar had appe¬≠aled to the federal government for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838">Rs7bn in emergency funds</a> to deal with climate-induced disasters.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCooperation from the federal government plays the role of oxygen for GB,‚Äù the official said, stressing that ‚Äúhomeless people with wrecked houses and eroding settlements were looking forward to remedies for their wounds‚Äù.</p>
<p>Terming PM Shehbaz‚Äôs visit a ‚Äúgood omen‚Äù, Faraq welcomed the premier to the region.</p>
