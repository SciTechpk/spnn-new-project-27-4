                <h2>Two teams to present Pakistan‚Äôs perspective to world on recent Indian aggression: FO</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Two government delegations are set to hold a series of meetings with major world capitals to present Pakistan‚Äôs perspective to the global community on the recent spike in tensions with India, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Monday.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">high-level team</a> ‚Äî consisting of three former foreign ministers, two former foreign sec¬≠¬≠retaries, two former ambassadors to the US, and a serving federal minister ‚Äî arrived in New York yesterday for consultations at the United Nations, the FO said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/visits-of-high-level-delegations-to-important-capitals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> today.</p>
<p>The delegation will also visit Washington DC, London and Brussels, the FO said.</p>
<p>Ex-FMs PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; and Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh¬≠mina Janjua are members of the first delegation.</p>
<p>The group is scheduled to meet UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Gute¬≠rres, the president of the UN General Assembly, and ambassadors of all five permanent members of the Security Council. It will also address a joint session of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation envoys.</p>
<p>The delegation will kick off its engagements on June 3, with planned meetings with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, senior administration officials, lawmakers, think-tank analysts, and leading media organisations.</p>
<p>Another delegation, led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi, will visit Moscow from June 2 to June 4, <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/statement-by-the-spokesperson-regarding-media-queries-related-to-visits-of-high-level-delegations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to the FO.</p>
<p>During the visit, Fatemi is scheduled to hold meetings with senior Russian officials and also engage with the media and think tanks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe visits of these delegations are aimed at projecting Pakistan‚Äôs perspective on the recent Indian aggression,‚Äù the FO statement read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe delegations will highlight Pakistan‚Äôs responsible and restrained conduct ‚Äî seeking peace with responsibility ‚Äî in the face of India‚Äôs reckless and belligerent actions in violation of international law.‚Äù</p>
<p>The delegations will also highlight that ‚Äúdialogue and diplomacy should take precedence over conflict and confrontation‚Äù.</p>
<p>The statement read that the delegations will underscore the importance of the international community to play its due role in promoting a lasting peace in the region, including the immediate resumption of the normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe delegations will engage in a series of meetings with the leadership of international bodies, public office holders, senior officials, parliamentarians, think tanks, media and diaspora,‚Äù the FO said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#strategic-importance-and-not-mere-photo-opportunities" id="strategic-importance-and-not-mere-photo-opportunities" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòStrategic importance and not mere photo opportunities‚Äô</h2>
<p>Separately, Senator Sherry Rehman said that the delegation led by the PPP chairman has already begun its US visit with a ‚Äúpacked schedule of high-level multilateral meetings in New York‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://ppp.org.pk/pr/33976/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, Rehman emphasised that the meetings will have strategic importance and not be ‚Äúmere photo opportunities‚Äù.</p>
<p>She added that the country‚Äôs status as ‚Äúa responsible and stable middle power‚Äù is being highlighted during the engagements, and that the country had a clear interest in ‚Äúregional peace and security‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAdherence to international laws is part of Pakistan‚Äôs foreign policy,‚Äù Rehman said, adding that the ‚Äúfabricated‚Äù Indian narrative against the country ‚Äúwill not be allowed to take the form of truth this time‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia has started using false terrorism allegations as justification for war. This trend cannot be allowed to become the norm,‚Äù she said, adding that the country would not be part of any Indian ‚Äúfilm script‚Äù.</p>
<p>The PPP leader said, ‚ÄúChairman Bilawal Bhutto has successfully presented Pakistan‚Äôs solid position on water, Kashmir and violations of international laws of war and peace.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan, as a responsible nuclear state, believes in a broad and fair dialogue based on peace,‚Äù she added.</p></p>

                <h2>Govt announces four-day Eidul Azha holidays</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The federal government on Monday announced a four-day public holiday on the festive occasion of Eidul Azha.</p>
<p>According to a notification issued by the Cabinet Division, the government has declared a public holiday from June 6-9, 2025 (Friday to Monday).</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prime minister has been pleased to declare the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th (Friday to Monday) as public holidays on the occasion of Eidul Azha,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>Pakistan would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913684">observe</a> Eidul Azha on June 7, the moon sighting Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee (RHC) announced last month after the crescent for the month of Zilhaj was not sighted.</p>
<p>The committee‚Äôs meeting took place on a roof in Islamabad‚Äôs Kohsar Block, where the religious affairs ministry has its office.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference, RHC Chairman Maulana Abdul Khabeer Azad said, ‚ÄúNo testimony of sighting the moon of the month of Zilhaj was received from any part of Pakistan [‚Ä¶]. Therefore, it was decided with consensus that Zilhaj 1, 1446AH would be on May 29, Thursday and Eidul Azha would be observed on June 7, Saturday.‚Äù</p>
<p>He noted that the weather remained cloudy in most parts of the country and clear in some.</p>
<p>Maulana Azad presided over the meeting of the RHC with officials and experts from other departments also gathered to see the moon. Simultaneous zonal meetings of the RHC also took place at their respective headquarters in the provincial capitals to send testimonies.</p>
<p>Dr Mohammad Hasan Ali, director of the Institute of Meteorology and Geophysics at the Pakistan Meteorological Department; Shaukatullah Khan of the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco); and Zainul Abedin from the science and tech ministry were among those present during the meeting.</p>
<p>Celebrated on the 10th of Zilhaj, Eidul Azha marks the culmination of Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam.</p></p>
