            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch' target='_blank'><strong>Army chief joins Trump for ‘historic’ White House lunch</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Trump says he wanted to thank Field Marshal Munir ‘for not going to war’ with India<br />
• US president ‘dismisses’ Modi’s claim that Washington had no role in India-Pakistan
de-escalation<br />
• Insiders say meeting secured via ‘unconventional means’, not diplomatic channels</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he was “honoured” to meet Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir for talks at the White House.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir has now become the first serving chief of army staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. The occasion also marked the first time a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law.</p>
<p>The meeting, which began aro­und 1pm local time and lasted two hours, came hours after the US pre­sident shot back at Indian PM Narendra Modi’s claim that the United States had not pla­yed any role in defusing tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours in May of this year.</p>
<p>Previous military rulers — such as Field Marshal Ayub Khan, Gen Ziaul Haq, and Gen Pervez Musharraf — met US presidents only after they had assumed the role of head of state.</p>
<p>Barack Obama did briefly “walk in” on a White House meeting with then-COAS Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, but that too was not a formal engagement.</p>
<p>When questioned about the meeting in an interaction with the media later, Trump said, “I was honoured to meet him (Field Marshal Munir) today.”</p>
<p>Asked whether the talks included the current Iran-Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917867/israel-iran-launch-new-missile-strikes-at-each-other-as-war-enters-6th-day">conflict</a>, Trump said: “They (Pakistan) know Iran very well, better than most, and they’re not happy about anything. It’s not that they’re bad with Israel. They know them both, actually, but they know Iran better.</p>
<p>“He (Field Marshal Munir) agreed with me. The reason I had him here was that I wanted to thank him for not going into the war [with India]. And I want to thank PM Modi as well, who just left a few days ago. We’re working on a trade deal with India and Pakistan. These two very smart people decided not to keep going with a war that could have been a nuclear war. Pakistan and India are two big nuclear powers.”</p>
<p>White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Trump was hosting Field Marshal Munir after he called for the president to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for preventing a nuclear war between India and Pakistan, <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>
<p>But insiders suggested that the meeting was not arranged through routine diplomatic channels, but rather was the outcome of “unorthodox efforts” by a group of advisers, businessmen, and other influential figures.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources in Washington said this initiative had been cooking for months and kept under wraps until the White House released President Trump’s official schedule on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sources said that deepened counter-terrorism cooperation, engagement with crypto-linked influence networks, and targeted lobbying via Republican-aligned firms in Washington helped Pakistan secure the meeting.</p>
<p>The working lunch saw senior aides from both sides in attendance. Insiders viewed the meeting as a milestone — perhaps a signal of a new phase in US-Pakistan relations.</p>
<p>South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman said the Trump-Munir meeting shouldn’t be seen only through the lens of the Israel-Iran war. “There’s been US-Pak engagement on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903248">critical minerals</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915901">crypto</a>, [and] CT,” he said. “Trump takes a deep personal interest in all of these. And Munir is empowered to talk about it all. Also, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916866/trump-again-offers-to-be-arbiter-in-kashmir-dispute">Kashmir</a>.”</p>
<p>Former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also hailed the meeting as a positive development for strengthening Pakistan-US relations.</p>
<p>The PPP leader, who recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911700">led</a> a high-powered delegation to Western capitals to convey Pakistan’s perspective on the military <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">stand-off</a> with India earlier this year, also pointed to the timing of the meeting as being quite significant.</p>
<p><strong>Trump ‘snubs’ Modi on mediation</strong></p>
<p>Tuesday’s phone call between Modi and Trump on the sidelines of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917316">G7 summit</a> in Canada, which the former attended as a guest, was the two leaders’ first direct exchange since the May 7-10 conflict.</p>
<p>Giving a readout of the call, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917877/modi-maintains-there-was-no-us-mediation-in-ceasefire-with-pakistan">claimed</a> the Indian PM had told the US president the May <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914608">ceasefire</a> was achieved through talks between the two militaries, and not US mediation.</p>
<p>“Talks for ceasing military action happened directly between India and Pakistan through existing military channels, and on the insistence of Pakistan. Prime Minister Modi emphasised that India has not accepted mediation in the past and will never do,” he said.</p>
<p>Misri also said that Trump expressed his support for India’s fight against terrorism and that Modi told him ‘Operation Sindoor’, under which it launched the cross-border strikes, was still on.</p>
<p>A White House official said on Wednesday that Trump had spoken with Modi a day earlier, without providing details of the call.</p>
<p>But later in the day, while speaking to reporters on the White House lawns, Trump insisted that he was the one who stopped the war.</p>
<p>When asked about his meeting with Pakistan’s army chief, he said: “Well, I stopped a war … I love Pakistan. I think Modi is a fantastic man. I spoke to him last night. We’re going to make a trade deal with Modi of India. But I stopped the war between Pakistan and India.”</p>
<p>Referring to Field Marshal Munir, Trump continued: “This man was extremely influential in stopping it from the Pakistan side. Modi from the India side and others. They were going at it — and they’re both nuclear countries. I got it stopped.”</p>
<p>Last month, Trump had said that the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours agreed to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910060">ceasefire</a> after talks mediated by the US, and that the hostilities ended after he urged the countries to focus on trade instead of war.</p>
<p>Reacting to Vikram Misri’s remarks, Mr Bhutto-Zardari tweeted: “Indians are just really very sore losers at this point”.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918019/kashmir-named-among-worlds-most-critical-escalation-points' target='_blank'><strong>Kashmir named among world’s ‘most critical escalation points’</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The <a class="link--external" href="https://www.visionofhumanity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Global-Peace-Index-2025-web.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Global Peace Index 2025</a> has put the disputed region of Kashmir at the forefront of the critical escalation hotspots in the world, where tensions between India and Pakistan remain ‘perilously high’.</p>
<p>The index released by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) with headquarters in Sydney, says the situation in Kashmir exemplifies the fragility of ceasefire agreements in volatile geographic settings and underscores the dangers posed by non-state actors capable of triggering international crises.</p>
<p>The index, a snapshot of the global state of peace, ranked Pakistan at 144, showing ‘low state of peace’ while India ranked 115 position with ‘medium state of peace’.</p>
<p>Ukraine and Russia have been placed at the bottom of the rankings of 163 countries.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Global Peace Index ranks Pakistan at 144, India at 115; says South Asia tensions remain perilously high</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About conflict history and escalation hotspots in India, the index report says the conflict is highly likely in the Kashmir region over the next year.  Applying the escalation-risk indicators to the Kashmir dispute finds it has the potential for rapid deterioration. A four-day conflict ensued from 7-10 May 2025 and was the deadliest escalation betwe­­en the countries in several years.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>A renewed confrontation over Kashmir would involve the two nuclear-armed rivals. Although a deliberate nuclear strike remains highly unlikely, any conventional campaign confined to the disputed territory could still inflict heavy battlefield losses and easily spill beyond the Kashmir region.</p>
<p>The conflict over Kashmir has the potential to substantially escalate or even become a full-blown war. Past triggers like terror attacks and corresponding Indian strikes on Pakistan have been controlled and external actors have placed significant pressure to de-escalate.</p>
<p>There is also a substantial risk of conflicts or increased violence inside India and Pakistan, with the potential for anti-Muslim violence in India or rebel groups like Balochistan separatists or the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan taking advantage of any conflict between the countries.</p>
<p>The Global Peace Index 2025 has pinpointed a set of critical escalation hotspots and regions where conflict risks are accelerating and could evolve into major wars.</p>
<p>According to the index, South Asia, the second least peaceful region globally, experienced the largest regional decline in peacefulness. This deterioration was driven primarily by repressive measures in Bangladesh under the Hasina government, and the heightened civil unrest and escalating internal and cross-border tensions in Pakistan.</p>
<p>This year’s results found that the average level of global peacefulness deteriorated by 0.36 per cent. This is the thirteenth deterioration in peacefulness in the last 17 years, with 74 countries improving and 87 deteriorating in peacefulness. Iceland remains the most peaceful country in the world, a position it has held since 2008.</p>

            <p><p>TRIPOLI/BERLIN: At least 60 migrants are feared dead after a pair of shipwrecks off the coast of Libya over the past week, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).</p>
<p>The first ship went down on June 12 near a Libyan port in Tripoli, with 21 people, including women and children, reported missing and only five survivors found, the IOM said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Those lost at sea included Eritrean, Pakistani, Egyptian and Sudanese nationals. The second wreck took place about 35 kilometres off the port city of Tobruk, with the sole survivor reporting 39 people lost at sea, according to the UN body.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“With dozens feared dead and entire families left in anguish, IOM is once again urging the international community to scale up search and rescue operations and guarantee safe, predictable disembarkation for survivors,” said Othman Belbeisi, the IOM’s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>According to the statement, at least 743 people have died so far this year trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. The deadly route, it said, is  “marked by increasingly dangerous smuggling practices, limited rescue capacity and growing restrictions on humanitarian operations”.</p>
<p>As of June 15, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, migrant landings on the Italian coast were up 15 per cent year on year, with most originating in Libya.</p>
<p><strong>Mediterranean rescue</strong></p>
<p>Maritime rescue organisations said on Wednesday they had pulled more than 175,000  people from the Mediterranean over the past 10 years, as waves of  migrants sought to use the dangerous sea route to reach Europe. The group of 21 NGOS active in the region estimated that at least 28,932  people had died while trying to cross the sea since 2015.</p>
<p>The majority had died in the central Mediterranean — waters between Libya, Tunisia, Italy and Malta — Mirka Schaefer of German NGO SOS  Humanity told a Berlin press conference. In that area, the equivalent of five adults and one child lost their lives every day over the past decade, she said. The number of unrecorded cases was likely to be “significantly higher”, she added.</p>
<p>Of the 21 organisations currently engaged in maritime rescue in the region, 10 of them are based in Germany. Between them, the groups operate 15 boats, four sail ships and four planes. The organisations have frequently clashed with authorities over their rescue operations, which were launched as Europe’s migration crisis broke out in 2015, when hundreds of thousands headed to the continent, mostly from the Middle  East.</p>
<p>In Italy, the current government has vowed to end crossings and attacked NGOs for creating a  “pull factor” that encourages departures, something migration observers say is unproven. Giorgia  Meloni’s hard-right government has passed laws requiring rescue ships to return to a designated port, a measure NGOs say is contrary to maritime law.</p>
<p>“The pressure on us is growing,” Schaefer said, criticising a lack of support from the German government.</p>
