                <h2>Misgivings in NA over haste to oust PTI leaders</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Gohar claims seats ‚Äòbeing snatched through courts‚Äô<br />
‚Ä¢ Law minister distances govt from convictions, asks PTI to take their objections to court<br />
‚Ä¢ Naveed Qamar takes exception to ‚Äòfrequent‚Äô presidential ordinances</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">convictions</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928963">disqualification</a> of the PTI leaders dominated the National Assembly session on Wednesday, as the opposition party protested the haste with which the Election Commission of Pakistan disqualified its members, while the government distanced itself from the decision.</p>
<p>After their conviction by multiple anti-terrorism courts in Punjab in cases linked to the May 9 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">violence</a>, over a dozen PTI national and provincial lawmakers have been de-seated in light of the court decisions.</p>
<p>Law Minister Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar, while speaking in the house, made it clear that convictions were the outcome of a lawful judicial process and asserted that the government played no role in the process.</p>
<p>The opposition members entered the house carrying portraits of lawmakers disqualified by the ECP and sought to speak over the issue. However, they left the hall after NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq denied them permission, saying points of order were not allowed during Question Hour.</p>
<p>After the opposition walked out of the house, the proceedings were suspended on account of the quorum.</p>
<p>After the session resumed, PTI interim chairman Gohar Ali Khan, while speaking in the house, decried the treatment meted out to the former ruling party in the lead-up to and after the 2024 polls.</p>
<p>He said the PTI‚Äôs seats were being ‚Äúsnatched‚Äù through courts and warned that such convictions and disqualifications threatened the democratic process.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He said this was the first time in history that key opposition leaders had been disqualified, adding that the ECP transgressed its authority by disqualifying PTI lawmakers before their convictions had attained finality.</p>
<p>Barrister Gohar Ali Khan claimed the PTI also condemned the May 9 violence ‚Äì in which military installations were also targeted ‚Äî and asked how long this incident would be used to send lawmakers packing.</p>
<p>But Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar responded that it was the domain of the courts to pronounce verdicts. ‚ÄúThis is a lawful process. Objections can be raised, but the forum to do so is also the court,‚Äù he remarked.</p>
<p>He cited the example of Jamshed Dasti who had been given interim relief by the Lahore High Court following his disqualification by the ECP. He said parliament was not the forum to decide the merits of ongoing prosecutions, adding that the constitutional framework required respect for judicial independence.</p>
<p>After proceedings were adjourned, the opposition members exited the house, raising slogans against the convictions and disqualifications. They also staged a protest outside the Parliament House building.</p>
<p><strong>Tiff over ordinances</strong></p>
<p>During Wednesday‚Äôs proceedings, two key lawmakers from the PPP and the PML-N ‚Äî partners in the ruling coalition ‚Äî got into an argument over the frequent promulgation of ordinances.</p>
<p>Before two recently promulgated ordinances were laid before the house for endorsement, PPP leader Syed Naveed Qamar raised objections, saying the unnecessary promulgation of ordinances undermined parliament.</p>
<p>The objection came as a surprise to some, as his own party leader President Asif Ali Zardari is the one issuing the ordinances.</p>
<p>Mr Qamar noted that successive governments had been abusing and misusing the constitutional provision, which allowed the promulgation of ordinances in peculiar circumstances. ‚ÄúThis whole process is anti-democratic and against the spirit of the Constitution,‚Äù he remarked.</p>
<p>Federal Minister for National Food Security Rana Tanveer Hussain, however, defended the ordinances, saying the process was in line with the Constitution and that no ordinance had unnecessarily been promulgated.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>According to the minister, the heavens will not fall by the promulgation of ordinances. He said the house and the relevant committees could suggest amendments to the ordinances.</p>
<p>According to Article 89 of the Constitution, the president may, except when the Senate or the National Assembly is in session, if satisfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary to take immediate action, make and promulgate an ordinance, as the circumstances may require.</p>

                <h2>US stuns India with massive tariff as ties hit new low</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Trump slaps another 25pc on New Delhi, taking rate to a whopping 50pc<br />
‚Ä¢ New import tax to take effect in three weeks, threatens exports worth $87bn; textile, footwear, gems and jewellery sectors hit<br />
‚Ä¢ India rejects tariffs as ‚Äòunjustified‚Äô, vows to protect national interests; Rahul Gandhi calls it ‚Äòeconomic blackmail‚Äô</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday imposed an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, citing New Delhi‚Äôs continued <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928905/trump-says-he-will-very-substantially-raise-tariffs-on-india-in-next-24-hours-over-russian-oil-purchases">imports</a> of Russian oil in a move that sharply escalated tensions between the two nations after trade talks reached a deadlock.</p>
<p>The new import tax, set to come into place in three weeks, will raise duties on some Indian exports to as high as 50pc ‚Äî among the highest levied on any US trading partner.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs executive order imposing the extra tariff did not mention China, which also imports Russian oil. A White House official had no immediate comment on whether an additional order covering those purchases would be forthcoming.</p>
<p>Analysts said Mr Trump‚Äôs move marks the most serious downturn in US-India relations since his return to office in January. The tariffs threaten to disrupt India‚Äôs access to its largest export market, where shipments totalled nearly $87 billion in 2024, hitting sectors like textiles, footwear, gems and jewellery.</p>
<p>It also marks a shift from the warm ties seen during Mr Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs February meeting, they said, pointing out Mr Trump‚Äôs recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927951">remarks</a> calling India‚Äôs economy ‚Äúdead‚Äù, its trade barriers ‚Äúobnoxious‚Äù and accusing the country of profiting from cheap Russian oil while ignoring the killings of Ukrainians in Russia‚Äôs three-and-a-half-year-old <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676939">invasion</a> of its neighbour.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs foreign ministry, usually shy of even contradicting the US, let alone challenging it, was forthright, calling the decision extremely unfortunate and noting that many other countries are also importing Russian oil in their national economic interest.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia will take all necessary steps to protect its national interests,‚Äù it said, adding that purchases were driven by market factors and the energy needs of India‚Äôs 1.4 billion people.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Additionally, Mr Modi‚Äôs National Security Adviser Ajit Doval was due in Moscow on Wednesday to discuss President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs visit to New Delhi later in the year. Reports said he would also discuss the new US tariffs on Russian oil trade with India. The Kremlin described Mr Trump‚Äôs threats as ‚Äúattempts to force countries to stop trade with India‚Äù.</p>
<p>The development comes as Mr Modi prepares for his first visit to China in over seven years, suggesting a potential realignment in alliances as relations with Washington fray.</p>
<p>Oil prices edged up about 1pc on Wednesday after falling to a five-week low in the prior session after Mr Trump penalised India for buying Russian oil and in light of a larger-than-expected US crude storage draw last week.</p>
<p>Last week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned China that continued Russian oil purchases could trigger new tariffs, as Washington prepares for the expiry of a US-China tariff ceasefire on Aug 12.</p>
<p><strong>Blow to Indian exports</strong></p>
<p>Trade between the United States and India ‚Äî the world‚Äôs biggest and fifth-largest economies, respectively ‚Äî is worth over $190 billion.</p>
<p>Exporters and trade analysts warn that the tariffs ‚Äî which Trump casts as a driver to reduce US trade deficits and reinvigorate domestic manufacturing ‚Äî could severely disrupt Indian exports.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is a severe setback. Nearly 55pc of our shipments to the US will be affected, said S.C. Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations.</p>
<p>The increased duties place Indian exporters at a 3,035pc disadvantage versus trade rivals in Vietnam, Bangladesh and Japan.</p>
<p>With such obnoxious tariff rates, trade between the two nations would be practically dead, said Madhavi Arora, economist at Emkay Global.</p>
<p>Indian officials acknowledged pressure to return to negotiations with the Trump administration. A phased cut in Russian oil imports and diversification could be a part of the compromise.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe still have a window,‚Äù said a senior Indian official, requesting anonymity. The fact that the new tariffs take effect in 21 days signals the White House is open to talks.</p>
<p>Another official said there were no immediate plans for Modi or senior leaders to travel to Washington, nor were any retaliatory measures being considered.</p>
<p>Instead, the government is weighing relief for exporters, including interest subsidies and loan guarantees.</p>
<p>A sharp drop in US-bound shipments could drag India‚Äôs GDP growth below 6pc this year, down from the central bank‚Äôs 6.5pc forecast, said Sakshi Gupta of HDFC Bank.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs rupee <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928961">weakened</a> in the offshore non-deliverable forwards market while stock futures fell marginally after the announcement.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄòEconomic blackmail‚Äô</strong></p>
<p>Rahul Gandhi, leader of the opposition in the Indian Lok Sabha, insisted that the 50pc tariffs on Indian goods are ‚Äúeconomic blackmail‚Äù to bully India into an unfair trade deal.</p>
<p>Soon after Mr Trump announced a penalty of another 25pc on India for buying Russian oil, the former Congress president said the prime minister should not let Indian interests be overridden.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPM Modi better not let his weakness override the interests of the Indian people,‚Äù Mr Gandhi said in a post on X.</p>

<p><em>The Hindu</em> carried an analysis showing that Mr Trump‚Äôs criticism of India for its oil and arms trade with Russia, while factually correct, allegedly lacks logic.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia and China are not the only countries that continued purchasing energy from Russia after the Ukraine war began. In fact, data shows that the European Union‚Äôs energy imports from Russia have been higher than India‚Äôs during the war,‚Äù the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Moreover, while India has increased its oil imports from Russia in recent years, many EU countries ‚Äî particularly the Netherlands ‚Äî have been importing large volumes of petroleum products from India.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Further, the US continues to import a variety of goods, especially fertilisers, from Russia.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSingling out a few countries for directly buying oil, while not putting the others who benefit indirectly in the same pedestal, defies logic,‚Äù the analysis said.</p>
