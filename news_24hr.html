            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927202/ecp-disqualifies-3-pti-lawmakers-following-their-convictions' target='_blank'><strong>ECP disqualifies 3 PTI lawmakers following their convictions</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday notified the disqualification of three PTI lawmakers over their convictions in various cases, according to documents available with <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>Last week, a Lahore anti-terrorism court acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi while <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925887">sentencing</a> Dr Yasmin Rashid, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry and others to 10 years in prison over a May 9 riots case related to violence on Sherpao Bridge.</p>
<p>According to the notifications, Chaudhry, member of the National Assembly (MNA) Mohammad Ahmed Chatta and member of the Provincial Assembly  (MPA) of Punjab Ahmad Khan were disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution (a person shall be disqualified from being elected [if] … he has been, on conviction for any offence involving moral turpitude, senteced to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years).</p>
<p>The first notification acknowledged Chaudhry’s conviction in the case ‘The State vs Dr Yasmin Rashid, etc’, reading: “As a consequence, Senator Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhry, has become disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan for being member of [the] Senate.</p>
<p>“Resultantly, Notification No.F.3(2)/2021-Cord. dated 10th March, 2021 to the extent of Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhary, as Senator, is hereby recalled with immediate effect,” the notice added, referring to the document notifying Chaudhry’s seat.</p>
<p>The second notice also acknowledged Chatta and Khan’s 10-year sentences on July 22, but in the case ‘The State vs Zafarullah Khan and others’.</p>
<p>“As a consequence, Mohammad Ahmed Chattha, MNA from NA-66 Wazirabad and Ahmad Khan, MPA, Provincial Assembly Punjab from PP-87 Mianwali-Ill have become disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution … for being members of National Assembly and Provincial Assembly of Punjab respectively,” the ECP notification read.</p>
<p>“Resultantly, notification No.F.2(5)/2024-Cord(1) dated 16th February 2024 to the extent of Mohammad Ahmed Chattha and notification No. F.2(6)/2024-Cord dated 17th February, 2024 to the extent of Ahmad Khan as returned candidates, are hereby recalled with immediate effect.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ah­­med Khan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921937">filed</a> a reference with the ECP against 26 PTI legislators over ‘unparliamentary conduct’ during the assembly’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920928">session</a> on June 27.</p>
<p>The disqualification reference was moved against the same lawmakers who were suspended for disrupting Chief Mi­­nister Maryam Nawaz’s speech and causing chaos in the house.</p>
<p>However, the speaker formally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925367">rejected</a> the petitions following successful negotiations between the government and the opposition.</p>
<p>In 2023, PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1769083">disqualified</a> for five years following his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">conviction</a> in the Toshakhana case.</p>
<p>In a notification, the ECP cited a court order and declared Imran disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution read with Section 232 of the Elections Act, 2017.</p></p>

            <p><p>The finance ministry on Monday projected consumer inflation for July to remain in a range of 3.5-4.5 per cent, citing stable prices and improved supply conditions, as price pressures ease further after the previous fiscal year’s sharp decline.</p>
<p>Inflation stood at 3.2pc in June, the ministry said in its monthly economic report, while average inflation for the fiscal year ending June 30 dropped to 4.49pc, a nine-year low, from 23.4pc the year before. The country’s fiscal year begins on July 1.</p>
<p>The ministry said the economy is expected to sustain its recovery in the early months of fiscal year 2026, underpinned by an improved macroeconomic backdrop and growing investor confidence.</p>
<p>Large-scale manufacturing likely maintained momentum in June, supported by rising private sector credit offtake and expanding production activity, the report said. The rebound is expected to lift imports of raw materials and intermediate goods, while aiding value-added exports, it added.</p>
<p>Strengthening domestic demand, a stable exchange rate, and steady global commodity prices were also likely to boost exports, remittances and imports in July, reinforcing external sector stability, the ministry said.</p>
<p>According to the report, the automobile sector exhibited strong performance during Jul-Jun FY2025, supported by substantial increases in the production of cars (40pc), trucks &amp; buses (96.8pc), and sports utility vehicles &amp; pick-ups (74.6pc).</p>
<p>Cement dispatches stood at 46.2 million tonnes during FY2025, marking a 2.1pc increase over the previous year; however, domestic cement sales declined by 3.1pc to 37 million tonnes, while exports rose significantly by 29.5pc to 9.2 million tonnes.</p>
<p>However, it warned that recent heavy rains could pose risks to agricultural output and supply chains, potentially impacting the inflation outlook in the coming months.</p>
<p>Since June  26, rain‑ and flood‑related incidents have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930">killed</a> at least 266 people and injured more than 630 nationwide, according to the National Disaster Management Authority, adding that 1,557 houses had been destroyed.</p>
<p>Last week, the Asian Deve­lopment Bank (ADB) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926217">projected</a> Pakistan’s economy to grow at a steady pace of 3pc in FY26, even as it lowered growth forecasts for the broader Asian region amid global trade uncertainty.</p></p>

            <p><p>The German Consulate General in Karachi on Monday announced on social media that it will be closed for services to non-EU citizens “until further notice”.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, all services for non-EU citizens have been suspended, including visa appointments.</p>
<p>“All confirmed visa appointments for non-EU citizens for an undisclosed time are cancelled and will not be rescheduled,” the notice read. “Applicants will need to register again via our appointment system.”</p>
