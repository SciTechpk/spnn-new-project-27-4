                <h2>Army chief‚Äôs elevation to field marshal splits PTI</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: There appears to be a split in the PTI over Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir‚Äôs promotion to the rank of field marshal, as its interim chairman Gohar Ali Khan felicitated the newly appointed field marshal as opposed to the incarcerated party founder, Imran Khan, who criticised the government‚Äôs move.</p>
<p>If a message posted on his X handle is to be believed, Imran Khan criticised the promotion in his interaction with lawyers, family members, and journalists during a hearing in the Adiala Jail  courtroom on Wednesday. The tweet was posted on Thursday morning,  however. It may be noted that the PTI leader had also met his sisters and lawyers, including Salman Safdar and Usman Gill, on the jail premises on  Wednesday.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The former premier doesn‚Äôt have access to his X account and someone else posts on his behalf, but the PTI has never revealed the identity of Mr Khan‚Äôs social media handler.</p>
<p>The PTI founder said it would have been more app¬≠ropriate if Gen Asim Munir had been declared ‚Äòking‚Äô as Pakistan was being run according to the ‚Äòlaw of the jungle‚Äô. He quipped that in the law of the jungle, ‚Äúthere is only one king‚Äù.</p>
<p>The harsh stance taken by the former prime minister comes in contrast to his party leaders, particularly Gohar Ali Khan, who also met him in jail on Thursday. Barrister Gohar told a local news channel that Allah has given the honour to COAS Asim Munir and also entailed responsibility. ‚ÄúI request all to improve/normalise the situation of the country,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p><em>Dawn.com</em> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912592">quoted</a> him as saying that there would be a formal statement by the PTI on the development. ‚ÄúThis is why I am saying that the [army chief] has gotten this new honour of field marshal. [We] have congratulated, but after this new honour, there is an increased responsibility on him to play his role even more and make the situation better,‚Äù he told reporters outside the jail as per <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe have no strife with the military. Khan <em>sahib</em> also said yesterday that we stand with our armed forces and whoever is related to the armed forces will be uncontroversial,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>PTI leader‚Äôs sister Aleema Khan criticised the interim chairman, Barrister Gohar, in her interaction with media persons, saying that he gave the statement felicitating the army chief in his personal capacity. The opinion of the party is not the opinion of Barrister Gohar, she added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have given the statement of the founder of PTI yesterday,‚Äù she said, adding that Barrister Gohar could speak for the PTI in the presence of the party founder. The founder clearly said yesterday (Wednesday) that there was ‚Äúa law of the jungle here, it would be better if the army chief gave himself the title of the king‚Äù, she added.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the federal cabinet <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912748/president-pm-decorate-coas-munir-with-rank-of-field-marshal">approved the promotion</a> of COAS Asim Munir to the rank of field marshal for his leadership in the recent conflict with India known as ‚ÄòMarka-i-Haq‚Äô.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄòNo deal‚Äô</strong></p>
<p>A post on Mr Khan‚Äôs X account said the rumours regarding a deal were not correct, but he still invited the establishment for talks for the sake of the country.</p>
<p>The post added Mr Khan did not want any deal or relief.</p>
<p>It was ‚Äúunfortunate that the law only applied to the weak in Pakistan and it was against the principles of democracy and the rule of law‚Äù.</p>
<p>The post also criticised the drone attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and directed the provincial government to register a protest with the federal government and make sure that it was not repeated. He said that the killing of people with drones cannot reduce terrorism.</p>
<p>It added that Pakistan made a lot of efforts to stop drone attacks by the United States, adding that bombs should not be dropped on own people.</p>
<p>As per the post, Mr Khan praised the role of armed forces, especially the air force, which thwarted Narendra Modi‚Äôs attempts to attack Pakistan and suggested they be ready for such actions in future.</p>
<p><strong>Gandapur‚Äôs IMF warning</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur warned the federal government that it could reconsider its cooperation with the federal government over the IMF conditions if party leaders were not allowed to meet the incarcerated leader.</p>
<p>Speaking to media persons outside Adiala Jail after meeting Imran Khan, the CM said the PTI founding leader was willing to initiate dialogue ‚Äúin the best interest of Pakistan‚Äù.</p>
<p>He said that if party leaders were denied access to Imran Khan, the PTI would reconsider its cooperation with the government, including on key issues like compliance with IMF conditions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the PTI spokesperson issued a statement, condemning the delays in scheduling bail hearings in the cases of the party‚Äôs founding chairman.</p>
<p>PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram, in a statement on Thursday, flayed the regime for allegedly subjecting Imran Khan to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSuch oppressive and sinister tactics are destined to fail, as (Imran) Khan‚Äôs spirit remains unbroken and resolute as the entire nation stands firmly behind its leader. PTI will not hold talks‚Ä¶because they (government) did not have legal, constitutional and moral authorities in this regard,‚Äù he claimed.</p>
<p>He emphasised that the government should not trust India and refrain from resuming dialogue until it renounces terrorism, restores the Indus Waters Treaty, and reinstates the constitutional status of occupied Kashmir.</p>

                <h2>No water for Pakistan from ‚ÄòIndian rivers‚Äô: Modi</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ AGP Awan says Islamabad willing to discuss water sharing deal<br />
‚Ä¢ Senate panel slams India‚Äôs ‚Äòprovocative action‚Äô</p>
<p>NEW DELHI: Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, a month after a deadly attack in India-held Kashmir led New Delhi to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">suspend</a> a key river water-sharing treaty between the neighbours.</p>
<p>The attorney general for Pakistan, in an interview with <em>Reuters</em>, responded that Islam¬≠abad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to the decades-old treaty.</p>
<p>The suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, was among a slew of measures announced by India against Pakistan last month after the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> that killed 26 people.</p>
<p>New Delhi had said the attack was backed by Pakistan, an accusation Islamabad den¬≠ied and the nuclear-armed neig¬≠hbours were involved in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on May 10.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack ‚Ä¶ Pakistan‚Äôs army will pay it, Pakistan‚Äôs economy will pay it,‚Äù Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The Indus treaty provides water for 80 per cent of Pakistan‚Äôs farms from three rivers that flow from India but Pakistan‚Äôs finance minister said this month that its suspension was not going to have ‚Äúany immediate impact‚Äù.</p>
<p>The AGP, Mansoor Usman Awan, told <em>Reuters</em> that Pakistan is ‚Äúwilling to talk about or to address anything‚Äù.</p>
<p>He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty.</p>
<p>The treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>The ceasefire between the countries has largely held, with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar saying there is no exchange of fire currently and ‚Äúthere has been some repositioning of forces accordingly‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe (military) operation continues because there is a clear message‚Ä¶that if there are acts of the kind we saw on April 22, there will be a response, we will hit the terrorists,‚Äù Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet <em>NOS</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p><strong>Senate committee</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Water Resources on Thu¬≠rs¬≠day said India‚Äôs actions threatening Pakistan‚Äôs water security were ‚Äúillegal‚Äù.</p>
<p>The committee members warned Pakistan would not tolerate such provocations.</p>
<p>The meeting, presided over by Senator Shahadat Awan, discussed the IWT in the light of India‚Äôs actions.</p>
<p>Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters Mehar Ali Shah briefed the panel on the issue.</p>
<p>He said the treaty was a bilateral agreement between Pakistan and India and cannot be held in abeyance unilaterally.</p>
<p>The committee unanimously condemned India‚Äôs ‚Äúunlawful and unilateral‚Äù declaration of holding the treaty 1960 in abeyance.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis provocative action would lead to a dangerous escalation and direct threat to the water security, agricultural productivity and livelihoods of 250 million Pakistani citizens that cannot be tolerated by Pakistan‚Äù, said the committee in a unanimous statement.</p>
<p>It said the World Bank president had also recently endorsed that the international agreement <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911007/world-bank-president-says-no-provision-in-indus-waters-treaty-for-suspension">could not be held in abeyance</a> by one party and continued.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe committee is of the view that the treaty remains in force and must be implemented in letter and spirit.‚Äù</p>
<p>The members vowed to ‚Äúvigorously defend‚Äù Pakistan‚Äôs rights under the treaty at all international forums.</p>
<p>This treaty is critically important for Pakistan as a lower-riparian state whose food security and agricultural productivity depend on consistent access to these waters, especially given our increasing climate vulnerability and erratic monsoon cycles, the committee observed.</p>
<p>The committee also condemned India‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909191/neelum-jhelum-hydropower-project-shelled-by-indian-forces-dg-ispr">attack</a> on the Neelum Jehlum project, calling the action ‚Äúnothing less than water warfare and aggression‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs weaponisation of the Indus Waters Treaty constitutes a red line for the people of Pakistan and the continued interference with Pakistan‚Äôs rightful water access under the treaty could threaten the recently established ceasefire between the two countries‚Äù, the panel asserted.</p>
<p>The meeting called upon the international community to take immediate notice of India‚Äôs aggression.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe urge all responsible members of the global community to impress upon India, the importance of honoring its international obligations.‚Äù</p>
<p>The panel reaffirmed that Pakistan was committed to a peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues with India, including the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>However, Pakistan ‚Äúwill not compromise on existential water rights‚Äù.</p>
