            <p><p>India will never restore the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Islamabad, and the water flowing to Pakistan will be diverted for internal use, Home Minister Amit Shah said in an interview with <em>Times of India</em> on Saturday.</p>
<p>Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">unilaterally suspended</a> its participation in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">1960 IWT</a>, which governs the usage of the Indus river system, on April 23, shortly after 26 civilians were killed in India-held Kashmir. Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack. The latter has denied the allegations and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe.</a></p>
<p>The accord remains dormant despite a ceasefire agreed upon by the two nuclear-armed neighbours last month following their worst fighting in decades.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned India’s unilateral suspension of the IWT, describing it as a “blatant violation and act of water aggression”, and warned that Pakistan would give a befitting response in line with decisions made at the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting held on April 24.</p>
<p>“No, it will never be restored,” Shah told the daily.</p>
<p>“We will take water that was flowing to Pakistan to Rajasthan by constructing a canal. Pakistan will be starved of water that it has been getting unjustifiably,” Shah said, referring to the northwestern Indian state.</p>
<p>The latest comments from Shah, the most powerful cabinet minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet, reveal Delhi’s intentions as Islamabad’s hopes for negotiations on the treaty in the near term.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Last month, <em>Reuters</em> reported that India plans to dramatically increase the water it draws from a major river that feeds Pakistani farms downstream, as part of retaliatory action.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Pakistan’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to <em>Reuters</em>’ request for comments.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>But it has said in the past that the treaty has no provision for one side to unilaterally pull back, and that any blocking of river water flowing to Pakistan will be considered “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">an act of war</a>”.</p>
<p>Islamabad is also exploring a legal challenge to India’s decision to hold the treaty in abeyance under international law.</p>

<p>Indian-held Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Friday opposed diverting the state’s waters to Punjab and other neighbouring states now that the IWT with Pakistan stands suspended, asking why they should get more water when they already have three rivers while parts of the Union Territory are facing an acute water shortage, India’s  <em>Telegraph</em> reported.</p>
<p>“Nobody will take it. At least I will not allow it as of now. First allow us to use our water, then we will talk about others. There is a drought-like situation in Jammu. There is no water in taps,” Abdullah told reporters.</p>
<p>Abdullah was reacting to the purported central government move to conduct a feasibility study for constructing a 113km-long canal to direct the surplus flow from the three western rivers of the Indus water system, the report said.</p>
<p>“Why should I take water to Punjab? There are already three rivers with Punjab (and the other two states) under the Indus Waters Treaty. Did they give us water when we needed it?” he was quoted as having said.</p>
<p>Omar referred to Punjab’s purported refusal to share water during disputes over the Ujh multipurpose project and the Shahpur Kandi barrage in Jammu in the past. “We were in dire straits then but they kept us waiting for years…. After years, some work was done on the Shahpur Kandi barrage,” he said.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918704/govt-appoints-naveed-asghar-as-acting-wapda-chairman' target='_blank'><strong>Govt appoints Naveed Asghar as acting Wapda chairman</strong></a>
            <p><p>Naveed Asghar Chaudhry has been appointed to the position of acting chairman of the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), according to a notification issued by the Ministry of Water Resources on Saturday.</p>
<p>The appointment of Asghar follows the resignation of retired Lieutenant General Sajjad Ghani earlier in the day. Ghani served in the role for almost three years before stepping down.</p>
<p>Asghar previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1688680/wapda-chairman-charge">served</a> as the interim Wapda chairman in 2022 after retired Lt Gen Muzammil Hussain resigned due to “personal reasons”. He then <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1704577">passed the role</a> to retired Lt Gen Ghani three months later.</p>
<p>He will now serve again as Wapda chairman “for a period of three months or until the appointment of [a] regular chairman […] with immediate effect and until further orders”, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Asghar will take on the position in addition to his current role as Wapda’s Member (Finance) under the Water Resources Division.</p>
<p>Asghar previously accompanied Ghani as he visited the sites of major projects during his time as chairman, such as the construction of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1733578">Mohmand Dam</a> on the River Swat.</p>
<p>In May, Ghani <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909425">visited</a> the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project — located approximately 41km from Muzaffarabad — after the dam site was damaged in Indian attacks a day earlier.</p>
<p>He strongly condemned the attack, saying, “International laws, including the Geneva Convention, do not allow attacking water structures even during a full-scale war.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Also in May, he persuaded the participants of a jirga to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911352">call off</a> a two-week sit-in, assuring them that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had constituted a committee to address the concerns of families whose land had been acquired for the Dasu hydropower project.</p>
<p>Dasu residents also staged protests in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894050">February</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906583/dasu-dam-hit-families-demonstrate-to-demand-land-payments">April</a> this year, presenting various demands, including the immediate release of payments under a relocation package</p>
<p>In April, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904488">highlighted</a> glaring inefficiencies and massive financial mismanagement in key national hydropower projects, in particular the Dasu Hydropower Project and the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project.</p>
<p>The next month, Ghani <a class="link--external" href="https://%20https://www.dawn.com/news/1914256" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed</a> that a number of key targets in the Greater Karachi Bulk Water Supply Scheme, better known as the K-IV Project, had been achieved.</p>
<p>Underlining the importance of the K-IV Project for Karachi, which was formally launched in 2011, he had directed the project team to accelerate construction activities to meet the deadlines.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>However, the project immediately faced a new <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916618">setback</a> this month, as the federal government has allocated only Rs3.2 billion in the budget against the required amount of Rs40bn for the scheme, sparking fears that the city may have to wait for “another 10 years” or more for the completion of the plan.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Pakistani government said on Saturday it has decided to formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize for his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” during the recent India-Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">crisis</a>.</p>
<p>The move by Pakistan was another indication of improved bilateral ties with the US.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/GovtofPakistan/status/1936159807326900577?t=_SkHHZ9STzyca0C7Nrq5_g&amp;s=19" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> shared on X, the government said the international community had “bore witness to unprovoked and unlawful Indian aggression, which constituted a grave violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, resulting in the tragic loss of innocent lives, including women, children, and the elderly”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

<p>Following the Indian aggression, Pakistan “launched Operation Bunyanum Marsoos  — a measured, resolute, and precise military response”, the post read.</p>
<p>It noted that the response was executed to exercise the country’s “fundamental right to self-defence” and “carefully to re-establish deterrence”, defending its “territorial integrity while consciously avoiding civilian harm”.</p>
<p>The post further read that “at a moment of heightened regional turbulence”, Trump “demonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi”.</p>
<p>It continued that the US president “de-escalated a rapidly deteriorating situation, ultimately securing a ceasefire and averting a broader conflict between the two nuclear states that would have had catastrophic consequences for millions of people in the region and beyond”.</p>
<p>“This intervention stands as a testament to his [Trump’s] role as a genuine peacemaker and his commitment to conflict resolution through dialogue,” it added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The government also acknowledged President Trump’s “sincere <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910785/fo-reiterates-support-for-trump-offer-to-resolve-kashmir-issue">offers</a>” to help resolve the longstanding dispute of Jammu and Kashmir between India and Pakistan — an issue that lies at the heart of regional instability.</p>
<p>“Durable peace in South Asia would remain elusive until the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Jammu and Kashmir,” it observed.</p>
<p>The government noted that President Trump’s leadership during the 2025 Pakistan-India crisis “manifestly showcases the continuation of his legacy of pragmatic diplomacy and effective peace-building”.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the post read that Pakistan remains hopeful that Trump’s “earnest efforts” will continue to contribute towards regional and global stability,  particularly in the context of ongoing crises in the Middle East, including the humanitarian <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918018">tragedy</a> unfolding in Gaza and the deteriorating <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917457/iran-state-tv-resumes-programming-after-israeli-attack-on-tehran-trump-reiterates-negotiations?_gl=1*1r5z0it*_ga*QUtLaWptVVNieFVlMFppeHc2Rl9TcWk0SW5zbHpRaGZVMjdfQnhWb3N6SHZvZHE5NjE3Mm5SQjRucVBhOUhCVQ..*_ga_C521GRS8DF*MTc1MDQ1NzIzMC40OC4xLjE3NTA0NTc5ODAuMC4wLjA.">escalation</a> involving Iran.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly said that the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours agreed to a ceasefire after talks mediated by the US, and that the hostilities ended after he urged the countries to focus on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911719">trade</a> instead of war.</p>
<p>However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917877/modi-maintains-there-was-no-us-mediation-in-ceasefire-with-pakistan">maintained</a> in a recent conversation with Trump that the ceasefire was achieved through talks between the two countries’ militaries and not US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912153">mediation</a>.</p>
<p>Governments can nominate people for the Nobel Peace Prize. There was no immediate response from Washington. A spokesperson for the Indian government did not respond to a <em>Reuters’</em> request for comment.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Mushahid Hussain, former chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Defence, suggested nominating Trump for the peace prize was justified.</p>
<p>“Trump is good for Pakistan,” <em>Reuters</em> quoted him as saying. “If this panders to Trump’s ego, so be it. All the European leaders have been sucking up to him big time.”</p>
<p>However, Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s former ambassador to the US, termed the decision “unfortunate”.</p>
<p>“A man who has backed Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza and called Israel’s attack on Iran as ‘<a class="link--external" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-tells-abc-israel-strikes-iran-excellent-warns/story?id=122807155" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">excellent</a>’. This move does not reflect the views of the people of Pakistan,” Lodhi <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/LodhiMaleeha/status/1936331000482603382" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X.</p>

<p>Shortly later, in a <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114717932061341718" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on his Truth Social platform, Trump complained that he had been overlooked by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for his mediating role in conflicts between India and Pakistan, as well as Serbia and Kosovo.</p>
<p>“I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for this, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the war between India and Pakistan, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the war between Serbia and Kosovo, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for keeping peace between Egypt and Ethiopia,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump campaigned for office as a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20what%20I%20want%20to%20be%3A%20a%20peacemaker%20and%20unifier.">peacemaker</a>” who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end wars in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging five months into his presidency.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Trump’s claims for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910973">Abraham Accords</a> being able to “unify the Middle East” have yet to be realised, with war breaking out between Israel and Iran, and no end in sight to the relentless bombardment by US ally Israel in Gaza.</p>
<p>Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize nominations from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years.</p>
<p>He has made no secret of his irritation at missing out on the prestigious award, bringing it up as recently as February during an Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Former US president Barack Obama <a href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home">won the prize</a> soon after taking office in 2009, and Trump complained during his 2024 election campaign that his Democratic predecessor was not worthy of the honour.</p>
