            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926745/fm-dar-says-remarks-about-dr-aafia-siddiqui-taken-out-of-context-vows-continued-support-until-release' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar says remarks about Dr Aafia Siddiqui ‘taken out of context’, vows continued support until release</strong></a>
            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday that his comments in the United States about the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui were being “taken out of context” in the wake of criticism of the remarks by her lawyer.</p>
<p>FM Dar is currently on a visit to the US. Dar spoke at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC, a day ago, during which he had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926640">drawn a parallel</a> with the case of Dr Aafia, who has spent years in a US prison, when responding to a question about former prime minister Imran Khan’s incarceration.</p>
<p>He noted that Pakistan did not interfere in that process because “the Americans had followed their judicial system”. Similarly, he said, Imran was sentenced by Pakistan’s judiciary, which followed the due process of law. “When the due process is followed, others do not have the right to interfere,” he said.</p>
<p>Dr Aafia, a neuroscientist and educator, was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924527">convicted</a> by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on charges of attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan and has been serving her sentence at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Carswell in the US since 2010.</p>
<p>FM Dar’s remarks were criticised by her lawyer as being “idiotic”.</p>
<p>Subsequently, a post by FM Dar on X said: “Yesterday, in response to a question about Imran Khan’s case at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, the reference to Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s case is being taken out of context. During the tenures of PML-N governments, we have consistently provided all diplomatic and legal assistance for Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s release, and we will continue to do so until the matter of her release is resolved.”</p>
<p>He said every country had its judicial and legal procedures, which were to be respected, whether it was Pakistan or the US.</p>
<p>“Our government’s stance on the issue of Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s release is clear and unequivocal.”</p>

<p>Responding to Dar’s comments earlier in the day, Dr Aafia’s lawyer Clive Stafford Smith OBE said: “Sorry but this is idiotic! ‘Due process’ does not equal something where Aafia had no witnesses, they lied &amp; it was all false. That’s called a miscarriage of justice not what’s ‘due’.”</p>

<p>Dar “appeared to be going out of his way to undermine Aafia’s case yesterday by acting like she got ‘due process’ when all she got was torture and a trial in New York when all the real witnesses were in Afghanistan”, he said in a separate post on X.</p>

<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, Smith said: “As you may have seen from the deputy PM’s statement, he was trying to justify what is happening to Imran Khan by using the Aafia Siddiqui case — saying her case is a result of ‘due process of law’ in the US and so therefore it is only something a judge can deal with.</p>
<p>“He goes on to say that disagreeing with a legal verdict against him does not give Imran Khan the right to provoke people to dissent, which should be done through the courts.”</p>
<p>Smith said that in his opinion, “I suspect we can all disagree with what he is saying: in all of the scores of people whom I have exonerated in the US, I have used publicity to help force the system to correct its mistakes, and obviously, in Aafia’s case, I tried to do that through the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866050">clemency process</a> with Biden too.”</p>
<p>He said that FM Dar’s analogy was “unwise as well as misplaced”.</p>
<p>On the PTI founder’s incarceration and legal troubles, he said: “I suspect many people will disagree with the notion that Imran Khan has received anything that approaches ‘due process of law’ in the cases against him, just as we can agree that Aafia is where she is today due to the criminal actions of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), along with others, rather than any ‘due process’.”</p>
<p>He added that FM Dar should not talk about Dr Aafia’s case in the context of Imran’s cases.</p>
<p>“In every instance, Pakistan’s officials need to be towing the consistent line, set out in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s excellent letter to Joe Biden, that no matter what you believe, Aafia has suffered enough,” Aafia’s lawyer added.</p>
<p>He added that he was very optimistic that Pakistan would continue with efforts to secure Dr Aafia’s release.</p>
<p>Speaking on the circumstances of her trial, Smith said: “The defence brought no witnesses to New York, not one.</p>
<p>“The prosecution brought the people they wanted — soldiers who all tried unsuccessfully to tell the same story, and an Afghan interpreter who was promised US residency and given a substantial amount of money.”</p>
<p>He said that the physical evidence solidly disproved the prosecution’s theory, even then, but before trial, the defence did not locate the videotape that proved beyond argument that the holes in the wall were not from Dr Aafia shooting, since they were from earlier that day.</p>
<p>“I have promised to file her appeal in New York in the next week or ten days,” Smith said.</p>
<p>A day ago, PM Shehbaz had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926537">assured</a> Dr Fouzia Siddiqui that the government would continue to provide all possible legal and diplomatic support in the matter of her sister.</p>
<p>On July 12, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had expr­essed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923643">dissatisfaction</a> over the federal government’s failure to submit a report in the case concerning Dr Aafia’s release, health and repatriation, with Justice Ishaq threatening to “summon the entire cabinet” if the report was not presented. IHC Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq on July 21 had issued a contempt of court notice to the entire federal government, including the prime minister and all ministers, for refusing to file an amicus brief to support Dr Aafia’s case in the US.</p>
<p>However, the IHC Registrar Office had on Wednesday put on hold the processing of the contempt of court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925717/contempt-notice-to-pm-cabinet-after-unsanctioned-hearing">notices</a> issued to PM Shehbaz and his cabinet members as the dealing staff decided to ascertain its validity first.</p>
<p>In February, the IHC was told that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1496759">proposal</a> to exchange Shakil Afridi for Dr Aafia was unfeasible. The law officer representing the federal government informed the court that  Smith had suggested the swap, but Pakistan and the US did not have any agreement for such an exchange.</p>
<p>Last year in October, PM Shehbaz had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866050">requested</a> that Biden pardon and release Dr Aafia from jail.</p>
<p>In a letter dated October 13, the prime minister expressed his concerns about Dr Aafia’s “fragile mental and frail physical health” while in prison. “Now 52 years old, she has served 16 years behind bars in the US.</p>
<p>“Numerous Pakistani officials have paid consular visits to Dr Siddiqui … all of them have raised their serious concerns about the treatment she has received,” the letter read. “In fact, they fear she may take her own life.”</p>
<p>Consequently, the US State Department <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867024">declined</a> to comment on the letter written by PM Shehbaz to the Biden administration.</p></p>

            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Saturday said Pakistan was committed to building a secure and prosperous environment in the region with the help of partner nations.</p>
<p>Over the past week, Pakistan has made efforts to expand defence cooperation with other nations. Saudi Arabia’s naval chief <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926301/pakistan-and-saudi-arabia-stress-mutual-resolve-to-strengthen-defence-cooperation">met</a> with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza in Rawalpindi on Thursday, while COAS Munir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926523/china-appreciates-pakistans-role-for-regional-peace-in-meeting-with-coas-munir-ispr">met</a> Chinese senior political and military leadership in Beijing on Friday.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7368" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Islamabad hosted the Regional Chiefs of Defence Staff Conference under the theme of ‘Strengthening Bonds, Securing Peace’ today, attended by senior military officials from the United States, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>The ISPR said COAS Munir formally welcomed the distinguished defence delegations and reaffirmed Pakistan’s steadfast commitment to peace, stability and constructive engagement across the region.</p>
<p>“In an era defined by transnational threats and complex hybrid challenges, the imperative for deeper military-to-military cooperation, strategic dialogue and mutual trust is paramount. Pakistan remains fully committed to working with partner nations to build a secure and prosperous regional environment,” Field Marshal Munir was quoted as saying by the statement.</p>
<p>The ISPR said the session’s participants also discussed regional security dynamics, the evolving security environment in central and south Asia and the necessity of joint training initiatives, counter-terrorism cooperation and coordinated humanitarian responses.</p>
<p>“This landmark multilateral engagement marked a significant stride toward advancing regional security cooperation, military diplomacy and strategic dialogue among participating nations,” the statement said.</p>

<p>According to the ISPR, the conference sought to reinforce security collaborations, enhance training initiatives and exchange the best practices in counterterrorism and other defence and security programmes.</p>
<p>The military’s media wing added that the participants collectively reaffirmed their resolve to uphold peace, respect, national sovereignty and confront common security threats such as terrorism, cybersecurity and violent extremism.</p>
<p>“Participants commended Pakistan’s leadership, hospitality, and initiative in fostering such inclusive and forward-looking defence diplomacy,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p>It further added: “This strategic convergence reflects Pakistan’s enduring commitment to a secure, interconnected and cooperative region, anchored in shared security interests and regional solidarity.”</p>
<p>Pakistan’s role in regional peace was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926499">lauded</a> by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a meeting with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday.</p>
<p>“Pakistan has always played a positive role in global and regional peace,” the Foreign Office had quoted the US secretary of state as saying while the US State Department said he expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s continued willingness to play a constructive role in mediating conversations with Iran and its commitment to preserving regional stability.</p>

<p>Separately, the government conferred the Nishan-i-Imtiaz (Military) award upon Army General Michael Kurilla, Commander of United States Central Command (Centcom), “in recognition of his exemplary service and pivotal role in advancing enduring military cooperation between Pakistan and the United States”, the ISPR announced in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926301/pakistan-and-saudi-arabia-stress-mutual-resolve-to-strengthen-defence-cooperation">statement</a>.</p>
<p>In a formal ceremony held at the Presidency, President Asif Ali Zardari conferred the decoration upon Gen Kurilla, acknowledging his contributions to regional security and his efforts in bolstering strategic defence ties between Islamabad and Washington. Upon his arrival, the Centcom chief was presented with a guard of honour.</p>
<p>“General Kurilla’s visionary leadership has been instrumental in fostering mutual understanding, enhancing defence collaboration, and deepening counterterrorism cooperation between the Pakistan Armed Forces and Centcom,” the statement read.</p>
<p>“His consistent engagement reflects a profound respect for Pakistan’s central role in promoting peace and stability across the region.”</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926722/rawalpindi-court-sends-3-suspects-on-physical-remand-in-alleged-honour-killing-case' target='_blank'><strong>Rawalpindi court sends 3 suspects on physical remand in alleged honour killing case</strong></a>
            <p><p>A court in Rawalpindi on Saturday remanded three suspects to police custody over an alleged murder and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926620">honour killing case of a newlywed woman</a>.</p>
<p>Police had initiated the investigation based on information that a woman had been murdered in the name of honour in Pirwadhai, following a jirga in which members of both families participated. As the woman’s family and in-laws became aware that the police were secretly investigating the incident, the deceased’s husband registered a case with the police under Section 496A. Police sources had said that the case was registered by the husband on the same day the woman was allegedly killed by suffocation with a pillow.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the investigation, as many as eight people, including the gravedigger, the graveyard secretary, the rickshaw driver who transported her body to the graveyard, her husband and family members including her brother, have been detained by police in connection with the case.</p>
<p>Three of the total suspects were present in the court of Magistrate Qamar Abbas Tarar today, according to a court order seen by <em>Dawn.com.</em></p>
<p>The judge approved the investigation officer’s (IO) request for custody, stating: “… Three-day physical remand of the accused for said purpose is hereby granted. Accused persons be produced before the court on July 29.”</p>
<p>In another order from today, the judge approved the application to conduct the exhumation of the victim’s body and scheduled it for July 28 at 10am. The judge directed the Holy Family Hospital’s medical superintendent to depute a medical officer who would arrive at the graveyard for the exhumation and also order the Pirwadhai Police station house officer to designate a guard at the victim’s grave until the exhumation.</p>
<p>The Rawalpindi tehsil medical officer was also instructed to provide sanitary workers for the process.</p>
<p>Separately, the police added Sections 109 (abetment), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender), 302 (murder) and 311  (Ta’zir after waiver or compounding of right of qisas in qatl-i-amd) of the Pakistan Penal Code to the FIR on Friday.</p>
<p>City Police Officer Syed Khalid Hamdani also told <em>Dawn.com</em> that a 10-member team was formed to assist in the investigation.</p>
<p>He said the team included various senior police officials further and IT experts of Rawalpindi Police, who would ensure timely support and the provision of technical evidence to the investigation officer from various institutions.</p>
<p>Hamdani said that the team would also conduct raids to ensure the timely arrest of more suspects in the light of information obtained from those detained during the investigation.</p>
<p>The incident comes a few days after  police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925718">arrested</a> at least 14 suspects for their involvement in the killing of a man and a woman in Degari area of Balochistan’s Quetta, who were shot dead on the orders of a tribal jirga ahead of Eidul Azha for so-called ‘honour’.</p>
<p>The arrests were made after a video of the killing went viral on social media, in which a group of people could be seen shooting the couple.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849480">continued</a> to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.</p>
<p>Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p>
<p>The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.</p></p>
