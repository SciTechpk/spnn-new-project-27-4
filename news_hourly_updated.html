<p>Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/israel-launches-strikes-on-iran">launched</a> an air offensive against Iran on Friday, killing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">commanders and scientists</a> and bombing nuclear sites in a stated bid to stop Tehran building an atomic weapon, which the latter has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a>, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p>

<hr />
<p>Earlier today, Tehran said Israel wanted to ‚Äúdrag the conflict to the Persian Gulf‚Äù after the latter attacked the world‚Äôs largest gas field that Iran shares with Qatar, igniting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours">another</a> round of deadly tit-for-tat missile barrages.</p>
<p>Two missile-like projectiles hit two locations in central Tehran, leading to explosions, the semi-official <em>Tasnim</em> news agency reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>A day after Israel wiped out the top echelon of Iran‚Äôs military command, it hit Iran‚Äôs oil and gas industry for the first time. Iran then partially suspended gas production at the South Pars gas field, which it shares with Qatar.</p>
<p>At least 10 people were killed overnight, including three children, and more than 140 were injured by missiles that had hit homes in northern and central Israel, authorities said, according to <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>Rescue teams combed through the rubble of residential buildings destroyed in strikes, using flashlights and sniffer dogs to look for survivors.</p>

<p>Following the fresh exchange of missiles, Iran‚Äôs Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran does not want its conflict with Israel to expand to neighbouring countries unless the situation is forced, adding its response had been based on self-defence.</p>
<p>Araghchi said Tehran had been responding to foreign aggression, and that if this aggression stopped, Iran‚Äôs reactions would also cease.</p>
<p>The foreign minister said the Israeli strikes on the offshore South Pars gas field that Iran shares with Qatar were a ‚Äúblatant aggression and a very dangerous act‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDragging the conflict to the Persian Gulf is a strategic mistake, and its aim is to drag the war beyond Iranian territory,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p>The foreign minister accused Israel of seeking to sabotage ongoing Iran-US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903561">nuclear talks</a>, which, according to him, could have opened the way for an agreement. Tehran was set to present a proposal this Sunday during a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">sixth round</a> of talks, which were cancelled following recent escalations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIsrael‚Äôs attack would never have happened without the US green light and support,‚Äù Araghchi said, adding Tehran does not believe American statements that Washington had taken no part in recent attacks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is necessary for the United States to condemn Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities if they want to prove their goodwill.‚Äù</p>
<p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/after-sitting-out-the-iran-attack-u-s-steps-in-to-help-israel-intercept-missiles-16749866" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that the US military was ‚Äúoperating in the air, on land and at sea to shoot down Iranian missiles fired at Israel‚Äù. ‚ÄúUS jet fighters, Navy destroyers and ground-based air-defence systems had [been] positioned to help counter any attack‚Äù, it said, citing US officials.</p>
<p><em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/14/israel-iran-war-us-nuclear-program-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Axios</a></em> quoted a US official as saying that Israel has urged the Trump administration to join the war, but said currently the administration was not considering it.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Israel‚Äôs Oil Refineries said its pipelines and transmission lines in Haifa had been damaged by missile strikes by Iran, according to a regulatory filing to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>It said that no injuries or casualties were reported at the sites, with refining facilities continuing to operate despite a shutdown of some downstream operations.</p>
<p>It said it is examining the impact of the damage on its operations and implications on its financial results.</p>
<p>Explosions echoed through Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as missiles streaked across the skies overnight, as interceptor rockets were launched in response. The military lifted its shelter-in-place advisory nearly an hour after issuing the warning.</p>
<p>Israeli media said at least 35 people were missing after a strike hit Bat Yam, a city south of Tel Aviv. A spokesperson for the emergency services said a missile hit an eight-storey building there and while many people were rescued, there were fatalities.</p>
<p>It was unclear how many buildings were hit overnight.</p>
<p>The latest wave of Iranian attacks began shortly after 11pm on Saturday (1am PKT Sunday), when air raid sirens blared in Jerusalem and Haifa, sending around a million people into bomb shelters.</p>
<p>Around 2:30am local time (4:30am PKT), the Israeli military warned of another incoming missile barrage and urged residents to seek shelter.</p>
<p>So far, at least 13 people in Israel have been killed and over 300 others injured since Iran launched its retaliatory attacks on Friday.</p>

<p>Brigadier General Ali Mohammad Naeini, the spokesperson for the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), said in a televised statement that Israel‚Äôs fuel production facilities for fighter jets and energy supply centres were targeted with a large number of drones and missiles, <em>Press TV</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/06/14/749850/Iran-IRGC-attack-Israel-fighter-jet-fuel-energy-sites-missiles-drones" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The IRGC spokesperson also claimed that the IRGC aerospace defense system had ‚Äúsuccessfully intercepted and destroyed‚Äù three Israeli cruise missiles, 10 drones, and dozens of ‚Äúhostile mini-drones in the affected regions‚Äù.</p>
<p>The elite force warned Tehran‚Äôs attacks will be ‚Äúheavier and more extensive‚Äù if Israel continues its hostilities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new commander of Iran‚Äôs Khatam al-Anbia Central Headquarters vowed that the Islamic Republic will keep conducting military operations against the Zionist regime vigorously to make the criminal enemy regret its aggression, <em>Tasnim</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/06/15/3335855/iran-s-operations-to-continue-unabated-until-israel-shows-remorse-senior-general" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>In comments on Sunday, Major General Ali Shadmani underlined that Iran‚Äôs retaliatory military operations against the Israeli regime will continue relentlessly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe chain of military operations by the Iranian Armed Forces that have brought pride to the country will continue in a much more massive and harsh manner than the past until the criminal and aggressive Zionist enemy regrets what it did completely,‚Äù he stated.</p>
<p>Iran said it had <a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1404/03/25/3335833/%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%DB%8C-2-%D8%B9%D8%B6%D9%88-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%AC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arrested two individuals</a> it accused of being members of Israel‚Äôs intelligence agency Mossad in Alborz province while they were preparing explosives and electronic devices, <em>Tasnim</em> reported today.</p>

<p>In Iran, nearly 140 people have been killed since Friday, with 78 on the first day of Israel‚Äôs campaign, and scores more yesterday, including 60 when a missile brought down a 14-storey apartment block in Tehran, where 29 of the dead were children.</p>
<p>Iranians can seek shelter in mosques and schools during Israeli attacks, as well as subway systems, which will be open at all times from tonight, government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani told state TV on Sunday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is no problem with the provision of food, medicine, fuel,‚Äù she added.</p>
<p>The Shahran oil depot in Tehran was targeted in an Israeli attack, Iran said, but added the situation was <a class="link--external" href="https://snn.ir/fa/news/1274102/%D8%A2%D8%AA%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%86%D9%81%D8%AA-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88-%D9%85%D8%AE%D8%B2%D9%86-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%AE%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A8-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AA-%DA%A9%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%84-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">under control</a>.</p>

<p>Three drones were launched toward the Ain al-Asad air base housing US forces in western Iraq following Israel‚Äôs strikes on Iran, the <em>Associated Press</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-iran-war-latest-06-14-2025-19c175edc115d99f0d35c24b38ab1773#:~:text=Drones%20launched%20toward%20base%20housing%20US%20forces%20in%20Iraq%20shot%20down" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>, citing a US military official and a second US official.</p>
<p>The drones were shot down, the officials said. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the report.</p>
<p><em>AP</em> further said that for a second day, supporters of armed factions in Iraq held a demonstration in Baghdad to denounce Israel‚Äôs bombing of Iran but did not attempt to breach a high-security zone where the US Embassy is located.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Germany, France and Britain are ready to hold immediate talks with Iran over Tehran‚Äôs nuclear programme in a bid to de-escalate the situation in the Middle East, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said.</p>
<p>Wadephul, who is on a visit to the Middle East, said he was trying to contribute towards a de-escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran, adding that Tehran had previously failed to take the opportunity to enter into constructive talks.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI hope that‚Äôs still possible,‚Äù Wadephul told German public broadcaster <em>ARD</em> late on Saturday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGermany, together with France and Britain are ready. We‚Äôre offering Iran immediate negotiations about the nuclear programme, I hope ]the offer] is accepted.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is also a key prerequisite for reaching a pacification of this conflict, that Iran presents no danger to the region, for the state of Israel or to Europe.‚Äù</p>
<p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz spoke to Oman‚Äôs Sultan Haitham bin Tariq al-Said on Sunday morning and both agreed it was important that the conflict in the Middle East should not escalate, a German government spokesperson said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe chancellor thanked (the sultan) for Oman‚Äôs mediation efforts towards ending Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme. He emphasised that Iran must never have nuclear weapons,‚Äù the spokesperson said in a statement, adding that both leaders underlined their willingness to help end the conflict through diplomatic means.</p>
<p>Tehran called off <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912795">nuclear talks</a> that Washington had said were the only way to halt Israel‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours">bombing</a>.

<p>A round of US-Iran nuclear talks that was due to be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">held in Oman</a> on Sunday was cancelled, with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi saying the discussions could not take place while Iran was being subjected to Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúbarbarous‚Äù attacks.</p>

<p>Britain could potentially support Israel in its conflict with Iran, but the decision to send additional military jets to the Middle East was made mainly to protect British bases and personnel, British finance minister Rachel Reeves said today.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Sky News</em>, Reeves called for a de-escalation in the conflict and said the decision to send additional jets to the region was a ‚Äúprecautionary move‚Äù.</p>
<p>Asked if Britain would come to Israel‚Äôs aid if asked, Reeves said: ‚ÄúWe have, in the past, supported Israel when there have been missiles coming in.‚Äù</p>
<p>She added: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sending in assets to both protect ourselves and also potentially to support our allies.‚Äù</p>

<p>At the same time, Iran has asked Cyprus to convey ‚Äúsome messages‚Äù to Israel, President Nikos Christodoulides said on Sunday, saying he expected to speak to Netanyahu later in the day.</p>
<p>Christodoulides also said he was not happy with what he said was a slow reaction by the European Union to the unfolding crisis in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Cyprus, the closest EU member state in the region, had asked for an extraordinary meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council, he said.</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#gas-field-attack" id="gas-field-attack" title="Permalink"></a>Gas field attack</h2>
<p>In the first apparent attack to hit Iran‚Äôs energy infrastructure, the semi-official <em>Tasnim</em> news agency said Iran partially suspended production at the world‚Äôs biggest gas field after an Israeli strike caused a fire there on Saturday.</p>
<p>The South Pars field is located offshore in Iran‚Äôs southern Bushehr province and is responsible for the lion‚Äôs share of gas production in Iran, the world‚Äôs third largest gas producer after the United States and Russia.</p>
<p>The strike caused a fire, which has been extinguished, the Iranian oil ministry said. The fire broke out in one of the four units of Phase 14 of South Pars, halting production of 12 million cubic metres of gas, <em>Tasnim</em> said.</p>
<p>Iran produces around 275 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas per year or some 6.5pc of global gas output, and consumes it domestically as it cannot export gas due to sanctions.</p>
<p>Iran shares the field with Qatar, which calls the field North Field. Qatar produces 77 million tonnes of liquefied gas from the field with the help of global majors such as Exxon and Shell and supplies the gas to Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Fears about potential disruption to the region‚Äôs oil exports had already driven up oil prices 9 per cent on Friday, even though Israel spared Iran‚Äôs oil and gas on the first day of its attacks.</p>
<p>An Iranian general, Esmail Kosari, said on Saturday that Tehran was reviewing whether to close the Strait of Hormuz, controlling access to the Gulf for tankers.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>With Israel saying its operation could last weeks, and Netanyahu urging Iran‚Äôs people to rise up against their rulers, fears have grown of a regional conflagration dragging in outside powers.</p>
<p>B‚ÄôTselem, a leading Israeli human rights organisation, said on Saturday that instead of exhausting all possibilities for a diplomatic resolution, Israel‚Äôs government had chosen to start a war that puts the entire region in danger.</p>
<p>Tehran has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916637/iran-threatens-to-target-us-bases-if-conflict-breaks-out">warned</a> Israel‚Äôs allies that their military bases in the region would come under fire too if they helped shoot down Iranian missiles.</p>
<p>Israel sees Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme as a threat to its existence, and said the bombardment was designed to avert the last steps to production of a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>Tehran has repeatedly said the programme is entirely civilian and that it does not seek an atomic bomb. However, UN‚Äôs nuclear watchdog IAEA <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916895">reported</a> it this week as violating obligations under the global non-proliferation treaty.</p></p>
