            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923729/jui-f-chief-fazl-advises-change-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-administration' target='_blank'><strong>JUI-F chief Fazl advises ‘change’ in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa administration</strong></a>
            <p><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Saturday suggested that there should be a “change” in the PTI-led Khyber Pakht­un­khwa government, adding that it would be better if the change came from within the ruling party amid reports of possible efforts afoot to bring a “regime change” in the province.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921763">met</a> two key leaders from the province, ostensibly to get a handle on the political situation. The PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre believes that the PTI government in KP has failed to deliver for over a decade, and recent events have further cemented their conviction that the provincial government is failing to safeguard the lives of the people. Meanwhile, the PTI has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921760/pti-warns-against-attempt-to-topple-provincial-set-up">warned</a> against any attempt to topple the provincial government through constitutional means.</p>
<p>Addressing the matter at a press conference in Peshawar today, the JUI-F chief said, “My advice would be that there should be a change in the province but if the PTI is in the majority, then the change should be from within the majority of the PTI. If the same people come together to bring a change in the provincial government, then it will be better.”</p>
<p>Fazl said he preferred this option rather than the opposition coming together and bringing a change in the government.</p>
<p>He added that it was his belief and that of his party that the majority of the province was “fake” and a product of rigging but it could not tolerate any political struggle or uncertainty, thus it would be better if there was a change from within the ruling PTI.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Speaking on the prevailing security situation in the province, Fazl said, “The common citizen’s life is insecure today.</p>
<p>“If the opposition parties contact us then will we talk to them and also try to hold an all party conference to discuss this issue and come up with a strategy to deal with it.”</p>
<p>Speaking about the merger of Fata with KP, he said, “We strongly opposed the merger when it was being done.”</p>
<p>Fazl said that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922671/pti-muqam-spar-over-ex-fata-jirga-committee">committee</a> formed to bring reforms in ex-Fata did not have representation from KP.</p>
<p>“From all the parties, only we have been asked for representatives for the committee, but we haven’t given our representatives,” he added. The JUI-F chief said that the party would take its decision in consultation with tomorrow’s grand tribal jirga.</p>
<p>“Is this decision an admission of the failure of the previous decision (Fata merger) or another ploy to gain access to the minerals of the area?” he asked.</p>
<p>The JUI-F chief said that if he was content with the federal government’s decisions, then he would have joined them. “Both the federal and the provincial governments were a result of electoral rigging,” Fazl said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi said that the ex-Fata committee was not “about reversing the merger of Fata and the province”.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Peshawar, he said, “The committee was formed when the prime minister and Field Marshal [Asim] Munir visited and a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915208">jirga</a> was held.</p>
<p>“The provincial government said that the jirga system that had ended in the merged districts should be revived, and this is what the committee was formed for.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Pakistan’s Olympic javelin champion Arshad Nadeem and India’s Neeraj Chopra are set to lock horns next month at the Diamond League event in Silesia, Poland, in their <a class="link--external" href="https://www.olympics.com/en/news/neeraj-chopra-vs-arshad-nadeem-record-head-to-head-rivalry-india-pakistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first</a> head-to-head contest since the Paris Olympics, it emerged on Saturday.</p>
<p>The match-up comes amid heightened political tensions between Pakistan and India, which have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923614">spilt over</a> into the world of sports.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://silesia.diamondleague.com/stars-galore-in-silesia-bukowiecka-and-lisek-announce-new-names/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> from the Diamond League, issued on July 9, announced the athletes taking part in the upcoming competition in Poland, including Kenyan middle-distance runner Faith Kipyegon.</p>
<p>The contest between Nadeem and Chopra was described as “the first opportunity for revenge after the Paris Olympics”.</p>
<p>“The Pakistani’s form remains something of a mystery, as he rarely appears on the European circuit,” the press release read. “The exception he will make on August 16 results from his desire to face Chopra.”</p>
<p>The press release noted that Chopra threw 90 metres this spring, adding that he is “yearning for more”. Last week, Chopra <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922485/indias-javelin-hero-chopra-leverages-star-power-as-crowds-flock-to-self-titled-event">headlined</a> the ‘Neeraj Chopra Classic’ — billed as India’s inaugural world-class field competition — and walked away with another gold medal.</p>
<p>In May, Nadeem threw a massive 86.4m to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914503">win gold</a> in the men’s javelin final at the Asian Athletics Championship in Gumi, South Korea.</p>
<p>A day before an April 22 terrorist attack in occupied Kashmir, Chopra had announced that the world’s top throwers, including Nadeem, had been invited to the first Neeraj Chopra Classic. However, the attack in Kashmir prompted heavy criticism of Chopra’s decision to invite Nadeem.</p>
<p>Nadeem ultimately did not attend the event.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923739/syrian-israeli-officials-to-meet-in-baku-diplomatic-source-in-damascus' target='_blank'><strong>Syrian, Israeli officials to meet in Baku: diplomatic source in Damascus</strong></a>
            <p><p>A Syrian and an Israeli official are expected to meet in Baku later on Saturday on the sidelines of Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s visit to Azerbaijan, a diplomatic source in Damascus with knowledge of the issue said.</p>
<p>“There will be a meeting between a Syrian official and an Israeli official on the sidelines of the visit being conducted by Sharaa in Baku,” said the source, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.</p>
<p>Israel is a major arms supplier to Azerbaijan and has a significant diplomatic presence in the Caucasus nation, which neighbours its arch foe Iran.</p>
<p>The diplomatic source stressed that Sharaa himself would not attend the Baku meeting, which would focus on “the recent Israeli military presence in Syria”.</p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1877481">overthrow</a> of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December, Israel carried out hundreds of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1877621">air strikes</a> in Syria to prevent key military assets from falling into the hands of the interim administration headed by Sharaa.</p>
<p>It also sent troops into the UN-patrolled buffer zone that used to separate the opposing forces on the strategic Golan Heights, from which it has conducted forays deeper into southern Syria.</p>
<p>Sharaa has said repeatedly that Syria does not seek conflict with its neighbours and has instead asked the international community to put pressure on Israel to halt its attacks.</p>
<p>His government recently confirmed that it had held indirect contacts with Israel seeking a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922168/syria-ready-for-return-to-1974-deal-with-israel">return</a> to the 1974 disengagement agreement, which created the buffer zone.</p>
<p>Israel has views Sharaa’s government in the context of his past links with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1877606">Al-Qaeda</a>.</p>
<p>But late last month, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel was interested in striking a peace and normalisation agreement with Syria. A Syrian government source quoted by state media responded that such talk was “premature”.</p>
<p>But during a visit to Lebanon this week, US special envoy to Syria Tom Barrack said: “The dialogue has started between Syria and Israel.”</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910971">meeting</a> Sharaa in Riyadh in May, US President Donald Trump told reporters he had expressed hope that Syria would join other Arab states which normalised their relations with Israel.</p>
<p>“[Sharaa] said yes. But they have a lot of work to do,” Trump said.</p>
<p>The Syrian president arrived in Baku earlier today for talks with his counterpart, Ilham Aliyev.</p>
<p>Azerbaijan announced it would begin exporting gas to Syria via Turkiye, according to a statement from the Azerbaijani presidency.</p></p>
