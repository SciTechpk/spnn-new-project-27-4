                <h2>Pakistan unveils first govt-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib has unveiled the country‚Äôs first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.</p>
<p>Saqib was recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913419">appointed</a> as Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Crypto and Blockchain, with the status of a minister of state. He has been on a tour of the United States seeking investment in Pakistan‚Äôs crypto markets.</p>
<p>He made the announcement about the reserve after delivering a keynote address before an elite audience, which included United States Vice President JD Vance, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr, at the <a class="link--external" href="https://b.tc/conference/2025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bitcoin Vegas 2025</a> in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan is no longer defined by its past. It is being reborn as a forward-looking hub of digital innovation ‚Äî powered by its youth, sharpened by necessity, and led by a new generation of tech statesmen,‚Äù said Saqib, in a statement issued by his office.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not just here as a minister,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here as the voice of a generation ‚Äî a generation that is online, on-chain, and unstoppable.‚Äù</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>In his keynote speech, Saqib announced the establishment of a national bitcoin wallet, ‚Äúholding digital assets already in state custody ‚Äî not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signalling long-term belief in decentralised finance.‚Äù</p>
<p>He also thanked Trump for his role as a peacemaker in the recent India-Pakistan conflict and for his commitment to crypto adoption.</p>
<p>He revealed that the government had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913238">allocated</a> 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity in first phase for bitcoin mining and AI data centres, opening doors to sovereign miners, tech firms, and clean energy partners around the world.</p>
<p>The statement noted Pakistan having over 40 million crypto wallets and one of the ‚Äúlargest and most active freelancer economies in the world‚Äù.</p>
<p>It added that Saqib was leading the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912539">creation</a> of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) ‚Äî a regulatory body designed to empower builders, protect investors, and formalise digital finance frameworks for the future.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBoth Pakistan and bitcoin have suffered from bad PR,‚Äù Saqib declared. ‚ÄúBut if you look past the headlines, you‚Äôll see something else: talent, resilience, and vision.‚Äù</p>
<p>He called on global crypto builders to come and invest in Pakistan. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre building something real ‚Äî come build it in Pakistan. Come build wallets for the unbanked. Come tokenise land. Come scale your mission with our youth and our unstoppable grit.‚Äù</p>
<p>During his keynote, Saqib delivered a ‚Äúblueprint for the future of emerging markets in Web3 that positions Pakistan as a tech-forward, youth-powered, and opportunity-rich nation ready to lead,‚Äù the statement concluded.</p>
<p>On February 25, the government had announced it was considering establishing a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897897">National Crypto Council</a> to adopt emerging digital currencies in line with global trends. In March, it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896070">appointed</a> Saqib as the chief adviser to the finance minister on the PCC and later made him the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897964#:~:text=Bilal%20Bin%20Saqib%2C%20who%20was%20recently%20appointed%20as%20chief%20adviser%20to%20the%20finance%20minister%2C%20has%20been%20made%20the%20council%E2%80%99s%20CEO.">council‚Äôs CEO</a>.</p>
<p>According to a press release, Saqib will now be responsible for developing a comprehensive, FATF-compliant regulatory framework for digital assets, launching bitcoin mining initiatives, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, finance, and land records.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Additionally, he will also facilitate ‚Äúlicensing and oversight of virtual asset service providers (VASPs)‚Äù and champion ‚Äúinvestor protection and Web3 ecosystem growth‚Äù in the country.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the government has announced the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913342">allocation</a> of 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the first phase of a national initiative to power bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.</p>
<p>According to the Finance Division, the ambitious initiative was part of a broader strategy to ‚Äúmonetise surplus electricity, create high-tech jobs, attract billions of dollars in foreign direct investment, and generate billions of dollars for the government‚Äù.</p></p>

            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Omar Ayub alleges Nawaz was initially unwilling to conduct nuclear tests<br />
‚Ä¢ PTI stresses need for political unity, independent judiciary</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: A message shared via the official X (formerly Twitter) account of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan on Tuesday called on public to prepare for a countrywide protest movement.</p>
<p>The post came a day after Imran Khan‚Äôs sister, Aleema Khan, had proposed a ‚Äò<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913804/aleema-proposes-give-and-take-formula-for-imrans-release">give-and-take formula</a>‚Äô for Mr Khan‚Äôs release.</p>
<p>Although Mr Khan does not have direct access to his social media account, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has not disclosed who manages his posts.</p>
<p>The latest message, <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ImranKhanPTI/status/1927602209883144689" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> in Mr Khan‚Äôs name, urged the masses to get ready for a nationwide protest movement, to be launched soon. It also raised concerns about his treatment in Adiala Jail, alleging that he was being denied basic rights.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúUnder jail regulations, I am entitled to a 30-minute meeting with my wife, Bushra Bibi, once a week, but even that has not been allowed for several days,‚Äù the post quoted Mr Khan as saying. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs meeting was also scheduled but was not held. Bushra Bibi has been imprisoned for 13 months solely to torment me, despite no crime being proven against her.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added, ‚ÄúThey can do whatever they want ‚Äî I will neither bow before their tyranny nor make any deal.‚Äù</p>

<p>The former premier revealed that he had issued special instructions to Salman Akram Raja for filing a contempt of court petition in the high court against the prison authorities, and simultaneously submit a petition in the Supreme Court over the violation of fundamental human rights.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll of you should be prepared ‚Äî a nationwide protest movement will be launched soon,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄòNawaz opposed nuclear tests‚Äô</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the 27th anniversary of Pakistan‚Äôs nuclear tests, Youm-i-Takbeer, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan alleged that then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif was initially unwilling to conduct the nuclear tests, citing negotiations with the United States.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMay 28, 1998, was the day Nawaz Sharif‚Äôs legs were trembling,‚Äù Mr Ayub claimed. ‚ÄúHe had refused to conduct the tests and was negotiating with the US administration to avoid going nuclear.‚Äù</p>
<p>Omar Ayub also claimed that Nawaz Sharif was ultimately compelled to authorise the nuclear tests due to significant pressure from key figures within the government and national leadership.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúMy late father, Gohar Ayub Khan, the late Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, the late Majeed Nizami, Raja Zafarul Haq, and Sheikh Rashid Ahmad strongly advocated in the cabinet meeting for proceeding with the tests. Their firm stance left the cabinet with no choice but to agree,‚Äù he claimed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShehbaz Sharif told my father that Nawaz Sharif was engaging in negotiations with the American president in return for not conducting the nuclear tests,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMy father responded by stating that Pakistan was fully prepared and must proceed.‚Äù</p>
<p>He paid tribute to those who played a pivotal role in making Pakistan a declared nuclear state, stating: ‚ÄúWe remember and honour the patriots who stood firm in the national interest and safeguarded Pakistan‚Äôs strategic future.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄòIndia may attack again‚Äô</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said that Imran Khan had been continuously warning that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi would go for another misadventure.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>At a press conference, he stressed the need for unity among political parties and called for an independent judiciary. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unfortunate that lawyers can predict court decisions even before proceedings begin. This has made Pakistan a global laughing stock,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Mr Akram said that Pakistan emerged as the first nuclear power in the Islamic world. ‚ÄúIt is deeply regrettable that Dr A.Q. Khan, the father of Pakistan‚Äôs nuclear programme, was forced to apologise on national television,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>On the current political and judicial crisis, Mr Akram criticised the 26th constitutional amendment, calling it the ‚Äúburial ground‚Äù of the Constitution.</p>
