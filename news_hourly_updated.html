                <h2>We will end this war, Iran warns ‚Äògambler‚Äô Trump</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Iran said on Monday that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">US attack</a> on its nuclear sites expanded the range of legitimate targets for its armed forces and called US President Donald Trump a ‚Äúgambler‚Äù for joining Israel‚Äôs military campaign against the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>Since Trump joined Israel‚Äôs campaign by dropping massive <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842#:~:text=The%20US%20strikes%20included%2014%20bunker%2Dbuster%20bombs%2C%20more%20than%20two%20dozen%20submarine%2Dlaunched%20Tomahawk%20missiles%20and%20over%20125%20military%20aircraft%2C%20the%20top%20general%20added.">bunker-buster bombs</a> on Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday morning, Tehran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate.</p>
<p>But while it has continued to fire missiles at Israel, it has yet to take action against the United States itself, either by firing at US bases or by targeting the 20 per cent of global oil shipments that pass near its coast at the mouth of the Gulf.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMr Trump, the gambler, you may start this war, but we will be the ones to end it,‚Äù Ebrahim Zolfaqari, spokesperson for Iran‚Äôs Khatam al-Anbiya central military headquarters, <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/RT_com/status/1937038083595354557" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Monday in English at the end of a recorded video statement.</p>

<p>Iran and Israel traded another wave of air and missile strikes on Monday as the world braced for Tehran‚Äôs response.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs administration has repeatedly said that its aim is solely to destroy Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919269/all-eyes-on-iran-after-trump-pulls-the-trigger-on-bunker-busters#:~:text=oil%20and%20gas.-,%E2%80%98Not%20at%20war%20with%20Iran%E2%80%99,-Defence%20Secretary%20Hegseth">not to open a wider war</a>.</p>
<p>But in a social media post on Sunday, Trump openly spoke of toppling the hardline clerical rulers who have been Washington‚Äôs principal foes in the Middle East since Iran‚Äôs 1979 revolution.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIts not politically correct to use the term, ‚ÄòRegime Change,‚Äô but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldnt there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!‚Äù he wrote.</p>

<p>Experts surveying commercial satellite imagery said it appeared that the US attack had severely damaged the site of Iran‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842#:~:text=Iranian%20media%20confirmed%20that%20part%20of%20the%20Fordow%20plant%2C%20as%20well%20as%20the%20Isfahan%20and%20Natanz%20nuclear%20sites%2C%20were%20attacked.">Fordow</a> nuclear plant, built inside a mountain, and possibly destroyed it and the uranium-enriching centrifuges it housed, although there was no independent confirmation.</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#more-israeli-strikes" id="more-israeli-strikes" title="Permalink"></a>More Israeli strikes</h2>
<p>Israel‚Äôs airstrikes on Iran have met little resistance from Iranian defences since Israel launched its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">surprise attack</a> on June 13, killing many of Iran‚Äôs top <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">commanders</a>.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said on Monday that about 20 jets had conducted a wave of strikes against military targets in western Iran and Tehran overnight. In Kermanshah, in western Iran, missile and radar infrastructure was targeted, and in Tehran a surface-to-air missile launcher was struck, it said.</p>
<p>Iranian news agencies reported air defences had been activated in central Tehran districts, and Israeli air strikes had hit Parchin, the location of a military complex southeast of the capital.</p>
<p>Iran says more than 400 people have been killed in the Israeli attacks, mostly civilians, but has released few images of the damage since the initial days of the bombing. Tehran, a city of 10 million people, has largely emptied, with residents fleeing to the countryside to escape attacks.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs retaliatory missile strikes on Israel have killed 24 people, all civilians, and injured hundreds, the first time a significant number of Iranian missiles have ever penetrated Israeli defences.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said a missile launched from Iran in the early hours of Monday had been intercepted by Israeli defences. Air raid sirens blared overnight in Tel Aviv and other parts of central Israel.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#limited-retaliation" id="limited-retaliation" title="Permalink"></a>Limited retaliation</h2>
<p>Beyond those missiles, Iran‚Äôs ability to retaliate is far more limited than a few months ago, since Israel inflicted defeat on Iran‚Äôs most feared regional proxy force, Hezbollah in Lebanon, whose downfall was swiftly followed by that of Iran‚Äôs most powerful client ruler, Syria‚Äôs Bashar al-Assad.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs most effective threat to hurt the West would probably be to restrict global oil flows from the Gulf. Oil prices spiked on Monday at their highest since January. But they have not yet shot up to crisis levels, indicating that traders see a path out of the conflict that avoids serious disruption.</p>
<p>Brent crude futures were down 0.5pc to $76.64 a barrel as of 8:30am GMT (1:30pm PKT), after briefly jumping above $80 at the opening.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs parliament has approved a move to close the Strait of Hormuz that leads into the Gulf, which would require approval from the Supreme National Security Council, a body led by an appointee of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>
<p>Attempting to strangle the strait could send global oil prices skyrocketing, derail the world economy and invite conflict with the US Navy‚Äôs massive Fifth Fleet that patrols the Gulf from its base in Bahrain.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs economic suicide for them if they do it. And we retain options to deal with that,‚Äù US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.</p>
<p>As Tehran weighed its options, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi was expected to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow today. The Kremlin has a strategic partnership with Iran, but also close links with Israel.</p>
<p>Speaking in Istanbul yesterday, Araqchi said his country would consider all possible responses and there would be no return to diplomacy until it had retaliated. <em>TASS</em> news agency later quoted him as saying Iran and Russia were coordinating their positions.</p></p>

                <h2>Either India shares water fairly or we will secure it from ‚Äòall 6 rivers‚Äô: Bilawal</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Former foreign minister and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Monday said India has the option to either share water fairly or ‚Äúwe will deliver water to us from all six (Indus river system) rivers‚Äù.</p>
<p>Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">unilaterally suspended</a> its participation in the 1960 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a> (IWT), which governs the usage of the Indus river system, on April 23, shortly after 26 civilians were killed in India-held Kashmir. Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack. The latter has denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. The accord remains dormant despite a ceasefire agreed upon by the two nuclear-armed neighbours last month following their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">worst fighting</a> in decades.</p>
<p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Saturday had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918691/india-will-never-restore-indus-waters-treaty-with-pakistan-amit-shah">slammed</a> Indian Home Minister Amit Shah‚Äôs ‚Äúbrazen disregard‚Äù for international agreements after the latter said New Delhi would never restore the IWT with Pakistan.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Speaking in the National Assembly during a session on the federal budget, Bilawal said, ‚ÄúIndia has two options: share water fairly, or we will deliver water to us from all six rivers.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe attack on <em>Sindhu</em> [Indus River] and India‚Äôs claim that the IWT has ended and it‚Äôs in abeyance, firstly, this is illegal, as the IWT is not in abeyance, it is binding on Pakistan and India, but the threat itself of stopping water is illegal according to the UN charter,‚Äù the former foreign minister said.</p>
<p>He continued that if India decides to follow through on the threat, we will have to wage war again.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He added that hopefully Pakistan won‚Äôt have to, but if it does have to, it is in the position to defeat India the same way it just did.</p>
<p>Bilawal further told lawamkers that peace between the two nuclear neighbours is impossible without cooperation, especially in counterterrorism efforts. ‚ÄúIf India and Pakistan refuse to talk, and if there is no coordination on terrorism, then violence will only intensify in both countries,‚Äù he warned.</p>
<p>He said India was weaponising terrorism for political purposes. ‚ÄúIndia seeks to exploit terrorism as a political tool to harm Pakistan‚Äôs international standing,‚Äù he said, adding that during his diplomatic visits to the United Kingdom and European Union as foreign minister, it became evident that India had lobbied hard to reverse Pakistan‚Äôs progress on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) front.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt a time when Pakistan had successfully moved from the FATF grey list to the white list, India made every effort to drag us back to the grey list using false narratives and diplomatic pressure,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut thanks to our Foreign Office, the prime minister, and his team, those efforts failed. Once again, Pakistan won ‚Äî and India lost.‚Äù</p>
<p>Bilawal also urged renewed dialogue between Pakistan and India to curb regional instability. He added, ‚ÄúWe are fighting not only for the public of Pakistan but also of India as well.‚Äù</p>
<p>He strongly criticised what he called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs dangerous doctrine of escalation. ‚ÄúUnder Modi‚Äôs new ‚Äòabnormal‚Äô, any terrorist incident in India becomes an automatic pretext for launching hostilities against Pakistan,‚Äù Bilawal warned.</p>
<p>He questioned what would happen if Pakistan were to adopt the same policy. ‚ÄúWe suffer from terrorist attacks ten times more than India, many of which are traced back to Indian funding or involvement. Should we then adopt a policy of automatic retaliation, too? That would mean surrendering our future to the will of terrorists.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat might be Modi‚Äôs vision, but it is not ours. We will not let terrorists dictate regional peace,‚Äù he declared.</p>
<p>Last week, addressing a crowd of supporters, Bilawal had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918592/kashmir-now-a-global-issue-says-bilawal">said</a> that New Delhi must accept the IWT. Pakistan‚Äôs narrative had prevailed, not only in diplomatic circles, but also across international media, he claimed.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915727">condemned</a> India‚Äôs unilateral suspension of the IWT, describing it as a ‚Äúblatant violation and act of water aggression‚Äù, and warned that Pakistan would give a befitting response in line with decisions made at the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting held on April 24.</p></p>
