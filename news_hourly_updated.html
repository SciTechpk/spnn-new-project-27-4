                <h2>Aurangzeb addresses post-budget press conference despite boycott from journalists</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is currently addressing a post-budget press conference to expand upon the proposed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292/budget-fy26-pakistan-targets-42pc-growth-slashes-overall-spending">federal budget</a> for the next fiscal year, after journalists staged a walkout.</p>
<p>According to a <em>Dawn.com</em> correspondent, the reporters voiced their concerns about not being given a technical briefing yesterday by the Federal Board of Revenue (FRB) on the Finance Bill 2025, which details the legislation for the proposed measures under the budget.</p>
<p>Subsequently, they walked out of the conference room in protest.</p>
<p>However, flanked by FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial and Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal, Aurangzeb soon continued with his press conference in the presence of some journalists.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He reiterated the significance of the tariff reforms under the National Tariff Policy. ‚ÄúPeople ask us that the revenue will decline but if we have to take this country forward towards an export-led discussion [‚Ä¶] I want to go into the details of the steps we have taken.‚Äù</p>
<p>The minister noted that additional customs duties were removed in four ‚Äúlines‚Äù, while they were reduced in 2,700 tariff lines, which were ‚Äúdirectly linked with those raw materials on the basis of which exporters will benefit‚Äù. He stressed these steps were just for the upcoming year and more measures will be taken eventually.</p>
<p>Echoing his remarks from yesterday, Aurangzeb stressed that the government tried to give relief ‚Äúas much as possible‚Äù while considering the fiscal space. He also pointed out the 0.5pc reduction in super tax for the corporate sector.</p>
<p>Detailing the measures proposed for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916465/tax-relief-for-property-buyers-but-not-for-sellers">property buyers and sellers</a>, he said: ‚ÄúSelling side still gets capital gains but the buying side should get some relief.‚Äù</p>
<p>The minister also termed the mortgage financing ‚Äúas important as the fiscal side of things and what we have to do on the taxation side‚Äù.</p>
<p>Speaking on the agricultural sector, Aurangzeb said an additional tax on fertilisers and pesticides was a ‚Äúbenchmark‚Äù but it was negotiated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the directions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that it was a ‚Äúcritical input into agriculture‚Äù and should not be imposed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAgain, this is a step in the right direction‚Äù, the minister asserted.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb acknowledged that additional taxes and measures were also talked about last year. ‚ÄúWe had to impose those as when we were speaking to international institutions, they were not agreeing with our stance that there can be enforcement in this country,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Expressing the aim to reach a tax-to-GDP ratio of 10.9pc by the next year, the minister said additional taxes were around Rs312m of the total 2.2tr target. ‚ÄúWe have two ways ‚Äî either we ensure enforcement or we introduce additional measures of up to Rs 400 to 500bn. This is why we will go to the parliament to help us out with the enabling amendments and legislation.‚Äù</p>
<p>The minister added: ‚ÄúWe have laws, legislation and taxes but we were not able to enforce it, so in this fiscal year, we have worked on enforcement, which has exceeded Rs400 billion.‚Äù</p>
<p>Responding to a query, Aurangzeb underscored the need to reduce the role of the middleman in the agricultural sector and increase the financing for small farmers. ‚ÄúIt is very critical [‚Ä¶] that we have a policy in the devolved subjects.‚Äù</p>
<p>He noted that the relevant measures were underway, hence the growth target was decided considering that.</p>
<p>On salaries and pensions, the finance czar stressed the need for a benchmark.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf we are saying the inflation is declining, similarly, the salary or pension has to benchmarked with inflation. This is not just the rule in Pakistan but across the world.‚Äù</p>
<p>Acknowledging that past concerns about the government expenditures not reducing were the ‚Äúright pushback‚Äù, the minister highlighted that the figure had gone up by just 1.9pc in the outgoing fiscal year.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have reduced subsidies and debt-servicing costs, and increased some expenditures because this country needed those. But this is our response to those people who are paying taxes in this country that ‚Äòwhy are you not bringing the government expenditures under control‚Äô,‚Äù Aurangzeb asserted.</p>
<p>He pointed out that whatever the government was giving was doing so ‚Äúby taking loans as we start with a deficit‚Äù, adding that if the expenditures were not reduced, then the loans would keep surging.</p>
<p>Responding to a question on how the federal government could delink population from the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, Auranzgeb asserted, ‚ÄúEverything will be done in consultation with provinces.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added, ‚ÄúNothing will be done [without them], including the national fiscal pact which we signed with the provinces.‚Äù</p>
<p>Asked about a recent increase in the salaries of the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker, the minister claimed that the last time their salaries were ‚Äúadjusted‚Äù was in 2016. He emphasised that the hike was ‚Äúall of a sudden‚Äù as it had not been done for the past nine years.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#the-budget" id="the-budget" title="Permalink"></a>The budget</h2>
<p>Maintaining an aggressive stance on fiscal consolidation, as required by the Int¬≠ernational Monetary Fund (IMF), Aurangzeb yesterday still managed to offer some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916440/non-filers-to-face-the-music-as-income-tax-rates-come-down">notional relief</a> to the salaried class in the federal budget for fiscal year 2025-26, along with incentives for the real estate and construction sectors, in an effort to revive the struggling industrial sector and stimulate economic growth.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, the government announced it was imposing a ‚Äòcarbon levy‚Äô of Rs2.5 per litre on petrol, diesel and furnace oil in the upcoming fiscal year, to be doubled the following year.</p>
<p>It also introduced a 5 per cent tax on large pensions, an 18pc tax on imported solar panels, and an increase in the debt servicing surcharge on electricity to finance not only interest payments, but also principal debt. Additionally, it announced the gradual elimination of tax exemptions for the tribal areas beginning this year.</p>

                <h2>PSX hits all-time high as proposed ‚Äòneutral-to-positive‚Äô budget well-received by investors</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) hit an all-time high of 124,000 points on Wednesday as the proposed federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year was well-received by investors for being ‚Äúneutral to positive‚Äù.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index climbed 2,285.13, or 1.87 per cent, to stand at 124,309.57 from the last close of 122,024.44 at 11:49am.</p>
<p>While there had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915753">uncer¬≠tainties</a> surrounding the taxation measures ahead of the budget announcement, the PSX <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916454/bulls-propel-psx-to-new-peak-of-122000">remained bullish</a> yesterday and gained nearly 400 points to cross the 122,000 point-mark, just before the budget was presented in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the budget announcement was ‚Äúwell-received by investors, primarily due to the absence of any new taxes or levies on the stock market, alleviating initial concerns‚Äù.</p>
<p>He noted: ‚ÄúOverall, the budget is viewed as neutral to positive for the listed sectors, with tax collection and fiscal deficit/primary surplus targets seen as non-events, as we believe they remain within the authority‚Äôs ability to meet for FY26.‚Äù</p>
<p>Despite a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914660">record tax shortfall</a> of Rs1.07 trillion recorded for the outgoing fiscal year, the government has set next year‚Äôs revenue target at Rs14.13tr ‚Äî an 18.7pc increase from this year‚Äôs revised estimate of Rs11.9tr, against the original budget target of Rs12.97tr.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Expanding upon the factors related to the stock market, Ashraf said the increase in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916442#:~:text=the%20finance%20minister%20announced%20an%20increase%20in%20the%20tax%20rate%20on%20interest%20income%20from%2015pc%20to%2020pc%2C%20a%20move%20that%20may%20discourage%20savings">tax rate for profit on debt</a> and ‚Äúproportionate imposition of tax on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913560">mutual funds</a> contingent to dividends received from debt and equities at rate of 25pc and 15pc mutual funds, respectively, is expected to provide further traction for the equity market‚Äù.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb yesterday announced an increase in the tax rate on interest income from 15pc to 20pc, a move that may discourage savings.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916466/budget-lacks-steps-to-cure-economic-ills-complain-industry-leaders">some businessmen</a> have labelled the proposed plan a ‚Äúcamouflage budget‚Äù due to its unrealistic targets and the lack of meaningful relief for both the business community and the general public.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/3  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>Pakistan Business Council Chief Executive Ehsan Malik, while noting ‚Äúsmall mercies‚Äù, termed the real estate sector the ‚Äúreal winner‚Äù from the budget.</p>
<p>Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) Secretary General M. Abdul Aleem expressed disappointment over the government‚Äôs limited progress in addressing inequitable corporate tax rates.</p>
