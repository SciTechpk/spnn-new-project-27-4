            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929230/misgivings-in-na-over-haste-to-oust-pti-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>Misgivings in NA over haste to oust PTI leaders</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Gohar claims seats ‘being snatched through courts’<br />
• Law minister distances govt from convictions, asks PTI to take their objections to court<br />
• Naveed Qamar takes exception to ‘frequent’ presidential ordinances</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">convictions</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928963">disqualification</a> of the PTI leaders dominated the National Assembly session on Wednesday, as the opposition party protested the haste with which the Election Commission of Pakistan disqualified its members, while the government distanced itself from the decision.</p>
<p>After their conviction by multiple anti-terrorism courts in Punjab in cases linked to the May 9 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">violence</a>, over a dozen PTI national and provincial lawmakers have been de-seated in light of the court decisions.</p>
<p>Law Minister Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar, while speaking in the house, made it clear that convictions were the outcome of a lawful judicial process and asserted that the government played no role in the process.</p>
<p>The opposition members entered the house carrying portraits of lawmakers disqualified by the ECP and sought to speak over the issue. However, they left the hall after NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq denied them permission, saying points of order were not allowed during Question Hour.</p>
<p>After the opposition walked out of the house, the proceedings were suspended on account of the quorum.</p>
<p>After the session resumed, PTI interim chairman Gohar Ali Khan, while speaking in the house, decried the treatment meted out to the former ruling party in the lead-up to and after the 2024 polls.</p>
<p>He said the PTI’s seats were being “snatched” through courts and warned that such convictions and disqualifications threatened the democratic process.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He said this was the first time in history that key opposition leaders had been disqualified, adding that the ECP transgressed its authority by disqualifying PTI lawmakers before their convictions had attained finality.</p>
<p>Barrister Gohar Ali Khan claimed the PTI also condemned the May 9 violence – in which military installations were also targeted — and asked how long this incident would be used to send lawmakers packing.</p>
<p>But Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar responded that it was the domain of the courts to pronounce verdicts. “This is a lawful process. Objections can be raised, but the forum to do so is also the court,” he remarked.</p>
<p>He cited the example of Jamshed Dasti who had been given interim relief by the Lahore High Court following his disqualification by the ECP. He said parliament was not the forum to decide the merits of ongoing prosecutions, adding that the constitutional framework required respect for judicial independence.</p>
<p>After proceedings were adjourned, the opposition members exited the house, raising slogans against the convictions and disqualifications. They also staged a protest outside the Parliament House building.</p>
<p><strong>Tiff over ordinances</strong></p>
<p>During Wednesday’s proceedings, two key lawmakers from the PPP and the PML-N — partners in the ruling coalition — got into an argument over the frequent promulgation of ordinances.</p>
<p>Before two recently promulgated ordinances were laid before the house for endorsement, PPP leader Syed Naveed Qamar raised objections, saying the unnecessary promulgation of ordinances undermined parliament.</p>
<p>The objection came as a surprise to some, as his own party leader President Asif Ali Zardari is the one issuing the ordinances.</p>
<p>Mr Qamar noted that successive governments had been abusing and misusing the constitutional provision, which allowed the promulgation of ordinances in peculiar circumstances. “This whole process is anti-democratic and against the spirit of the Constitution,” he remarked.</p>
<p>Federal Minister for National Food Security Rana Tanveer Hussain, however, defended the ordinances, saying the process was in line with the Constitution and that no ordinance had unnecessarily been promulgated.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>According to the minister, the heavens will not fall by the promulgation of ordinances. He said the house and the relevant committees could suggest amendments to the ordinances.</p>
<p>According to Article 89 of the Constitution, the president may, except when the Senate or the National Assembly is in session, if satisfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary to take immediate action, make and promulgate an ordinance, as the circumstances may require.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929224/army-chief-heads-to-us-again' target='_blank'><strong>Army chief heads to US, again</strong></a>
            <p><p>WASHINGTON: Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir is expected in the US this week for consultations with his American counterparts, official sources told <em>Dawn</em>.</p>
<p>Sources said this would be a return visit, following a trip to Pakistan by Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, head of the US Central Command (CENTCOM), in late July.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/STATEMENTS/Statements-View/Article/4263167/centcom-commander-completes-15-day-visit-to-region/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press statement</a> issued on Aug 4, CENTCOM recalled Gen Kurilla’s recent visit to Pakistan and other countries in the region.</p>
<p>During the visit, Gen Kurilla was also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926741#:~:text=Govt%20honours%20US%20Centcom%20chief%20with%20Nishan%2Di%2DImtiaz">conferred</a> the Nishan-i-Imtiaz (Milit­ary) by the Pakistani government.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir previously visited Washin­gton in June, when he was hosted by President Don­ald Trump for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044">lunch</a> at the White House — an unprecedented gesture typically reserved for visiting heads of state or government.</p>
<p>There was no official word on the visit from Inter- Services Public Relations or Pakistan’s embassy in Washington, but during his previous, the army chief had hinted that he expected to return to the US again later in the year.</p>
<p>The development comes just over a month after the US general described Pakistan as a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524">phenomenal partner</a>” in counterterrorism efforts during a congressional hearing, where he also praised Pakistan’s role “in promoting peace and stability” in the region.</p>
<p><strong>No designs on Presidency</strong></p>
<p>Separately, the ISPR chief has rubbished rumours of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir becoming the president, <em>Dawn.com</em> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929075">reported</a>.</p>
<p>His statement follows a similar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923280/interior-minister-rebuts-rumours-about-president-zardari-resigning-from-office">rebuttal</a> by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi early in July, when he clarified that no idea existed “about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency”.</p>
<p>Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry told <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2025/08/03/pakistans-army-chief-is-cosying-up-to-donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Econo­mist</a></em> in a recent interview that talk of his boss becoming president is ‘nonsense’.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929220/bahria-town-asks-sc-to-halt-auction' target='_blank'><strong>Bahria Town asks SC to halt auction</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Bahria Town on Wednesday challenged a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928834">short order</a>  of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) which allowed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to proceed with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929028">auction</a> of properties linked to a plea bargain involving property tycoon Zain Malik.</p>
<p>Moved by senior counsel Farooq H. Naek on behalf of Bahria Town’s accounts and finance manager Adnan Khurshied Babar, the petition pleaded before the Supreme Court that NAB, by auctioning the properties, was acting in a discriminatory and arbitrary manner in violation of Articles 4, 10A, 23 and 24 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>It argued that NAB lacked the legal authority to unilaterally auction or dispose of mortgaged properties, owned by a third-party surety, without  initiating separate proceedings or obtaining adjudication from a  competent forum.</p>
<p>Bahria Town, it maintained, was not a party to the plea bargain.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Tarar claims FIA raids have yielded ‘incontrovertible proof’ of money laundering</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The respondents named in the appeal include Islamabad’s accountability court, NAB chairman, Rawalpindi region director general of the bureau, and the official in charge of its recovery and disbursement management cell.</p>
<p>Zain Malik, son-in-law of Bahria Town chairman Malik Riaz who is facing three NAB references, had pledged Bahria Town properties as collateral under a plea bargain agreement signed under Section 25(b) of the National Accountability Ordinance 1999.</p>
<p>The agreement was approved by the accountability court in August 2020.</p>
<p>The attached properties include Media House Phase-I Rawalpindi, agricultural land at Mouza Mohra Noor, Bahria Town Corporate Offices I &amp; II, Rubaish Marquee, Arena Cinema, Bahria Town International Academy, and Safari Club.</p>
<p>The petition argued that the IHC’s order dismissing Bahria Town’s plea was flawed, based on misreading of the record, and legally unsound.</p>
<p>It further stated that both the IHC and the accountability court had acted beyond their jurisdictions, thus violating Section 88 of the CrPC, which did not permit attachment of properties owned by third parties not accused or proclaimed offenders.</p>
<p><strong>‘Evidence unearthed’</strong></p>
<p>In a separate statement on Wednesday, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar claimed the government had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929117">found evidence</a> that the controversial tycoon and his real estate empire had engaged in money laundering on a “grand” scale.</p>
<p>He said an FIA inquiry had yielded very important documents which were “incontrovertible proof of Malik Riaz and Bahria Town’s corruption”.</p>
<p>He claimed that evidence unearthed so far revealed money laundering to the tune of Rs1.12 billion, alleging that the Safari Hospital in Rawalpindi was used as a front.</p>
