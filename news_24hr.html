            <p><p>• PML-N withdraws candidate in favour of JUI-F’s nominee on minority seat<br />
• ANP’s Shahida Waheed wins draw on women seat</p>
<p>PESHAWAR: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Thursday withdrew its candidate in favour of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) for a seat reserved for non-Muslims, paving the way for JUI-F to become the largest opposition party in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly with 18 lawmakers.</p>
<p>As a result, JUI-F’s candidate Gorpal Singh will now be notified as MPA-elect on the said seat by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Awami National Party (ANP) candidate Shahida Waheed was declared the winner through a draw against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Parliamentarians (PTI-P) candidate for a seat reserved for women. She will also be notified by the ECP as MPA-elect.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Both developments took place at the office of Provincial Election Commissioner (PEC) Saeed Gul in Peshawar on Thursday, where senior party leaders were present.</p>
<p>PML-N provincial president Amir Muqam and JUI-F’s Maul­ana Attaur Rehman attended the event along with their respective candidates, Gorsaran Lal and Gorpal Singh. The PML-N delegation formally withdrew its candidate in support of JUI-F’s nominee.</p>
<p>Similarly, delegations of ANP, led by MPA Nisar Baz and candidate Shahida Waheed, and PTI-P, led by MPA Arbab Waseem and candidate Somi, were also present for the draw. Following the draw, ECP officials declared Ms Waheed the winner.</p>
<p>Both PML-N and JUI-F were allo­­t­ted one seat each, reserved for non-Muslims, on the basis of the seven general seats won by each of them. The ECP had decided to allot the remaining seat through a draw.</p>
<p>Similarly, both ANP and PTI-P were awarded one seat each reserved for women and the remaining seat had to be allotted through a draw between candidates of these parties.</p>
<p>Following the notifications, JUI-F and PML-N will each hold nine of the total 26 reserved seats for women in the KP Assembly. PPP holds five, while ANP and PTI-P will now hold two and one, respectively.</p>
<p>For the four seats reserved for non-Muslims, JUI-F will hold two, while PML-N and PPP will have one each.</p>
<p>The opposition now <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920722/opposition-will-swell-to-52-in-kp-assembly">holds</a> a total of 52 lawmakers in the KP Assembly, including 18 MPAs of JUI-F, 17 of PML-N, 10 of PPP, four of ANP, and three of PTI-P. Presently, Dr Ibadullah of PML-N is the leader of the opposition in the KP Assembly. PTI-backed lawmakers maintain their tally of 92 members.</p>

            <p><p>Lightning strikes during monsoon storms in eastern India this week killed at least 33 people and injured dozens, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The deaths in Bihar occurred during fierce storms between Wednesday and Thursday, a state disaster management department statement said, with the victims mostly farmers and labourers working in the open.</p>
<p>More heavy rain and lightning are forecast for parts of the state.</p>
<p>Bihar state’s disaster management minister, Vijay Kumar Mandal, told <em>AFP</em> that officials in vulnerable districts had been directed to “create awareness to take precautionary steps following an alert on lightning”.</p>
<p>The state government announced compensation of 4 million rupees ($4,600) to the families of those killed by lightning.</p>
<p>At least 243 died by lightning in 2024 and 275 the year earlier, according to the state government.</p>
<p>India’s eastern region, including Bihar, is prone to annual floods that kill dozens and displace hundreds of thousands of people during the peak monsoon season.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924884/us-declares-outfit-behind-pahalgam-attack-terror-group' target='_blank'><strong>US declares outfit behind Pahalgam attack ‘terror group’</strong></a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: The US has designated the group, which claimed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in India-held Kashmir’s Pahalgam area, as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) and specially designated global terrorist (SDGT) group.</p>
<p>Without any evidence, New Delhi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">blamed</a> Islamabad for the April 22 attack, which saw 26 people killed in the Baisaran hill station, and used it as a pretext to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">launch</a> military strikes against Pakistan.</p>
<p>According to a recent <em>BBC News</em> report, the group had initially said it was behind the attack, but later disowned it.</p>
<p>Thursday’s statement from the State Department seemed to echo India’s viewpoint, which has claimed that the little-known newly-formed group was actually a “front and proxy” of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).</p>
<p>India also blames the LeT for orchestrating the 2008 Mumbai attacks and several other attacks on military forces. The US earlier designated LeT as an FTO in December 2001.</p>
<p>One of the first mentions of the group came in 2020, when then-Indian army chief M.M. Naravane accused Pakistan of creating a “new terror group” in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>“I would rather call it Terror Revival Front. It is another terrorist organisation by another name. This is a terrorist organisation supported by its proxies across the border. They will be dealt with appropriately,” he was quoted as saying. Pakistan’s Foreign Office had rejected the allegation at the time.</p>
<p>“These actions taken by the Department of State demonstrate the Trump administration’s commitment to protecting our national security interests, countering terrorism, and enforcing President Trump’s call for justice for the Pahalgam attack,” the statement said.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with Indian journalist Karan Thapar, former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had said that Pakistan was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1923094">ready</a> to cooperate with India against this group.</p>
<p>At the time, Mr Thapar had claimed that New Delhi’s attempts to have the group designated as a terror outfit by the United Nations had been blocked by China, on Pakistan’s behalf.</p>
