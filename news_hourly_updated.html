                <h2>Interior minister rebuts rumours about President Zardari ‘resigning’ from office</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Thursday rebutted rumours of President Asif Ali Zardari being asked to resign, terming it a “malicious campaign”.</p>
<p>“We are fully aware of who is behind the malicious campaign targeting President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and the chief of army staff,” Naqvi <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MohsinnaqviC42/status/1943211206371602592" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X.</p>
<p>“I have categorically stated that there has been no discussion, nor does any such idea exist about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency,” he asserted.</p>

<p>“The president of Pakistan enjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces,” the minister said.</p>
<p>He quoted President Zardari as having “clearly” stated: “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”</p>
<p>Naqvi stressed that the “sole focus” of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was Pakistan’s strength and stability, and “nothing else”.</p>
<p>“To those involved in this narrative, do whatever you wish in collaboration with hostile foreign agencies. As for us, we will do whatever is necessary to make Pakistan strong again, InshAllah,” Naqvi added.</p>
<p>Earlier today, PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui also denied reports of Zardari’s resignation.</p>
<p>Speaking on <em>Geo News’</em> programme “<a class="link--external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzXtjUbD19E&amp;t=719s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Geo Pakistan</a>”, he said: “Reports that Zardari is resigning, Imran’s sons are coming, Nawaz Sharif is going to Adiala … these are not news. They are bogus, table stories.”</p>
<p>He further said, “Zardari has not created any difficulties for the government, and understands his constitutional responsibilities as head of state”.</p>
<p>The PML-N leader said his party had “no trouble” working with the president, who leads the PPP, and there was no credible reason to remove him from office.</p>
<p>“We have a coalition with the PPP. Why would we bring down this system?” he questioned.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, social media campaigns against the army have escalated, reflecting broader tensions within the country’s political and social fabric.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856908">government</a>, as well as the military, have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1876905">repeatedly</a> warned about “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=fake%20news%20and%20propaganda%20have%20become%20so%20common%20and%20there%20is%20no%20accountability%20for%20it.%E2%80%9D">fake news and propaganda</a>” proliferating on social media, with military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=theories%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20added.-,%E2%80%98Digital%20terrorism%E2%80%99,-Questioned%20about%20criticism">digital terrorism</a>” under the laws.</p>
<p>In May, President Zardari and PM Shehbaz formally decorated Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Syed Asim Munir with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912748/president-pm-decorate-coas-munir-with-rank-of-field-marshal">rank of field marshal</a> for his “sagacious leadership and exceptional strategy” during the recent conflict with India.</p>
<p>In a subsequent dinner hosted by the army chief, Field Marshal Munir lauded the political leadership for their “strategic foresight” during <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> against India.</p>

<p>The next month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who belongs to PM Shehbaz’s PML-N, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918558/whats-behind-khawaja-asifs-praise-for-hybrid-system">hailed</a> the “existing hybrid model of governance” in the country. In a separate interview, he also termed it as a “practical necessity” for Pakistan, saying the system was “doing wonders”.</p>
<p>In May 2024, the army chief and President Zardari had expressed their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1825461">concern</a> over “baseless and unsubstantiated allegations levelled by a specific political party and its few individuals” against the army for their political interests.</p></p>

They are crucial to replenishing water supplies and agriculture, and therefore, the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security. However, they also wreak havoc by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>At least nine people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923183/11-killed-as-rains-continue-to-batter-punjab-balochistan">lost their lives</a> and many others sustained injuries as heavy monsoon rains lashed Lahore on Wednesday. The downpours caused widespread flooding and disrupted daily life in several areas.</p>
<p>“Over the last 24 hours, four people died and 40 were injured due to rain and winds across the province,” Rescue 1122 Punjab Spokesperson Farooq Ahmed said in a statement.</p>
<p>Those who sustained serious injuries were immediately transported to a hospital, the spokesperson said.</p>
