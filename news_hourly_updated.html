<p>Today’s incident comes days after a portion of a building <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921188/no-casualties-reported-as-22-rescued-from-partially-collapsed-building-in-karachis-kharadar">collapsed</a> in the city’s Kharadar area. However, no casualties or injuries were reported. The Public Account Committee of the Sindh Assembly had directed the provincial government in December to take urgent steps to evacuate over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879565">570 buildings</a> declared “dangerous” by authorities across Karachi.</p>
<p>Rescue efforts were underway at the building situated on Fida Hussain Shaikha Road in Lyari’s Baghdadi neighbourhood, according to a statement from the Baghdadi police.</p>
<p>Pakistan Rangers, in a statement, said its personnel were also assisting in the rescue operations and “engaged in rescuing individuals trapped under the rubble”.</p>
<p>The heavy rescue machinery struggled to access the narrow alleys, and police baton-charged residents to clear the way, <em>AFP</em> reported.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters at the site of the incident, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab said the government needed to “take action”, noting that there were around 434 buildings in the Old City area that had been declared “dangerous” by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA). A statement by the authority put the number of such buildings across Karachi at 588.</p>
<p>“We have two options: to convince people to move out or force them to evacuate,” Wahab said, adding that any government tries not to take any forced action but to convince people.</p>
<p>“This loss of lives today shows that when the state or the government tells you anything, you should follow it.”</p>
<p>The mayor requested the inhabitants of such dilapidated buildings to evacuate as soon as possible to prevent any unpleasant incident and loss of life or property.</p>

<p>Saad Edhi of the Edhi Foundation described the structure to <em>AFP</em> as a “worn-out building”. Police official Arif Aziz told <em>AFP</em> that up to 100 people had been living in the building.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the incident reportedly occurred between 9-9:30am but due to disruption of the communication network, the department received the information late.</p>
<p>He said that as per the residents and relatives, there were still 20-25 people stuck in the rubble and the rescue operation was still under way. He said some families had already realised the gravity of the situation and begun leaving with a few of them having already left the building as its structure had started to deteriorate after the recent rains.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the SBCA said it had declared the plot as dangerous through its Technical Committee for Dangerous Buildings after a thorough inspection conducted in October 2022.</p>
<p>It said it had received a complaint from the Sindh Human Rights Commission on July 22, 2022, and the authority had thereafter promptly issued the first ejectment notice on June 2, 2023, directing the residents and occupants to vacate the premises.</p>
<p>It said a second notice was issued on February 28, 2024, followed by a third with a three-day final warning and lastly a fourth notice addressed to the managing director of K-Electric, Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) on June 25, 2024, instructing them to disconnect utility services.</p>
<p>The SBCA added that an urgent reminder for ejectment was issued on June 2 with copies sent to the South deputy and assistant commissioners and the Kalari station house officer, requesting their intervention to evacuate the premises and prevent any potential incident.</p>
<p>“On June 29, 2025, the SBCA director also reported that residents were warned via megaphones to evacuate the building immediately.</p>
<p>“Regrettably, the residents were reluctant to vacate the building unless alternate accommodation was provided. Furthermore, the utility agencies, K-Electric, SSGC, and KWSB, did not respond or disconnect services in a timely manner, nor did the district administration paid attention and responded by our issued ejectment notices.</p>
<p>“It is important to note that the monsoon season is ongoing, increasing the risk associated with dangerous structures. According to SBCA records, 588 buildings have been declared dangerous throughout Karachi with 107 such buildings in Lyari alone. The SBCA has repeatedly advertised these threats through print and electronic media.”</p>
<p>It also pointed out that during his tenure, former Sindh chief secretary Sohail Rajput had instructed then-Karachi commissioner Saleem Rajput to take efforts to vacate the buildings declared dangerous by the SBCA Technical Committee. It added that the matter was still pending.</p>

<p>“We are helpless and just looking at the rescue workers to bring our loved ones back safely.”</p>
<p>Shankar Kamho, aged 30, a resident of the building who was out at the time, said around 20 families were living inside.</p>
<p>“I got a call from my wife saying the building was cracking and I told her to get out immediately,” he told <em>AFP</em> at the scene.</p>
<p>“She went to warn the neighbours, but one woman told her ‘this building will stand for at least 10 more years’. Still, my wife took our daughter and left. About 20 minutes later, the building collapsed.”</p>

<p>Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/sindhinfodepart/status/1941112397894234372" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> a high-level committee has been formed that will submit a report on the incident within three days.</p>
<p>His spokesperson Zubair Memon said the committee has been directed to submit a report identifying the responsible officers and their negligence. The minister also ordered the suspension of the related officials at the SBCA.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters at the site of the incident, Ghani lamented that residents did not evacuate the building despite being served notices previously due to the unsafe conditions of the run-down structure.</p>
<p>“Not one but many notices were given to them (residents) to evacuate the building in the past four to six years. But I can also understand the citizens’ struggle.</p>
<p>“[…] On the one hand is your home in which you are residing, [but] on the other hand is your life,” Ghani added, urging residents of other dilapidated structures to evacuate to avoid any disaster.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>“If we forcibly make them evacuate, then also a humanitarian aspect comes forward, and we have to become a target of criticism for it,” the minister stressed.</p>
<p>Ghani said he had been told that the building was built in 1974. “There is an entire mafia that constructs these illegal buildings in the city; we have taken strict action against them and filed FIRs,” he said, urging citizens not to buy or rent such buildings to “end the demand”.</p>
<p>Taking notice of the incident in a statement, Ghani ordered the top officials of the relevant authorities, including the SBCA, to reach the site of the incident to monitor the rescue efforts.</p>
<p>“A report on the causes of the building collapse and all its reasons should be submitted immediately,” he said in the statement issued by Memon.</p>
<p>“All obstacles around the building should be removed to speed up the rescue operation,” Ghani added.</p>
<p>Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.</p>
<p>But Karachi, home to more than 20m, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.</p>

<p>Sindh Rescue 1122 Director General (DG) Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, in a statement, said the service’s Central Command and Control Centre received an alert of the incident at 10:53am.</p>
<p>“As soon as the alert was received, the Urban Search and Rescue team, along with a disaster-response vehicle (DRV), immediately reached the site of the incident,” the Rescue 1122 DG asserted.</p>
<p>He detailed that over 100 rescue personnel, five DRVs, two snorkels and multiple ambulances were present at the building’s location. Cranes and lifters have also been dispatched to the site, DG Shaikh added.</p>
<p>He explained that there were hindrances during the rescue operation due to the “unruly crowd, various road blockades and mobile network [issues]”.</p>

                <h2>No bar on extraditing ‘individuals of concern’ if India cooperates, says Bilawal</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Friday said Pakistan had no objection to extraditing “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1503669">individuals of concern</a>” to India as a confidence-building measure, as long as New Delhi showed willingness to cooperate in the process.</p>
<p>Ties between Pakistan and India have remained tense, further strained after New Delhi, without presenting evidence, blamed Pakistan for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly April attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. This led to a four-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">military confrontation</a> in May, with both sides dropping their guns after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">American intervention</a>.</p>
<p>The PPP chairman has repeatedly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915997">called</a> for India and Pakistan to engage in a dialogue to establish peace.</p>
<p>Speaking during an exclusive interview with <em>Al Jazeera</em>, the PPP chief responded to a question about extraditing Laskhar-i-Taiba (LeT) chief Hafiz Saeed and Jaish-i-Muhammad (JeM) chief Masood Azhar as possible concessions and good-faith gestures to India.</p>
<p>“As part of a comprehensive dialogue with Pakistan, where terrorism is one of the issues that we discuss, I am sure Pakistan would not be opposed to any of these things,” Bilawal said.</p>
<p>Both LeT and JeM have been <a class="link--external" href="https://nacta.gov.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/proscribed-organizations-06-oct-2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">banned</a> by Pakistan, according to the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta), while Saeed is currently serving a 33-year sentence for terror financing and Azhar has been proscribed by Nacta.</p>
<p>Bilawal added that cases prosecuted against these “individuals” were those related to Pakistan, such as terrorist financing. However, he noted that prosecuting them for cross-border terrorism was difficult due to noncompliance from Delhi.</p>
<p>“India is refusing to comply with certain basic elements that require that conviction to take place,” he explained. “It’s important … to present evidence within these courts, for people to come over from India to testify, to put up with whatever the counter-accusations will be.</p>
<p>“If India is willing to be cooperative in that process, I am sure there will be no hurdle in extraditing any individual of concern.”</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#new-abnormal" id="new-abnormal" title="Permalink"></a>‘New abnormal’</h2>
<p>Bilawal also expressed concern about India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284#:~:text=dangerous%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20warned.-,Modi%20vows%20to%20pursue%20attackers%20to%20%E2%80%98ends%20of%20the%20Earth%E2%80%99,-Meanwhile%2C%20in%20India">vow</a> to pursue terrorists, calling it a “new abnormal”.</p>
<p>“The new normal or the new abnormal that India would like to impose in the subcontinent … is that any terrorist attack within India means war with Pakistan,” he said. “This does not serve the interests of Pakistan, and it does not serve the interests of India.</p>
<p>“Two nuclear-armed countries have got to the point that they have reduced the threshold for military conflict … to this level, which in effect means that we leave the destiny of 1.7 billion people not in the hands of the Pakistani or Indian government, but to nameless, faceless non-state actors,” he added.</p>
<p>Pressed on the whereabouts of Saeed and Azhar, Bilawal stated that the former was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1684132">incarcerated</a>, while stating that Islamabad believes the latter is in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“It is factually not correct that Hafiz Saeed is a free man; he is in the custody of the Pakistani state,” he maintained, stating that Islamabad has been unable to arrest Azhar.</p>
<p>“It is our belief that he is in Afghanistan,” Bilawal stated. “If and when the Indian government shares information that he is on Pakistani soil, we will be more than happy to arrest him.</p>
<p>“But the fact is that the Indian government is not referring to them, nor any of these individuals involved in the terrorist attack that justified this war,” the PPP chief continued.</p>
<p>“We went to war on a lie. This is a precedent that has been set and India is trying to exploit: you cry terrorist and attack a sovereign, Muslim country.”</p></p>
