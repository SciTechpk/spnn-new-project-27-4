<p>Pakistan previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911132">invited</a> India to a comprehensive dialogue to address all contentious issues, including the Kashmir dispute and the water distribution.</p>
<p>During a meeting with British High Commissioner Jane Marriott today, PM Shehbaz appreciated the UK‚Äôs role in de-escalating tensions during the Pakistan-India standoff.</p>
<p>He welcomed the British government‚Äôs decision to resume <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924570/uk-lifts-ban-on-pakistani-airlines-removes-country-from-air-safety-list">PIA flights</a> to the UK.

<p>Both sides discussed the ‚Äúpositive trajectory‚Äù of bilateral relations. The prime minister said that the recently held <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924280/pakistan-uk-ink-accord-to-boost-economic-cooperation">trade talks</a> between the two countries would lead to mutually beneficial opportunities for both sides. ‚ÄúPakistan is also cooperating closely with the UK at the UN Security Council, where Pakistan currently holds the monthly Presidency,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Marriott briefed PM Shehbaz about her recent visit to London, where she had extensive consultations on enhancing bilateral ties.</p>
<p>She lauded the Pakistani government‚Äôs recent economic performance which brought about a significant improvement in key macroeconomic indicators. She also discussed the UK‚Äôs perspective on regional developments in South Asia and the Middle East.</p>

<p>Last week, UK‚Äôs government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924354">launched</a> e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù border and immigration system.</p>
<p>The announcement came just a day after the two countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924280/pakistan-uk-ink-accord-to-boost-economic-cooperation">formally signed</a> the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#un-envoy-hits-back-at-india-for-cross-border-terrorism-claims" id="un-envoy-hits-back-at-india-for-cross-border-terrorism-claims" title="Permalink"></a>UN envoy hits back at India for cross-border terrorism claims</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Pakistan‚Äôs envoy to the UNSC, Ambassador Usman Jadoon, rejected Indian allegations of cross-border terrorism and asked India to change its behaviour, instead of resorting to its ‚Äútired narrative of victimhood and blame-shifting‚Äù, during the UNSC debate on ‚ÄúPromoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes‚Äù on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Indian envoy was reacting to Deputy PM Dar‚Äôs speech in New York during the reception hosted for Pakistan‚Äôs presidency of the UNSC, where the latter underscored the need for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is India which actively sponsors, aids and abets terrorism in my country and beyond,‚Äù Ambassador Jadoon, deputy permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, told the 15-member body on Tuesday evening, while responding to allegations made by India‚Äôs UN Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRather than being blinded by hubris and a misplaced sense of impunity, and instead of resorting to its tired narrative of victimhood and blame-shifting, India must introspect seriously, change its behaviour and comply with its international legal obligations on all counts,‚Äù he said, in the debate convened by Pakistan to promote pacific settlement of disputes between nations.</p>
<p>Ambassador Jadoon said that it was especially regrettable that the Indian ambassador targeted Pakistan yesterday, when earlier in the day, the council ‚Äúspoke with a unanimous voice to reaffirm the purposes and principles of the UN charter and the imperative of peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for international law and effective implementation of the resolution of the security council‚Äù.</p>
<p>The Pakistani envoy pointed out that firstly, India was in illegal occupation of the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile claiming to abide by the UN charter, and purportedly the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes, India has been in violation of security council resolutions on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, and has refused to implement those resolutions, thereby denying the Kashmiri people the exercise of their inalienable right to self-determination,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs egregious violations of human rights which extend beyond the occupied territory of Jammu and Kashmir and encompass its appalling treatment of minorities has been widely reported by international human rights organisations,‚Äù Jadoon added.</p>
<p>He also said that India had ‚Äústooped to a new low‚Äù of unilaterally and illegally holding in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">abeyance</a> the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, with the stated aim of depriving the people of Pakistan of water from the Indus river system.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn gross violation of international law, India resorted to blatant aggression against my country between 7-10 May, targeting civilians, including women and children,‚Äù the ambassador said.</p>
<p>He highlighted Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúbefitting but measured response‚Äù in accordance with its right to self-defence, aimed exclusively at military targets, that resulted in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">downing</a> of six Indian aircraft that took part in the aggression, among other significant military losses.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe hostilities came to an end owing to Pakistan‚Äôs position of strength and responsible approach, and facilitation of the US, as also highlighted in the statement of the US this morning, ‚Äú Jadoon told the delegates.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is ironic that India, which itself brought the Jammu and Kashmir dispute to the security council, refuses to implement the resolutions adopted by the council to peacefully resolve this dispute,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>Obviously stung by the success of Pakistan‚Äôs signature event at the council, the Indian envoy had claimed that Pakistan was ‚Äústeeped in fanaticism and terrorism‚Äù, and a ‚Äúserial borrower from the International Monetary Fund‚Äù.</p>
<p>The debate will resume on July 24 to listen to the remaining speakers, after listening to scores of high-level representatives.</p></p>

                <h2>Pakistan and Bangladesh agree on visa-free entry for diplomats, pledge stronger security cooperation</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan and Bangladesh on Wednesday agreed in principle to grant visa-free entry to holders of diplomatic and official passports, along with a pledge to stronger security cooperation.</p>
<p>The two countries were once one nation but split following a bloody civil war, which saw the territory previously referred to as ‚ÄòEast Pakistan‚Äô seceding to form the independent nation of Bangladesh. In the years since the split between Pakistan and Bangladesh, Dhaka‚Äôs leaders ‚Äî especially the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245">ousted</a> regime of Sheikh Hasina ‚Äî stayed firmly in the Indian camp, preferring to maintain close ties with New Delhi and keeping Islamabad at arm‚Äôs length.</p>
<p>However, ever since a popular uprising that saw Hasina‚Äôs government toppled in August of last year, with the deposed premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856408">fleeing</a> to her old ally India, there has been a thaw in ties between the two capitals, with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894028/countrys-trade-with-bangladesh-surpasses-1bn-report">trade</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878467">bilateral relations</a> seeing a marked improvement.</p>
<p>In May, Bangladesh High Commissioner to Pakistan Iqbal Hussain Khan said that the visa regime between Pakistan and Bangladesh was being eased for the business community to foster economic growth in the region.</p>
<p>Today‚Äôs development came during a visit of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to Bangladesh, where he met Home Minister retired Lieutenant General Jahangir Alam Chowdhury in Dhaka.</p>
<p>Naqvi was presented with a guard of honour before the two sides began discussions.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the two ministers held wide-ranging talks on bilateral issues and matters of mutual interest, with a particular focus on strengthening cooperation in internal security and law enforcement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSignificant progress on visa-free entry for diplomatic and official passports during the meeting. Pakistan and Bangladesh make a principled decision to provide visa-free entry facility for diplomatic and official passports,‚Äù said a statement from the interior ministry.</p>

<p>Both sides expressed a strong desire to deepen collaboration in key areas, including counter-terrorism, combatting drug trafficking and preventing human smuggling.</p>
<p>The ministers also discussed plans to exchange training programmes between police academies, aiming to improve professional capacity and technical expertise.</p>
<p>Chowdhury thanked Naqvi for offering support in police training and described the visit as an ‚Äúimportant milestone‚Äù in advancing ties between the two countries.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI wholeheartedly welcome my brother upon his arrival in Dhaka. Your visit is of great importance for the promotion of Pakistan-Bangladesh relations,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>To follow up on the decisions taken during the meeting, both sides agreed to form a joint committee with Interior Secretary Khurram Agha leading the Pakistani side in this coordination effort.</p>
<p>The committee will oversee implementation of the agreed initiatives and explore further avenues for cooperation.</p>
<p>As part of the growing partnership, a high-level delegation from Bangladesh is expected to visit Islamabad soon to study the Safe City Project and tour the National Police Academy.</p></p>
