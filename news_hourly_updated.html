                <h2>US averted likely Pak-India nuclear war, says Trump</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump has said Washington had averted what could have been a nuclear war between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting drones</a> sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns. On May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, Trump announced that a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> had been reached between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>“The situation had escalated to the point where nuclear war could have broken out,” Trump said in an interview with US outlet <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-says-comey-knew-assassination-meaning-behind-deleted-social-media-post#:~:text=pointed%20to%20a%20recent%20ceasefire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News</a></em> on Friday.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to a question about getting both countries to step back from the brink of war, Trump called it a “bigger success than I will ever be given credit for”.</p>
<p>“Those are major nuclear powers […] and they were angry. […] It was tit-for-tat, it was getting deeper and more missiles,” he said. He added the next step would have been “the N-word”, responding in the affirmative to the host confirming he meant “nuclear”.</p>
<p>“That’s the worst thing that can happen,” Trump noted. Referring to discussions he said he had with both Pakistan and India on trade, the US president said: “I’m using trade to settle scores and make peace.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Trump said that he had great conversations with Pakistan. “You know we can’t forget them because it takes two to tango.”</p>
<p>“So proud of what we’re able to do with India and with Pakistan,” the US president said.</p>
<p>He continued that Pakistan would love to trade with the US. “They are brilliant people. They make amazing products. We don’t do much trading with them.”</p>
<p>As the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810/trumps-tariffs-stoke-global-trade-war-as-china-eu-hit-back">imposed heavy levies</a> on dozens of allies and rivals alike on April 2, Pakistan was hit by a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901838/economists-see-hurdles-and-opportunities-for-pakistan-as-us-imposes-29pc-tariff-on-country">29 per cent tariff</a> on goods it exports to the US. The government has said it is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906864">seeking ways</a> to address the existing trade imbalance between the two countries.</p>
<p>On trade with New Delhi, Trump said that India was one of the highly tariffed nations, making it almost “impossible to do business”.</p>
<p>However, India is ready to cut 100pc of its tariffs for the US, he added. “That deal will come soon,” the president said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, he had stated that India had offered a trade deal that proposed “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911203">no tariffs</a>” for American goods.</p>
<p>This interview was the third time in a week that the US president expressed his intention of deepening trade ties with Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>“We’re going to do a lot of trade with Pakistan … and India,” Trump said earlier this week, recalling that he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910565/trump-says-warned-pakistan-india-of-no-trade-if-fighting-not-halted">warned</a> both countries of “not doing any trade” if they did not stop fighting. A day after the ceasefire, he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910382#:~:text=adding%20that%20he%20also%20intended%20to%20%E2%80%9Cincrease%20trade%20substantially%20with%20both%20of%20these%20great%20nations%E2%80%9D">said</a> he was going “to increase trade substantially with both of these great nations”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The US-brokered ceasefire had brought a halt to a week of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909156/nuclear-war-can-break-out-at-any-time-in-case-of-pak-india-standoff-khawaja-asif">record escalation</a> between Pakistan and India as the latter took a series of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988">unprovoked military actions</a> despite Islamabad’s call for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a> into India’s allegations over the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>The military has confirmed that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910992">13 security personnel</a>, including members of the Pakistan Army and the Pakistan Air Force, were martyred while over 75 were injured during the confrontation with India.</p>
<p>It has also stated that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910848/40-civilians-11-personnel-martyred-in-indian-strikes">40 civilians</a> — including seven women and 15 children — lost their lives during the Indian aggression, while 121 others sustained injuries.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Britain is working with the US to ensure a ceasefire between India and Pakistan endures and that “confidence-building measures” and dialogue take place, according to its foreign minister David Lammy.</p>
<p>“We will continue to work with the United States to ensure that we get an enduring ceasefire, to ensure that dialogue is happening and to work through with Pakistan and India how we can get to confidence and confidence-building measures between the two sides,” Lammy told <em>Reuters</em> in Islamabad at the end of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911413/india-should-adhere-to-ceasefire-pakistan-will-respond-if-hostilities-resume-fo#:~:text=FM%20Dar%20appreciates%20UK%20role%20in%20de%2Descalation">two-day visit</a>.</p>

<p>Asked about India’s April 23 suspension of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>, potentially <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911383">squeezing</a> Pakistan’s water supply, Lammy said: “We would urge all sides to meet their treaty obligations.”</p>
<p>The Pakistan Commission on Indus Waters earlier this month <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908458">shared</a> a detailed report with the federal government about massive violations of the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) by New Delhi. Pakistan plans to launch <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907454">international legal action</a> against India over its move to hold the critical water-sharing agreement in abeyance.</p>
<p>Pakistan has said Britain and other countries, in addition to the United States, played a major role in de-escalating the fighting. Diplomats and analysts say the ceasefire <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911472">remains fragile</a>.</p></p>

                <h2>PTI leader Ali Zafar asks world to denuclearise India</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: As India came under fire in the Senate on Friday for recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">unprovoked aggression</a> against Pakistan and for targeting civilians, a PTI leader called for nuclear disarmament of the hostile neighbour for being an irresponsible atomic power.</p>
<p>On recent tensions with India, PTI’s parliamentary leader in the House Barrister Ali Zafar said India had proved itself to be an irresponsible state that violates international law. “India’s nuclear arsenal poses a threat to peace in the region and beyond. The international community must act to denuclearise India in the interest of humanity,” he said.</p>
<p>He said India’s propaganda that Pakistan’s nuclear weapons were not safe has failed and it has shown that its own nuclear assets were not safe.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>He said the international community must denuclearise India and stop giving it arms, as these could be used against innocent civilians. He said the recent hostility and the powerful response to aggression shattered India’s dream of regional hegemony.</p>
<p>“Our air force proved during a single night to be the king of the skies,” he said, adding that after recent developments, the Kashmir dispute has once again taken the centre stage. He advised Indians to get rid of extremist Narendra Modi and choose a leader who wants to live in peace with neighbours.</p>

<p>“The Indian nation should see where Modi is taking them,” he said, adding that  the people and political parties were united for Pakistan. “The war is not over yet. There is no need to celebrate much. Modi is heartbroken, he is like a wounded rat,” he said.</p>
<p>He also propos­ed setting up a parliamentary committee on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>. Stressing that national unity was need of the hour, Ali Zafar called for ending the persecution of PTI. He demanded the immediate release of all political prisoners and the withdrawal of fabricated cases against PTI leaders.</p>
<p>PML-N parliamentary leader Irf­a­nul Haq Siddiqui in his speech said Pakistan stands for peace but was capable enough to defend its ter­­ritorial integrity and sovereignty.</p>
<p>He said that the national unity witnessed during recent tensions, will also be remembered as a shining chapter in Pakistan’s history. Senator Siddiqui said that the most positive aspect of India’s aggression and Pakistan’s resounding victory is that today, the government and opposition stand united. “This national unity is the real success,” he remarked.</p>
<p>Criticising India’s regional policies, he noted that India’s history was marred by strained relations with neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan, or Sri Lanka, India has never maintained friendly ties with any of them. India can never turn Pakistan into Gaza, and this message has been firmly conveyed to it. Our valiant forces have proven that wars are not just fought with weapons, but with spirit, courage, and determination,” Mr Siddiqui said.</p>
<p><strong>Nawaz’s silence questioned</strong></p>
<p>The House also witnessed an up­­roar and a war of words after PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif’s silence du­­ring heightened tension with India was questioned by a PTI lawmaker.</p>
<p>PTI Senator Aon Abbas Buppi said the people of Pakistan demonstrated an unprecedented unity when the country had to face an unprovoked aggression. The atmosphere became tense when Buppi turned his guns towards Nawaz Sharif and chided him for keeping mum during escalation of tensions with the hostile neighbour.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>He drew a comparison between PTI founder Imran Khan with PML-N supreme Nawaz Sharif in the conflict and said that his party leader Imran Khan in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/AonAbbasPTI/status/1923317112170230132" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a> said those who cannot stand against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s war were not Pakistanis.</p>
<p>“At the same time, some people remained silent for two weeks and did not utter a single word against Modi. Perhaps, they have some business interests,” he said. “It would be written in history that a person whose party was imposed on the nation and was the biggest beneficiary of the system and whose daughter was the chief minister (of a province) didn’t utter a word about Modi till today.”</p>
<p>He also targeted Defence Minis­ter Khawaja Muhammad Asif and said that no one demeaned and em­­b­­arrassed the country more than him.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Amidst an uproar in the House Presiding Officer Senator Sherry Rehman noted that Senator Buppi has tried to “pollute the atmosphere of the House, though no one did this during the session. “You are in violation of the spirit of the House. Ple­ase take your words back,” she said.</p>
<p>Parliamentary Leader of PML-N in the House Senator Irfan Siddiqui said that the leadership of all political parties was always respected on a reciprocal basis. He stressed that his party could criticise PTI leader Imran Khan for a number of reasons, but insisted this was not an occasion for such things. “If you disrespect my leader, your leader will also be disrespected,” he added.</p>
<p>PTI Senator Humayun Mohmand sarcastically said that he was misunderstood that Mr Sharif was silent over the issue but it was Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari who revea­led that the ex-premier designed the whole operation against India. “Perhaps he was designing this operation while sitting at a secret place,” he added. The PTI lawmaker also said the superior judiciary has undermined its independence and said that it was now trying to steal the reserved parliamentary seats from PTI.</p>
<p>“This practice of judiciary is a threat amid the ongoing war with India,” he added. PPP lawmaker Jam Saifullah Dharejo staged a walkout from the House after Presiding Officer Senator Sherry Rehman refused to allow him to deliver a written speech.</p>
