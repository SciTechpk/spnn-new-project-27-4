            <p><p>RAWALPINDI: A toddler who went missing while playing in the street was found dead in a sewerage line in Ratta Amral on Thursday,  allegedly murdered by a boy, a close relative of the little girl.</p>

<p>Maryam, one-year-old girl, while playing outside her house in Mohalla Qazian Ratta Amral with other children, went missing.</p>

<p>After the disappearance, Maryam’s parents started a search for her, but failing to find clues, her grandmother, Ms Musarat Bibi, sought police help and registered a case under the relevant section of the law.</p>

<p>During the search, the missing girl’s body was found in the main sewerage line of Dhoke Ratta on Thursday. The local police reached the spot and shifted the body to the District Headquarters Hospital for post-mortem. An investigation launched to ascertain the facts behind the tragic death of the little girl.</p>

<p>Later on, police arrested the accused, who was identified as Azan Sultan, 10 and a half years old, and lived in the same house. The accused boy was shifted to the protection bureau by the local court.</p>

<p>During the initial investigation, the accused revealed that he had picked up the girl and put her head in the sewerage line water, which claimed her life. The police investigating officer said while quoting the accused as: “I didn’t like her.”</p>

<p>Police said that the CCTV footage helped the police to trace the accused as he could be seen picking up the girl from the street and taking her away. The girl’s body was handed over to her parents after the postmortem.</p>

<p>The girl’s father was an employee in the cantonment board. The father of the accused is an addict, as his mother had left his house and resided with her parents. </p>

            <p><p>Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to cut off government contracts to Elon Musk’s companies and the world’s richest man suggested the US president should be impeached, marking a stark end to an unlikely alliance and leaving onlookers wondering what was next.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914033">hostilities</a> between the former allies intensified when the president criticized Tesla CEO Musk in the Oval Office and the pair then lobbed verbal barbs at each other on their social media platforms: Trump’s Truth Social and Musk’s X.</p>
<p>“The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump posted.</p>
<p>Tesla shares closed down over 14 per cent on Thursday, losing about $150 billion in market value in the largest single-day decline in value in its history.</p>
<p>Minutes after the closing bell, Musk replied, “Yes,” to a post on X saying Trump should be impeached, an unthinkable move in Congress where Trump’s Republicans hold majorities in both chambers.</p>

</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The trouble between the two started brewing days ago, when Musk denounced Trump’s sweeping tax-cut and spending <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912732">bill</a>.</p>
<p>The president initially held his tongue while Musk campaigned to torpedo the bill, saying it would add too much to the nation’s $36.2 trillion in debt.</p>
<p>Trump broke his silence on Thursday, telling reporters he was “very disappointed” in Musk.</p>
<p>“Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” Trump said.</p>
<p>As Trump spoke, Musk responded in real time on X.</p>
<p>“Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930667528696828120" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Musk, who spent nearly $300 million backing Trump and other Republicans in last year’s election.</p>
<p>In another post, Musk asserted that Trump’s signature tariffs would push the US into a recession later this year.</p>

<p>Musk’s businesses also include rocket company and government contractor SpaceX and its satellite unit Starlink.</p>
<p>Musk, whose space business plays a critical role in the US government’s space program, said that as a result of Trump’s threats he would <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930718684819112251" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">begin decommissioning</a> SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft. Dragon is the only US spacecraft capable of sending astronauts to the International Space Station. Late on Thursday, Musk backed off the threat.</p>
<p>And in a sign of a possible detente to come, Musk subsequently <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930798791806050496" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>: “You’re not wrong,” in response to billionaire investor Bill Ackman saying Trump and Musk should make peace.</p>

<p>Trump and Musk are both political fighters with a penchant for using social media to attack their perceived enemies, and many observers had predicted a falling out.</p>
<p>Musk had become one of Trump’s most visible advisers as <a class="link--external" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1892748&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjusoOngNyNAxV6YEEAHbShKVcQFnoECBkQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0tNrfyso1xR9c5bRAX-fQK" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">head</a> of the Department of Government Efficiency, which mounted a sweeping and controversial effort to downsize the federal workforce and slash spending.</p>
<p>After leaving that role, Musk this week targeted what Trump has named his “big, beautiful bill”, calling it a “disgusting abomination” that would deepen the federal deficit.</p>
<p>His attacks amplified a rift within the Republican Party that could threaten the bill’s prospects in the Senate.</p>
<p>Nonpartisan analysts say Trump’s bill could add $2.4tr to $5tr to the nation’s $36.2tr in debt.</p>
<p>A prolonged feud between the pair could make it harder for Republicans to keep control of Congress in next year’s midterm elections if it leads to a loss of Musk’s campaign spending or erodes support for Trump in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>“Elon really was a significant portion of the ground game this last cycle,” said a Republican strategist with ties to Musk and the Trump administration who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>“If he sits out the midterms, that worries me.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Musk posted that “in November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.”</p>
<p>Musk had already said he planned to curtail his political spending in the future. Musk’s increasing focus on politics provoked widespread protests at Tesla sites, driving down sales while investors fretted that Musk’s attention was too divided.</p></p>

            <p><p><strong>• Bilawal urges world to stand against Indian aggression, says water an existential issue for Pakistan<br />
• Ex-US diplomat endorses call for neutral Pahalgam probe, regrets Pak-US ties ‘still stuck in the past’<br />
• VP Vance meets Indian delegation as US officials assure Pakistan of ‘equal representation’</strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON: As fomer foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari blamed India for pushing South Asia towards the first nuclear war over water, a former US ambassador to Pakistan endorsed Islamabad’s demand for an independent inquiry into the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909771/dg-ispr-says-india-has-no-evidence-for-pahalgam-incident-or-alleged-attacks-in-last-48-hours">Pahalgam incident</a>, which led to a full-blown conflict between Islamabad and New Delhi.</p>
<p>At a policy forum hosted by the Middle East Institute (MEI) in Washington, former US ambassador to Islamabad Anne Patterson stressed that the United States-Pakistan relationship was hindered by mistrust, despite ongoing security cooperation.</p>
<p>“The US-Pakistan relationship is so stuck in the past that India was not required to present any forensic or investigative evidence after the Pahal­gam attack,” Ms Patterson said.</p>
<p>“It (India) had simply said that Pakistan was still engaged in terrorism. And international observers, I hate to say, tended to believe this claim.”</p>
<p>She added, “This incident almost led to a nuclear war, and it’s critically important to get to the bottom of what happened. An independent investigation, possibly by agencies like the FBI or Scotland Yard, should be the first step.”</p>
<p>Mr Bhutto-Zardari highlighted Pakistan’s core concerns: terrorism, Kashmir, and the ongoing water dispute with India. “Water wars used to be a theory. India shutting off Pakistan’s water supply is laying the foundation for the first nuclear water war,” he said, referring to repeated <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">violations</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>.</p>
<p>“We have said that cutting off our water supply will be an act of war. We don’t say it in a jingoistic manner… It’s an existential crisis for us. Any country would fight for its survival and for its water,” he added, urging global powers to take a firm position against what he described as Indian aggression.</p>
<p><strong>Balancing act</strong></p>
<p>Delegations from both countries are in Washington this week, engaging with US officials, who are trying to strike a delicate diplomatic balance.</p>
<p>The Pakistani <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow">delegation</a> includes Senator Sherry Rehman, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt, and Jalil Abbas Jilani.</p>
<p>The Indian delegation is led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and includes Shambhavi Chaudhary (Lok Janshakti Party), Sarfaraz Ahmed (Jharkhand Mukti Morcha), G. M. Harish Balayogi (Telugu Desam Party), Shashank Mani Tripathi, Tejaswi Surya, and Bhubaneswar Kalita (all from the BJP), Mallikarjun Devda (Shiv Sena), former Indian Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu, and Shiv Sena MP Milind Deora.</p>
<p>The Indian delegation met US Vice President JD Vance on Thursday, taking advantage of his links to India.</p>
<p>Michael Kugelman, a US scholar of South Asian affairs based in Washington, described the visits as “a high-octane diplomatic effort on both sides meant to secure buy-in from Washington on key positions at a high-stakes moment for both Islamabad and New Delhi”.</p>
<p>He noted that India’s approach is “especially striking” as New Delhi typically avoids internationalising its bilateral disputes.</p>
<p>Mr Kugelman explained: “India’s position is that Pakistan isn’t sufficiently acting against terror. … For Pakistan, it’s about getting Washington to view New Delhi in ways that it tends not to: as untrustworthy and as an aggressor. In effect, each side is trying to not only advance its narratives but also change perceptions in Washington.”</p>
<p>He added: “Here, New Delhi has an advantage as Washington, on bipartisan levels, tends to sympathise more with Indian than Pakistani positions. And that includes most importantly not wading into the Kashmir issue.”</p>
<p>Other scholars, however, urged the United States to manage engagements with both sides carefully and equitably.</p>
<p>Hassan Abbas, another scholar associated with the National Defence University in Washington, noted that Pakistan had “already done a lot to fight terrorism” and was paying the price for it. “Now, Pakistan needs US appreciation and cooperation in dealing with the terrorists. Intelligence-sharing platforms need to be revived.”</p>
<p>Both delegations are also lobbying for their countries on Capitol Hill, meeting senior US lawmakers and chairs of various Congress committees.</p>
<p>The Pakistani delegation met the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and other congressmen and senators. “They told us they are ensuring equal representation for both,” said a Pakistani diplomatic source.</p>
<p>The Indian delegation met members of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees, including senators Dave McCormick, Jacky Rosen, Jim Risch, Mark Warner, John Cornyn, and Elissa Slotkin.</p>
