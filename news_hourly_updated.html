                <h2>May 9 riots: Faisalabad ATC sentences Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz and other PTI leaders to 10 years in jail</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Faisalabad on Thursday sentenced PTI leaders, including Omar Ayub Khan, Shibli Faraz, Hamid Raza, and Zartaj Gul, to 10 years of imprisonment for their involvement in the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1752003">PTI supporters</a>, protesting the party founder Imran Khan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">arrest</a>, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">attacking</a> the Lahore corps commander‚Äôs residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.</p>
<p>Out of 185 PTI workers accused, 108 have been sentenced by the court today.  PTI‚Äôs Member of the Provincial Assembly (MPA), Junaid Afzal Sahi, was sentenced to three years in prison. Meanwhile, MPA Khayal Ahmad Kastro, Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Zain Qureshi, and former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry have been acquitted in the cases.</p>
<p>Reacting to the development, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the party will challenge the decision in the high courts.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media in Islamabad today, Gohar said: ‚ÄúWe will raise the issue with PTI Founder Imran Khan on the future course of action regarding whether we should return to the parliament or launch a movement.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that the ‚Äúpolitical cases against PTI members were baseless‚Äù, adding that the PTI believed in running the system instead of believing in extremism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe do not believe in violence or incitement in politics. Those who have been convicted today do not believe in politics of violence.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a post on X, the PTI condemned the sentences in the strongest terms and branded the cases ‚Äúfalse, fabricated, and politically motivated‚Äù, adding that the opposition leaders in both houses were sentenced to prevent the party‚Äôs mass mobilisation on August 5.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThrough this decision, six of our National Assembly members, three Punjab Assembly members and one senator have been sentenced,‚Äù the party stated. ‚ÄúThis decision is not only a clear violation of the Constitution and the law but also another dark stain on the face of justice.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe judiciary‚Äôs continuous transformation into a rubber stamp at the behest of the state system, issuing such grave verdicts one after another under political pressure without transparent trials, evidence, cross-examination of witnesses, or the right to defence, is a dangerous trend that is completely undermining the credibility of the judicial system,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>The PTI added that this is the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù opposition leaders in both houses of parliament have been sentenced ‚Äúsolely based on their loyalty to Imran Khan‚Äôs political narrative, public representation, and constitutional struggle‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe real purpose of these decisions is not to deliver legal justice but to make a concerted effort to prevent the public protest scheduled for August 5, which was announced by Imran Khan himself,‚Äù the party claimed.</p>

<p>‚ÄúToday‚Äôs sentences and the warrants issued against several other leaders this morning are all links in the chain of fear that the state system harbours toward Imran Khan‚Äôs peaceful public movement.‚Äù</p>
<p>Moreover, the party branded the sentences ‚Äúpart of a systematic plan aimed at suppressing the public awakening and political consciousness emerging under Imran Khan‚Äôs leadership‚Äù.</p>
<p>However, the PTI wrote that these sentences only ignited their resolve, ahead of the protests slated for August 5.</p>
<p>‚ÄúImran Khan‚Äôs vision lives in our hearts, and our loyalty to it remains unwavering.
Our leaders and workers are ready for every sacrifice, because we believe that only those nations survive the darkness of oppression that resist,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914290">May</a>, an ATC in Islamabad sentenced PTI members, including MNA Abdul Latif, to 27 years of imprisonment for attacking a police station during the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>In December 2024, <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7126" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">military courts</a> had sentenced 85 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their involvement in violent attacks on military installations during the riots on May 9.</p>

                <h2>Sindh ombudsperson orders removal of KE CEO for harassing female colleague</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The provincial ombudsman for protection against harassment of women at workplaces on Thursday ordered the removal of K-Electric (KE) Chief Executive Officer Moonis Alvi after finding him guilty of workplace harassment.</p>
<p>Alvi, along with other KE employees, was accused of workplace harassment by the company‚Äôs former chief marketing and communication officer, Mahreen Aziz Khan, said the order issued by provincial ombudsman Justice (R) Shahnawaz Tariq.</p>
<p>In her application, Khan had accused Alvi, Chief People Officer Rizwan Dallia, Chief of Security Col (R) Wahid Asghar, and Member of the Board of Directors and Chairman Board HR Committee Khalid Rafi, of ‚Äúcausing harassment, intimidation and mental agony‚Äù.</p>
<p>The ombudsman‚Äôs order said that Alvi had ‚Äúcommitted harassment, created a hostile environment and caused mental agony at the workplace to [Khan] and her team‚Äù.</p>
<p>Consequently, Alvi was penalised under Section 4(4)(ii)(c) of the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, and ordered removed from his service instantly, along with a penalty of Rs2.5 million, which shall be paid to Khan as compensation within 30 days of the order being passed.</p>
<p>It said that if he failed to pay the fine amount within the stipulated period, it would be recovered as land revenue in terms of the Land Revenue Act, 1967, through the concerned deputy commissioner from Alvi‚Äôs moveable and immoveable properties, including bank accounts.</p>
<p>It also said that his CNIC and passport would be be blocked through Nadra and the Ministry of Interior till recovery of the fine. The order said it was self-executory and in case of its non-compliance, contempt proceedings under Section 10(1)(vi) of the act would be initiated against the concerned delinquent officers.</p>
<p>Regarding the three others accused, the order said: ‚ÄúThere is no direct evidence for committing harassment to the complainant; therefore, they are discharged from the allegations of harassment as alleged by the complainant.‚Äù</p>
<p>Alvi responded to the development in a series of posts on X.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have always upheld the values of integrity and dignity in professional interactions, and I deeply believe in fostering safe and inclusive workplaces for all.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe recent verdict is deeply distressing to me,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhile I respect the legal process and the institutions that uphold it, I must, in good conscience, state that the findings do not reflect the truth of the situation as I experienced it.</p>
<p>He added: ‚ÄúThis has been a painful journey ‚Äî not just professionally, but personally.‚Äù</p>
<p>Alvi said he was currently reviewing the decision with his legal counsel and would be exercising his right to appeal.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is for anyone who feels wronged to be heard. I remain committed to ensuring that the truth is fully brought to light, through all lawful means available,‚Äù he said on X.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Khan‚Äôs legal adviser, Barrister Talal Wasif Qavi, released a statement on her behalf.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis judgment affirms that no one who disrespects the daughters of this nation deserves to hold any office ‚Äî public or private. It is a clear message that power cannot shield misconduct.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAcross Pakistan, working women face harassment in silence. This case proves they no longer need to be afraid. Justice is possible,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis decision serves as a beacon of hope for every working woman who has been forced into silence. We stand with all women who speak out ‚Äî and will continue to fight until dignity and safety are guaranteed in every workplace.‚Äù</p>
<p>Alvi was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922828">reappointed</a> as the CEO by KE‚Äôs board of directors on July 7.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1573865">2020</a>, he and other senior KE officials were booked after another citizen died from electrocution in Karachi. Following the incident, the government formed a special committee to streamline KE operations and called for the removal of its top leadership over poor service during the monsoon.</p>
<p>Sources said government board members had pushed to replace Alvi and the distribution head with professionals capable of handling crises and ensuring efficient service.</p></p>
