            <p><p>A state of emergency has been declared in several districts of Punjab as heavy rains triggered flooding, the spokesperson Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924232">issued</a> a warning of torrential rains with wind-thundershowers that will last throughout the country till July 17.</p>
<p>Director General Punjab WASA Tayyab Farid said that “rivers have overflowed due to heavy rains in Rawalpindi, Chakwal and surrounding areas,” leading to a flood situation.</p>
<p>According to the Rescue Punjab spokesperson Farooq Ahmed, heavy rains have left 33 dead across the province today, while another 176 people have been injured.</p>
<p>“13 people have died in Lahore, eight in Faisalabad, four in Pakpattan, three in Sheikhupura and Okara and one person each in Nankana Sahib and Sahiwal,” said the Rescue Punjab spokesperson.</p>
<p>Citizens have been advised to avoid unnecessary travel, stay away from power lines and open manholes, said DG WASA.</p>
<p>Rescue teams are on alert in the field to deal with the emergency, he added.</p>
<p>PMD has issued a flood alert for the Gawalmandi and Kattarian bridges in Rawalpindi as the water level in the Leh Nullah continues to rise.</p>
<p>“Residents of low-lying areas near Leh Nullah must cooperate with the administration if evacuation becomes necessary,” said DG PDMA.</p>
<p>Strict action to be taken against those gathering or bathing near Leh Nullah, cautioned the PDMA spokesperson.</p>
<p>A local holiday has been announced in Rawalpindi in light of the emergency, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Jhelum, rescue operations were underway to evacuate citizens trapped in floodwaters in Dhok Badar village of the district.</p>
<p>“Over 40 people have been rescued so far”, said DG PDMA, adding that rescue operations will continue until all citizens are safely evacuated.</p>
<p>“Pakistan army personnel and rescue teams are currently rushing the citizens to safe locations,” he added.</p>

<p>Punjab’s Chakwal district recorded 400 millimetres of rain overnight due to a cloudburst, triggering flash floods across the city, a statement from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Thursday.</p>
<p>PDMA Spokesperson Irfan Ali Kathia district said, “Chawkwal recorded 400mm of rain in 10 hours, which left many areas flooded.”</p>
<p>He said water has begun to recede with the cessation of the downpour, and evacuation efforts are underway to rescue the trapped citizens.</p>
<p>The district administration has been alerted, while the relevant rescue departments, including WASA, Rescue 1122, and other civil personnel, have been summoned to the field to oversee rescue efforts, according to District Commissioner Chakwal, Quratul Ain Malik.</p>
<p>In light of the situation, relief arrangements have been made in hospitals and public buildings, Malik said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the PDMA spokesperson Kathia added that the district administration was in contact with the military as well in case of additional support.</p>
<p>“The PDMA assured the district administration of support in rescue and relief efforts and is personally overseeing the rescue operation until all citizens are safely evacuated,” Kathia said. “The district administration is continuing to monitor the situation, particularly in low-lying areas.”</p>
<p>District Emergency Operation Centre, including the PDMA Control Room, are on high alert, he said, adding that “helicopters and other rescue resources are also on standby.”</p>

<p>Heavy downpour in Mandi Bahauddin left one dead and injured 11 people on Wednesday, as the city recorded 210mm of rainfall.</p>
<p>Shah Hussain, 10, drowned while bathing in the rainwater, while in another incident, two boys — Qasim, 08, and Huzaifa, 06— were electrocuted during the rain.</p>
<p>Nine people were injured after the roofs of three dilapidated houses collapsed at separate locations. Areas in the city, such as College Chowk, Pindi Purani, and Jail Chowk, remained submerged under two to four feet of water.</p>
<p>Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday continued its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924716/psx-rebounds-on-hopes-of-ratings-upgrade">renewed</a> bullish momentum as it crossed the 138,000 points during intraday trade.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,785.25 points, or 1.31 per cent, to stand at 138,165.21 points at 11:57am, from the previous close of 136,379.96 points.</p>
<p>The PSX had staged a modest recovery yesterday as investors resumed buying, encouraged by the formation of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924499">high-level committee</a> to address the business community’s concerns over the recently introduced taxation measures.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The development has helped the KSE-100 index gain momentum despite the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924723/businesses-gear-up-for-nationwide-strike">July 19 strike call</a> by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry to protest against the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917240">powers</a> to arrest and prosecute businessmen introduced in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292">federal budget</a>.</p>
<p>Investor confidence was also reinforced by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924444">briefing to Moody’s</a> on Pakistan’s improved macroeconomic outlook and financial stability, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924716/psx-rebounds-on-hopes-of-ratings-upgrade#:~:text=bolstered%20optimism%20for%20a%20potential%20ratings%20upgrade%20in%20Moody%E2%80%99s%20upcoming%20review.">bolstering optimism</a> for a potential ratings upgrade in the credit rating agency’s upcoming review.</p>

            <p><p>A contingent of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) featuring the advanced JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter jets arrived in the United Kingdom to take part in the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) 2025, a statement from the military’s media wing said on Thursday.</p>

<p>“PAF’s participation in RIAT, one of the world’s largest military airshows, underscores Pakistan Air Force’s commitment to showcasing its professional excellence, operational capability and the indigenous strength of its aviation industry,” the ISPR highlighted.</p>
<p>Adding to the operational significance of this international deployment, Pakistan Air Force’s JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighters executed successful Air-to-Air Refuelling operations en route to the UK with the support of a PAF IL-78 aerial refuelling tanker.</p>
<p>“The intricate refuelling operation demonstrated PAF’s long-range operational capabilities and the proficiency of its air and ground crew in conducting extended operations beyond national borders.</p>
<p>“JF-17 Block-III is an EASA Radar and Long Range BVR equipped 4.5 generation multi-role fighter aircraft which is capable of undertaking a wide variety of combat missions, bolstering airpower application in the face of contemporary challenges, thereby strengthening national security,” the statement added.</p>
<p>In May, when Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">downed</a> 5 Indian jets as retaliation for late-night strikes during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/pakistan-india-tensions">Pakistan-India conflict</a>, the PAF formally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">acknowledged</a> a month later that it was the Kamra-based 15 Squadron that led the charge in shooting down the jets.</p>
<p>The event is now considered one of the largest air-to-air engagements in South Asia in more than half a century.</p>
<p>“There is a palpable sense of enthusiasm across the United Kingdom following the recent Pakistan-India conflict, as aviation enthusiasts and defence observers were eagerly looking forward to the arrival of the Pakistan Air Force’s JF-17 Thunder Block-III,” the statement said.</p>
<p>“The aircraft’s combat-proven capabilities and operational excellence have garnered significant global attention, making its appearance at RIAT a highly anticipated highlight in the aerospace and defence community.”</p></p>
