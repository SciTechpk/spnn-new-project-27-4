            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Azerbaijan on Thursday to participate in the 17th Summit of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO).</p>
<p>The summit is set to run from July 3–4 in Khankendi, convening ECO heads of states/governments, ministers, ECO observers, special guests from non-ECO countries and heads of international organisations to achieve development and prosperity through fragile economic integration.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant Tariq Fatemi are accompanying the prime minister during the two-day visit.</p>
<p>The delegation arrived in the city of Shusha for a two-day visit, where it was received by Azerbaijan’s Minister for Culture Adil Karimli, at Fuzuli Airport.</p>

<p>In a statement ahead of the visit, the Foreign Office had said the prime minister would “share Pakistan’s perspective on key regional and global challenges, reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to the ECO Vision 2025, and advocate for enhanced intra-regional trade, transport connectivity, energy cooperation, and sustainable development”.</p>
<p>He will also hold bilateral meetings with other ECO leaders on the sidelines of the summit to discuss matters of mutual interest, the statement added.</p>
<p>The theme of the summit is ‘New ECO Vision for a Sustainable and Climate Resilient Future’.</p>
<p>According to a <a class="link--external" href="https://eco.int/eco-prepares-for-the-17th-eco-summit-in-azerbaijan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by ECO, the summit will convene ECO heads of states/governments, ministers, observers, special guests from non-ECO countries and heads of international organisations to achieve development and prosperity through fragile economic integration.</p>
<p>The summit will feature a “dynamic and inclusive ECO Week”, held from July 1–4 across multiple cities in Azerbaijan. The ECO week will include a series of thematic forums aimed at advancing youth engagement, gender inclusion and economic connectivity within the region.</p>
<p>The 16th ECO summit was held from November 9, 2023, in Tashkent, Uzbekistan and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1788014">attended</a> by then-caretaker prime minister Anwarul Haq Kakar.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday acquitted four PTI members who had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914445">convicted</a> on charges of attacking a police station during the violent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9 riots</a>.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1752003">PTI supporters</a>, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">attacking</a> the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.</p>
<p>An Anti-Terrorism Court in Islamabad had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914290">sentenced</a> PTI MNA Abdul Latif and 11 other party members were convicted under various charges on May 30  for attacking the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1858445">Ramna police station</a> in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Following the verdict, the police took the four of the convicted members present in the court, namely Mira Khan, Muhammad Akram, Shahzeb, and Sohail Khan, into custody.</p>
<p>During today’s hearing, Justice Azam Khan and Justice Khadim Soomro acquitted the four convicts after the prosecution was unable to prove their presence at the scene of the protest based on the witnesses’ accounts.</p>
<p>The convicts had been charged under Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) Sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 186 (obstructing official duty), 188 (disobeying order of a public servant), 324 (attempted mu­r­der), 353 (assault on public servants), 436 (arson) and 440 (misch­ief); Sect­ion 144 of CrPC; and Sec­tion 7 of the Anti Terro­rism Act (ATA), 1997.</p>
<p>They were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment under Section 7 ATA, five years under Section 324 of PPC, four under Section 436, two each under sections 353 and 148.</p>
<p>Additionally, the convicts were sentenced to four years in prison and fined Rs40,000 for burning a motorcycle under Section 426 (punishment for mischief); and a separate sentence of four years in prison and a fine of Rs40,000 under Section 440 (mischief committed after preparation made for causing death or hurt) for vandalising a police station.</p>
<p>A sentence of three-month imprisonment was imposed for interfering in the work of the police under Section 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), one month for violating Section 144 (joining unlawful assembly armed with a deadly weapon), and two years for committing a crime in a group under Section 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in prosecution of common object).</p>
<p>The sentences were to run concurrently.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#the-hearing" id="the-hearing" title="Permalink"></a>The hearing</h2>
<p>PTI lawyer Babar Awan argued that out of the nine prosecution witnesses, only one witness — Assistant Sub-Inspector Muhammad Sharif — was able to identify the accused.</p>
<p>He said, “While it was alleged that the protesters had resorted to firing, no one was injured. The crime must be punished, but the system should not be made into a joke.”</p>
<p>Justice Soomro asked the prosecutor, Nasir Shah, to present the evidence. Shah said that the evidence had been collected but sought more time to present it before the court.</p>
<p>The bench said that if more time was required, then it should have been informed in advance, since now it had heard all the arguments.</p>
<p>It further said that no one was injured, adding that the prosecution should prove the presence of the accused at the scene.</p>
<p>The judges said that the witnesses’ statements did not include any mention that the accused were present at the scene. They questioned whether the court would now hand down sentences based on an identity parade.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the prosecutor said, “What could be a greater act of terrorism than an attack on a police station?”</p></p>

            <p><p>Iran on Thursday affirmed its commitment to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), as it accused Germany of “malice” over its criticism of Tehran’s decision to suspend cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog.</p>
<p>“Iran remains committed to the NPT and its Safeguards Agreement,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a post on X.</p>
<p>“The explicit German support for the bombing of Iran has obliterated the notion that the German regime harbours anything but malice towards Iranians,” he added in response to a German foreign office post criticising the move.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Iran officially <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921637/iran-suspends-cooperation-with-un-nuclear-watchdog">suspended</a> its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, citing the agency’s failure to condemn Israeli and US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.</p>
<p>In a post on X, Germany’s foreign office called on Iran to “reverse this decision,” saying it sends a “devastating message”.</p>
<p>“It eliminates any possibility of international oversight of the Iranian nuclear program, which is crucial for a diplomatic solution,” it added.</p>

<p>Araghchi lambasted what he called Germany’s “explicit support for Israel’s unlawful attack on Iran” on June 13, killing top Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists.</p>
<p>On June 17, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Israel was doing the “dirty work … for all of us” by targeting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.</p>
