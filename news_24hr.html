            <p><p>US President Donald Trump has said said the escalation between India and Pakistan was a “shame”.</p>
<p>He was the first world leader to react to the tense situation after India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">carried out strikes</a> inside Pakistan which also retaliated and reportedly shot down Indian jets.</p>
<p>“It’s a shame. We just heard about it as we were walking in the doors of the Oval [Office],” he said inside the White House after overseeing the swearing-in ceremony for his special envoy, Steve Witkoff.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>“I guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past. They’ve been fighting for a long time,” the US president added.</p>
<p>“I hope it ends very quickly.”</p>
<p>In a statement, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called for restraint from both countries, Associated Press  reported.</p>
<p>“The Secretary-General is very concerned about the Indian military  operations across the Line of Control and international border. He calls  for maximum military restraint from both countries. The world cannot  afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan,” said  the statement.</p>
<p>The US State Department also said it is “closely monitoring developments,” <em>CNN</em> reported.</p>
<p>“We are aware of the reports, however we have no assessment to offer at this time,” the spokesperson said. “This remains an evolving situation,and we are closely monitoring developments.”</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909071/psx-bleeds-as-fears-of-indian-military-action-come-true' target='_blank'><strong>PSX bleeds as fears of Indian military action come true</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday witnessed yet another bloodbath this year — tumbling by as many as 6,500 points in intraday trade — as investors’ fears of a military action by India against Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">came true last night</a>.</p>
<p>The Pakistani military brought down five Indian jets in retaliation for late-night strikes launched by its neighbouring country at six sites in Punjab and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index decreased by 6,560.82 points, or 5.78 per cent, to stand at 107,007.68 from the last close of 113,568.50 when the market opened at 9:30am.</p>
<p>Due to the massive dip, the market was immediately suspended briefly.</p>
<p>This marked the second-largest intra-day plunge (points-wise), ranking next to the nearly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902788#:~:text=The%20benchmark%20KSE%2D100%20index%20witnessed%20a%20record%20intra%2Dday%20plunge%20(points%2Dwise)%20of%208%2C687.68%20points">8,700-point loss</a> that followed the United States’ <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810">tariff announcement</a> last month.</p>
<p>However, the market started recovering slightly, reaching 112,457.37 points at around 10:34am, before declining to 111,171.92 points at 12pm — nearly 2,400 points below yesterday’s close.</p>
<p>“The market opened under pressure today following Indian strikes on unarmed civilians in Pakistan,” said Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities.</p>
<p>“Some selling has been observed, though volumes remain low as investors assess the evolving situation,” Farooq said, adding that recovery was expected once tensions begin to de-escalate.</p>
<p>Shahbaz Ashraf, chief investment officer at Frim Ventures, also attributed the sell-off to “heightened geopolitical tensions following reports of Indian strikes on multiple Pakistani locations”.</p>
<p>“The flare-up has rattled investor sentiment, with fears of further escalation weighing on the market,” he said. However, Shahbaz added, analysts remained “cautiously optimistic, hoping the conflict will remain short-lived with likely mediation from global powers”.</p>
<p>“Importantly, with macroeconomic indicators showing signs of recovery, market watchers believe this correction could be temporary. Many view the pullback as a potential buying opportunity, especially for long-term investors looking to accumulate quality stocks at lower valuations,” he noted, explaining the gains witnessed later.</p>
<p>Samiullah Tariq, head of research at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, said the impact of today’s selling pressure would be short-term and the market would “recover once this ends”.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, also observed that the PSX was “feeling the impact” of last night’s developments.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Echoing Shahbaz’s opinion, Awais said the plunge “may present a buying opportunity, as we do not expect the situation to escalate further”.</p>
<p>In the past few days, panicky investors have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908797/shares-at-psx-fail-to-sustain-early-gains-dip-by-500-points">continued</a> to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907535/shares-at-psx-slump-on-heightened-pakistan-india-tensions">reduce their holdings</a> as Pakistan had expressed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">heightened possibility</a> of a military action <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">by India</a> in the wake of the latter’s allegations regarding a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.</p>

<p>International rating agency Moody’s has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908608">warned</a> that sustained India-Pakistan tensions could negatively affect Pakistan’s growth.</p>
<p>It also said that escalating tensions could cause a setback to nascent macroeconomic stability and also disrupt Pakistan’s access to foreign funding flows.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Moody’s noted that macroeconomic conditions in India would remain stable. However, it did stress that higher defence spending could impact India’s “fiscal strength and slow its fiscal consolidation”.</p></p>

            <p><p>India said it attacked Pakistan early on Wednesday following a deadly attack on tourists in Kashmir last month. Pakistan reported eight deaths and said it had responded to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/pakistan-india-tensions#1909044">Indian strikes</a>.</p>
<p>This is what global leaders have said about the latest hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours:</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#chinese-foreign-ministry" id="chinese-foreign-ministry" title="Permalink"></a>Chinese foreign ministry</h2>
<p>“India and Pakistan are neighbours that cannot be moved apart, and they are also China’s neighbours,” a foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We call on both India and Pakistan to prioritise peace and stability, remain calm and restrained and avoid taking actions that further complicate the situation,” the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>Beijing also offered to play a mediating role in reducing tensions.</p>
<p>“We are willing to work together with the international community and continue to play a constructive role in easing the current tensions,” foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#uk-trade-secretary-jonathon-reynolds" id="uk-trade-secretary-jonathon-reynolds" title="Permalink"></a>UK Trade Secretary Jonathon Reynolds</h2>
<p>The UK is ready to support both India and Pakistan to de-escalate tensions, Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said.</p>
<p>“Our message would be that we are a friend, [and] a partner to both countries. We stand ready to support both countries. Both have a huge interest in regional stability, in dialogue, in de-escalation and anything we can do to support that, we are here and willing to do,” he told <em>BBC radio.</em></p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#russian-foreign-ministry" id="russian-foreign-ministry" title="Permalink"></a>Russian foreign ministry</h2>
<p>Russia’s foreign ministry in a statement said it was “deeply concerned by the escalation of military confrontation,” and called on the parties to “exercise restraint to prevent further deterioration.”</p>
<p>The foreign ministry hoped the tensions could be “resolved through peaceful, diplomatic means.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#japan-chief-cabinet-secretary-yoshimasa-hayashi" id="japan-chief-cabinet-secretary-yoshimasa-hayashi" title="Permalink"></a>Japan Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi</h2>
<p>“In regard to the terrorist act that occurred in Kashmir on April 22, our country firmly condemns such acts of terrorism. Furthermore, we express strong concern that this situation may lead to further retaliatory exchanges and escalate into a full-scale military conflict. For the peace and stability of South Asia, we strongly urge both India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and stabilise the situation through dialogue.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#french-foreign-minister-jean-noel-barrot" id="french-foreign-minister-jean-noel-barrot" title="Permalink"></a>French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot</h2>
<p>France also called on India and Pakistan to show restraint.</p>
<p>“We understand India’s desire to protect itself against the scourge of terrorism, but we obviously call on both India and Pakistan to exercise restraint to avoid escalation and, of course, to protect civilians,” Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, said in an interview on <em>TF1 television.</em></p>
<p>“I don’t think anyone has an interest in a lasting confrontation between India and Pakistan,” he said, adding that he would be speaking with his counterparts in India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Earlier today, US President Donald Trump expressed disappointment over the incident, calling it a “shame”, while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio hoped for engagement towards a peaceful resolution. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged both countries to exercise “maximum military restraint”.</p></p>
