            <p><p>US President Donald Trump said on Friday that representatives from Pakistan are coming to the United States next week as Islamabad seeks to make a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">deal on tariffs</a>.</p>
<p>Pakistan faces a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">potential 29 per cent tariff</a> on its exports to the US due to a $3 billion trade surplus with the world’s biggest economy, under tariffs announced by Washington last month on countries around the world.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s formal <a class="link--external" href="https://pakungeneva.pk/un-resolutions-on-jammu-kashmir/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">negotiations</a> with the United States on reciprocal tariffs started earlier in the day with a phone call between Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, a press release from the finance ministry said.</p>
<p>“Pakistan representatives are coming in next week,” Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews after departing Air Force One.</p>
<p>“And India, as you know, we’re very close to making a deal with India. And I wouldn’t have any interest in making a deal with either (Pakistan and India) if they were going to be at war with each other. I went that and I let them know,” the US president stressed.</p>
<p>The developments follow a recent military confrontation between Pakistan and India over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.</p>
<p>New Delhi, based on the allegations, launched a series of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> in Pakistan in early May, killing civilians. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>. After intercepting drones sent by India on May 8 and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.</p>

<p>Indian Trade Minister Piyush Goyal visited Washington recently to advance trade talks, with both sides aiming to sign an interim agreement by early July.</p>
<p>India faces 26pc tariffs on shipments to the US.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> reported last week that India is likely to allow US firms to bid for contracts worth over $50 billion, mainly from federal entities, as it negotiates a trade deal with Washington.</p>
<p>The increase in trade tariffs on Pakistani products, amongst a global tariff announcement by US President Donald Trump, which were paused, could have a devastating impact on Pakistan’s important exports and serve as a wake-up call for diversification, according to a state-owned think tank.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics warned that these tariffs could have a “devastating impact” on the country’s export sector, translating into an annual loss of $1.1-1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Trump’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810/trumps-tariffs-stoke-global-trade-war-as-china-eu-hit-back">tariffs</a>, implemented on April 2, introduced a 10 per cent baseline tariff for every country the US trades with, and additional reciprocal tariffs on rivals and allies alike.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump also reaffirmed his claim of having brokered the May 2025 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">Pakistan-India ceasefire</a> — a statement that continues to irk New Delhi but is quietly welcomed in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Speaking at a White House press conference on Friday, President Trump said his intervention “stopped India and Pakistan from fighting”, adding that the conflict could have “turned out into a nuclear disaster”.</p>
<p>“We talk trade and we said we can’t trade with people that are shooting at each other and potentially using nuclear weapons,” he said. “They’re great leaders in those countries. And they understood and they agreed and that all stopped.”</p>
<p>This marks the fifth time President Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">publicly cited his role</a> in halting the conflict. He underscored America’s power to both wage and prevent wars, stating, “Ultimately, we can fight better than anybody,” but added, “we’re stopping others from fighting also.”</p>
<p>He also expressed gratitude to the leaders of both South Asian nations, as well as his own diplomatic team. “I want to thank the leaders of India, the leaders of Pakistan, and I want to thank my people also,” he said.</p>

<p>A Pakistani delegation, led by PPP chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, will arrive in New York on Sunday. It is expected to meet UN Secretary-General António Guterres, the current president of the UN General Assembly, and ambassadors of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. The delegation will also address a joint session of OIC envoys during its two-day stay in New York.</p>
<p>The group will travel to Washington on June 3, where it hopes to meet Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other senior US officials. The visit also includes meetings with congressional lawmakers, policy experts from major think tanks, and US media representatives.</p>
<p>While Pakistani officials have been cautious in public, they privately acknowledge that President Trump played a significant role in defusing the recent conflict. In contrast, India has repeatedly rejected the notion of outside involvement, claiming that the ceasefire was initiated by Pakistan and achieved without US mediation.</p>
<p>Curiously, Islamabad denies making such a request and instead credits President Trump — creating an unusual diplomatic convergence between Pakistani officials and the current US president.</p>
<p>Trump’s latest comments are seen in Islamabad as a timely morale booster for the visiting delegation. Pakistani diplomats say they not only endorse his claim but would welcome a broader US role in South Asia, particularly in resolving the <a class="link--external" href="https://pakungeneva.pk/un-resolutions-on-jammu-kashmir/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kashmir dispute</a>. Trump had earlier underscored the need to resolve this issue, calling it a “festering wound” that must be addressed to ensure lasting peace in the region.</p>
<p>President Trump’s remarks were part of a broader narrative positioning his second term as one focused on restoring global stability. “When I left, we had no wars, we had no problems. We defeated ISIS, we rebuilt our military, and we had no inflation,” he said. “And when I came back, we had a lot of inflation. We had wars all over the place.”</p>
<p>Listing current global crises — including the war in Ukraine, the Israeli invasion of Gaza, and tensions in the Indo-Pacific — President Trump cited South Asia as another region where US leadership has made a difference. “And now we have something where we’re really healing a lot of that,” he said, casting himself as a stabilising force in a turbulent world.</p>
<p>His assertion of having averted a “nuclear disaster” is likely to prompt strong reactions in diplomatic circles, particularly in New Delhi, which has consistently rejected third-party involvement in its disputes with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Yet, the timing of his remarks is significant. The Pakistani delegation’s visit to Washington aims to focus on trade, regional security, and reshaping US-Pakistan ties amid shifting global alliances and domestic political transitions. President Trump’s comments may complicate the diplomatic tone — or, for Islamabad, provide an opening to highlight its international relevance and US engagement.</p>
<p>Analysts say even if the president’s role in the ceasefire is exaggerated, the fact that hostilities ceased suggests that diplomatic pressure — including from Washington — was a factor. Given President Trump’s preference for direct engagement and bold claims, his involvement cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>For Pakistan, the ceasefire remains a rare instance where a US president publicly acknowledged playing a role in reducing South Asian tensions — something successive governments in Islamabad have long sought.</p>
<p>As one Pakistani official noted privately: “It doesn’t matter who claims the credit, as long as the firing stops.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Christine Fair, a US scholar once seen as aligned with pro-Indian perspectives, challenged New Delhi’s narrative of success in the recent Pakistan-India conflict.</p>
<p>“Indians who fail to see the victories that Pakistan snatched from the latest skirmish will fail to understand just why India has not and will not deter Pakistan,” she wrote in a post on X.</p></p>

<p>KARACHI: Business leaders have advised the government to avoid surprises in the upcoming federal budget by proposing significant relief for the salaried class, including a reduction in the general sales tax (GST) and the phasing out of the super tax.</p>
<p>In addition to balancing the external account and managing the fiscal deficit, Pakistan Business Council CEO Ehsan Malik stated that there is now an urgent need to augment <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913055">defence spending</a> through higher export earnings.</p>
<p>The PBC’s budget proposals aimed to fiscally incentivise the rapid growth of exports and the indigenisation of inputs. Given the constraints on the fiscal account, the council sought a gradual reduction in corporate and super taxes, as well as the withdrawal of multiple taxation on inter-corporate dividends.</p>
<p>Relief was requested for salaried employees, as was a reduction in GST, which at 18pc incentivised evasion. He emphasised that a higher tax-to-GDP ratio should be the result of business growth, not the outcome of further taxes on those already taxed.</p>

<p>He sought a gradual reduction in corporate and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899088">sales tax rates</a>, along with the phasing out of the super tax in three years.</p>
<p>“We urge the government not to throw in surprises and engage all the stakeholders for tax reforms along with ensuring policy consistency,” Aleem added.</p>

<p>Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Senior Vice-President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon said the focus should be on boosting exports as the government has been claiming it would not go to International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the future after the completion of the ongoing $7bn Extended Fund Facility.</p>
<p>“In this scenario, the government should frame policies to develop the export sector,” he added.</p>
<p>He urged the government to avoid “new taxes” on export-oriented sectors as they would increase production costs and make goods uncompetitive globally.</p>

<p>Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Jawed Bilwani stressed the need to enhance industrial competitiveness, promote exports, broaden the tax base, and eliminate structural inefficiencies in the economic framework.</p>
<p>The past fiscal year has seen significant macroeconomic improvements, offering an opportunity to implement targeted policy interventions that can drive sustained economic growth.</p>
<p>“We strongly advocate for a broad-based, transparent, and predictable tax framework that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910790">expands the tax net</a>, removes distortions, and fosters a fairer distribution of the tax burden,” he said, adding that rationalising aggressive tax regimes, eliminating inefficiencies, and simplifying tax procedures will be essential in ensuring a pro-growth fiscal environment.</p>
<p>Mr Bilwani noted that the SME sector, which serves as a backbone of economic activity and employment, continues to struggle due to limited access to finance and an unsupportive regulatory framework.</p>

<p>He called for a harmonised GST system, faster refunds, gradual reduction of sales tax to 15pc, and abolition of the additional sales tax to reduce informality.</p>
<p>He demanded an end to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1839346">Fata/Pata tax exemptions</a>, overhauling welfare schemes, and adopting digitalisation, and a one-window operation. Ahmed also urged the restoration of zero-rated status for export sectors and essential goods.</p>

            <p><p>• Justice Mandokhail issues 36-page dissenting note against majority decision to uphold civilians’ military trial<br />
• Regrets govt opted to burden military courts instead of improving judicial system</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail of the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench on Friday issued a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/downloads_judgements/i.c.a._5_2023_dn.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">36-page dissenting note</a> challenging the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909113">majority verdict</a> that upheld the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881338">trial of civilians</a> in military courts and raising questions about the use of military courts for civilian cases.</p>
<p>“Nowhere in the world, courts martial try terrorism-related cases,” said Justice Mandokhail, a member of the seven-judge constitutional bench, in the dissenting note.</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, in a minority judgement on May 7, set aside <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1797503">intra-court appeals</a> against the Oct 23, 2023, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783065/may-9-riots-sc-declares-military-trials-of-civilians-null-and-void">five-judge judgement</a> that had declared the military trials of civilians illegal.</p>
<p>While brushing aside the perception that civil courts had failed to tackle the menace of terrorism and courts martial were the only solution to the problem, Justice Mandokhail explained that courts martial did not have jurisdiction to deal with cases of terrorism or other criminal matters.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He regretted criticism of criminal courts was unfounded and was not supported by any reliable data. It was true that the conviction rate by the ordinary criminal courts was low, but it did not mean that the courts did not have the will to do proper justice, he added.</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail also expressed regrets that the elected governments instead of addressing the politically motivated and frivolous cases, improving the system of investigation, establishing a mechanism of collecting truthful witnesses and protecting them, providing workable atmosphere, protection to the judges and improving the judicial system, expressed no confidence in criminal courts by opting to burden the courts martial with such a huge responsibility.</p>
<p>According to him, <a class="link--external" href="https://pakistancode.gov.pk/pdffiles/administrator5a436c410d7fc88fc27dae7b864c6f63.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pakistan Army Act</a> relates to members of the armed forces to ensure proper discharge of their duties and maintenance of discipline, as provided by Article 8(3a) of the Constitution and, therefore, does not offer fundamental rights to persons under military discipline.</p>
<p>On the right to appeal against decisions of the court martial, Justice Mandokhail observed there was always a possibility of mistakes or errors in court rulings. He noted that an appeal to a higher, independent and impartial forum was a universally recognised tool to scrutinise the decision of fora below so as to eliminate the slightest instance of miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p>Appeal being a continuation of trial was, therefore, an important substantial ingredient of the fundamental principles of fair trial and due process, without which, the fundamental rights of individuals would be compromised.</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail said the military officers presiding over the courts martial may be good at disposing military-related matters, but had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884399">no judicial expertise</a> and experience to deal with criminal cases. Courts martial cannot be considered on a par with the judicial officers who are not only law graduates but also with the only function to deliver justice and having vast judicial experience at their credit, he emphasised.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The judicial officers were independent, impartial and without the influence, command and control of the executive, he noted.</p>
<p>He regretted that the federal and provincial governments, instead of attending to the causes of terrorism and taking preventive measures, were trying to achieve their goal through courts martial, which was “not a correct approach”.</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail was of the opinion that expecting ordinary criminal courts to convict persons without evidence and material, connecting them with the offence, would amount to violating the principle of natural justice, fair trial and due process.</p>
<p>He noted that the Pakistan Army Act was a disciplinary statute related to members of the armed forces as provided by Article 8(3a) of the Constitution and therefore, did not offer fundamental rights to persons under military discipline.</p>
<p>However, on the effect of taking away fundamental rights in civilians’ trial, Justice Mandokhail observed that these rights were inalienable, unless expressly taken away by the Constitution. Taking away, abridging or denying the fundamental rights, had serious consequences, he observed, as it could undermine the fundamental principle of democracy, compromise the well-being of a citizen, and amount to giving a licence to the executive to abuse, torture, illegally detain and treat the citizens inhumanely.</p>
<p>Besides, the denial of fundamental rights would have a negative impact upon the economic treaties and domestic and foreign investments, Justice Mandokhail observed, adding that violating or denying the fundamental rights could weaken the rule of law.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Article 245 prescribed the functions of the armed forces, limited to defending the state from external aggression and internal threat, while Article 175(3) mandated that the judiciary shall be separated from the executive, he wrote.</p>
<p>As the function of the armed forces did not include the prosecution of general criminal offences committed by civilians, exercising powers beyond the defined scope was without jurisdiction, he noted.</p>
<p>According to him, indulging courts martial in adjudication of criminal cases of a general nature in respect of the general public would subject them to strong criticism in either case of conviction or acquittal, which will result in loss of trust and confidence in the army, whose function is only to defend and protect the country.</p>
