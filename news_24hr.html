            <p><p>Yaum-i-Ashura processions commenced across the country on Sunday amid tight security, police said.</p>
<p>Yaum-i-Ashura is observed every year on Muharram 10 with solemnity to pay homage to Imam Husain — the grandson of Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) — and other martyrs of Karbala.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Karachi Traffic Police issued a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921828">traffic plan</a> for Muharram 8 to 10, outlining the procession routes as well as alternative traffic flows.</p>
<p>Stringent security measures are being taken across the country, such as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920725/army-to-be-deployed-across-country-for-security-during-muharram">army deployment</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919931">crackdown</a> on sectarian content and hate mongers, ahead of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920308">Ashura</a> (Muharram 10), being observed today.</p>
<p>In Karachi, the Ashura majlis commenced at Nishtar Park at around 8:30am, according to an alert from the police. “The number of participants is approximately 3500 to 4000 and it is being led by Shahenshah Hussain Naqvi.”</p>
<p>Traffic has been closed from main Numaish to MA Jinnah Road up to Kharadar  Husseinia Irania Imam Bargah, with the exception of Bab-e-Urdu Chowk, Karachi traffic police said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Additionally, 733 NGOs, as well as senior officers of Karachi Police, and 6,271 head constables and constables are performing duty today. Expert police snipers have also been deployed alongside the main procession.</p>
<p>“Traffic police officers and personnel have been deployed to maintain traffic flow on the main procession routes and crossings, including alternative traffic routes arranged for the 10th Muharram procession, so as to keep the traffic flowing by keeping the public safe from any inconvenience,” said a statement from the office of Karachi’s additional inspector general of police.</p>
<p>“Karachi Police is providing complete security to the mourners participating in the 10th Muharram processions.”</p>
<p>The statement urged the public to keep an eye on their surroundings and immediately inform the police on Madadgar 15 of any suspicious or unusual situation.</p>

<p>Similar arrangements have been made across Punjab on the instructions of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, with more than 12,000 rescuers deployed for Ashura and routine rescue operations, according to Emergency Services Secretary Dr Rizwan Naseer.</p>
<p>“Across Punjab, 815 ambulances, 2,166 motorbikes, and 316 fire and rescue emergency vehicles have been deployed,” he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Lahore, 55 emergency ambulances, 300 rescue motorbikes, 44 fire and rescue and specialised emergency vehicles have been deployed, as well as 1,350 rescuers deployed.</p>
<p>In Islamabad, over 4,000 police officers and personnel were deployed to ensure the safety of 12 processions and 48 religious gatherings scheduled for the day.</p>
<p>Inspector General of Police (IGP) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi is personally monitoring all security arrangements across the federal capital and supervising operations on the ground, according to the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em>.</p>
<p>A total of 57 security checkpoints have been established across Islamabad to secure processions and majalis, and more than 300 traffic officers have been deployed to ensure smooth vehicular flow and assist the public throughout the day.</p>
<p>“All security operations are being monitored through Safe City surveillance, body-worn cameras, drones, as well as both mobile and central control rooms,” IG Rizvi said.</p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid rich tribute to the sacrifice of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) and his companions, saying that Ashura gives us a message of sacrifice, truthfulness, sincere determination, and standing up for the truth.</p>
<p>In their separate messages on Yaum-i-Ashura, they urged the nation to uphold the values and principles of fortitude and courage demonstrated by the martyrs of Karbala and to exhibit perseverance in the face of trials, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>President Zardari said that Karbala is a symbol of an eternal struggle against falsehood. “This day is not only an unparalleled story of sacrifice, loyalty, and patience but also a bright lamp that shows the path of truth and righteousness in the darkness of every era.”</p>
<p>In his message, PM Shehbaz said: “Karbala teaches us that although the path of truth is difficult, it is the path that leads to the pleasure of Allah Almighty and the satisfaction of hearts and eternal prosperity.”</p>
<p>He said the message of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) is not limited to his time but is a universal message, which even today convinces us that a Muslim stands for the truth, supports the oppressed, and advocates justice in all circumstances.</p></p>

            <p><p>Calling himself a “simple Buddhist monk” who usually didn’t celebrate birthdays, the Dalai Lama marked his 90th on Sunday by praying for peace after China insisted it would have the final say on who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921752/dalai-lama-confirms-he-will-have-a-successor-after-his-death">succeeded</a> the Tibetan spiritual leader.</p>
<p>Chanting of red-robed monks and nuns rang out from Himalayan hilltop forested temples in India, home to the Dalai Lama since he and thousands of other Tibetans fled Chinese troops who crushed an uprising in their capital Lhasa in 1959.</p>
<p>“I am just a simple Buddhist monk; I don’t normally engage in birthday celebrations,” the Dalai Lama said in a message, thanking those marking it with him for using the opportunity “to cultivate peace of mind and compassion”.</p>
<p>Dressed in traditional robes and a flowing yellow wrap, he walked with the aid of two monks while flashing his trademark beaming smile to thousands of followers.</p>

<p>Beijing condemns the Nobel Peace Prize winner — who has led a lifelong campaign for greater autonomy for Tibet, a vast high-altitude plateau — as a rebel and separatist.</p>
<p>Alongside the celebrations, however, is the worry for Tibetans in exile that China will name its successor to bolster control over the territory it poured troops into in 1950 and has ruled ever since.</p>
<p>That raises the likelihood of rival challengers to the post; one by self-declared atheist Beijing, the other by the Dalai Lama’s office based in neighbouring India, a regional rival of China.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#good-heart" id="good-heart" title="Permalink"></a>‘Good heart’</h2>
<p>The celebrations on Sunday are the culmination of days of long-life prayers for Tenzin Gyatso, who followers believe is the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, a man whose moral teachings and idiosyncratic humour have made him one of the world’s most popular religious leaders.</p>
<p>“While it is important to work for material development, it is vital to focus on achieving peace of mind through cultivating a good heart and by being compassionate, not just toward near and dear ones, but toward everyone,” he said in his birthday message.</p>
<p>“Through this, you will contribute to making the world a better place.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The celebrations also included his key announcement that, after being inundated with messages of support from fellow Tibetans both inside and in exile, the spiritual institution would continue after his death.</p>
<p>He said he had received appeals from followers from across the Himalayan region, Mongolia and parts of Russia and China.</p>
<p>The seemingly esoteric matters of reincarnation have real-world political consequences, with Tibetans fearing his death will mark a major setback in his push for more autonomy for the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama said his India-based office alone would “exclusively” identify that successor — prompting a swift and sharp reply from China that the reincarnation “must be approved by the central government” in Beijing.</p>
<p>China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921605#:~:text=China-,said,-on%20Wednesday%20that">said</a> the succession would be carried out “by drawing lots from a golden urn”, foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>That urn is held by Beijing, and the Dalai Lama has warned that, when used dishonestly, it lacks “any spiritual quality”.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered effusive birthday greetings on Sunday, calling the Dalai Lama an “enduring symbol of love”.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said in a statement that Washington was “committed to promoting respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of Tibetans”.</p>
<p>Among the crowds attending the celebrations was Hollywood star Richard Gere, a longtime backer of the Tibetans in exile, who on Sunday said the Dalai Lama “totally embodies selflessness, complete love and compassion and wisdom”.</p>

<p>Messages of support were also given by former US presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush, as well as Barack Obama, who said the Dalai Lama had shown what it means to “speak up for freedom and dignity”.</p>
<p>The ceremony ended with the Dalai Lama eating a slice of cake and thousands singing “happy birthday”.</p>
<p>No details have been released for the future succession.</p>
<p>All so far have been men or boys, often identified as toddlers and taking up the role only as teenagers.</p>
<p>The current Dalai Lama, himself identified in 1937, has said that if there is a successor it will come from the “free world” outside China’s control.</p>
<p>In a speech to followers on Sunday, the Dalai Lama said his practice of Buddhism meant he had dedicated his life towards seeking compassion.</p>
<p>“I’m now 90 and… when I reflect on my life, I see that I have not wasted my life at all”, he said, speaking in Tibetan.</p>
<p>“I would not have regrets at the time of my death; rather I would be able to die very peacefully.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Rescuers searched on Saturday for 27 girls missing from a riverside summer camp in Texas, after torrential rains caused devastating <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922320">floods</a> that killed 50 people in the US state.</p>
<p>Multiple flash flood warnings remained in place across central Texas after water surged through communities, with the Guadalupe River rising by 26 feet (eight metres) in just 45 minutes.</p>
<p>The Kerr County summer camp where hundreds were staying was left in disarray, with blankets, teddy bears and other belongings caked in mud.</p>

<p>“We have recovered 43 deceased individuals in Kerr County. Among these who are deceased, we have 28 adults and 15 children,” said Larry Leitha, the sheriff of the flood-ravaged region.</p>
<p>Multiple victims were also found in other counties, bringing the death toll to 50.</p>
<p>Texas Department of Emergency Management chief Nim Kidd said air, ground and water-based crews were scouring the length of the Guadalupe River for survivors and the bodies of the dead.</p>
<p>“We will continue the search until all those who are missing are found,” he said.</p>
<p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott said he was expanding a state disaster declaration and was requesting additional federal resources from President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The flooding began Friday — the start of the Fourth of July holiday weekend — as months’ worth of rain fell in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) warned that more rain was forecast, and that “excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.”</p>
<p>In Kerrville on Saturday, the usually calm Guadalupe was flowing fast, its murky waters filled with debris.</p>
<p>“The water reached the top of the trees. About 10 meters or so,” said resident Gerardo Martinez, 61. “Cars, whole houses were going down the river.”</p>
<p>Flash floods, which occur when the ground is unable to absorb torrential rainfall, are not unusual.</p>
<p>But scientists say that in recent years, human-driven climate change has made extreme weather events such as floods, droughts and heatwaves more frequent and more intense.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Sheriff Leitha said 27 children from Camp Mystic in flooded Kerr County were still missing. Around 750 girls were attending the camp along the banks of the Guadalupe.</p>
<p>US media reported that four of the missing girls were dead, citing their families.</p>
<p>The windows of camp cabins were shattered, apparently by the force of the water.</p>
<p>Michael, who only gave <em>AFP</em> his first name, was searching the camp for his eight-year-old daughter.</p>

<p>“I was in Austin and drove down yesterday morning, once we heard about it,” he said, adding that he was hoping for a “miracle.”</p>
<p>The obituary section of the Kerrville community news site was dotted with tributes to victims, including Camp Mystic’s owner and director Dick Eastland.</p>
<p>The director of Heart O’ The Hills summer camp, located about a mile from Camp Mystic, Jane Ragsdale, was also confirmed dead.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Texas, four people were confirmed dead in Travis County, northeast of Kerr, and 13 people were missing, public information office director Hector Nieto told <em>AFP.</em></p>
<p>A 62-year-old woman’s body was found in the city of San Angelo in Tom Green County, along the Concho River, police said.</p>
<p>Two more people died in Burnet County, the area’s emergency management coordinator, Derek Marchio, told <em>AFP</em>, bringing the state-wide death toll to 50.</p>

<p>Department of Homeland Security head Kristi Noem said Trump wanted to “upgrade the technologies” at the weather service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p>
<p>“We need to renew this ancient system,” Noem told a press conference.</p>
<p>Scientists and disaster management agencies have criticised Trump for cutting funding and staffing at the NOAA, in charge of weather forecasts and preparedness, and the NWS.</p>
<p>When asked about claims that residents were given insufficient warning of the floods, Noem said she would “carry your concerns back to the federal government.”</p>
<p>Officials and residents alike were shocked by the speed and intensity of the flooding.</p>
<p>“We didn’t know this flood was coming,” Kerr County official Rob Kelly said Friday.</p>
<p>“The predictions were definitely off,” and the rain was “double of what was anticipated,” Kerrville city official Dalton Rice said.</p>
<p>Rice added that rescuers were facing “very difficult” conditions, and declined to give an overall figure for how many were missing.</p>
<p>Soila Reyna, 55, a Kerrville resident who works at a church helping people who lost their belongings, witnessed the devastation unfold.</p>
<p>“It has been years since we had a flood, but nothing like this,” Reyna said.</p>
<p>“Nothing like as catastrophic as this, where it involved children, people and just the loss of people’s houses… It’s just crazy,” she added.</p></p>
