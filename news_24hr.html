            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump on Friday said he had ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in regions near Russia in response to threats from former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev.</p>
<p>“I have ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that,” Trump said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114954549017557270" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on Truth Social.</p>
<p>“Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences. I hope this will not be one of those instances.”</p>

<p>Trump did not say whether he meant nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed submarines. He also did not elaborate on the locations, which are kept secret by the US military.</p>
<p>The United States and Russia control the vast majority of the world’s nuclear weaponry, and Washington keeps nuclear-armed submarines on patrol as part of its so-called nuclear triad of land, sea and air-launched weapons.</p>
<p>Trump and Medvedev, who is deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, traded taunts in recent days after Trump on Tuesday said Russia had “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927617">10 days from today</a>” to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine or be hit, along with its oil buyers, with tariffs.</p>
<p>Moscow, which has set out its own terms for peace in Ukraine, has shown no sign that it will comply with Trump’s deadline.</p>
<p>Medvedev on Monday accused Trump of engaging in a “game of ultimatums” and reminded him that Russia possessed Soviet-era nuclear strike capabilities of last resort after Trump told Medvedev to “watch his words”.</p>

<p>In response to a post by US Senator Lindsey Graham reiterating America’s seriousness to reach a peace deal, the former Russian president wrote: “It’s not for you or Trump to dictate when to ‘get at the peace table’. Negotiations will end when all the objectives of our military operation have been achieved.</p>

<p>Medvedev has emerged as one of the Kremlin’s most outspoken anti-Western hawks since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in 2022. Kremlin critics deride him as an irresponsible loose cannon, though some Western diplomats say his statements illustrate the thinking in senior Kremlin policy-making circles.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow hoped for more peace talks with Ukraine but that the momentum of the war was in its favour, signalling no shift in his stance despite a looming sanctions deadline from Washington.</p>
<p>Trump has said he will impose new sanctions on Moscow and countries that buy its energy exports — of which the biggest are China and India — unless Russia moves by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927617">August 8</a> to end the three-and-a-half-year war.</p>
<p>Trump has expressed mounting frustration with Putin, accusing him of “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922956">bullshit</a>” and describing Russia’s latest attacks on Ukraine as “disgusting”.</p>
<p>Putin, without referring to the Trump deadline, said three sessions of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926159">peace talks</a> with Ukraine had yielded some positive results, and Russia was expecting negotiations to continue.</p>

<p>“As for any disappointments on the part of anyone, all disappointments arise from inflated expectations. This is a well-known general rule,” he said.</p>
<p>“But in order to approach the issue peacefully, it is necessary to conduct detailed conversations. And not in public, but this must be done calmly, in the quiet of the negotiation process.”</p>
<p>He said Russian troops were attacking Ukraine along the entire front line and that the momentum was in their favour, citing the announcement by his defence ministry on Thursday that Moscow’s forces had captured the Ukrainian town of Chasiv Yar after a 16-month battle.</p>
<p>Ukraine denied that Chasiv Yar was under full Russian control.</p>
<p>Kyiv has, for months, been urging an immediate ceasefire, but Russia says it wants a final and durable settlement, not a pause. Since the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911511">peace talks</a> began in Istanbul in May, it has conducted some of its heaviest air strikes of the war, especially on the capital Kyiv.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian government has said the Russian negotiators do not have the mandate to make significant decisions and that President Volodymyr Zelensky has called on Putin to meet him for talks.</p>
<p>“We understand who makes the decisions in Russia and who must end this war. The whole world understands this too,” Zelensky said on Friday on X, reiterating his call for direct talks between him and Putin.</p>
<p>“The United States has proposed this. Ukraine has supported it. What is needed is Russia’s readiness.” Russia says a leaders’ meeting could only take place to set the seal on agreements reached by negotiators.</p>

<p>Ukraine and its European allies have frequently said they do not believe Putin is really interested in peace and have accused him of stalling, which the Kremlin denies.</p>
<p>“I will repeat once again, we need a long and lasting peace on good foundations that would satisfy both Russia and Ukraine, and ensure the security of both countries,” Putin said, adding that this was also a question of European security.</p>
<p>Putin was speaking alongside his ally Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, at talks on an island in Lake Ladoga that is the site of a famous Russian monastery.</p>
<p>Russian TV earlier showed the two men greeting monks at the Valaam Monastery, where they have met several times before, and holding candles during the chanting of prayers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ukrainian rescuers recovered more than a dozen more bodies from the rubble of a collapsed apartment block in Kyiv overnight, bringing the death toll from Russia’s worst air strike of the year on Ukraine’s capital to 31.</p>
<p>A two-year-old was among the five children found dead after Thursday’s sweeping Russian drone and missile attack, Zelensky said on Friday, announcing the end of a more than 24-hour-long rescue operation.</p>
<p>A total of 159 people were wounded in the multi-wave strike, in which Russia launched more than 300 drones and eight missiles early on Thursday, the latest in a campaign of fierce strikes on Ukrainian towns and cities.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The worst damage was to an apartment building that partially collapsed in the Sviatoshyn district in western Kyiv. Damage was also reported in at least three other districts of the capital.</p>
<p>Natalia Matviyenko, 65, sitting near the damaged apartment building, said she did not place much faith in Trump’s tough rhetoric.</p>
<p>“Trump just says, ‘I’m upset with President Putin’s behaviour.’ And what? No results,” she said.</p>
<p>The US leader, who returned to power on a pledge to swiftly end the war, has in recent weeks rolled back his earlier conciliatory approach toward Moscow and signalled openness to arming Ukraine.</p>
<p>But a diplomatic effort to end the war has stalled, with Moscow not backing down from what Kyiv and its allies describe as maximalist demands.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#will-putin-listen" id="will-putin-listen" title="Permalink"></a>‘Will Putin listen?’</h2>
<p>On Friday, mourners laid flowers and lit candles at the wrecked apartment block, where rumbling excavators hoisted heavy pieces of rubble. The makeshift shrine included brightly coloured stuffed animals.</p>
<p>Oksana Kinal, 43, who was placing flowers to honour a co-worker who had been killed alongside a son, said she hoped Trump would follow up on his threat but also expressed doubt.</p>
<p>“I think America has a lot of points of leverage that can be used against Russia,” she said. “But will Putin listen to this? I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Kyiv’s air force said on Friday that Ukrainian air defences had destroyed more than 6,000 drones and missiles across the country in July alone.</p>
<p>“The world possesses every instrument required to ensure Russia is brought to justice,” Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko wrote on X on Friday. “What is lacking is not power but will.”</p>

            <p><p>The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Friday called for a grand dialogue between all political parties of the country and a new charter of democracy between them.</p>
<p>The TTAP had held its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927866">multi-party conference</a> on Thursday, appealing for a new social contract to restore the Constitution and democracy, claiming that government officials had blocked access to the original venue in Islamabad, forcing them to relocate. The alliance was forced to move its conference to a private farmhouse after authorities placed barriers at its intended venue, Tulip Banquet Hall.</p>
<p>The coalition of six opposition parties formed last year, had formalised its organisational structure last month and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924669">declared blanket support</a> for all anti-government protests.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference today on the second day of the conference held at his farmhouse, TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar presented the alliance’s resolution.</p>
<p>“The parties participating in the TTAP and its All-Party Conference (APC) agreed that at this time there is an urgent need for a new democratic charter among all political parties and political forces,” the resolution read, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“As a result of the constant attacks of the hybrid system, the Constitution of Pakistan, the human rights given in it from Articles 8 to 11, and the parliamentary democratic system have become meaningless and today the social contract between the people and the state has been shattered.</p>
<p>“Therefore, for the new charter, a complete consensus should be reached among all the political forces in the country after a national dialogue.”</p>
<p>The TTAP said that political consensus was needed on the following aspects: supremacy of the Constitution and Parliament, rule of law, independence of the judiciary, appointment of a free and independent Election Commission and fair elections, the situation in Balochistan, the situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the former tribal areas, the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, inter-provincial relations and water distribution, inter-relations of political parties and investigation of all illegal administrative actions, freedom of the media, rights of women and minorities and international relations.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Criticising yesterday’s events, the TTAP strongly condemned the conference’s cancellation at the Islamabad hotel by the administration and declared that this action was a blow to the constitutional and legal rights of citizens.</p>
<p>“The APC expressed deep concern over the current constitutional, political and economic situation of the country. Today, no class or nationality living in the country is satisfied, the farmers are devastated, the salaried class is under the burden of taxes and the business class is leaving the country and transferring its capital abroad.</p>
<p>“The poverty rate in the country has increased to an alarming level and currently about 45 per cent of Pakistan is forced to live below the poverty line and the purchasing power of the middle class has decreased by 58pc. The unemployment rate has reached an alarming level of 22pc, while the same rate among the youth is more than 30pc.</p>
<p>“This has never been the case in the history of Pakistan. All the participating parties of the conference decided that a comprehensive and common strategy is needed to bring the country out of the current channels,” the resolution stated.</p>
<p>The alliance demanded an end to the “wave of fascism and political manipulation” in the country.</p>
<p>It also condemned the “unjust imprisonment” of PTI founder Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi, demanding their early release and immediate appointment of their pending cases in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and the Supreme Court for immediate hearing.</p>
<p>The opposition moot also lashed out at the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">recent sentencing</a> against scores of PTI leaders and workers, including the National Assembly and Senate opposition leaders, saying yesterday was a “dark day in the political and democratic history of Pakistan in this regard and it once again shows that this hybrid system wants the complete elimination of the opposition in the country”.</p>
<p>On constitutional supremacy, the alliance criticised the recent amendments made to the Constitution and called for their removal. The moot also called for the dismantling of the Special Investment Facilitation Council, alleging that the rights and resources of the provinces were usurped through it.</p>
<p>Regarding the rule of law, the TTAP said that corruption in civil institutions and “undue and illegal interference by political and defence institutions” had led to a loss of public trust and undermining of professional capabilities, which was causing a deterioration in the situation of law and order in the country.</p>
<p>“While the justice system needs reforms, the concept of the rule of law has been severely shaken as a result of interference in the justice system, which needs to be corrected and the public’s trust restored.”</p>
<p>In particular, the moot said that the independence of the judiciary was reduced to a mere slogan after the 26th amendment and “kangaroo courts are now busy only in the work of cleaning up the houses of the powerful”.</p>
<p>The TTAP said there was an urgent need to completely abolish the 26th amendment, take direct steps to prevent all interference in the judiciary and devise an uncontroversial system of appointment of judges to purify the judiciary and restore the reputation of the institution.</p>
<p>“The letter of six judges of the Islamabad High Court has opened the floodgates for the demands of judicial independence in Pakistan. These judges are the heroes of the Pakistani people and we strongly condemn the actions taken against them and fully support their stand,” the alliance said, referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1824028/ihc-judges-detail-brazen-meddling-in-letter-to-supreme-judicial-council">letter</a> written by six IHC judges alleging institutional interference and pressure in judicial work.</p>
<p>On the security situation in Balochistan and KP, the moot said the prevailing conditions in the former were a wound for the country that needed to be urgently addressed.</p>
<p>“The first right to the province of Balochistan and its resources belongs to its residents … We demand that the illegally missing persons across Pakistan and especially in Balochistan be immediately brought to justice. The illegal private militias present across Pakistan, especially in Balochistan and KP, who are backed by the authorities, should be immediately dismantled and the policy of extrajudicial killings should be immediately stopped and the right to a fair trial given in the Constitution should not be deviated from in any way.</p>
<p>“Political prisoners, including Dr Mahrang Baloch, should be released in full. Only civil law enforcement agencies should be given responsibility for maintaining law and order. Also, immediate steps should be taken to eliminate the harassment of Baloch students studying in educational institutions across Pakistan in the name of law and order and to eliminate the hateful prejudice against them,” the resolution said.</p>
<p>Responding to the conference, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar dismissed it as a rote development to sabotage the economy whenever important diplomatic events were due, such as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928047/iranian-president-to-visit-pakistan-on-saturday-fo">upcoming visit</a> of the Iranian president.</p>

            <p><p>At least 26 people were injured as the Islamabad Express passenger train derailed near Kala Shah Kaku in Punjab’s Sheikhupura district on Friday with rescue services carrying out a search operation.</p>
<p>According to a statement from Punjab Rescue 1122, five bogies of the train were derailed near a chemical plant in the Kala Shah Kaku area, with the control room receiving reports around 7:32pm.</p>
<p>“Six emergency vehicles and 25 rescuers were immediately dispatched to start the rescue operation,” Punjab Rescue Spokesperson Farooq Ahmed was quoted as saying. “Most of the passengers suffered scratches, bruises and skin injuries and 25 were given first aid.”</p>
<p>The statement added that a 25-year-old man was trapped in the derailed carriage and injured his hip.</p>

<p>“A complete search operation is being carried out in all the bogies to ensure that no passenger is trapped,” the statement reads, adding that rescuers were trying to save one other person at the scene.</p>
<p>“The injured have been transported to Tehsil Headquarter Hospital in Muridke for treatment,” the statement added.</p>
<p>On July 28, three coaches of the Jaffar Express train were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927185">derailed</a> near Shikarpur following an explosion on the tracks, leaving one person injured.</p>
<p>Sukkur Railways Divisional Superintendent Jamshaid Alam said that the Jaffar Express was travelling from Peshawar to Quetta when it was caught in the explosion near Sultanpur.</p>
<p>“Following the blast, train operations have been suspended,” Alam said, adding that passengers “faced serious difficulties due to the train’s derailment”.</p>
<p><em>The Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported that Railways Minister Muhammad Hanif Abbasi took notice of the derailment and directed the Railways CEO and the divisional superintendent to reach the scene and oversee the situation.</p>
<p>The minister also ordered a detailed inquiry into the accident and instructed that a report be submitted within seven days.</p>
<p>On July 29, the Ministry of Railways <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927307/technical-fault-not-blast-derailed-jaffar-express-ministry-of-railways">said</a> that the train was derailed due to a technical fault and not an explosion, adding that local residents thought the sound of the derailed train was an explosion.</p>
<p>It said an unfamiliar terrorist outfit “took advantage of the incident” and falsely labelled it as an “armed attack” and claimed responsibility. “This claim is not only baseless, but also tantamount to an example of opportunism and irrelevance.”</p></p>
