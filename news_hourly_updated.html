<p>Dangers of further escalation loomed over a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1917383">meeting</a> of G7 leaders in Canada, with US President Donald Trump expressing hope a day ago that a deal could be done but no sign of the fighting abating on a fourth day of war.</p>
<p>Netanyahu made the remarks as he visited the Tel Nof airbase in central Israel, accompanied by Defence Minister Israel Katz and Chief of Staff Lieutenant-General Eyal Zamir, according to the Israeli media.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are on our way to achieving our two objectives: eliminating the nuclear threat and eliminating the missile threat,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu also threatened the citizens of Tehran, telling them to leave Iran‚Äôs capital. ‚ÄúWe are taking action.‚Äù</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted an evacuation order for citizens in Tehran on his X account.</p>
<p>The post ordered citizens living in a specific area of the Iranian capital to ‚Äúleave immediately‚Äù, warning that Israel would attack Iran‚Äôs military infrastructure in the area.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDear citizens, for your safety, please leave the mentioned area in the third district of Tehran immediately,‚Äù the order read, enclosing a map of the city. ‚ÄúYour presence in this area endangers your life.‚Äù</p>

<p>The latest fatalities in Israel, reported by Israel‚Äôs national emergency services, raised the death toll to 23 since Friday.</p>
<p>Israeli attacks in Iran have killed at least 224 people so far, including 70 women and children, while over 1,200 have been injured, the health ministry was quoted as saying earlier today by <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/at-least-224-killed-over-1-000-wounded-in-israeli-strikes-on-iran-health-ministry/3599882" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anadolu Agency</a></em>.</p>
<p>More than 90 per cent of the wounded were civilians, including women and children, health ministry official Hossein Kermanpour <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/HKermanpour/status/1934331936912326671" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X.</p>
<p>At least 100 more were wounded in Israel in the overnight blitz, part of a wave of attacks by Tehran in retaliation for Israel‚Äôs strikes targeting the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of sworn enemy Iran.</p>

<p>As the attacks did not seem to halt, Russia and Turkiye offered to facilitate the end of the ongoing war between Israel and Iran.</p>
<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan told his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian in a phone call today that his country ‚Äústands ready to undertake a facilitating role to end the conflicts as soon as possible and return to nuclear negotiations‚Äù.</p>
<p>Erdoƒüan ‚Äúemphasised the importance Turkiye attaches to the preservation of peace and stability in the region‚Äù, the Turkish presidency said.</p>
<p>The Kremlin said Russia remains ready to act as a mediator between Israel and Iran, and that Moscow‚Äôs previous proposal to store Iranian uranium in Russia remains on the table.</p>
<p>Before Israel launched strikes on the Islamic Republic, Russia said last week that it stood ready to remove highly enriched uranium from Iran and convert it into civilian reactor fuel as a potential way to calm the crisis.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis proposal remains on the table, it remains relevant. But, of course, with the outbreak of hostilities, the situation has become seriously complicated,‚Äù Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou know that we condemn those actions that have led to such a dangerous escalation of tension in the region,‚Äù Peskov stated.</p>
<p>He noted that the root causes of the conflict needed to be addressed and eliminated, and that the military strikes were escalating the entire crisis to beyond serious levels.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd secondly, we also note a significant consolidation of society in Iran against the background of the bombing that is currently being carried out by the Israeli side,‚Äù Peskov added.</p>
<p>Stating that Russia ‚Äúremains ready to do everything necessary to eliminate the root causes of this crisis‚Äù, Peskov said the situation was ‚Äúescalating more than seriously, and, of course, this is not affecting the situation for the better‚Äù.</p>
<p>Asked about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs remarks to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/netanyahu-reveals-iran-marked-trump-enemy-number-one-assassination-plot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News</a></em> on Sunday that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917243">regime change</a> in Iran could be a result of Israel‚Äôs military attacks, Peskov said that the Kremlin had seen the remarks.</p>
<p>The statement comes after Trump yesterday cited the possibility that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, could help. Speaking to <em>ABC News</em>, Trump said he would be open to Putin being a mediator in the conflict. ‚ÄúHe is ready. He called me about it. We had a long talk about it,‚Äù the US president had said.</p>
<p>The European Union said Russia has ‚Äúzero credibility‚Äù as a potential mediator between Iran and Israel, after Trump suggested that Putin could play a role.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere has been a recent Russia-Iran partnership agreement, which signals deepening cooperation across multiple areas, including foreign policy and defence,‚Äù EU spokesman Anouar El Anouni said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn light of such, Russia cannot be an objective mediator.‚Äù</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan condemned Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúact of force‚Äù against Iran and called for an immediate cessation of hostilities when they spoke by phone on Monday, the Kremlin said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBoth sides expressed the most serious concern about the ongoing escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict, which has already led to a large number of casualties and is fraught with serious long-term consequences for the entire region,‚Äù a Kremlin statement said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe leaders spoke in favour of an immediate cessation of hostilities and the settlement of contentious issues, including those related to the Iranian nuclear programme, exclusively by political and diplomatic means.‚Äù</p>
<p>The two sides agreed to remain in close cooperation, the statement said.</p>
<p>Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed in a phone call on Monday that the conflict between Iran and Israel must end and room must be made for diplomacy as soon as possible, the Turkish presidency said.</p>
<p>In a statement, the presidency also said Erdogan repeated his view that the only solution to the crisis was a return to nuclear talks.</p>

<p>Search and location operations were underway in the coastal city of Haifa, where around 30 people were wounded, emergency authorities said, as dozens of first responders rushed to the strike zones.</p>
<p>Fires were seen burning at a power plant near the port, the media reported. Video footage showed several missiles over Tel Aviv and explosions could be heard there and over Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Israel‚Äôs military warned of a new missile salvo incoming from Iran. ‚ÄúA short while ago, the IDF identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the State of Israel,‚Äù the army posted on Telegram, using the acronym for its official name.</p>
<p>It said its air defences were working to intercept the threat but advised people to ‚Äúenter a protected space and remain there until further notice‚Äù.</p>
<p>Several residential buildings in a densely populated neighbourhood of Tel Aviv were destroyed in a strike that blew out the windows of hotels and other nearby homes just a few hundred metres from the US Embassy branch in the city.</p>
<p>The US ambassador to Israel said the building sustained minor damage, but there were no injuries to personnel.</p>
<p>British maritime security firm Ambrey said that fires were observed at the power plant in the vicinity of Israel‚Äôs Haifa port, <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>

<p>Ambrey said it observed video footage of the Israeli military intercepting the attack, followed by impacts from two hypersonic missiles.</p>
<p>An <em>AFP</em> journalist heard loud explosions in Jerusalem on early Monday, while footage showed Israeli air defences working over the city. Outside Haifa, an <em>AFP</em> journalist saw fires break out following the latest Iranian barrage.</p>
<p>Israel‚Äôs public broadcaster <em>Kan</em> reported that at least four areas were hit in the latest Iranian attacks on central Israel.</p>

<p>Iran does not intend to develop nuclear weapons but will pursue its right to nuclear energy and research, President Masoud Pezeshkian said today, reiterating Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1700780">religious edict</a> against weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>Iran had claimed the existence of the <em>fatwa</em> for years before making the text public for the first time in 2010, when it was being accused by the West and Israel of seeking to secretly acquire the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>While asserting that Iran remains opposed to developing weapons of mass destruction, Esmaeil Baghaei, Iran‚Äôs foreign ministry spokesperson, said the Iranian parliament is preparing a bill to leave the nuclear <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1479334">Non-Proliferation Treaty</a> (NPT).</p>
<p>The Iranian president, speaking during a parliamentary session on Monday, also called for unity and solidarity ‚Äúmore than ever‚Äù against the Israeli aggression, <em>Press TV</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/06/16/749935/We-must-stand-united-against-the-criminals--aggression--Iran%E2%80%99s-Pezeshkian" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian asserted that Iran had the right to benefit from nuclear energy and research that served the nation‚Äôs interests, adding that no one had the right to deny this right.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have extended a hand of brotherhood to all Islamic nations ‚Äî for they are all our brothers. Today, most, if not all, of them stand with us and by our side,‚Äù he further said.</p>
<p>The president said the US violated international norms by ‚Äúallowing‚Äù Israel to attack Iran, stressing that Iran never sought war or initiated it.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe enemy cannot remove us or our nation from the scene through violence, killings, and assassinations,‚Äù Pezeshkian said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor every hero who falls, hundreds more will rise to carry the flag and stand against the oppression, injustice, crimes, and betrayal committed by these aggressors,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>On the slain nuclear researchers killed in Israel‚Äôs attacks, Pezeshkian asked: ‚ÄúWhat crime did a scientist commit to deserve being murdered, along with his family, by someone from the other side of the world?‚Äù</p>

<p>The Israeli military said earlier today that it was striking surface-to-surface missile sites in central Iran, adding it was ‚Äúoperating against this threat in our skies and in Iranian skies‚Äù.</p>
<p>Israel has claimed strikes as far away as Iran‚Äôs holy city of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1835205">Mashhad</a> in the far east, 2,300 kilometres from Israel.</p>
<p>Iranian state television reported that at least five people were killed on Sunday by an Israeli strike that hit a residential building in downtown Iran.</p>
<p>Colonel Reza Sayyad, a spokesman for Iran‚Äôs armed forces, threatened a ‚Äúdevastating response‚Äù to Israel‚Äôs attacks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLeave the occupied territories (Israel) because they will certainly no longer be habitable in the future,‚Äù he warned in a televised address, adding shelters will ‚Äúnot guarantee security‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to <em>AFP</em>, residential areas in both countries have suffered deadly strikes since the hostilities broke out, with Israel‚Äôs Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slamming Iran on Sunday for allegedly targeting civilians.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIran will pay a very heavy price for the premeditated murder of civilians, women and children,‚Äù he said, during a visit to the site of a missile strike on a residential building in the coastal city of Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>His remarks came hours after Iranian missile fire killed another 10 people yesterday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a likely Iranian drone killed a woman in Syria, a Britain-based war monitor said, in what would be the first death on Syrian soil since the current hostilities between Iran and Israel began, reported <em>AFP.</em></p>
<p>The drone struck the woman‚Äôs home in western Tartus province, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p>
<p>Iran has executed a man who was found guilty of spying for Israel‚Äôs intelligence agency Mossad, the semi-official <em>Fars</em> news agency reported today, identifying the man as Esmail Fekri.</p>
<p>The execution is the <a class="link--external" href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-hanging-israel-mossad-spy-90089362075772025a0e0da5ee763be0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">third</a> in recent <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/30/iran-hangs-man-accused-of-spying-for-israel-mossad" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">weeks</a> related to the conduct of espionage on behalf of Israel.</p>
<p>Iranian media, including <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1404/03/25/3335833/%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%DB%8C-2-%D8%B9%D8%B6%D9%88-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%AC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tasnim</a></em>, reported on Sunday that police had arrested two suspects over alleged links to Israel‚Äôs Mossad spy agency. Israel, in turn, said it had taken two individuals into custody over alleged links to Iranian intelligence.</p>

<p>In Iran, a heavy cloud of smoke hung above Tehran after Israeli aircraft struck two fuel depots. Local media also reported an Israeli strike on the police headquarters in the city centre.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt been able to sleep since Friday because of the terrible noise,‚Äù said a Tehran resident who gave her name as Farzaneh.</p>
<p>‚ÄúToday, they hit a house in our alley, and we were very scared. So we decided to leave Tehran and head to the north of the country.‚Äù</p>
<p>Some, however, were determined to stay.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is natural that war has its own stress, but I will not leave my city,‚Äù 31-year-old Shokouh Razzazi told <em>AFP.</em></p>
<p><em>AFP</em> images from Israel‚Äôs Haifa, meanwhile, also showed a column of smoke rising on Sunday evening following an Iranian missile barrage.</p>

<p>In Washington, two US officials told <em>Reuters</em> that Trump had vetoed an Israeli plan in recent days to kill Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe found out that the Israelis had plans to hit Iran‚Äôs supreme leader. President Trump was against it, and we told the Israelis not to,‚Äù a US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>When asked about the <em>Reuters</em> report, Netanyahu <a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/netanyahu-reveals-iran-marked-trump-enemy-number-one-assassination-plot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Fox News</em></a> on Sunday: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so many false reports of conversations that never happened, and I‚Äôm not going to get into that.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe do what we need to do,‚Äù he told <em>Fox</em>‚Äôs ‚ÄòSpecial Report With Bret Baier‚Äô.</p>
<p>Asked whether <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917243">regime change</a> in Iran was one of the objectives of Israel‚Äôs strikes, Netanyahu said that ‚Äúit certainly could be the result, because the Iran regime is very weak‚Äù.</p>
<p>In the same interview, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/netanyahu-trump-iran-fox-news-b2770483.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Independent</a></em> reported, Netanyahu claimed that Iran attempted to assassinate Trump twice ‚Äúthrough proxies‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThrough their intel, yes; they want to kill him,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs enemy number one,‚Äù the Israeli premier said, referring to the US president.</p>

<p>However, seemingly contradicting his ally, Netanyahu claimed that American pilots were shooting down drones headed towards Israel. In the same interview, he also said that he and Trump were ‚Äúfully coordinated‚Äù.</p>
<p>Trump has urged the two foes to ‚Äúmake a deal‚Äù, adding, however, that ‚Äúsometimes they have to <a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-israel-iran-have-fight-out-believes-deal-possible" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fight it out</a>‚Äù first.</p>

                <h2>SBP maintains 11pc interest rate amid Mideast conflict</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) maintained its policy rate on Monday at 11 per cent, after many analysts cited inflation risks from rising global commodity prices amid Iran-Israel tensions.</p>
<p>The central bank‚Äôs policy rate, after being slashed by 1,000bps from 22pc since June 2024 in seven intervals, was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908601">cut to 11pc</a> last month.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 11 per cent,‚Äù the SBP said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.sbp.org.pk/press/2025/Pr-16-Jun-2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>Several brokerages had initially expected a cut but revised their forecasts after the Israeli strikes sparked fears of a broader conflict.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The MPC observed that global oil prices had ‚Äúrebounded sharply, reflecting the evolving geopolitical situation in the Middle East and some ease in US-China trade tensions‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTaking stock of these developments and potential risks, the committee assessed that the real interest rate remains adequately positive to stabilise inflation within the target range of 5‚Äì7pc,‚Äù the MPC stressed.</p>
<p>The escalating hostilities after Israel‚Äôs attacks on Iran on Friday had triggered a sharp spike in oil prices ‚Äî a worry for Pakistan given the broader impact on imported inflation from a potentially prolonged conflict and tightening of crude supplies.</p>
<p>Eleven of 14 respondents in a snap poll by <em>Reuters</em> expected the SBP to leave the benchmark rate unchanged at 12pc. Two forecast a 100 basis-point (bps) cut and one predicted a 50bps cut.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#inflation-expected-to-trend-up-and-stablise-in-5-7pc-target-range" id="inflation-expected-to-trend-up-and-stablise-in-5-7pc-target-range" title="Permalink"></a>Inflation expected to ‚Äòtrend up and stablise‚Äô in 5-7pc target range</h2>
<p>On inflation, the MPC noted that the recent uptick in May <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914976">to 3.5pc</a> year-on-year was in line with its expectation, whereas core inflation declined ‚Äúmarginally‚Äù.</p>
<p>The headline inflation had hit an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908067">all-time low</a> of 0.3pc YoY after declining for several months from <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1757288">around 40pc</a> in May 2023.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The MPC said inflation was expected to ‚Äútrend up and stabilise‚Äù in the target range. The SBP expects average inflation to range between 5.5pc and 7.5pc for the current fiscal year, which ends this month.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis outlook, however, remains subject to multiple risks emanating from potential supply-chain disruptions from regional geopolitical conflicts, volatility in oil and other commodity prices, and the timing and magnitude of domestic energy price adjustments,‚Äù the committee added.</p>
<p>It noted that economic growth was picking up gradually and was projected to gain further traction next year on the back of earlier rate cuts. However, the MPC cautioned about ‚Äúsome potential risks to the external sector amidst the sustained widening in the trade deficit and weak financial inflows‚Äù.</p>
<p>It observed that some of the proposed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292">FY26 budgetary measures</a> may further widen the trade deficit by increasing imports, adding that the decision to maintain the interest rate was ‚Äúappropriate to sustain the macroeconomic and price stability‚Äù.</p>
<p>The MPC termed the ‚Äútimely realisation of planned <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916681">foreign inflows</a>, achievement of the targeted fiscal consolidation and the implementation of structural reforms as essential to maintain macroeconomic stability and achieve sustainable economic growth‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúThe decision to hold rates was not surprising given the uncertain geopolitical outlook with oil prices spiking around 15pc,‚Äù said Mustafa Pasha, executive director at Karachi-based Lakson Investments.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAdditionally, it gives the SBP time to assess the impact of the budget and upcoming gas/electricity tariff revisions on inflation and the external account.‚Äù</p>
<p>Noting the key developments since its last meeting in May, the MPC said the real GDP growth for FY25 was provisionally reported at 2.7pc.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDespite a substantial widening in the trade deficit, the current account remained broadly balanced in April,‚Äù it highlighted, also mentioning the increase in the SBP foreign exchange reserves to $11.7 billion as of June 6, owing to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910966">$1 billion tranche</a> by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>‚ÄúThird, the revised budget estimates indicate the primary balance surplus at 2.2pc of GDP in FY25, up from 0.9pc last year,‚Äù the MPC said, adding that the government was targeting a primary surplus of 2.4pc of the GDP for next year.</p>
<p>The SBP decision also comes on the heels of Pakistan‚Äôs contractionary budget, in which it cut total spending by 7pc and set a GDP target of 4.2pc for fiscal year 2025-26.</p>
<p>The government said the $350 billion economy is stabilising under a $7bn International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, though analysts remain wary of external and fiscal pressures.</p></p>
