                <h2>13 security personnel martyred in North Waziristan suicide bombing: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Thirteen security personnel were martyred in a suicide bombing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs North Waziristan district on Saturday, carried out by Indian proxy <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em>, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7334" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).</p>
<p>According to the military‚Äôs media wing, a vehicle-borne suicide attacker targeted a security convoy in the district‚Äôs Mir Ali area, before being intercepted by the convoy‚Äôs lead vehicle.</p>
<p>In July last year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade">designated</a> the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em>, while mandating all institutions to use the term <em>khariji</em> (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn their desperation, an explosive-laden vehicle was rammed by the Indian sponsored kharijis into one of the vehicles of the leading group,‚Äù the ISPR stated. ‚ÄúThirteen brave sons of [the] soil, embraced <em>shahadat</em> (martyrdom) [and] in this tragic and barbaric incident, two children and a woman [were also] severely injured.‚Äù</p>
<p>The martyred personnel were identified as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subedar Zahid Iqbal, 45, from Karak</li>
<li>Havildar Sohrab Khan, 39, from Naseerabad</li>
<li>Havildar Mian Yousaf, 41, from Buner</li>
<li>Naik Khitab Shah, 34, from Lower Dir</li>
<li>Lance Naik Ismail, 32, from Naseerabad</li>
<li>Sepoy Rohail, 30, from Mirpurkhas</li>
<li>Sepoy Muhammad Ramzan, 33, from Dera Ghazi Khan</li>
<li>Sepoy Nawab, 30, from Quetta</li>
<li>Sepoy Zubair Ahmed, 24, from Naseerabad</li>
<li>Sepoy Muhammad Sahki, 31, from Dera Ghazi Khan</li>
<li>Sepoy Hashim Abbasi, 20, from Abbotabad</li>
<li>Sepoy Muddasir Ejaz, 25, from Layyah</li>
<li>Sepoy Manzar Ali, 23, from Mardan</li>
</ul>
<p>The ISPR said that in ensuing sanitisation operations, 14 <em>khawarij</em> were ‚Äúsent to hell‚Äù by the security forces. The statement added that operations in the area would continue and ‚Äúthe perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act will be brought to justice‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe security forces of Pakistan, in step with [the] nation, remain steadfast in their resolve to eradicate Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers and innocent civilians further reinforce our unwavering commitment to safeguarding our nation at all costs,‚Äù the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack on the security convoy and paid tribute to the 13 martyred personnel for their sacrifice in a statement from his office.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe martyrs ensured the security of the motherland by sacrificing their lives,‚Äù the president said, adding that those who give their lives to defend the homeland are ‚Äúour real heroes‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSuch a cowardly attack cannot dampen the morale of the nation,‚Äù Zardari said.</p>
<p>The president also paid tribute to the armed forces for killing 14 terrorists after the attack.</p>
<p>‚Äú[The] Pakistani nation and security forces are determined to root out Indian-sponsored terrorism,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOperations will continue until terrorism is completely eradicated.‚Äù</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also strongly condemned the attack in a statement from his office, paying tribute to the 13 martyred security personnel.</p>
<p>Expressing grief over the injury of innocent civilians, the PM said, ‚ÄúIndian-backed terrorists committed [a] cowardly act. The entire nation salutes the martyrs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are resolute to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country,‚Äù the PM stated.</p>
<p>Earlier, a statement from the KP chief minister‚Äôs office confirmed that eight security personnel were martyred in the blast. KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur condemned the attack and expressed his condolences and prayers for the martyrdom of the personnel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI salute security personnel and their families who have sacrificed their lives for the country and the nation,‚Äù Gandapur was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecurity forces have made unprecedented sacrifices to establish peace in the country and eliminate terrorism,‚Äù the CM added. ‚ÄúThese sacrifices further raise the resolve and morale of the nation against terrorism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEveryone in the nation stands with security forces in the war against terrorism,‚Äù the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Initially, District Police Officer (DPO) Waqar Ahmed told <em>Dawn.com</em> that four civilians were injured in the ‚Äúsuicide attack‚Äù carried out through a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device.</p>
<p>The attack comes days after two soldiers were martyred and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919801/two-soldiers-martyred-11-terrorists-killed-in-south-waziristan-ibo-ispr">11 terrorists</a> were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in KP‚Äôs South Waziristan district.</p>
<p>On June 15, a Frontier Corps (FC) soldier was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917345/fc-soldier-cop-martyred-in-waziristan-orakzai-attacks">martyred</a> in a targeted gun attack in Ladha tehsil of Upper South Waziristan district.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915363">14 terrorists</a> were killed in North Waziristan‚Äôs Datta Khel town during a security operation.</p>

<p>Militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in the country last month, according to data <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914847/militant-attacks-increased-to-85-in-may-pakistan-institute-for-conflict-and-security-studies">released</a> by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, which recorded 85 attacks in May compared to 81 in April.</p>
<p>The military has said India was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">using its ‚Äúassets‚Äù</a> to inte¬≠nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, with ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry detailing ‚Äúirr¬≠e¬≠futable evidence‚Äù of an Ind¬≠ian military personnel‚Äôs involvement.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>The country ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>

                <h2>Tarar assails KP administration as 11 bodies recovered from Swat River</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday slammed the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government for its failure to address the Swat River flash flood a day prior, as 11 bodies have been dredged from the waterway by rescuers.</p>
<p>At least 19 people have been killed and six others injured in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa amid heavy rains and the consequent flash floods and landslides, according to data from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).</p>
<p>Separately, KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920555/at-least-18-reported-missing-in-swat-river-flash-floods-8-bodies-found">suspended</a> Swat Additional Deputy Commissioner for relief Ihsan-ul-Haq, Babuzai Assistant Commissioner (AC) Nida Iqbal and Khwazakhela AC Muhammad Amir Khan.</p>
<p>Tarar expressed his grief over the disaster in the Swat River, stating, ‚ÄúWhenever there‚Äôs a natural disaster, it is the government‚Äôs responsibility to extend relief.‚Äù</p>
<p>Speaking about the KP government suspending the Swat deputy commissioner, Tarar said that KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur should have been suspended instead.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe CM should have been suspended; a man who says ‚ÄòI cannot hand out tents, it‚Äôs not my job‚Äô,‚Äù Tarar stated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDid the people of KP give you the mandate to work from Adiala?‚Äù the minister asked, referring to how Gandapur approaches incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan for instructions and approval. ‚ÄúThe people did not give you a mandate to operate like this; they gave you a mandate to serve the public.‚Äù</p>
<p>Tarar then noted how, despite advanced technology, the PTI‚Äôs KP government has been unable to implement effective infrastructure and attempts to rescue people who get trapped atop steep rock formations using makeshift arrangements.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúThe KP government helicopter, which is used by the CM and was used by Imran Khan, could not be flown to the rescue of women and children who were in grave danger,‚Äù he lamented.</p>
<p>‚ÄúComing to Islamabad, armed with weapons and attacking policemen is not bravery, nor is it any sort of feat,‚Äù Tarar said, referring to the PTI‚Äôs Islamabad rally. ‚ÄúReal bravery is implementing an effective rescue system during 12 years of government.‚Äù</p>
<p>He addressed Gandapur: ‚ÄúIf you could not procure rescue equipment, you should have just kept quiet. If handing out tents is not your job, then what is? Is rescuing people and keeping them safe not your job?‚Äù</p>
<p>Tarar noted that the KP taxpayer is bearing the brunt of inaction by the provincial administration. The minister suggested that Gandapur ‚Äúabolish the PDMA ‚Ä¶ and stop taking taxes if you are not able to save people‚Äù.</p>

<p>According to Rescue 1122 KP spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi, the bodies of 11 of the 13 people who were swept away in the flood have been recovered so far.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOf the bodies, nine are from Sialkot, while two are from Mardan,‚Äù Faizi told <em>Dawn.com</em>. ‚ÄúRescue 1122 is conducting a search operation to recover the remaining missing people.‚Äù</p>
<p>Following the flooding, the KP government later on Saturday announced measures to mitigate the problems caused by flooding in rivers across the province.</p>
<p>In a post on X, the provincial government announced that among the decisions taken were a complete ban on all types of mining activities and encroachments along the riverbed, as well as declaring the office of the assistant deputy commissioner (relief) a response centre.</p>
<p>Additionally, all rivers will be effectively monitored, rescue teams will be provided with life jackets, drones and other modern equipment and irrigation early warning systems will be re-evaluated.</p>
