            <p><p>Pakistani pilgrims will be barred from travelling by road to Iran and Iraq for the Arbaeen pilgrimage due to public and national security, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Pilgrims <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855955">visit Iraq</a> to attend the chehlum commemoration — also known as Arbaeen (40 in Arabic) — to mark the 40th day of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922472/ashura-processions-in-major-cities-of-country-conclude-peacefully">mourning</a> for the martyrdom of Imam Husain, the grandson of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</p>
<p>“After extensive consultations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [the] Balochistan Government, and security agencies, it has been decided that <em>zaireen</em> (pilgrims) will not be allowed to travel to Iraq and Iran by road for Arbaeen this year,” Naqvi said on X.</p>
<p>He added that the “difficult decision was taken in the interest of public safety and national security”.</p>
<p>However, the pilgrims will be able to travel by air, the minister noted.</p>

<p>Naqvi stressed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed authorities to “arrange maximum flights to facilitate their pilgrimage in the coming days”.</p>
<p>Naqvi’s statement came after he met with PM Shehbaz earlier today to brief him on the new policy for pilgrims, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> (<em>APP</em>) <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/interior-minister-calls-on-pm-briefs-over-zaireens-new-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The premier also directed Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif to arrange “special flights” for the pilgrims, <em>APP</em> stated, citing a press release from the PM Office.</p>
<p>Iraq’s Karbala, where Imam Hussein and his brother Abbas are buried in two enormous mausoleums facing each other, is the centre of the Shia world during this time. More than <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854804/millions-of-pilgrims-rally-for-arbaeen">21 million</a> devotees took part in the pilgrimage last year.</p>
<p>Pakistan is set to introduce a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922178">new travel management system</a> from Jan 1, 2026, under which pilgrims will only be allowed to undertake the journey under registered organisers.</p>

<p>Under the new measures, the traditional Salar System will be abolished and replaced with a Zaireen Group Organisers model. Alongside weekly flights to Iran being increased from six to 15, 107 additional special flights will also be arranged for pilgrims heading to Iraq.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousuf <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925358/religious-affairs-minister-retracts-40000-missing-pilgrims-remark">retracted</a> his statement that 40,000 pilgrims had not returned from trips to Iran and Iraq. He clarified that a “misunderstanding” of outdated paper records that had not yet been fully digitised resulted in the statement.</p>

<p>Senator Marri had sought a report on a critical discrepancy — the Gwadar Development Authority officials blamed a lack of funds for the project delays, while the Finance Division said it had received no funding demand from the Balochistan government.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926953/trump-says-eu-and-us-have-reached-a-deal-on-trade' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says EU and US have ‘reached a deal’ on trade</strong></a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he had reached a trade agreement with European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen.</p>
<p>“We have reached a deal. It’s a good deal for everybody,” Trump told reporters after talks with von der Leyen at his golf resort in Turnberry, Scotland. The EU chief also hailed it as a “good deal”.</p>
<p>Earlier, the US president told reporters he felt the two sides had a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926648/trump-sees-50pc-chance-of-trade-deal-with-eu">50-50 chance</a> of a deal with the European Union. The bloc faces an across-the-board US levy of 30 per cent unless it strikes a trade pact by August 1.</p>
<p>Washington warned on Sunday there would be “no extensions” and Trump confirmed “the deals all start on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926398#:~:text=A%20further%20escalation%20in%20trade%20tensions%20could%20deliver%20a%20fresh%20blow%20to%20the%20eurozone%20economy,%20with%20Trump%20having%20set%20a%20deadline%20of%20August%201%20to%20impose%20a%20basic%20tariff%20rate%20of%2030pc%20on%20the%20European%20Union.">August 1</a>”.</p>
<p>Von der Leyen’s European Commission, negotiating on behalf of EU countries, is pushing hard for a deal to salvage a trading relationship worth an annual $1.9 trillion in goods and services.</p>
<p>The EU chief said at the start of the talks at Trump’s luxury golf resort in southwestern Turnberry that if they reached a deal, “I think it would be the biggest deal each of us has ever” made.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>According to an EU diplomat briefed ahead of the meeting, the contours of a deal are in place, but key issues still need settling.</p>
<p>“A political deal is on the table — but it needs the sign-off from Trump, who wants to negotiate this down to the very last moment,” the diplomat told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>The proposal, they said, involves a baseline levy of around 15pc on EU exports to the United States — the level secured by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926063">Japan</a> — with carve-outs for critical sectors including aircraft and spirits, though not for wine.</p>
<p>Any deal will also need to be approved by EU member states, whose ambassadors, on a visit to Greenland, were updated by the commission Sunday morning. They would meet again after any accord.</p>
<p>According to the EU diplomat, the 27 countries broadly endorsed the deal as envisaged — while recalling their negotiating red lines.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#baseline-15pc" id="baseline-15pc" title="Permalink"></a>Baseline 15pc</h2>
<p>The Trump-von der Leyen meeting was taking place in the president’s luxury golf resort in Turnberry on Scotland’s southwestern coast. The 79-year-old Trump said on Friday he hoped to strike “the biggest deal of them all” with the EU.</p>
<p>The EU is focused on getting a deal to avoid sweeping tariffs that would further harm its sluggish economy — while holding out retaliation as a last resort.</p>
<p>Under the proposal described to <em>AFP</em>, the EU would commit to ramping up purchases of US liquefied natural gas, along with other investment pledges.
Pharmaceuticals, a key export for Ireland, would also face a 15pc levy, as would semiconductors.</p>
<p>The EU also appears to have secured a compromise on steel that could allow a certain quota into the United States before tariffs would apply, the diplomat said.
But Trump said on Sunday that trade tariffs with the EU would not be lower than 15pc.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#auto-sector" id="auto-sector" title="Permalink"></a>Auto sector</h2>
<p>The EU has been hit by multiple waves of tariffs since Trump reclaimed the White House. It is currently subject to a 25pc levy on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900637">cars</a>, 50pc on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914658">steel and aluminium</a>, and an across-the-board <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810">tariff</a> of 10pc, which Washington threatens to hike to 30pc in a no-deal scenario.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>It was unclear how the proposed deal would impact tariff levels on the auto industry, crucial for France and Germany. Carmakers are already reeling from the levies imposed so far.</p>
<p>While 15pc would be much higher than pre-existing US tariffs on European goods, which average around 4.8pc, it would mirror the status quo, with companies currently facing an additional flat rate of 10pc.</p>
<p>Should talks fail, EU states have greenlit counter tariffs on $109 billion (€93bn) of US goods, including aircraft and cars, to take effect in stages from August 7.</p>
<p>Brussels is also drawing up a list of US services to potentially target.</p>
<p>Beyond that, countries including France say Brussels should not be afraid to deploy a so-called trade “bazooka” — EU legislation designed to counter coercion that can involve restricting access to its market and public contracts.</p>
<p>But such a step would mark a major escalation with Washington.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#ratings-dropping" id="ratings-dropping" title="Permalink"></a>Ratings dropping</h2>
<p>Trump has embarked on a campaign to reshape US trade with the world, and has vowed to hit dozens of countries with punitive tariffs if they do not reach a pact with Washington by August 1.</p>
<p>US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday the August 1 deadline was firm and there will be “no extensions, no more grace periods.”</p>
<p>Polls suggest, however, that the American public is unconvinced by the White House strategy, with a recent <a class="link--external" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/692879/independents-drive-trump-approval-second-term-low.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gallup survey</a> showing his approval rating at 37pc, down 10 points from January.</p>
<p>Having promised “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922611/trump-dispatches-letters-outlining-new-tariffs-on-foreign-nations#:~:text=While%20the%20Trump%20administration%20has%20signalled%20hopes%20of%20striking%20dozens%20of%20deals%20by%20early%20July%20%E2%80%94%20at%20one%20point%20boasting%20of%20%E2%80%9C90%20deals%20in%2090%20days%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%94%20there%20have%20been%20limited%20results%20so%20far.">90 deals in 90 days</a>,” Trump’s administration has so far unveiled five, including with Britain, Japan and the Philippines.</p></p>

            <p><p>Karachi’s Institute of Business Management (IoBM) on Saturday held its first-ever technology-centric competition as part of the ‘Technova 2025’ event.</p>
<p>According to the event’s <a class="link--external" href="https://technovaiobm.netlify.app/components/about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>, ‘TechNova’ is a premier tech and innovation event bringing together students, professionals, and enthusiasts from diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>It is a unique blend of technical and non-technical modules. The event provides an engaging platform for participants to showcase their skills, compete in exciting challenges, and explore emerging technologies.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, the event’s vice president, Muhammad Anas — a final year student at IoBM, said: “This was the first tech-centric event in the history of IoBM; it had multiple tech modules, including a final year project showcase, a startup launchpad, speed programming, prompt engineering, web and logo design, and maths mania.”</p>
<p>He added that winners were awarded with a cash prize of up to Rs50,000, and the competition was attended by students, teachers, technology experts and professionals from more than 25 universities across the country.</p>
<p>“<em>Alhamdulillah</em>, we had more people than expected. Around 500+ participants and visitors, excluding university students and staff who made up a footfall of around 2500 to 3000 people,” Anas added.</p>
<p>The event — organised under the College of Computer Science and Information Systems, aimed to provide an opportunity for youth to express their technology, creative thinking and practical skills, according to a press release by the competition.</p>
<p>The event, affiliated with the varsity’s Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ (IEEE) student branch, began with an opening session, which was attended by the leadership of the institute and personalities from the tech industry.</p>
<p>The event also included a special artificial intelligence symposium, in which experts discussed the future of artificial intelligence and its educational and industrial significance.</p>
<p>The speakers included Microsoft Pakistan Country Education Lead Jibran Jamshed, Telec Group Director Brigadier Musharraf Khan, Rector Professor Dr Tariq Rahim Soomro, and other notable speakers.</p>
<p>In the final year project competition, the students presented innovative ideas which were not only appreciated but some teams also received investment offers. Students demonstrated their creative skills in web and logo designing, while speed programming demonstrated their technical abilities through accurate coding within a set time. Academic competitions were held in ‘Maths Mania’ and ‘Prompt Engineering’, while the youth presented business ideas through ‘Launchpad’.</p>
<p>Speaking about their project, the winner of the startup launchpad competition, Ayaan Amir, a mechanical engineering student, said: “My project was a healthy food startup called GreenBite. We aim to provide oil-free meals that are not only healthy and delicious but also affordable.”</p>
<p>He added that there was a demand for a service for health-conscious individuals who want a reliable, daily meal solution without compromising on flavour or budget, and that the judges had encouraged his team to reach out to them to develop the idea further.</p>
<p>In May, Fatima Jinnah Women University (FJWU), Department of Law, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908261">organised</a> a contest under the theme of ‘Legislative Drafting and Policy Competition on AI Governance’ in the university.</p>
<p>The event was organised in collaboration with Sehrish Saba Raja and Associates Legal Clinic and Research Centre, The Society 5.0 Initiative, Law Students’ Council Pakistan, and other distinguished partners.</p>
<p>It brought together 11 teams from leading universities and think tanks across the country to present innovative legislative and policy proposals on artificial intelligence governance.</p>
<p>In March of this year, Khyber Medical University (KMU) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895592">hosted</a> the HULT Prize 2025 Campus Competition, wherein 21 emerging startups showcased their creativity and entrepreneurial skills</p></p>
