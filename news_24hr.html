            <p><p>Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad on Thursday said that no decision has been made to postpone the federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-26, clarifying that the previously announced date of June 10 remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Amid <a class="link--external" href="https://www.geo.tv/latest/606744-govt-may-postpone-budget-again-amid-eid#:~:text=Earlier%20today,%20Finance%20Ministry%20sources%20indicated%20that%20the%20federal%20government%20could%20further%20delay%20the%20presentation%20of%20the%20Budget%202025%E2%80%9326%20due%20to%20scheduling%20constraints%20posed%20by%20Eid%20holidays." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">media reports</a> claiming that the budget had once again been rescheduled due to the Eidul Azha holidays, Schehzad wrote on X today that no decision has been made to postpone or reschedule the budget.</p>
<p>“As communicated earlier, the upcoming Federal Budget FY26 is on schedule to be announced on June 10, 2025,” he wrote. “Similarly, the upcoming Pakistan Economic Survey FY25 is scheduled to be announced on June 9, 2025.”</p>

<p>Additionally, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal told reporters that there was no change in the budget date.</p>
<p>“The federal budget will be presented on June 10,” he told the media after exiting a committee meeting at the National Assembly.</p>
<p>According to the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), Eidul Azha is expected to fall on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912584">June 7</a>, which means the third day of Eid will likely fall on June 9 — the same day the Economic Survey is due to be released.</p>
<p>Last week, Schehzad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912867">announced</a> on X that the federal budget would be presented on June 10, while the Pakistan Economic Survey would be released a day earlier.</p>
<p>Before that, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909569">announced</a> that the federal government will present the next fiscal year’s budget on June 2, with a 16 per cent lower development allocation of Rs921 billion, resulting in the likely closure of about 200 ongoing development projects.</p>
<p>Last year, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1839433">presented</a> his first federal budget with a total outlay of Rs18.9 trillion, which analysts said was broadly “in line with IMF guidelines”.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb, during the budget presentation, said that the goal was to widen the tax base to avoid burdening existing taxpayers.</p></p>

<p>Earlier this week, the PM and his delegation, including Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, visited Turkiye, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913442">Iran</a> and Azerbaijan, expressing gratitude for their support during a recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military escalation</a> with India.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the PM took part in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913863">trilateral summit</a> with Turkiye and Azerbaijan. He reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to hold talks with India on the Kashmir dispute and counterterrorism, stressing New Delhi wanted the same “in all sincerity”.</p>
<p>According to state broadcaster <em>PTV News</em>, the PM arrived in the Tajik capital Dushanbe today for his two-day visit, being received by Tajik PM Kokhir Rasulzoda at the airport.</p>
<p>“Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant Syed Tariq Fatemi also accompanied the prime minister,” <em>PTV News</em> reported.</p>

            <p><p>Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal on Thursday said that the ban on cryptocurrency was still in place across Pakistan, stressing the need for its regulation.</p>
<p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1750061">does not recognise</a> crypto assets, which are digital currencies in which transactions are verified and recorded by a decentralised system. The SBP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1678678">issued</a> a formal notice in 2022 advising the general public to be cautious of and refrain from trading cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>During today’s meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance, PPP MNA Sharmila Farooqi introduced a bill on digital currency regulations, prompting different remarks from committee members.</p>
<p>“There are no regulations for cryptocurrency,” Farooqui said, adding that since Pakistan was moving towards digital currency, cryptocurrency should be decentralised.</p>
<p>She highlighted Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879022">exit</a> from the ‘grey list’ of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) — a global money laundering and terrorism financing watchdog — and said, “How will Pakistan protect cryptocurrency from money laundering?”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In 2018, Pakistan was placed on the so-called ’<a class="link--external" href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/high-risk-and-other-monitored-jurisdictions/documents/increased-monitoring-march-2022.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grey list’</a> for allegedly failing to take adequate measures to curb terror financing and money laundering. The country was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1716183">removed</a> from the list in 2022.</p>
<p>While highlighting the SBP’s ban on crypto investment, Bosal said, “Preliminary work is underway in the Crypto Council but there is a need for proper regulations for cryptocurrency.”</p>
<p>The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897897">officially launched</a> in March this year to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country’s financial landscape.</p>
<p>According to SBP official Sohail Jawad, there was a legal framework required for cryptocurrency. “The National Working Group on Digital Currency has been established, while suggestions have been given to the Crypto Council,” he said.</p>
<p>“Only El Salvador has legalised cryptocurrency in the world, and now they are reversing this decision,” he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, committee member Osama Ahmed said, “There is no ban on holding cryptocurrency in Pakistan.”</p>
<p>He said that cryptocurrency was being used to order vehicles from Japan, adding, “Has the State Bank taken any action on this?” He asked, “Is the government supervising the mining of cryptocurrency?”</p>
<p>MNA Mirza Ikhtiar Baig noted the youth were investing in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>“The value of cryptocurrency is increasing due to government measures, so the government should clearly state whether cryptocurrency is legal or not,” he stressed.</p>
<p>The finance secretary said that while the Crypto Council was established through the executive approval of the prime minister, it had not yet received legal approval.</p>
<p>“The Council must address the concerns raised in the meeting today,” he said.</p>
<p>Earlier today, PCC Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914060/pakistan-unveils-first-govt-led-strategic-bitcoin-reserve">unveiled</a> the country’s first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In his keynote speech, Saqib announced the establishment of a national bitcoin wallet, “holding digital assets already in state custody — not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signalling long-term belief in decentralised finance”.</p>
<p>He also revealed that the government had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913238">allocated</a> 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity in the first phase for bitcoin mining and AI data centres, opening doors to sovereign miners, tech firms, and clean energy partners around the world.</p>
<p>Speaking on this development, Baig said that the government had set the electricity rate for crypto mining at seven to eight cents while Pakistan’s industries were demanding nine cents per unit.</p>
<p>“Why doesn’t the government provide electricity to industries at nine cents?” he remarked, saying, “Our exports can increase if industries are provided with electricity at this rate. The government should provide electricity to residential consumers at this rate.”</p>
<p>Farooqui added, “How was the decision to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity [for crypto mining] made?”</p>
<p>She also asked whether the government conducted a detailed review of this decision, saying, “Pakistan itself is suffering from load shedding.”</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905500">gaining momentum</a> globally as the number of use cases is increasing and many countries are now making them legal.  However, it has had a mixed reception by regulators globally.</p>
<p>In some countries, like El Salvador, it has legal tender status, while in others, including Pakistan, India and China, it is not accepted as payment for goods and services, nor can one own it legally, though it is not officially banned either.</p></p>
