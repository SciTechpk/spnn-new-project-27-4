<p>A statement from Shahid Rind said: “Three passengers were martyred and seven were injured in the tragic incident” when a shooting occurred on a passenger coach coming from Karachi to Quetta in Kalat’s Nemargh area.</p>
<p>He said the injured were being moved to the District Headquarters Hospital Kalat for treatment, adding that an emergency had been imposed at the facility.</p>
<p>“Security agencies, district administration and rescue teams have immediately reached the scene. Security forces have surrounded the area and a search operation is underway. Security forces are pursuing the attackers,” Rind said.</p>

<p>Speaking to <em>Geo News</em>, he said Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti had taken notice of the incident and sought a report from police and law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>“Based on initial info, terrorists were sitting in ambush, they stopped the bus and then attacked. We cannot confirm the number of terrorists, but it was carried out from both sides of the road,” Rind said.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the shooting in Kalat in a statement from his office, extending his condolences and assailing <em>Fitna-Al-Hindustan</em> — a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">term</a> the government uses for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan — for targeting civilians.</p>
<p>“The targeting of innocent passengers by <em>Fitna-Al-Hindustan</em> terrorists is a very cowardly act,” he was quoted as saying. “These terrorists are hatching a heinous conspiracy to sabotage peace by targeting soft targets. With the support of the nation, we will foil these conspiracies by Indian-sponsored terrorists.”</p>
<p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah also condemned the incident.</p>
<p>“Targeting innocent passengers is a very barbaric act. Terrorists are a plague on the nation’s soil,” he said, adding that it was necessary to eliminate such elements for the country’s prosperity.</p>
<p>PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman said targeting innocent and defenceless civilians was a “heinous act”.</p>
<p>“The state must take decisive and robust action against terrorists. The entire nation and security institutions are united in the fight against terrorism … The government must bring terrorists and their facilitators to justice and deliver exemplary punishment,” she said.</p>

<p>PPP MNA and spokesperson Shazia Marri said such incidents went against Baloch traditions.</p>
<p>“Innocent and unarmed people are being killed on foreign instigation; these people do not deserve any leniency. Elements involved in terrorism in Balochistan should be dealt with firmly and decisively.</p>
<p>“The nation is united against the terrorists of <em>Fitna-ul-Hindustan</em>. The cowardly actions of terrorists are increasing; the federal and provincial governments should suppress such elements.”</p>

<p>The incident comes a week after at <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923342/passengers-kidnapped-in-sardhaka-rescue-operation-underway-balochistan-govt">least nine passengers</a> travelling on two Punjab-bound coaches were abducted and killed by unidentified armed men in the Sur-Dakai area, situated on the border between Balochistan’s Zhob and Loralai districts.</p>
<p>The government had said that <em>Fitna-al-Hindu­stan</em> had carried out attacks at three different places — Kakat, Mastung and Sur-Dakai.</p>
<p>The Balochistan Liberation Front, a banned outfit, later claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group said it had killed the nine individuals after blocking the highway between Musakhail-Makhtar and Khajuri.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923476/bodies-of-slain-passengers-in-balochistan-bus-killing-sent-to-punjab-hometowns-official">sources</a>, two passenger coaches en route to Punjab were intercepted in the Sur-Dakai area near the N-70 highway, close to Dab — a place along the Loralai-Zhob border. A group of armed men had blocked the road and stopped the two vehicles.</p>
<p>The armed assailants boarded the coaches, checked the identity cards of passengers and forced 10 persons off the vehicles at gunpoint. “They dragged out 10 passengers — seven from one coach and three from the other — and took them away (to an unknown place),” a surviving passenger had told Levies. “I don’t know what they did to them, but I heard gunfire as we were leaving.”</p>
<p>After abducting the nine passengers, the assailants allowed both coaches to leave the area. According to sources, the attackers had checked the national identity cards of all passengers and specifically targeted individuals with Punjab addresses. They also opened fire on the coaches during the abduction to prevent any escape.</p>
<p>In May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna-al-Hindu­stan</em>.</p>
<p>In March, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900559/several-killed-vehicles-torched-in-balochistan">five people</a> were killed by armed men who blocked the highway in the Kalmat area of Gwadar district, while three long-body trailers carrying urea from Gwadar port were set on fire in the Tajaban area.</p>
<p>In February, seven Punjab-bound passengers were offloaded from a bus and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892974/">shot dead</a> in Barkhan district. The incident came days after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892214">12 were killed</a> in a blast targeting a bus carrying coal miners in Harnai.</p>
<p>Balochistan has witnessed a spate of attacks targeting those hailing from Punjab. In two separate incidents in April 2024, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1827193">nine people</a> were killed after being forced off a bus near Noshki, while <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1830243">two labourers</a> from Punjab were shot in Kech.</p>
<p>In May last year, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832433">seven barbers</a> from Punjab were shot dead near Gwadar, while August saw <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854830">23 travellers</a> offloaded from trucks and buses and shot in the Musakhail district.</p>
<p>The Musakhail incident was part of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855006">flare-up of violence</a>, where dozens of militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army — a separatist outfit — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854776/gun-grenade-attacks-in-balochistan">launched numerous attacks</a> across Balochistan, targeting security personnel as well as civilians.</p>

                <h2>UK lifts ban on Pakistani airlines, removes country from Air Safety List</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The United Kingdom on Wednesday removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, thereby allowing Pakistani airlines to now apply to operate flights to the UK, according to a statement from the British High Commission in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Debt-ridden Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1566153">banned</a> from flying to the European Union, UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1558944">killing nearly 100 people</a>. The ban on operating to Europe was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875575">lifted</a> in November last year.</p>
<p>Today’s development comes after a team from the UK Department for Transport <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923408/uk-audit-approves-pakistan-aviation-security">concluded</a> an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”.</p>
<p>“Following air safety improvements, the UK’s Air Safety Committee has lifted UK restrictions on Pakistani carriers,” said a statement from the British High Commission.</p>
<p>“Individual airline carriers will still need to apply for permits to operate to the UK through the UK Civil Aviation Authority.”</p>
<p>British High Commissioner Jane Marriott was quoted as saying: “I’m grateful to aviation experts in the UK and Pakistan for their collaborative work to drive improvements to meet international safety standards.</p>
<p>“While it will take time for flights to resume, once the logistics are in place, I look forward to using a Pakistani carrier when visiting family and friends.”</p>
<p>In a post on X, Marriott called the approval “an important step, and a testament” to PIA’s air safety improvements.</p>

<p>Decisions on de-listing states and air carriers from the UK Air Safety List are made through an independent aviation safety process, according to the statement.</p>
<p>“This is overseen by the UK’s Air Safety Committee, who have <em>[sic]</em> been closely engaging with the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority over several years.</p>
<p>“The committee has judged that necessary safety improvements have been made since its original decision in 2021. Therefore, based on this independent and technically-driven process, it has decided to remove Pakistan and its air carriers from the list.”</p>
<p>PIA said it was all set to resume flights to the UK now.</p>
<p>“It became possible after adherence to the most stringent flight safety standards, reviewed by the UK’s Air Safety Committee.”</p>

<p>In a press conference in Islamabad, Asif said the aviation ministry would now apply for licences to restore routes to Britain.</p>
<p>The minister said Airblue had also been removed from the safety list: “According to my knowledge, they have allowed not just PIA but also Airblue.”</p>
<p>Asif affirmed that the government was making efforts to resume New York flights.</p>
<p>The move adds to another positive development, with the UK government yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924354">launching</a> e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an “enhanced” border and immigration system.</p>
<p>A day prior to that, the two countries formally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924280/pakistan-uk-ink-accord-to-boost-economic-cooperation">signed</a> the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.</p>

<p>Asif hailed the removal of Pakistani airlines from UK’s Air Safety list, but stressed the need for fixing responsibility for the loss caused to the national carrier.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, Asif strongly criticised the PTI government for the fiasco and reputational damage caused to PIA, which he called a “crime against state”.</p>
<p>He pinned the responsibility on former prime minister Imran Khan and then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan, who had stated in the National Assembly after the 2020 crash that almost <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1567845">40 per cent</a> of the country’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1565352">pilots</a> had fake licenses.</p>

<p>The minister called on the government to pursue whoever was responsible for this loss, as the nation’s image was affected and a negative impression was created about the national airline and its pilots.</p>
<p>“Imran Khan and Ghulam Sarwar turned PIA into a graveyard,” Asif quipped.</p>
<p>In reply to a question, he said Sarwar’s speech was “enough to fix responsibility” as the national flag carrier’s image was affected. He suggested that the prime minister could order an enquiry to conduct an investigation and hold individuals accountable.</p>
<p>The minister noted that PIA suffered a drop in business, planes became <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1771459">dysfunctional</a> and the pilots’ reputation was tarnished. He highlighted that overseas Pakistanis used the airline due to cheaper and direct routes.</p>
<p>Asif hailed the civil aviation regulator and ministry officials for the “historic” day, saying that the decision has restored confidence in the national airline and aviation industry. He also thanked the UK and EU regulators for their guidance to plug loopholes and meet international standards.</p>
<p>The next step was privatising PIA, Asif noted, adding that the restoration of routes will assist the process as the government will receive a higher bid price. He asserted that the private sector would be able to revive the airline with higher investment, induct a new fleet and open new routes.</p></p>
