<p>The latest fatalities in Israel, reported by Israel‚Äôs national emergency services, raised the death toll to 23 since Friday.</p>
<p>Israeli attacks in Iran have killed at least 224 people so far, including 70 women and children, while over 1,200 have been injured, the health ministry was quoted as saying earlier today by <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/at-least-224-killed-over-1-000-wounded-in-israeli-strikes-on-iran-health-ministry/3599882" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anadolu Agency</a></em>.</p>
<p>More than 90 per cent of the wounded were civilians, including women and children, health ministry official Hossein Kermanpour <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/HKermanpour/status/1934331936912326671" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X.</p>
<p>At least 100 more were wounded in Israel in the overnight blitz, part of a wave of attacks by Tehran in retaliation for Israel‚Äôs strikes targeting the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of sworn enemy Iran.</p>
<p>Search and location operations were underway in the coastal city of Haifa, where around 30 people were wounded, emergency authorities said, as dozens of first responders rushed to the strike zones.</p>
<p>Fires were seen burning at a power plant near the port, the media reported. Video footage showed several missiles over Tel Aviv and explosions could be heard there and over Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Israel‚Äôs military warned of a new missile salvo incoming from Iran. ‚ÄúA short while ago, the IDF identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the State of Israel,‚Äù the army posted on Telegram, using the acronym for its official name.</p>
<p>It said its air defences were working to intercept the threat but advised people to ‚Äúenter a protected space and remain there until further notice‚Äù.</p>
<p>Several residential buildings in a densely populated neighbourhood of Tel Aviv were destroyed in a strike that blew out the windows of hotels and other nearby homes just a few hundred meters from the US Embassy branch in the city.</p>
<p>The US ambassador to Israel said the building sustained minor damage, but there were no injuries to personnel.</p>
<p>British maritime security firm Ambrey said that fires were observed at the power plant in the vicinity of Israel‚Äôs Haifa port, <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>
<p>Ambrey said it observed video footage of the Israeli military intercepting the attack, followed by impacts from two hypersonic missiles.</p>
<p>An <em>AFP</em> journalist heard loud explosions in Jerusalem on early Monday, while footage showed Israeli air defences working over the city. Outside Haifa, an <em>AFP</em> journalist saw fires break out following the latest Iranian barrage.</p>

<p>Israel‚Äôs public broadcaster <em>Kan</em> reported that at least four areas were hit in the latest Iranian attacks on central Israel.</p>
<p>The predawn missiles also struck near Shuk HaCarmel, a popular market in Tel Aviv that typically draws large crowds of residents and tourists buying fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as popular bars and restaurants.</p>
<p>A residential street in nearby Petah Tikva and a school in ultra-Orthodox Jewish city Bnei Brak were also hit.</p>

<p>Iranian state television reported that at least five people were killed on Sunday by an Israeli strike that hit a residential building in downtown Iran.</p>
<p>Israel has claimed strikes as far away as Iran‚Äôs holy city of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1835205">Mashhad</a> in the far east, 2,300 kilometres from Israel.</p>
<p>Colonel Reza Sayyad, a spokesman for Iran‚Äôs armed forces, threatened a ‚Äúdevastating response‚Äù to Israel‚Äôs attacks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLeave the occupied territories (Israel) because they will certainly no longer be habitable in the future,‚Äù he warned in a televised address, adding shelters will ‚Äúnot guarantee security‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to <em>AFP</em>, residential areas in both countries have suffered deadly strikes since the hostilities broke out, with Israel‚Äôs Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slamming Iran on Sunday for allegedly targeting civilians.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIran will pay a very heavy price for the premeditated murder of civilians, women and children,‚Äù he said, during a visit to the site of a missile strike on a residential building in the coastal city of Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>His remarks came hours after Iranian missile fire killed another 10 people yesterday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a likely Iranian drone killed a woman in Syria, a Britain-based war monitor said, in what would be the first death on Syrian soil since the current hostilities between Iran and Israel began, reported <em>AFP.</em></p>
<p>The drone struck the woman‚Äôs home in western Tartus province, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said earlier today that it was striking surface-to-surface missile sites in central Iran, adding it was ‚Äúoperating against this threat in our skies and in Iranian skies‚Äù.</p>

<p>In Iran, a heavy cloud of smoke hung above Tehran after Israeli aircraft struck two fuel depots. Local media also reported an Israeli strike on the police headquarters in the city centre.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt been able to sleep since Friday because of the terrible noise,‚Äù said a Tehran resident who gave her name as Farzaneh.</p>
<p>‚ÄúToday, they hit a house in our alley, and we were very scared. So we decided to leave Tehran and head to the north of the country.‚Äù</p>
<p>Some, however, were determined to stay.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is natural that war has its own stress, but I will not leave my city,‚Äù 31-year-old Shokouh Razzazi told <em>AFP.</em></p>
<p><em>AFP</em> images from Israel‚Äôs Haifa, meanwhile, also showed a column of smoke rising on Sunday evening following an Iranian missile barrage.</p>

<p>The military said rescue teams ‚Äúhave been dispatched to several hit sites in Israel‚Äù, while the fire services reported rescuers heading to a building on the coast that sustained a ‚Äúdirect hit‚Äù.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, in Bat Yam, first responders wearing helmets and headlamps picked through a bombed-out building.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere was an explosion and I thought the whole house had collapsed,‚Äù said Bat Yam resident Shahar Ben Zion.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was a miracle we survived.‚Äù</p>

<p>In Washington, two US officials told <em>Reuters</em> that Trump had vetoed an Israeli plan in recent days to kill Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe found out that the Israelis had plans to hit Iran‚Äôs supreme leader. President Trump was against it, and we told the Israelis not to,‚Äù a US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>When asked about the <em>Reuters</em> report, Netanyahu <a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/netanyahu-reveals-iran-marked-trump-enemy-number-one-assassination-plot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Fox News</em></a> on Sunday: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so many false reports of conversations that never happened, and I‚Äôm not going to get into that.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe do what we need to do,‚Äù he told <em>Fox</em>‚Äôs ‚ÄòSpecial Report With Bret Baier‚Äô.</p>
<p>Asked whether <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917243">regime change</a> in Iran was one of the objectives of Israel‚Äôs strikes, Netanyahu said that ‚Äúit certainly could be the result, because the Iran regime is very weak‚Äù.</p>
<p>In the same interview, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/netanyahu-trump-iran-fox-news-b2770483.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Independent</a></em> reported, Netanyahu claimed that Iran attempted to assassinate Trump twice ‚Äúthrough proxies‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThrough their intel, yes; they want to kill him,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs enemy number one,‚Äù the Israeli premier said, referring to the US president.</p>
<p>Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20shifting%20stance%20around%20the%20Israeli%20strikes%2C%20which%20he%20called%20%E2%80%9Cexcellent%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9Cvery%20successful%E2%80%9D%20in%20a%20series%20of%20media%20interviews%20on%20Friday">lauded Israel‚Äôs offensive</a> but said Washington had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917285#:~:text=Trump%20distances%20US%20from%20strikes%20on%20Iran%2C%20warns%20against%20attacks%20on%20it%20in%20%E2%80%98any%20way%E2%80%99">nothing to do</a> with it, while threatening to unleash ‚Äúthe full strength and might‚Äù of the US military if Iran attacked American interests.</p>
<p>However, seemingly contradicting his ally, Netanyahu claimed that American pilots were shooting down drones headed towards Israel. In the same interview, he also said that he and Trump were ‚Äúfully coordinated‚Äù.</p>
<p>Trump has urged the two foes to ‚Äúmake a deal‚Äù, adding, however, that ‚Äúsometimes they have to <a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-israel-iran-have-fight-out-believes-deal-possible" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fight it out</a>‚Äù first.</p>
<p>He <a class="link--external" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-us-gets-involved-israel-iran-conflict/story?id=122865561" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>ABC News</em></a> on Sunday that he would be ‚Äúopen‚Äù to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, being a mediator. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible we could get involved‚Äù in the ongoing battle in the Middle East, he said.</p>
<p>Two US officials said on Friday that the US military had helped shoot down Iranian missiles that were headed toward Israel, according to <em>Reuters</em>. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/after-sitting-out-the-iran-attack-u-s-steps-in-to-help-israel-intercept-missiles-16749866" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> the same.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi maintained Tehran had ‚Äúsolid proof‚Äù that US forces had supported Israel in its attacks.</p>
<p>He also told a meeting of foreign diplomats that Iran‚Äôs actions were a ‚Äúresponse to aggression‚Äù. ‚ÄúIf the aggression stops, naturally our responses will also stop,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Iran scrapped <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">planned</a> nuclear <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903561">talks</a> with the United States, saying it was ‚Äúmeaningless‚Äù to negotiate while under fire.</p>

            <p><p>New Delhi said on Monday its diplomats were helping some Indian students relocate out of harm‚Äôs way in Iran, which has come under days of deadly Israeli <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917457/israel-warns-tehrans-residents-will-pay-the-price-soon-as-toll-rises-after-tel-aviv-haifa-attacks">bombardment</a>.</p>
<p>Tehran has hit back with strikes against Israel since it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/israel-launches-strikes-on-iran">unleashed</a> waves of attacks against Iran on Friday, sparking global alarm that the conflict could erupt into a regional war.</p>
<p>New Delhi, which has relations with both countries, has sought to relocate its citizens within Iran after Tehran closed its airspace.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Indian Embassy in Tehran is continuously monitoring the security situation and engaging Indian students in Iran to ensure their safety,‚Äù a foreign ministry statement said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn some cases, students are being relocated with [the] Embassy‚Äôs facilitation to safer places within Iran,‚Äù the ministry added.</p>
