            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929119/trump-imposes-additional-25pc-tariff-on-indian-goods-relations-hit-new-low' target='_blank'><strong>Trump imposes additional 25pc tariff on Indian goods, relations hit new low</strong></a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued an executive order imposing an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, citing New Delhi’s continued imports of Russian oil, sharply escalating tensions between the two countries after trade talks collapsed.</p>
<p>The new measure raises tariffs on some Indian goods to as high as 50pc, among the steepest faced by any US trading partner.</p>
<p>The move is expected to hit key Indian export sectors, including textiles, footwear, and gems and jewellery and marks the most serious downturn in US-India relations since Trump returned to office in January.</p>
<p>In an <a class="link--external" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/addressing-threats-to-the-united-states-by-the-government-of-the-russian-federation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> issued from the White House, Trump said: “I find that the Government of India is currently directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil.</p>
<p>“Accordingly, and as consistent with applicable law, articles of India imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25pc.”</p>
<p>Trump said he determined it “necessary and appropriate” to impose an additional ad valorem duty on imports of articles of India since it was directly or indirectly importing Russian oil.</p>

<p>The tariff is set to take effect in three weeks and would be added on top of a separate 25pc tariff entering into force on Thursday. It maintains exemptions for items targeted by separate sector-specific duties, such as steel and aluminium, and categories that could be hit, such as pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Trump’s executive order does not mention China, which also buys Russian oil. A White House official had no immediate comment on whether an additional order covering those purchases would be forthcoming.</p>
<p>The development pays off on Trump’s repeated threats to hike the tariff rate on India for its oil purchases from Russia.</p>
<p>India’s foreign ministry said that the decision was “extremely unfortunate” and that New Delhi would take all actions necessary to protect its national interests. “We reiterate that these actions are unfair, unjustified and unreasonable,” it said.</p>

<p>A senior Indian official said New Delhi was blindsided by the sudden imposition of the new levy and the steep rate, as both countries continue to discuss trade issues.</p>
<p>Trump said a day ago he would increase the tariff charged on imports from India from 25pc <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928905/trump-says-he-will-very-substantially-raise-tariffs-on-india-in-next-24-hours-over-russian-oil-purchases">“very substantially”</a> over the next 24 hours, given India’s continued purchases of Russian oil.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>“India has not been a good trading partner, because they do a lot of business with us, but we don’t do business with them. So we settled on 25pc but I think I’m going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they’re buying Russian oil,” he had told <em>CNBC</em> in a televised interview.</p>
<p>“They’re fuelling the war machine, and if they’re going to do that, then I’m not going to be happy,” Trump had said, adding that the main sticking point with India was that its tariffs were too high.</p>
<p>Trump last week said he would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927587">impose</a> a 25pc tariff on goods imported from India and added that the world’s fifth-largest economy would also face an unspecified penalty, but gave no details. Later, Trump mou­nted a sharp attack and said: “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”</p>
<p>Over the weekend, two Indian government sources told <em>Reuters</em> that India would keep purchasing oil from Russia despite Trump’s threats. In turn, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928504/top-trump-aide-accuses-india-of-financing-russias-war-in-ukraine">accused</a> India of effectively financing Russia’s war in Ukraine by purchasing oil from Moscow.</p>
<p>Trump had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928704">made the same threat</a> about substantially raising tariffs a day ago.</p>
<p>Responding to the threat, India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had issued a statement claiming that the US and the European Union “targeted” New Delhi for purchasing Russian oil after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.</p>
<p>The MEA highlighted in its statement that the very nations criticising India were engaging in trade with Russia themselves, adding that the goods exchanged include energy, fertilisers, mining products, chemicals, iron and steel and machinery and transport equipment.</p>
<p>“Where the United States is concerned, it continues to import from Russia uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for its electric vehicle industry, fertilisers, as well as chemicals,” the MEA statement added.</p>
<p>“In this background, the targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable. Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security.”</p>
<p>India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, is the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854116">biggest buyer</a> of seaborne Russian crude, a vital revenue earner for Russia as it wages war in Ukraine for a fourth year.</p>
<p>The US levy on India exceeds those agreed by some other nations in deals with the Trump administration. For example, the tariff on Vietnam is set at 20pc and on Indonesia at 19pc, with levies of 15pc on Japanese and European Union exports.</p>
<p>Last week, Trump said Washington had reached a trade deal with India’s arch-rival Pakistan that Islamabad said would lead to lower tariffs on its exports.</p>
<p>Since India’s short but deadly conflict with Pakistan in May, New Delhi has been unhappy about Trump’s closeness with Islamabad and has protested, casting a shadow over trade talks.</p>
<p>Despite former public displays of bonhomie between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has taken a slightly harder stance against the US in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the India-Pakistan ceasefire he announced on social media on May 10, but India disputes his claim that it resulted from his intervention and trade threats.</p>
<p>By declaring the Indian economy dead in the water, Trump has put Modi and his party in a bind. Until recently, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was canvassing support for the US president’s election. Its supporters were holding special prayers and muttering mystical chants for Trump’s victory. There was at least one temple created where a sculptured image of Trump was worshipped.</p>
<p>But Trump has ignored the lavish praise and called out India’s energy imports from Russia and its tariff regime as non-negotiable.</p>
<p>The Indian government said it was trying to figure out a response by consulting all the “stakeholders”, a euphemism for angry businesses whose hopes were riding on Modi’s daring ability to play both sides of the street.</p>
<p>That appears to have hit a dead-end.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Wednesday halted the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) from taking any action against PTI leaders Shibli Faraz and Omar Ayub.</p>
<p>The ECP on Tuesday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928901">disqualified</a> Faraz as the Senate opposition leader, Ayub as the National Assembly equivalent, then-MNAs Zartaj Gul, Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza and other PTI lawmakers following their convictions in cases related to the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">attacking</a> the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.</p>
<p>An anti-terrorism court in Faisalabad last week <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">senten­ced</a> over PTI 100 leaders and workers to jail terms of up to 10 years in connection with the riots. Faraz, Zartaj Gul and Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan were among those awarded rigorous imprisonment.</p>
<p>Identical orders issued today by a bench comprising Justice Arshad Ali and Justice Farah Jamshed said that Faraz and Ayub were in the process of appealing their convictions in the Lahore High Court (LHC) and had surrendered themselves before the PHC so they could approach the LHC.</p>
<p>The orders said that their convictions were not final and the ECP had not waited for the outcome of their appeals before disqualifying them. They directed notices be issued to the respondents in the matter and meanwhile, “the ECP shall not take any further process” under its notifications to disqualify the PTI leaders.</p>
<p>The orders adjourned both cases to Aug 20. The bench had granted protective bail to the two and Gul earlier today.</p>
<p>Talking to the media, Ayub said the ECP had disqualified him without following due procedure. He thanked the PHC for granting transit bail so he could file his appeal.</p>
<p>A day prior, Ayub lambasted the ATC’s “bogus verdict” in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/OmarAyubKhan/status/1952737607013576874" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, saying that he would contest it and the ECP’s disqualification in court.</p>
<p>He also posted a video of himself at the PHC with other PTI leaders and lawyers, saying the court had given him a few days and bail would be granted to him on filing his appeal.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929117/evidence-of-major-money-laundering-racket-found-against-bahria-town-and-malik-riaz-tarar' target='_blank'><strong>Evidence of ‘major money laundering racket’ found against Bahria Town and Malik Riaz: Tarar</strong></a>
            <p><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Wednesday said that the government had found evidence that real estate tycoon Malik Riaz and Bahria Town had engaged in money laundering on a “grand” scale.</p>
<p>The development adds to the legal woes of the property tycoon and his real estate company, with the former being an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1803717">absconder</a> in the Al-Qadir Trust case, while the National Accountability Bureau has announced a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929028">fresh auction</a> of six properties of Bahria Town.</p>
<p>Delivering a televised press statement, Tarar said: “An important development occurred a day ago in the investigation of the Bahria Town corruption case. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) carried out a successful raid in which very important documents have surfaced that are incontrovertible proof of Malik Riaz and Bahria Town’s corruption.”</p>
<p>He said the FIA had been conducting an ongoing investigation, with raids being carried out as well. “The documents that have surfaced reveal money laundering and corruption of a great amount by Malik Riaz and Bahria Town with the documents recovered so far showing evidence of Rs1.12 billion in money laundering,” the information minister added.</p>
<p>Tarar said Rawalpindi’s Safari Hospital was being used as a “front office” where cash and records were kept.</p>
<p>“The hospital’s ambulances were being used to transport the money and records,” the minister said. “Not only does this prove illegal transactions and hundi hawala, but the money and documents were kept in the hospital so no suspicion arises.</p>
<p>“When the raid took place yesterday … two people — Imran and Kaiser — who ran the hawala and hundi operations, were linked to the Bahria Town chief financial officer and the evidence has been seized by the FIA,” he added.</p>
<p>Tarar alleged that Bahria Town’s leadership, CFO and finance director were “running a major money laundering racket through which amounts were being sent abroad”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“There will be more amounts besides the Rs1.12bn that will come forth,” he said, adding that the investigation was only beginning.</p>
<p>“The setup in the hospital is clear evidence that billions were being sent out of the country illegally to damage the economy. None of this money was sent abroad through official or banking channels but through illegal means.</p>
<p>“As soon as the FIA carried out the raid, Bahria Town personnel tried to burn some of the records. Some documents were burnt, but we seized the majority of the records … If there was nothing illegal in that hospital, why burn records?” Tarar asked.</p>
<p>The information minister said that the “corruption racket” was being investigated, adding that it involved a lot more people and the FIA had information about the locations of others involved in the scheme.</p>
<p>“I ask these people to turn themselves in,” Tarar said. “Malik Riaz organised all of this and sending money abroad through hundi and hawala is a crime. We will bring more evidence before the public.</p>
<p>“Bahria Town CFO Amir Rasheed and Bahria Town head Shahid Qureshi have been linked to Imran and Kaiser, who were running a racket. Indisputable evidence proves that they were colluding in this mega corruption scandal,” the information minister said.</p>
<p>Tarar maintained that those living in Bahria Town would not be affected by the government’s investigation. “We are only investigating Malik Riaz, his officials and family members involved in this racket,” he clarified.</p>

<p>The development comes a day after Riaz called for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928921">“dialogue and a dignified solution”</a> amidst Bahria Town’s legal troubles.</p>
<p>“I would like to make a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928921/malik-riaz-calls-for-truce-amid-bahria-towns-legal-woes">final appeal</a> from the bottom of my heart that we be given a chance to return to serious dialogue, and a dignified solution,” he wrote in a post on X.</p>
<p>“For this purpose, we assure you that we will participate in any arbitration and implement its decision 100 per cent,” the property tycoon added. “On this occasion, I also assure you that if the arbitration decision requires payment of money from our side, we will ensure its payment, God willing.”</p>
<p>The property tycoon or Bahria Town have not yet responded to the information minister’s statements.</p>

<p>Separately, Bahria Town today filed an appeal against the NAB auction of its properties allowed by the Islamabad High Court.</p>
<p>“The impugned order … passed by honourable Islamabad High Court … as well as the order dated [March 19] passed by Accountability Court No.1 are contrary to the express provisions of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999, as amended by the Second Amendment Act, 2022, which provides that ‘upon failure of an accused to comply with a plea bargain Agreement, the Agreement becomes inoperative with respect to the rights and obligations of the parties immediately’,” the petition, available with <em>Dawn.com</em> argued.</p>
<p>The petition also argued that NAB “initiated a series of baseless and vexatious legal proceedings with mala fide intent to harass, pressurise and coerce the petitioner”, calling the manner in which NAB acted “discriminatory and prejudicial”.</p>
<p>“The courts … failed to appreciate that [NAB] does not have any authority to auction or sell the properties of the petitioner, in view of Section 33-E (recovery of amount of fines, etc as arrears of land revenue) of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 and the provisions of the West Pakistan Land Revenue Act, 1967,” the petition argued.</p>
<p>The petition requested that the Supreme Court grant leave to appeal the IHC’s order.</p>
