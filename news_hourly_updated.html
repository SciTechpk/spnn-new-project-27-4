                <h2>PM pleased as remittances rise by 26.6pc to hit record $38.3bn in FY25</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his satisfaction on Wednesday as data showed that workers‚Äô remittances increased by 26.6 per cent to hit a record $38.3 billion during the fiscal year 2025 as compared to the corresponding period of last year.</p>
<p>The State Bank of Pakistan said remittances reached $38.3bn during July-June 2024-25, as compared to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844949">$30.3bn</a> in remittances received during the same period for FY2023-24.</p>
<p>Similarly, on a year-by-year basis, the workers‚Äô remittances went up by 7.9pc to $3.406bn in June 2025, compared to $3.158bn during the same month last year.</p>

<p>Data showed that Saudi Arabia ($823.2m) and the United Arab Emirates ($717.2m) were the biggest sources of remittance inflows during June 2025, followed by the United Kingdom ($537.6m) and the United States ($281.2m).</p>
<p>A statement from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office said the premier was pleased at the development, saying that the government was committed to economic prosperity after bringing economic stability, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe record surge in remittances reflects expatriate Pakistanis‚Äô valuable contributions and their confidence in the national economy,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>He expressed the opinion that the recent positive economic indicators were a ‚Äúmanifestation of the government‚Äôs policies in the right direction‚Äù.</p>
<p>Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad termed the record remittances ‚Äúmassive‚Äù in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/kschehzad/status/1942869065359364192" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X and added that the feat ‚Äúreflects growing trust of overseas Pakistanis in the economy and policy measures‚Äù.</p>

                <h2>SBP to launch pilot for digital currency, says governor</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Jameel Ahmad said on Wednesday the institution plans to launch a pilot for a digital currency and is finalising legislation to regulate virtual assets as the government ramps up efforts to modernise the country‚Äôs financial system.</p>
<p>Central banks globally are exploring the use of digital currencies as interest in blockchain-based payments grows. Pakistan‚Äôs move follows similar steps by regulators in China, India, Nigeria and several Gulf states to test or issue digital currencies through controlled pilot programmes.</p>
<p>At the <a class="link--external" href="https://events.reutersevents.com/nextasia" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Reuters</em> NEXT Asia</a> summit in Singapore, Ahmad said Pakistan was ‚Äúbuilding up our capacity on the central bank digital currency‚Äù and hoped to roll out a pilot soon.</p>
<p>He was speaking on a panel alongside Sri Lanka‚Äôs central bank governor, P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, with both discussing monetary policy challenges in South Asia.</p>
<p>Ahmad said a new law would ‚Äúlay down the foundations for the licensing and regulation‚Äù of the virtual assets sector and that the central bank was in touch with some tech partners.</p>
<p>The move builds on efforts by the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897897">set up</a> in March by the government to drive virtual asset adoption.</p>
<p>Bilal bin Saqib, PCC chief executive officer and state minister on blockchain and crypto, said in a statement today that the government had <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/business/virtual-assets-act-2025-approved-formally/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approved</a> the  Virtual Assets Act 2025, creating an independent regulator to license and oversee the crypto sector.</p>
<p>The PCC is exploring bitcoin mining using surplus energy, has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902715">appointed</a> Binance founder Changpeng Zhao as a strategic adviser and plans to establish a state-run <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914060">Strategic Bitcoin Reserve</a>.</p>

<p>It has also held talks with US-based crypto firms, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906732">World Liberty Financial</a> linked to US President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>In May, the SBP <a class="link--external" href="https://www.sbp.org.pk/press/2025/Pr-30-May-2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">clarified</a> that virtual assets were not <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914439#:~:text=informed%20the%20National%20Assembly%E2%80%99s%20Standing%20Committee%20on%20Finance%20that%20cryptocurrency%20is%20currently%20banned">illegal</a>. However, it advised financial institutions not to engage with them until a formal licensing framework was in place.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere are risks associated, and at the same time, there are opportunities in this new emerging field. So we have to evaluate and manage the risk very carefully, and at the same time not allow to let go of the opportunity,‚Äù he said on the panel.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#tight-grip-falling-interest-rates" id="tight-grip-falling-interest-rates" title="Permalink"></a>Tight grip, falling interest rates</h2>
<p>Ahmad said the SBP would continue to maintain a tight policy stance to stabilise inflation within its 5‚Äì7 per cent medium-term target.</p>
<p>Pakistan has cut its benchmark rate from a peak of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1830543">22pc</a> to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908601">11pc</a> over the past year, as inflation slumped from 38pc in May 2023 to 3.2pc in June, averaging 4.5pc in the 2025 fiscal year just ended, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921571">nine-year low</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are now seeing the results of this tight monetary policy transfer, both on our inflation as well as on the external account,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Ahmad said Pakistan was not overly exposed to dollar weakness, noting its foreign debt was mostly dollar-denominated and only 13pc comprised Eurobonds or commercial loans.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt see any major impact,‚Äù he said, adding that reserves had risen to $14.5 billion from under $3bn two years ago.</p>
<p>Ahmad said Pakistan‚Äôs three-year $7bn <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">IMF programme</a>, which runs through September 2027, was on track and had resulted in reforms in fiscal policy, energy pricing and the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are confident that after that [IMF programme], maybe we will not require an immediate [follow-up].‚Äù</p>
<p>Asked whether Pakistan had financing plans lined up for upcoming military equipment purchases, particularly imports from China, the SBP governor said he was not aware of such plans.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#govt-approves-virtual-assets-act-2025" id="govt-approves-virtual-assets-act-2025" title="Permalink"></a>Govt approves Virtual Assets Act 2025</h2>
<p>Earlier today, the government formally approved the Virtual Assets Act, 2025, following endorsements from the federal cabinet, the prime minister and the president, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>The law establishes the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922661">Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority</a> (PVARA), an autonomous federal body empowered to licence, regulate and supervise entities dealing in virtual assets, according to a press release issued by the office of the special assistant on blockchain and cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The authority has been granted comprehensive powers to ensure transparency, compliance, financial integrity, and the prevention of illicit activities, in alignment with international standards, including those of the Financial Action Task Force.</p>
<p>The board of the authority will include key government stakeholders, such as the SBP governor, secretaries of finance, law and justice, and information technology and telecommunications, as well as the chairpersons of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the Digital Pakistan Authority.</p>
<p>Additionally, two independent directors with expertise in virtual assets, law, finance, or technology will be appointed by the federal government. The chairperson, appointed on the basis of demonstrated experience in finance, law, technology, or regulatory affairs, will oversee the authority‚Äôs functions.</p>
<p>Under the act, any person or company intending to offer virtual asset services in or from Pakistan must be licensed by the authority. A structured licensing regime will be introduced, with specific requirements for incorporation, operational capacity, compliance frameworks and reporting obligations.</p>
<p>The legislation also incorporates a framework for responsible innovation by establishing a regulatory sandbox, allowing emerging technologies and business models to be tested under supervisory oversight. In addition, the authority may issue no-action relief letters under defined conditions to facilitate experimentation while preserving regulatory accountability.</p>
<p>To ensure compatibility with Islamic finance principles, the law mandates the formation of a shariah advisory committee, which will advise the authority on matters related to the shariah compliance of virtual asset products and services.</p>
<p>Licensed entities offering Islamic financial products will be bound by the rulings issued by the committee.</p>
<p>The act also provides for the establishment of a virtual assets appellate tribunal to hear appeals against regulatory decisions. The tribunal will function with judicial independence and a specialised bench comprising experts in law, finance, and technology.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith this forward-looking legislation, Pakistan takes a major step in shaping a secure, inclusive and innovation-friendly digital financial ecosystem, ensuring that technological progress is matched with institutional readiness and public interest safeguards,‚Äù <em>APP</em> said.</p></p>
