                <h2>11 soldiers martyred, 78 wounded while defending Pakistan in Indian attack: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least 11 soldiers were martyred and 78 wounded while defending Pakistan against India‚Äôs ‚Äúunprovoked and reprehensible dastardly attacks‚Äù during the recent escalation between the neighbours, said the military‚Äôs media wing in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan under the banner of Operation Sindoor, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>On Saturday, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">announced</a> that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), 40 civilians ‚Äî including seven women and 15 children ‚Äî lost their lives in the Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.</p>
<p>The martyrs from the Pakistan Army include Naik Abdul Rehman, Lance Naik Dilawar Khan, Lance Naik Ikramullah, Naik Waqar Khalid, Sepoy Muhammad Adeel Akbar and Sepoy Nisar, as per the statement.</p>
<p>The martyrs from the Pakistan Air Force include Squadron Leader Usman Yousuf, Chief Technician Aurangzeb, Senior Technician Najeeb, Corporal Technician Farooq, and Senior Technician Mubashir.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan Armed Forces mounted a resolute response under the banner of Marka-i-Haq, delivering precise and notch-up retributive strikes through Operation Bunyanum Marsoos‚Äù, stated the ISPR in its statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTheir noble sacrifice of martyrs is an enduring symbol of courage, devotion, and unwavering patriotism ‚Äî etched forever in the nation‚Äôs memory,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúLet there be no ambiguity: any attempt to challenge Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty or territorial integrity, ever again, shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response.‚Äù</p>
<p>Paying tribute to the martyred civilians and military personnel, the ISPR offered heartfelt prayers for the recovery of the injured.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet there be no ambiguity: any attempt to challenge Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty or territorial integrity, ever again, shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response,‚Äù the statement read while reaffirming that the nation ‚Äúremains resolute in the face of aggression.‚Äù</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz Sharif has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910450/nation-celebrates-befitting-response-to-aggression">announced</a> that Youm-e-Marka-i-Haq will be observed every year on May 10 on the ‚Äúmagnificent success‚Äù of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. Friday, May 16, 2025, will be observed as a day to pay tribute to the armed forces for achieving magnificent success on the defence front and to bow before God in gratitude, he added.</p></p>

                <h2>More funds to be allocated for education sector in upcoming budget: KP CM</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ali Amin Gandapur on Tuesday vowed that the provincial government will make education a ‚Äútop priority‚Äù in the upcoming budget and allocate more resources towards the sector, state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/13-05-2025/more-funds-to-be-allocated-for-education-sector-in-upcoming-budget-kp-cm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>The chief minister‚Äôs concerns follow in the wake of the unexpected <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910614/shortage-of-books-troubles-students-teachers-in-kp">textbook shortage</a> in the province which has disrupted classes, high dropout rates, and Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúlow‚Äù ranking in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854348">District Education Performance Index Report 2020-23</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPresiding over a meeting in Peshawar, he directed measures to enhance teachers‚Äô capacity, ensure 100 per cent merit in new recruitments, and establish schools in rented buildings in areas where they are urgently needed,‚Äù the report said.</p>
<p>During the meeting, it was decided that comprehensive and multi-faceted measures would be taken to increase student enrollment in schools. In this regard, schemes would be included in the upcoming budget to support various activities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGandapur expressed concern that in some districts,  the rate of out-of-school children remains alarming, and the declaration of an education emergency is a necessary step to reduce this number and improve enrollment rates,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The chief minister emphasised strengthening the monitoring system and taking steps to provide missing facilities such as laboratories, examination halls, and other essential infrastructure in existing schools.</p>
<p>During the last two decades, students received books from the provincial government free of charge at the start of the scholastic year in April.  Two years ago, the government decided to deliver only half of the required books as the costs reached over Rs10 billion, directing the schools‚Äô administration to collect old books from the students promoted to the next grades and fulfil the remaining book requirements.</p>
<p>This year, however, a complex situation has emerged in schools as the textbook board claims that it has printed all the books requested by the education department but students and teachers have complained about a shortage of books.</p>
<p>In August last year, an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854348">official report</a> placed the country‚Äôs education system in the ‚Äòlow‚Äô performance category and highlighted critical areas requiring attention to improve education outcomes.</p></p>
