                <h2>JUI-F chief Fazl advises ‚Äòchange‚Äô in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa administration</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Saturday suggested that there should be a ‚Äúchange‚Äù in the PTI-led Khyber Pakht¬≠un¬≠khwa government, adding that it would be better if the change came from within the ruling party amid reports of possible efforts afoot to bring a ‚Äúregime change‚Äù in the province.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921763">met</a> two key leaders from the province, ostensibly to get a handle on the political situation. The PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre believes that the PTI government in KP has failed to deliver for over a decade, and recent events have further cemented their conviction that the provincial government is failing to safeguard the lives of the people. Meanwhile, the PTI has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921760/pti-warns-against-attempt-to-topple-provincial-set-up">warned</a> against any attempt to topple the provincial government through constitutional means.</p>
<p>Addressing the matter at a press conference in Peshawar today, the JUI-F chief said, ‚ÄúMy advice would be that there should be a change in the province but if the PTI is in the majority, then the change should be from within the majority of the PTI. If the same people come together to bring a change in the provincial government, then it will be better.‚Äù</p>
<p>Fazl said he preferred this option rather than the opposition coming together and bringing a change in the government.</p>
<p>He added that it was his belief and that of his party that the majority of the province was ‚Äúfake‚Äù and a product of rigging but it could not tolerate any political struggle or uncertainty, thus it would be better if there was a change from within the ruling PTI.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Speaking on the prevailing security situation in the province, Fazl said, ‚ÄúThe common citizen‚Äôs life is insecure today.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf the opposition parties contact us then will we talk to them and also try to hold an all party conference to discuss this issue and come up with a strategy to deal with it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Speaking about the merger of Fata with KP, he said, ‚ÄúWe strongly opposed the merger when it was being done.‚Äù</p>
<p>Fazl said that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922671/pti-muqam-spar-over-ex-fata-jirga-committee">committee</a> formed to bring reforms in ex-Fata did not have representation from KP.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFrom all the parties, only we have been asked for representatives for the committee, but we haven‚Äôt given our representatives,‚Äù he added. The JUI-F chief said that the party would take its decision in consultation with tomorrow‚Äôs grand tribal jirga.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIs this decision an admission of the failure of the previous decision (Fata merger) or another ploy to gain access to the minerals of the area?‚Äù he asked.</p>
<p>The JUI-F chief said that if he was content with the federal government‚Äôs decisions, then he would have joined them. ‚ÄúBoth the federal and the provincial governments were a result of electoral rigging,‚Äù Fazl said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi said that the ex-Fata committee was not ‚Äúabout reversing the merger of Fata and the province‚Äù.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Peshawar, he said, ‚ÄúThe committee was formed when the prime minister and Field Marshal [Asim] Munir visited and a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915208">jirga</a> was held.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe provincial government said that the jirga system that had ended in the merged districts should be revived, and this is what the committee was formed for.‚Äù</p></p>

                <h2>MQM founder Altaf Hussain‚Äôs condition has ‚Äògreatly improved‚Äô: party official</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) founder Altaf Hussain‚Äôs health has been on the mend after he was admitted to the hospital, according to a video by a party official posted on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hussain was recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923515">hospitalised</a> in London due to ‚Äúsevere illness‚Äù, where he underwent multiple tests. London-based senior party leader Mustafa Azizabadi told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the MQM founder‚Äôs treatment was ongoing and ‚Äúhopefully it‚Äôs not something serious‚Äù.</p>
<p>In a video message posted early on X today, Azizabadi stated that the MQM founder‚Äôs health had improved since yesterday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAltaf Hussain <em>bhai</em> (brother) has undergone some tests and blood transfusion has been given. The tests show that Altaf <em>bhai‚Äôs</em> health ‚Ä¶ has greatly improved,‚Äù Azizabadi said. ‚ÄúDoctors are treating him according to the test results.‚Äù</p>
<p>He highlighted that misinformation had spread about Hussain‚Äôs condition, calling it ‚Äúupsetting‚Äù.</p>

<p>An update from MQM Coordination Committee Deputy Convener Qasim Ali said doctors conducted a detailed medical examination and agreed to continue treatment in light of the test reports from a day ago.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDoctors have advised continuing blood transfusions for Altaf Hussain today as well due to a decrease in blood count.‚Äù</p>

<p>Previously known as the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, Hussain founded his party in 1984 to represent the Urdu-speaking community, which had migrated to Pakistan amid Partition.</p>

<p>Under Hussain‚Äôs leadership, MQM swept the 1988 election in Sindh‚Äôs urban areas, emerging as the third-largest party in the country.</p>
<p>The MQM under Hussain was accused of using violent tactics to attain and retain political power. On the contrary, Hussain maintained that the state and other political parties have targeted MQM and its workers ever since its formation.</p>
<p>Hussain currently lives in London, where he has been in self-imposed exile since 1992. He was later granted British citizenship. From London, Hussain played an active role in politics, regularly broadcasting political speeches to his followers in Karachi.</p></p>
