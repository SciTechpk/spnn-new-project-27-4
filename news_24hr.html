            <p><p>The Pakistan military has brought down five Indian jets in retaliation for late-night strikes by its neighbouring country launched at six sites, according to officials.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between Pakistan and India began roughly around 1am on Wednesday with the Indian air strikes when the neighbouring country launched “Operation Sindoor”. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed the downing of two Indian jets around 2:45am as Pakistan launched its swift response. The confirmation of the third Indian plane came around 3:42am via state media, <em>PTV</em>, saying: “Pakistan Air Force shot down another Indian Rafale aircraft 17 nautical miles southwest of Awantipora.” The military spokesperson provided an updated damage assessment of the scenario around 4am. Confirmation of the fourth and fifth jets came after 5am by the defence and information ministers, and the military.</p>

<p>Similarly, appearing on <em>Geo News</em> at 5:09am, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also said that Pakistan had downed five Indian jets.</p>
<p>“[We shot jets down] in Akhnoor, Ambala, Barnala and in Jammu. We also shot down quadcopters and a big drone,” he stated. “It is an ongoing situation, we need to see what India does.”</p>
<p>The military, <em>Reuters</em> reported, said the five Indian fighter jets included three Rafale planes and one each of Russian planes, a Su-30 and MiG-29.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the military told <em>Reuters</em> Indian planes were only targeted after they attacked Pakistan.</p>
<p>There was no word from India on the downing of the jets, which would be the most serious loss for the Indian military in decades and risked further escalation.</p>
<p>The Rafale fighter is a new addition to India’s military, part of a plan to modernise its military, reduce dependence on Russian-origin equipment, and boost domestic weapons production to supply forces deployed along two contentious borders with Pakistan and China.</p>
<p>Before the clash, the Indian Air Force operated 36 Rafale fighters, while the navy’s aircraft fleet mainly comprises Russian MiG-29 jets.</p>
<p>India signed a deal with France’s Dassault Aviation on Monday to buy another 26 Rafale fighter aircraft worth 630 billion rupees ($7.4 billion) for its navy in late April.</p>
<p>Tarar earlier said that Pakistan’s military response was ongoing but did not share operational details. “We shot down two Indian planes and we are responding to Indian aggression right now as we speak,” he told British broadcaster <em>Sky News</em>.</p>
<p>“Indian media, in a state of frenzy, is continuously running fabricated stories about losses of Pakistani Air Force and false claims of damaged aircraft,” <em>PTV</em> had said, stating, “No Pakistan Air Force aircraft has sustained any damage.”</p>

<p>Appearing on British broadcaster <em>Sky News</em> around 2:45am, Tarar said Pakistan’s response is ongoing, but did not share operational details.</p>
<p>When asked about the potential for escalation, Tarar said it “is an evolving situation”.</p>
<p>He reiterated that Pakistan was expecting an attack by India and said that “they would be the aggressor”.</p>
<p>“We offered an investigation into the whole Pahalgam episode, we wanted a fair and transparent investigation. But … India, without evidence, has targeted civilians, women and children. India had no right to do that,” he added.</p>
<p>“As the minister for information, I have occupied a seat of responsibility,” Tarar said. “I have taken an oath and I will give you verified information.”</p>
<p>When asked why India blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack, Tarar replied: “This area (Pahalgam) is a good 200 kilometres from the Line of Control. The FIR was filed in 10 minutes, but police arrived after one and a half hours.”</p>
<p>Tarar accused India of “running away” from an investigation into the Pahalgam attack and accused India’s governing party of “wanting a reason to attack Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“We have a high morale and we will respond to Indian aggression,” he said.</p>
<p>“India has no evidence whatsoever to link Pakistan to this incident,” he stressed. “India has attacked civilians … without any justifiable cause and because we have the right to self-defence, we will defend our country, we will respond.”</p>
<p>Questioned about terrorists found hiding in Pakistan in the past, including Al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden, Tarar rejected the allegations and reiterated that Pakistan was facing terrorist attacks “every second week”.</p>
<p>“If you’re talking about the history — the Soviet invasion, the cold war — then that’s a different story,” he said.</p>
<p>Tarar also maintained that the US had thanked Pakistan for its efforts in the war against terrorism and “for the good fight we are fighting”.</p>
<p>“India will now face Pakistan’s very fierce response, because we are never the aggressors,” he said.</p>
<p>Referring to Pahalgam, Tarar said India “is questioning its own government”.</p>
<p>“They have no evidence, they have no facts and they ran away from the investigation which Pakistan had offered,” the minister added. They attacked our civilians, they attacked our mosque today, they attacked five localities. Pakistan will now respond and will respond very, very effectively.</p>
<p>“Our desire for peace should not be mistaken for weakness,” he said.</p>
<p>When asked about India’s strikes, Tarar said that no terrorist infrastructure was hit.</p>
<p>“When I took foreign and local journalists to a village near the LoC … tomorrow morning, I was planning to take them to Bahawalpur and Muridke to show them where the strikes have occurred, to show that the local population is living there.</p>
<p>“We totally deny India’s allegations regarding terrorists,” Tarar maintained. “We have complete evidence that women and children have been targeted, there are civilian casualties in this and we will bring the evidence to foreign and local media. There are no terrorist camps.”</p>
<p>Questioned about the possibility of de-escalation, Tarar said that the situation is ongoing, adding, “let’s see how it turns out”.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>ARY News</em> at 1:06am about the initial details of the attack, DG Chaudhry said: “All of our air force jets are airborne. This cowardly and shameful attack was carried out from within India’s airspace. They were never allowed to come and intrude into the space of Pakistan.”</p>
<p>He noted: “Let me say it unequivocally: Pakistan will respond to this at a time and place of its own choosing. This heinous provocation will not go unanswered.”</p>
<p>“This temporary happiness that India has achieved with this cowardly attack will be replaced with enduring grief.”</p>

<p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told <em>ARY News</em> that civilian areas were attacked.</p>
<p>“The attacks were carried out on civilian areas,” Asif said, adding that the “cowards” attacked from their own airspace. “They never left their house. Let them come out, we will respond fittingly.”</p>
<p>When asked about Pakistan’s decisions, Asif replied that Pakistan will retaliate.</p>
<p>“We will give a far greater response than their own strike,” the minister said. “Not only did they attack civilians but they did it from their own airspace.”</p>
<p>On <em>Geo News</em>, Asif clarified that the strikes were launched from within India’s airspace.</p>
<p>“Women and children have been martyred in civilian areas. India is claiming it was targeting terrorist camps,” he said. “There is no such thing, international media can visit the targets so that India’s lies are exposed. We are offering international media to come wherever attacks have happened.”</p>
<p>The defence minister further said: “They don’t have the courage to attack us in our airspace, and they are firing on women and children. Mosques have been destroyed.”</p>
<p>He vowed that “we will give a befitting response,” he said. “They will immediately receive their due.”</p>
<p>Multiple loud explosions were heard in Azad Jammu and Kashmir close to the mountains around the city of Muzaffarabad after midnight, multiple <em>Reuters</em> witnesses said.</p>
<p>After the explosions, the city’s power was blacked out, the witnesses said.</p>

<p>“Our actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted.

<p>“Pakistan must launch an immediate strong counter strike against India. We have to teach India and fascist Modi a lesson India will never forget. It is imperative that PM Imran Khan is released from Adiala because he is the single person who can unify the country,” demanded Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub.</p>

<p>“India’s act of aggression has resulted in martyrdom of civilians, including women and children. This act of aggression has also caused grave threat to commercial air traffic.</p>
<p>“We strongly condemn India’s cowardly action, which is a flagrant violation of the UN Charter, international law, and established norms of inter-state relations.</p>
<p>In the wake of Pahalgam attack, the Indian leadership has once again used the bogey of terrorism to advance its sham narrative of victimhood, jeopardising regional peace and security. India’s reckless action has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict.“</p>
<p>The FO said the situation continues to evolve and Pakistan reserves the right to respond appropriately at a time and place of its choosing, in accordance with the Article-51 of the UN Charter, and as enshrined in international law.</p>
<p>“The government, armed forces and people of Pakistan stand united in the face of Indian aggression. They will always act with iron resolve to protect and preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan.”</p>
<p>“We the people of Pakistan stand together as a nation against this ugly, senseless, foolish Indian aggression. We are shoulder to shoulder with our fighting forces and will defend our homeland against this cowardly Indian attack,” said former president Arif Alvi.</p>

<p>United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres is very concerned about Indian military operations in Pakistan and AJK, his spokesperson said, while calling for maximum military restraint from India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>“The world cannot afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan.”</p>
<p>United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed called on India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, de-escalate tensions and avoid further escalation that threatens regional and international peace, the Emirati state news agency <em>WAM</em> reported early on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The minister stressed the importance of heeding the voices calling for dialogue and mutual understanding to prevent military escalation, strengthen stability in South Asia, and avoid further regional tensions, <em>WAM</em> added.</p>

<p>The sources said the airspace was initially closed for 48 hours and all flights were cancelled, with passengers advised to return home.</p>
<p>“Major change in air routes in the region. All foreign flights rerouted to Pakistani airspace. Foreign flights leave Pakistani airspace and head towards the Arabian Sea.

<p>Earlier, Asif said that a clash with India “can happen anytime” amid the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586">ongoing tensions</a> between the two countries in the wake of a militant attack in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the headquarters of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) earlier in the day, where he was briefed on the country’s preparation for a “conventional threat”. Asif was also part of the visit.</p>
<p>Speaking in an interview on <em>Geo News</em> show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ on the briefings in the ISI HQ, the defence minister reiterated that he had already said before that a clash with India was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907158">imminent</a>.</p>
<p>“That is still imminent today and can happen anytime,” he said, adding that a confrontation could be “one of the choice” India could want to adopt but “we have developed a countermeasure for every choice, whether that is a surgical strike or ground attack or air attack or naval engagement.</p>
<p>“We are ready for them everywhere at all times.”</p>
<p>He said the “crux” of today’s briefing was that “every kind of incursion or attack is being expected from them.”</p>
<p>Asif added that the briefing also delved into Pakistan’s strategy for responding to any situation.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Questioned about the chance of an ambush on a large scale, the minister said such actions were always taken on a small scale and added that he did not see any possibility of a big ambush or movement since it was detected immediately.</p>
<p>“We are continuously monitoring them,” he said, referring to Indian activities on the border. “Everything is in our watch. It is not the matter that they’re doing something hidden, which will cause an ambush.”</p>
<p>Asif said Pakistan’s preparation was complete and the government would not sit idly by. “A befitting response will be given to them at every level the moment they make a move.”</p>
<p>Pakistan has also taken the matter to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586">United Nations Security Council</a>, which was briefed on the country’s stance on the Pahalgam attack and India’s “unsubstantiated” allegations.</p>
<p>In the latest moves by the two nuclear-armed nations, the Civil Defence in Rawalpindi has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908691/civil-defence-activates-14-posts-in-rawalpindi">activated its 14 posts</a> in the garrison city while all states in India are set to conduct <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908697/indian-states-told-to-conduct-air-raid-drills">mock drills</a> for “effective civil defence”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the United States again today called for calm between India and Pakistan, after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned of stopping water from flowing across borders.</p>
<p>“We continue to urge Pakistan and India to work towards a responsible resolution that maintains long-term peace and regional stability in South Asia,” State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters.</p>
<p>She did not comment on Modi’s latest comments but said that the US was “aware of various reports” on the situation and was “engaged”. “We remain in touch with the governments of both countries at multiple levels,” she said.</p>

<p>“The leadership was apprised of regional security developments and the evolving threat matrix, including conventional military options, hybrid warfare tactics and terrorist proxies,” it added.</p>
<p>The premier was accompanied by Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, Asif and the services chiefs, the PMO said.</p>
<p>The services chiefs — Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar — were part of the visiting team, according to a group photo released on the occasion.</p>
<p>The picture also showed ISI Director General Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik — who was recently appointed as the country’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907660">national security adviser</a> — and the military’s media spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, present there.</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz and the accompanying dignitaries “underscored the imperative of heightened national vigilance, seamless inter-agency coordination, and reinforced operational readiness to deter and decisively respond to any violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”, the PMO said.</p>
<p>Commending the ISI’s “professionalism and strategic acumen”, the prime minister lauded its “critical role in safeguarding national interests and enabling informed national security decision-making under complex and dynamic conditions”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan Army is one of the most professional and disciplined force in the world,” the premier was quoted as saying. He reaffirmed that the entire nation was standing with “our brave armed forces”.</p>
<p>“The leadership reaffirmed Pakistan’s unambiguous resolve to defend the homeland against all threats — conventional or otherwise,” the statement read.</p>
<p>The leaders reiterated that with the nation’s full support, the armed forces, supported by all other elements of national power and state institutions, remained “fully prepared to uphold Pakistan’s security, prestige, and honour under all circumstances”.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also visited the newly established National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre (NIFTAC) and formally inaugurated its state-of-the-art headquarters, “which will serve as the central node for coordinating Pakistan’s national counterterrorism strategy”, the PMO said.</p>
<p>“NIFTAC, a federal institution, integrates over 50 relevant federal and provincial departments and agencies into a unified intelligence and threat management architecture supported by a centralised national database.”</p>
<p>The statement added that at the subnational level, NIFTAC is linked to six Provincial Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centres (PIFTACs), including those in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, ensuring seamless coordination from the federation to the provinces.</p>
<p>Commending the efforts of all stakeholders involved in operationalising this vital capability, the prime minister described NIFTAC as a quintessential national platform for collaborative threat assessment and response. He underscored that “dismantling the nexus between terrorism, illicit networks, and external sponsorship requires robust and efficient institutional mechanisms.”</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said NIFTAC would play a pivotal role in uprooting terrorism and its support structures from the country.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Modi said that water from India that once flowed across borders would be stopped.</p>
<p>Modi did not mention Pakistan specifically, but his speech comes after New Delhi suspended its part of the 65-year-old Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which governs water critical for consumption and agriculture.</p>
<p>“India’s water used to go outside, now it will flow for India”, Modi said in a speech in New Delhi.</p>
<p>“India’s water will be stopped for India’s interests, and it will be utilised for India.”</p>
<p>Pakistan has warned that tampering with its rivers would be considered “an act of war”.</p>
<p>However, experts also pointed out that India’s existing dams do not have the capacity to block or divert water and can only regulate the timing of when they release flows.</p>
<p>Islamabad accused India of altering the flow of the Chenab River, one of three rivers placed under Pakistan’s control according to the IWT.</p>
<p>“We have witnessed changes in the river (Chenab) which are not natural at all,” Punjab Irrigation Minister Kazim Pirzada told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>“The majority impact will be felt in areas which have fewer alternate water routes,” Pirzada warned.</p>
<p>“One day the river had normal inflow and the next day it was greatly reduced,” Pirzada added.</p>
<p>In Azad Jammu and Kashmir, large quantities of water from India were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906856">reportedly released</a> on April 26, according to the Jinnah Institute.</p>
<p>“This is being done so that we don’t get to utilise the water,” Pirzada added.</p>

<p>Separately, the Foreign Office said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar held a telephonic conversation with Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan Amir Khan Muttaqi who “appreciated Pakistan’s proactive steps to ease trade and facilitate travel”, amid rising tensions with India.</p>
<p>It added that Muttaqi extended an invitation to Dar to visit Afghanistan again. “He conveyed prayers and best wishes for the government and people of Pakistan,” the FO said.</p>
<p>Dar also briefed his Afghan counterpart on recent provocation and “illegal and unilateral measures” by India against Pakistan, reiterating Pakistan’s commitment to peace and safeguarding its sovereignty.</p>
<p>Both leaders expressed satisfaction with the pace of progress made by the two sides in bilateral relations since the deputy PM’s visit to Afghanistan on April 19, with a focus on trade, connectivity, economic cooperation, people-to-people contacts and reactivating political consultative mechanisms.</p>
<p>The two sides also agreed on the importance of maintaining high-level contacts for fostering long-term cooperation to promote peace and security in the region and beyond, the statement concluded.</p>

            <p><p>Seven soldiers were martyred in a blast from an improvised explosive device planted by “Indian proxy” terrorists in Balochistan’s Kacchi district, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7280" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said: “On May 6, 2025, terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, so-called ‘Baloch Liberation Army’, targeted security forces’ vehicle with an improvised explosive device in general area Mach.”</p>
<p>It said the following seven soldiers were subsequently martyred in the attack: Subedar Umar Farooq, 42, resident of Karachi; Naik Asif Khan, 28, resident of Karak district; Naik Mashkoor Ali, 28, resident of Orakzai district; Sepoy Tariq Nawaz, 26, resident of Lakki Marwat district; Sepoy Wajid Ahmed Faiz, 28, resident of Bagh district; Sepoy Muhammad Asim, 22, resident of Karak district and Sepoy Muhammad Kashif Khan, 28, resident of Kohat district.</p>
<p>“Nefarious designs of India and its proxies operating on Pakistani soil will be defeated by the valiant security forces, LEAs (law enforcement agencies) and the brave nation of Pakistan,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p>It added that sanitisation of the area was being carried out to eliminate any terrorists present in the area and the perpetrators of the “heinous and cowardly act” would be brought to justice.</p>
<p>“Security forces of Pakistan, in step with the nation, remain determined to thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan, and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve.”</p>
<p>Two Pakistan Coast Guards personnel were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908760">injured</a> on Monday when a remote-controlled bomb targeted their patrol vehicle in the Jiwani area, while a Levies official escaped unharmed when his private vehicle was destroyed by a separate roadside bomb in Pishin district.</p>
<p>Last week, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">accused</a> India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.</p>
<p>“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said, using the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Militant violence and security operations intensified in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901722/militant-attacks-in-march-surged-to-highest-level-since-2014">report</a> by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">ranked second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p></p>

            <p><p>The outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) continues to be a thorn in relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan despite a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905251/fm-dar-says-afghan-side-told-wont-allow-each-others-soil-to-be-used-for-terror">recent positive trip</a> of Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar to Kabul, according to remarks by veteran diplomat Mohammad Sadiq on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The increased activity of armed groups within Pakistan since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 remains a common source of tensions between the two neighbours. Pakistan maintains that these armed groups <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904015/pm-shehbaz-regrets-persistent-use-of-afghan-soil-by-terrorists">operate</a> from within Afghan soil, a claim that Afghan officials have denied, maintaining that no one can use Afghan soil against any country.</p>
<p>Last month, FM Dar had said Pakistan and Afghanistan had assured each other that they would not allow nefarious elements to use their soil to conduct attacks or illicit activities against the other, adding that both countries would be responsible for taking appropriate action in such a case.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Dar’s interactions with the Afghan Taliban leadership were quite cordial, with promises from both sides to improve ties and address the irritants standing in the way of better relations.</p>
<p>However, Ambassador Sadiq, Pakistan’s special representative for Afghanistan, said while speaking at a seminar titled “Pak-Afghan Relations under the Shadow of Terrorism”, organised by the Institute of Regional Studies, that the “Afghan Taliban government could not resolve Pakistan’s concerns regarding outlawed TTP till now.”</p>
<p>He added: “It seems that there is a difference of opinion in Afghanistan on this issue.”</p>
<p>Sadiq said the TTP was a challenge. “It is not just a challenge for Pakistan. TTP is damaging Pak-Afghan relations. Many people in Afghanistan are aware of this fact,” he added.</p>
<p>“There was a time when we could have solved the TTP problem after Zarb-i-Azb,” Sadiq said, referring to the major operation conducted against the TTP, other Pakistani and foreign militant groups in North Waziristan in June 2014.</p>
<p>“At that time, some went across the border [into Afghanistan], some turned into sleeper cells here in Pakistan.”</p>
<p>He said the issue of the TTP could have been discussed in the Doha peace talks between the United States and the Afghan Taliban, but it was not addressed at the time.</p>
<p>“The Afghan Taliban are in control of every place in Afghan cities, villages and towns, but it seems they are not tired of the war yet.</p>
<p>“There are different opinions among different classes and regions in Afghanistan. The TTP participated in the Afghan Taliban’s war against the United States. This included supplying suicide bombers with all kinds of assistance. The Afghan interim government says that it is afraid that if it takes action against the TTP, they will join IS (Islamic State),” Sadiq said.</p>
<p>The ambassador said there were examples of suicide bombers being trained in camps and then sold to another group.</p>
<p>“Members of the Afghan Taliban also join the TTP, IS and other groups,” he said.</p>
<p>He recalled that the government of Ashraf Ghani in 2019 had declared TTP as a threat to Afghanistan in the country’s first National Security Police and had arrested a number of TTP commanders.</p>
<p>“Afghanistan had at that time reached the conclusion that the TTP is a threat to its security.”</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/AmbassadorSadiq/status/1919747305764270272" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, he said he had emphasised the importance of strengthening Pakistan-Afghanistan relations to address security concerns and promote regional stability and economic development.</p>
<p>Last month, security forces had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906939/54-terrorists-killed-as-infiltration-attempt-thwarted-in-kp-ispr">killed 54 terrorists</a> attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district.</p>
<p>According to the Inter-Services Public Relations, this was the highest-ever number of terrorists killed by security forces in a single engagement throughout the campaign against terrorism.</p>
<p>Security forces had later <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907126">killed 17 more</a> terrorists in North Waziristan district near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.</p></p>
