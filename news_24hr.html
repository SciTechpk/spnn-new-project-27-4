            <p><p>Pakistani leadership, including President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the rights of minorities while hailing their services to the country on Monday, in celebration of National Minorities Day.</p>
<p>National Minorities Day is celebrated on August 11 every year. It commemorates the historic speech by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, made on Aug 11, 1947, where he emphasised equal rights for all citizens regardless of religion. The day aims to highlight the religious and socio-economic rights of minorities in Pakistan.</p>
<p>In separate addresses today, President Zardari and PM Shehbaz both reaffirmed their commitment to safeguarding and advancing the rights of minorities while acknowledging their contributions to the country.</p>
<p>The president reaffirmed his resolve to continue efforts to promote interfaith harmony, brotherhood and unity to build an inclusive and prosperous Pakistan.</p>
<p>“This day reflects Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s vision of a Pakistan where every citizen lives in equality, harmony, and mutual respect,” he said, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://ppp.org.pk/pr/34450/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>

<p>The president said that the Constitution guaranteed equal rights to all citizens “irrespective of religion, caste, creed, or colour”, and that it safeguarded the political, economic, religious, social and cultural rights of minorities.</p>
<p>“Pakistan stands resolutely against all forms of discrimination, extremism, and religious intolerance,” he stressed. “We remain determined to build a society free from prejudice — one that embraces diversity as a strength and is anchored in mutual respect, interfaith harmony, and shared progress.”</p>
<p>He added that the day was also an occasion to acknowledge the contributions of the minority communities to nation-building, saying that they had served the country with dedication in the armed forces, judiciary, civil services, education and healthcare.</p>
<p>Their patriotism and service remained a “source of pride for the entire nation”, he added.</p>
<p>The president noted measures taken by the country for the welfare and empowerment of minorities, including the establishment of the National Commission for Minorities, allocation of a Minorities Welfare Fund, restoration and preservation of places of worship and provision of scholarships and financial assistance to minority students.</p>
<p>“We continue to promote interfaith dialogue and ensure meaningful participation of minorities in every sphere of national life,” he added.</p>
<p>In a separate address, PM Shehbaz also reaffirmed the government’s commitment to the full inclusion of minorities in government institutions, Parliament and the national mainstream while appreciating their role in the country’s development and progress.</p>
<p>“The welfare and well-being of all minorities in Pakistan, be they Sikhs, Christians, Hindus (or) Parsis, is one of the priority duties of the government of Pakistan,” he said.</p>
<p>He emphasised the services rendered by minorities “in every walk of life”, including those who had sacrificed their lives defending Pakistan.</p>
<p>“We pay tribute to them from the bottom of our hearts,” he said. “Pakistan is proud of its minorities’ patriotism, professional hard work and attachment to national heritage and culture.”</p>
<p>The PM also stressed that protecting minority rights, aside from a constitutional obligation, was also a religious duty, saying, “Islam specifically advocates the protection of civil, religious and social rights of minorities. Ulema and religious leaders play a key role in protecting religious freedom.”</p>
<p>He called on all Pakistanis to practise unity and solidarity, mutual respect and tolerance.</p>
<p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also acknowledged National Minorities Day, appreciating the role of minorities in the development of the country.</p>
<p>“The true strength and beauty of Pakistan lies in its diversity,” he said in a post on social media, calling the safeguarding and respecting of minority rights an “unbreakable pillar of the country’s democratic vision”.</p>
<p>“Our struggle is for a Pakistan where no citizen feels isolated or unsafe due to their religion, but where bonds of brotherhood rise above prejudice.”</p>

<p>Statements were also made by Federal Minister for Human Rights Azam Nazeer Tarar and Chief Minister for Sindh Murad Ali Shah.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Tarar called the occasion a “solemn reminder of our shared responsibility to ensure that every citizen of Pakistan enjoys equality, justice, and respect, irrespective of faith”.</p>
<p>He echoed the messages of the PM and president, emphasising the vision of the country’s founding father for a state “where religion would never hinder the rights, dignity, or equal standing of its people”, as well as Islamic teachings to “uphold justice without exception”.</p>
<p>“Let us pledge to build a Pakistan where diversity is celebrated, unity is our strength, and justice remains our guiding principle”, the minister said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CM Murad condemned intolerance against minorities and reaffirmed the province’s commitment to peaceful co-existence.</p>
<p>“Our beloved Sindh has always been tolerant and progressive in terms of religious freedom,” he said while addressing a gathering at a Hindu temple in Karachi. During his speech, he compared the province to “intolerant” Western democracies.</p>
<p>“In our province, across the board, we condemn actions against minorities because we are the land of Sufis,” he said, adding, “The Sufis of Sindh have always given the same lesson, which is that we should all co-exist in peace and harmony.</p>
<p>“I am happy to see today that our Hindu, Sikh and Parsi brothers are standing and celebrating the day together.”</p>
<p>He reaffirmed that the government of Sindh would “always stand with minorities” and that action would always be taken against any “unfortunate incident” against minorities in Sindh.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the Sindh Workers Welfare Board decided to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929987/sindh-govt-to-extend-e-bike-scheme-to-minority-workers">extend</a> its upcoming electric bikes scheme beyond women to industrial workers from minority communities.</p>
<p>However, despite the leadership’s statements, religious freedom remains a challenge in Pakistan, with recurring incidents of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1837480">mob attacks</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918828">forced conversions</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1841740">blasphemy cases</a>, as noted by the European Union’s Sebastien Lorion.</p>
<p>Last month, State Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Kesoo Mal Kheal Das <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904861">acknowledged</a> that religious minorities in the country face administrative and governance issues.</p>
<p>According to Kheal Das, the law for the establishment of the National Commission for Minority Rights has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904861">approved</a> by both houses of the parliament and awaits presidential assent.</p></p>

            <p><p>At least seven volunteers died and six were injured early on Monday when a landslide hit individuals working at a water channel in Gilgit-Baltistan’s (GB) Danyor city, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660/situationer-unprecedented-melting-in-g-b">melting glaciers</a> have become more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921009/at-least-8-dead-13-injured-in-rain-related-incidents-across-gb-punjab-and-sindh-officials#:~:text=two%20sisters%20died%20after%20being%20swept%20away">late June</a>.</p>
<p>The situation worsened when deadly floods <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20so%20far%2C%2010%20fatalities%20and%20four%20injuries%20have%20been%20reported">10 deaths</a> have been confirmed across the region, with a dozen tourists <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928659/funeral-held-in-absentia-for-missing-tourists-in-gbs-babusar-after-14-days-of-search-efforts">missing</a>.</p>
<p>Thirteen volunteers, mainly young people, were attempting to restore the water supply in the main water channel from Danyor nullah to Danyor town, which had been damaged due to the recent floods, when the landslide hit at 2am today.</p>
<p>“Thirteen volunteers restoring the water supply were buried under the rubble,” Gilgit’s Rescue 1122 said in a statement.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Stating the casualties, it said the injured were taken to a hospital. District Emergency Officer (operations) Abdul Basit was present at the site to supervise the restoration, Rescue 1122 added.</p>
<p>Muhammad Akbar, one of the residents who took part in the rescue operations, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the bodies and injured had been moved to “various hospitals in Gilgit and Danyor”.</p>
<p>On July 22, a flash flood in Danyor nullah <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930#:~:text=Rescue%201122%20said%20a%20flash%20flood%20in%20Danyor%20nallah%20inundated%20residential%20communities">inundated</a> residential communities and damaged crops and irrigation channels. The deluge also damaged link roads and suspension bridges, cutting road links to affected areas.</p>
<p>Hussain Akbar Shah, another local, said thousands of Danyor residents were facing a shortage of drinking water and irrigation water as the valley depended on water from the nullah.</p>
<p>A statement by the GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq stated that the total number of volunteers was 15, out of whom seven were confirmed dead.</p>
<p>An emergency has been declared at hospitals in Gilgit, the spokesperson added. “Our hearts are saddened by this unfortunate accident. Gilgit is in a state of mourning,” Faraq said.</p>

<p>Funeral prayers were later held for the volunteers who died in the incident. Residents also protested at Danyor Chowk against the incident, holding the government responsible for it.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters, area elders led by former GB minister Muhammad Iqbal said the government had failed to res­tore the disrupted water supply despite repeated assurances.</p>
<p>The elders noted that although residents had managed to temporarily restore the pipeline, subsequent flooding destroyed it again, while the government had not started work on it. The protesters demanded that the government take action, or they would launch protests.</p>
<p>GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan expressed his condolences on the incident and announced compensation for the bereaved families.</p>
<p>“The families of those who died in the Danyor nullah [incident] will receive compensation as per the government policy,” CM Gulbar said, directing that the wounded be provided with the best medical treatment.</p></p>

            <p><p>Prominent <em>Al Jazeera</em> journalist <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928082/israeli-soldiers-use-silencers-while-shooting-gaza-aid-seekers-report">Anas Al Sharif</a>, who had previously been threatened by Israel, was among four colleagues killed in an Israeli airstrike on Sunday, in an attack widely condemned by media and rights groups.</p>
<p>Israel has been facing growing international criticism over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by its offensive since October 2023, with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1876811">Amnesty International</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879714">Human Rights Watch</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897646">experts</a> already declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.</p>
<p>Al Sharif, aged 28, was among a group of four <em>Al Jazeera</em> journalists and an assistant who were killed in a “directed assault” on a tent opposite Shifa Hospital in eastern Gaza City, Gaza officials and <em>Al Jazeera</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://network.aljazeera.net/en/press-releases/al-jazeera-condemns-assassination-its-journalists-israeli-occupation-forces" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>. An official at the hospital said two other people were also killed in the strike.</p>
<p>Calling Al Sharif “one of Gaza’s bravest journalists”, <em>Al Jazeera</em> said the attack was a “desperate attempt to silence voices in anticipation of the occupation of Gaza”.</p>
<p>The other journalists killed were Mohammed Qreiqeh, and photographers Ibrahim Al Thaher and Mohammed Noufal.</p>

<p>Israel’s military admitted it targeted and killed Al Sharif, alleging he had headed a Hamas cell and “was responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians” and troops.</p>
<p><em>Al Jazeera</em> rejected the claim and said that before his death, Al Sharif had also dismissed earlier claims by Israel that he was connected to Hamas.</p>
<p>The Qatar-based outlet held the “Israeli occupation forces and government responsible for deliberately targeting and assassinating its journalists”.</p>
<p>“This follows repeated incitement and calls by multiple Israeli officials and spokespersons to target the fearless journalist Anas Al Sharif and his colleagues,” it noted.</p>
<p>“Anas Al Sharif and his colleagues were among the last remaining voices in Gaza conveying the tragic reality to the world,” <em>Al Jazeera</em> said.</p>

<p>A press freedom group and a United Nations expert previously warned that Al Sharif’s life was in danger due to his reporting from Gaza. UN Special Rapporteur <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Irene Khan</a> said last month that Israel’s claims against him were unsubstantiated.</p>

<p>Al Sharif was previously part of a <em>Reuters</em> team, which in 2024 won a Pulitzer Prize in the category of Breaking News Photography for coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict.</p>
<p>Amnesty Australia also <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/amp/1193058">recognised him</a> with a Human Rights Defender Award in December 2024.</p>
<p>Al Sharif, whose X <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/AnasAlSharif0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">account</a> showed more than 500,000 followers, posted on the platform minutes before his death that Israel had been intensely bombarding Gaza City for more than two hours.</p>
<p>In a pre-written message released on his X account after his killing, Al Sharif lambasted those who remained silent and called on the world to speak for Palestine.</p>
<p>“… I never hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or misrepresentation, hoping that God would witness those who stayed silent, those who accepted our killing,” he said.</p>
<p>“I urge you not to let chains silence you, nor borders restrain you. Be bridges toward the liberation of the land and its people, until the sun of dignity and freedom rises over our stolen homeland,” Al Sharif added.</p>

<p>Last October, Israel’s military had named Al Sharif as one of six Gaza journalists it alleged were members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, citing documents it said showed lists of people who completed training courses and salaries.</p>
<p>“<em>Al Jazeera</em> categorically rejects the Israeli occupation forces’ portrayal of our journalists as terrorists and denounces their use of fabricated evidence,” the network said in a statement at the time.</p>
<p>The Gaza government media office said 237 journalists have been killed since Israel’s onslaught started on Oct 7, 2023, of which 186 have been confirmed by CPJ as well.</p>
<p><em>Dawn</em>, corroborating details from various credible sources, has compiled a list of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/gaza-journalists-killed/">over 250</a> slain journalists.</p>

<p>Journalists’ groups and <em>Al Jazeera</em> denounced the killings.</p>
<p>The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which in July urged the international community to protect Al Sharif, said in a statement that Israel had failed to provide any evidence to back up its allegations against him.</p>
<p>“Israel’s pattern of labelling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,” said Sara Qudah, CPJ’s director for the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>“Journalists are civilians and must never be targeted. Those responsible for these killings must be held accountable,” Qudah added.</p>

<p>“Israel’s ongoing campaign of targeted assassinations of Palestinian journalists is a war crime, plain and simple,” said National Executive Director Nihad Awad of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in a statement.</p>
<p>“The murder of these <em>Al Jazeera</em> journalists is not an accident or collateral damage — it is part of a consistent, documented policy of silencing media voices and hiding the truth of the genocide being carried out by Israel in Gaza,” Awad said.</p>
<p>The Freedom of the Press Foundation also condemned the killings, calling for international action to halt further attacks on the media, according to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://aje.io/iacsb2?update=3881801" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></em>.</p>
<p>“Everyone who has been angered by recent horrific images of starvation and suffering in Gaza needs to recognise that they wouldn’t see those images, and wouldn’t know about the atrocities their governments bankroll, without journalists risking their lives,” Seth Stern, director of advocacy at the New York-based nonprofit, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“That is exactly why Israel is targeting and killing them in violation of international law. Now, perhaps more than any other time since the killing began, the world understands how vital these journalists’ work is.</p>
<p>“The calls for the assassinations to end must be louder than ever, and we can’t let our leaders get away with mere expressions of concern or performative condemnations while the money and weapons Israel uses to exterminate journalists and other civilians keep flowing.”</p>
<p>US Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal called on the United States to stop providing weapons for this genocide“ in Gaza.</p>
<p>“The Israeli military has killed more than 200 journalists and media workers,” Jayapal highlighted on X.</p>

<p>Hamas said the killing may signal the start of an Israeli offensive.</p>
<p>“The assassination of journalists and the intimidation of those who remain paves the way for a major crime that the occupation is planning to commit in Gaza City,” Hamas said in a statement.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would launch a new offensive to dismantle Hamas strongholds in Gaza, where a hunger crisis is escalating after 22 months of conflict.</p></p>
