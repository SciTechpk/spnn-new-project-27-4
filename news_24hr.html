            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) on Monday and chaired a high-level meeting to review the flood damages from the recent monsoon rains and distribute relief funds to the affected people.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge became more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921009/at-least-8-dead-13-injured-in-rain-related-incidents-across-gb-punjab-and-sindh-officials#:~:text=two%20sisters%20died%20after%20being%20swept%20away">late June</a>. Situation worsened when deadly floods <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20so%20far%2C%2010%20fatalities%20and%20four%20injuries%20have%20been%20reported.%20Seven%20deaths%20were%20reported%20from%20Babusar%2C%20two%20from%20Thore%20Valley%20(Dia%C2%ADmer)%20and%20another%20from%20Astore%20district.">10 people</a>, mostly tourists, have lost their lives, with between 10 and 15 tourists still missing.</p>
<p>Addressing a review meeting on the damages caused by the recent monsoon rains, PM Shehbaz termed the destruction caused by cloodbursts in Diamer and other areas as “unfortunate”. He prayed for those who lost their lives and for the speedy recovery of the injured.</p>
<p>He hailed the work of various federal authorities — including the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the ministries of communication, water, GB, climate change, and international coordination — in assisting with the relief work.</p>
<p>“Pakistan’s contribution to global emissions is negligible, but despite this, it is among the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891272">top 10 countries</a> that are facing destruction and losses due to global warming,” the premier noted.</p>
<p>Recalling the devastating <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1724134">2022 floods</a>, he said, “After that, each year such destruction comes in less or greater intensity.”</p>
<p>In 2022, the country witnessed the most devastating floods in its history, which killed 1,700 people, affected 33 million people, washed away swathes of agricultural lands, and incurred <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1721343">losses</a> worth $30 billion, according to governmental estimates.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz stressed that he had issued “clear” directives to Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik and his team to work on the matter. He highlighted that Malik has attended various conferences on climate change and secured funds for resilient infrastructure in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Highlighting that the ministry had a key role in “mitigating the changes arising from climate change” across the country, the premier noted that the NDMA was originally established for relief, rescue and rehabilitation work once a disaster strikes.</p>
<p>He recalled that the communication secretary had spent six days in GB as he oversaw the restoration of roads damaged by the rains.</p>
<p>The prime minister vowed to visit GB once the monsoon rains end to lay the foundation stone of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1822414">Daanish School</a> he had promised to the region. “We will also discuss other development projects with you and decide on them,” he assured the GB government.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at Gilgit Airport earlier today for the one-day visit, GB Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, Chief Minister Gulbar Khan and other officials welcomed the premier.</p>

<p>The visit comes after PM Shehbaz chaired a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928144">high-level meeting</a> last week to review the monsoon damage, where he reaffirmed the federal government’s full support for relief and recovery efforts in GB and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).</p>
<p>Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik, Kashmir Affairs and GB Minister Amir Muqam, Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Inter-Provincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, and PM’s coordinator on GB Shabbir Ahmed Usmani are accompanying the premier.</p>
<p>“The prime minister will meet with the victims of rains and floods in Gilgit and distribute relief funds,” <em>PTV</em> said. He will also hold meetings with Governor Shah and CM Gulbar.</p>

<p>In a statement on the occasion, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said, “The hopes of flood affectees are attached to the prime minister.</p>
<p>“GB has faced losses worth more than Rs20 billion due to the worst destruction caused by the floods,” Faraq highlighted.</p>
<p>As floods and landslides hit GB in late July, CM Gulbar had appe­aled to the federal government for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838">Rs7bn in emergency funds</a> to deal with climate-induced disasters.</p>

<p>“Cooperation from the federal government plays the role of oxygen for GB,” the official said, stressing that “homeless people with wrecked houses and eroding settlements were looking forward to remedies for their wounds”.</p>
<p>Terming PM Shehbaz’s visit a “good omen”, Faraq welcomed the premier to the region.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922323/maximum-temperature-record-shattered-in-gbs-chilas-and-bunji-pmd">heat­­waves</a>, erratic weat­her patterns and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928021">glacial melting</a> have triggered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a> and intense floods across the region.</p>
<p>Five members of a family trapped due to a flood four days ago in GB’s Ghizer District were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928659/5-family-members-stranded-due-to-floods-in-gb-rescued-after-4-days">rescued today</a>, the region’s Rescue 1122 said.</p>

<p>On Friday, a <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">glacier burst</a> in GB’s Bagrot Valley led to the death of a 12-year-old boy, while his father was injured. The same day, Rescue 1122 officials said one person was rescued, while three other family members <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928144#:~:text=Tragedies%20mount%20in%20GB">went missing</a> after they had attempted to rescue a man who had jumped into the Ghizer River.</p>

            <p><p>Pakistan on Monday unequivocally condemned the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem by Israeli ministers, calling Tel Aviv out for its “shameless actions which are inflaming tensions in Palestine and the wider region”.</p>
<p>Early on Sunday, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, shielded by Israeli police, led a large group of illegal settlers in a provocative march and mass incursion into the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, coinciding with the Jewish commemoration of Tisha B’Av, <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/far-right-israeli-minister-leads-mass-illegal-settler-incursion-into-al-aqsa-mosque/3649390" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Anadolu Agency</em> reported</a>.</p>
<p>According to the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, at least 1,251 illegal Israeli settlers stormed the mosque compound in the morning hours, performing Talmudic rituals, singing, and dancing under heavy police protection.</p>
<p>Al-Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest site in Islam after Makkah and Madina. Under a delicate decades-old “status quo” arrangement with Muslim authorities, the Al-Aqsa compound is administered by a Jordanian religious foundation, and Jews can visit but may not pray there.</p>
<p>“This sacrilege against one of Islam’s holiest sites is not only an affront to the faith of over a billion Muslims but also a direct assault on international law and the collective conscience of humanity,” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif posted on X.</p>

<p>He said that such systematic provocations by the occupying power, coupled with reckless calls for annexation, imperilled the prospects for peace.</p>
<p>The prime minister said that Israel’s “shameless actions” were deliberately inflaming tensions in Palestine and the wider region, pushing the Middle East closer to further instability and conflict.</p>
<p>“Pakistan reiterates its urgent call for an immediate ceasefire, an end to all acts of aggression, and the revival of a credible peace process leading to an independent and viable State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in accordance with international law and relevant UN resolutions,” PM Shehbaz added.</p>
<p>The Foreign Office also issued a separate statement to condemn the Israeli move.</p>
<p>“The presence and statements of senior Israeli officials, and the repugnant declaration that ‘the Temple Mount is ours,’ are a dangerous and deliberate attempt to provoke religious sentiments across the world, escalate tensions, and alter the status of Al‑Aqsa Mosque,” the statement said.</p>
<p>It said that Israel’s expansionist attempts were a deliberate effort to destabilise the region and sabotage any meaningful path to peace.</p>
<p>“These provocations risk igniting a catastrophic spiral of violence across the region.”</p>
<p>The world, it continued, must not remain silent in the face of such systemic, illegal, inhumane, and unlawful aggression. Such actions constitute a blatant violation of international human rights and humanitarian laws, the United Nations Charter, as well as various UN and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Resolutions.</p>
<p>“We urge the international community, particularly the United Nations, to take immediate and concrete steps to hold Israel accountable for its illegal actions and to protect the religious sanctity of Al‑Aqsa Mosque and the rights of the Palestinian people, in particular the right to self-determination.</p>
<p>“Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering support for the creation of a sovereign, independent, viable, and contiguous Palestinian State based on pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.”</p>

            <p><p>Abbottabad police on Monday arrested three suspects who allegedly gang-raped a woman last week in the Bakot area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Abbottabad district, springing into action after the incident sparked social media outrage.</p>
<p>Abbottabad police spokesperson Azam Mir Afzal told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the suspects had allegedly gang-raped a woman from Rawalpindi on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“District Police Officer (DPO) Umar Tufail took action and ordered the immediate arrest of the suspects after the incident was highlighted on social media, including Facebook and TikTok,” Spokesperson Afzal said.</p>
<p>He added that the Bakot station house officer (SHO), Arshad Khan, was sent to the village, where he had also found the local community angered over the incident.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>On the SHO’s complaint, a first information report (FIR) was lodged at the Bakot police station yesterday under sections 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 375A (Rape) and 376 (Punishment for rape) of the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/1860/actXLVof1860.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pakistan Penal Code</a>.</p>
<p>According to the FIR, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, police arrested the suspect who owned the house where the woman was allegedly raped by him and his friends.</p>
<p>The FIR added that one of the suspects brought the woman to his friend’s house in his car from Rawalpindi, where he and his friends raped her, one after the other. In his statement, the homeowner confessed to committing the crime while also identifying his two accomplices.</p>
<p>The police stated in the FIR that the accomplices were also arrested, while a search for the victim continued and the investigation was underway.</p>
<p>Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1761373">death penalty</a> or <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893037">imprisonment</a> of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899694/two-arrested-for-kidnap-gang-rape-of-minor-girl-in-bahawalnagar">prevail</a> in the country.</p>
<p>In July, a newlywed 19-year-old girl in Karachi’s Lyari was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922609/newlywed-19-year-old-girl-in-coma-after-alleged-brutal-sexual-violence-by-husband">admitted</a> to Civil Hospital Karachi in critical condition after an alleged marital rape and “brutal sexual violence” at the hands of her husband, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926056">succumbing</a> to her injuries within the month. The husband was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922676/man-arrested-booked-for-wifes-attempted-murder-marital-rape">arrested</a> by the police.</p>
<p>Earlier that month, Karachi police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922097/karachi-police-arrest-primary-suspect-in-ittehad-town-gang-rape-case">arrested</a> the primary suspect allegedly involved in the gang-rape of a girl in Ittehad Town.</p></p>
