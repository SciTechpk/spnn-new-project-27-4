                <h2>PM Shehbaz expresses satisfaction on ‘cordial and productive’ COAS-Trump meeting in call with Rubio</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday expressed satisfaction on the “cordial and productive discussion” between US President Donald Trump and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir during a call with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p>
<p>The COAS, who visited Washington earlier this week, was invited to a luncheon at the White House and discussed joint counterterrorism efforts and expanding bilateral trade during a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093/trump-coas-munir-talk-counterterrorism-and-trade-in-cordial-meeting-ispr">“cordial” meeting</a> with Trump, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir met with Trump at the White House yesterday, becoming the first serving chief of army staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. The occasion also marked the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">first time</a> a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law.</p>
<p>According to state broadcaster <em><a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvworld/newsdetail/7701" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PTV News</a></em>, the PM’s conversation with Washington’s top diplomat was described as “warm and cordial”, with the discussion revolving around key bilateral and regional issues.</p>
<p>“The prime minister expressed satisfaction over the recent meeting between President Trump and … Field Marshal Asim Munir, in Washington, terming it productive and cordial,” the report read.</p>
<p>“The prime minister conveyed his best wishes for US President Donald Trump, lauding his bold leadership and commending Secretary Rubio’s diplomatic efforts that facilitated a ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India,” <em>PTV News</em> reported. “He emphasised that this understanding averted a potential catastrophe between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The PM was also quoted as saying that Trump’s “positive remarks” about Pakistan were encouraging for lasting peace in the region and reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to resolve disputes with India — namely the Kashmir issue, the Indus Waters Treaty and counter-terrorism — through dialogue.</p>
<p>Discussing security, PM Shehbaz reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to eliminate terrorism and counter groups such as the Balochistan Liberation Army and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.</p>
<p>“Secretary Rubio acknowledged Pakistan’s efforts in combating terrorism and assured full US cooperation in addressing these threats,” <em>PTV News</em> reported.</p>
<p>Additionally, PM Shehbaz underscored the need for Pakistan and the US to enhance collaboration in sectors including trade, investment, energy, mining, rare earth minerals and information technology.</p>
<p>“Both sides agreed that their discussions should now lead to concrete action across multiple areas of mutual interest. To further strengthen ties, the prime minister emphasised the importance of frequent high-level exchanges,” <em>PTV News</em> reported, adding that the PM extended an invitation to Trump and Rubio to visit Pakistan.</p>
<p>“Secretary Rubio expressed appreciation for the call and reaffirmed the US’s commitment to enhancing cooperation with Pakistan,” <em>PTV News</em> said. “He praised Pakistan’s adherence to the ceasefire with India and its continued efforts for peace in the region, especially given its close ties with Iran.</p>
<p>“Rubio affirmed Washington’s intent to work closely with Islamabad to promote regional and global peace and stability.”</p>
<p>Pakistan has been steadily improving ties with the US.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said that Pakistan and the US will continue to strengthen their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917668/pakistan-us-agree-to-advance-talks-on-reciprocal-tariffs-aurangzeb">economic partnership</a> as both sides agreed to advance negotiations on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">reciprocal tariffs</a> through constructive engagement.</p>
<p>While speaking at an event in Islamabad, Aurangzeb said he had a constructive and positive conversation with the US Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick. He said that both countries are moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>“The government will stay the course of reforms in taxation, energy and other sectors,” he said. “We have also carried out tariff reforms to move towards [a] competitive economy.”</p>
<p>In March, it was announced that Pakistan and the US would hold a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900767">counter-terrorism dialogue</a> in June.</p>
<p>This was agreed during a meeting between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and acting US Ambassador Natalie Baker. During the meeting, Pakistan-US relations, matters of mutual interest and bilateral cooperation were discussed in detail.</p>

<p>In his remarks on the recent conflict with India, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who was addressing a crowd in Karachi upon his return from a foreign diplomatic tour, said, “For the first time in history, the leader of Pakistan’s army, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, has a meeting with Trump at the White House.”</p>
<p>Bilawal questioned India’s claims, saying, “If Pakistan is ‘terroristan’ [and] involved in terrorism, then what is our military leader doing in Washington?”</p>
<p>He said, “What does the field marshal’s meeting at the White House signify then?” adding, “Is the general of a failed nation called there? No.”</p>
<p>“This highlights that India lost the war and Pakistan won the war. The talks were a congratulatory meeting,” he added. “I consider this a success for Pakistan by the US.”</p>

                <h2>Afghanistan turns to Russia for some food supplies amid Iran-Israel war</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Afghanistan is in discussions with Russia to import certain foodstuffs as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917867/israel-iran-launch-new-missile-strikes-at-each-other-as-war-enters-6th-day">conflict</a> between Israel and Iran, one of its largest trading partners, risked cutting off supplies, its agriculture minister told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>As relations between Russia and the Taliban government have been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906189/russia-allows-taliban-to-have-ambassador-in-moscow">improving</a>, an Afghan delegation is visiting Russia’s main economic conference in St Petersburg this week, meeting Russian agriculture officials.</p>
<p>“Afghanistan is definitely aiming for self-sufficiency in its agricultural products. However, we still rely on some food items that come from Iran, and if problems arise there, it will undoubtedly have its effects,” Ataullah Omari said on the sidelines of the conference.</p>
<p>Iran supplies Afghanistan with some dairy products, among other commodities, and there is widespread concern that the week-old war between Israel and Iran could disrupt trade flows.</p>
<p>Russia — the world’s largest wheat exporter — and Kazakhstan are the main suppliers of wheat and flour to Afghanistan. Russia is also supplying sugar and vegetable oil.</p>
<p>Omari said that the country is now seeking wheat rather than flour from Russia.</p>
<p>Afghanistan, the top buyer of Russian flour in 2024, increased its own wheat production by 10 per cent last year to 4.83 million metric tonnes. The country’s total wheat consumption is estimated at 6.8m metric tonnes a year.</p>
<p>“For the past four years, since the withdrawal of the Americans, we have been making efforts to provide our essential food supplies ourselves. The remaining amount, including flour and wheat, is supplied annually by Russia,” Omari said.</p>
<p>“We have requested that Russia send us wheat instead of flour. Additionally, the import of other products that come from Russia to our country annually is progressing well,” he added.</p>
<p>In April, Russia <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904942">lifted</a> its ban on the Taliban, which it had designated as a terrorist organisation for more than two decades, paving the way for Moscow to normalise ties with Afghanistan’s leadership.</p>
<p>Since 2022, Afghanistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1707499">imported</a> gas, oil, and wheat from Russia, marking the first major economic deal after the Taliban returned to power, facing international isolation following 20 years of war against US-led forces.</p>
<p>Omari expressed concern about <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915308">Afghan refugees</a> living in Iran who could become victims of Israel’s attacks. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) estimates that nearly 4.5m Afghan nationals reside in Iran.</p>
<p>“Any kind of damage that occurs there is absolutely unsatisfactory for our nation and our people, especially for many of our refugees who live there and are our brothers,” he said.</p></p>
