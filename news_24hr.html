            <p><p>The United Kingdom on Wednesday removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, thereby allowing Pakistani airlines to now apply to operate flights to the UK, according to a statement from the British High Commission in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Debt-ridden Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1566153">banned</a> from flying to the European Union, UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1558944">killing nearly 100 people</a>. The ban on operating to Europe was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875575">lifted</a> in November last year.</p>
<p>Today’s development comes after a team from the UK Department for Transport <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923408/uk-audit-approves-pakistan-aviation-security">concluded</a> an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”.</p>
<p>“Following air safety improvements, the UK’s Air Safety Committee has lifted UK restrictions on Pakistani carriers,” said a statement from the British High Commission.</p>
<p>“Individual airline carriers will still need to apply for permits to operate to the UK through the UK Civil Aviation Authority.”</p>
<p>British High Commissioner Jane Marriott was quoted as saying: “I’m grateful to aviation experts in the UK and Pakistan for their collaborative work to drive improvements to meet international safety standards.</p>
<p>“While it will take time for flights to resume, once the logistics are in place, I look forward to using a Pakistani carrier when visiting family and friends.”</p>
<p>In a post on X, Marriott called the approval “an important step, and a testament” to PIA’s air safety improvements.</p>

<p>Decisions on de-listing states and air carriers from the UK Air Safety List are made through an independent aviation safety process, according to the statement.</p>
<p>“This is overseen by the UK’s Air Safety Committee, who have <em>[sic]</em> been closely engaging with the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority over several years.</p>
<p>“The committee has judged that necessary safety improvements have been made since its original decision in 2021. Therefore, based on this independent and technically-driven process, it has decided to remove Pakistan and its air carriers from the list.”</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the move, saying it will provide “ease in travel between the UK and Pakistan will help this vital trade relationship grow manifold”.</p>
<p>“With over 1.6 million people of Pakistani heritage living in the UK and thousands of British nationals in Pakistan, today’s announcement brings long-awaited relief and new opportunities for families and friends to reunite,” he wrote on X.</p>

<p>Reacting to today’s development, Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif commended the government led by his party for “crossing another milestone”. “Three years of continuous hard work have borne fruit,” he <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KhawajaMAsif/status/1945389259881406550" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X.</p>
<p>“The green crescent flag is once again soaring proudly in the skies,” Asif added, commending his aviation ministry for its efforts.</p>

<p>In a press conference in Islamabad, Asif said the aviation ministry would now apply for licences to restore routes to Britain.</p>
<p>The minister said Airblue had also been removed from the safety list: “According to my knowledge, they have allowed not just PIA but also Airblue.”</p>
<p>Asif affirmed that the government was making efforts to resume New York flights.</p>
<p>The move adds to another positive development, with the UK government yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924354">launching</a> e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an “enhanced” border and immigration system.</p>
<p>A day prior to that, the two countries formally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924280/pakistan-uk-ink-accord-to-boost-economic-cooperation">signed</a> the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.</p>

<p>Asif hailed the removal of Pakistani airlines from UK’s Air Safety list, but stressed the need for fixing responsibility for the loss caused to the national carrier.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, Asif strongly criticised the PTI government for the fiasco and reputational damage caused to PIA, which he called a “crime against state”.</p>
<p>He pinned the responsibility on former prime minister Imran Khan and then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan, who had stated in the National Assembly after the 2020 crash that almost <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1567845">40 per cent</a> of the country’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1565352">pilots</a> had fake licenses.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The minister called on the government to pursue whoever was responsible for this loss, as the nation’s image was affected and a negative impression was created about the national airline and its pilots.</p>
<p>“Imran Khan and Ghulam Sarwar turned PIA into a graveyard,” Asif quipped.</p>
<p>In reply to a question, he said Sarwar’s speech was “enough to fix responsibility” as the national flag carrier’s image was affected. He suggested that the prime minister could order an enquiry to conduct an investigation and hold individuals accountable.</p>
<p>The minister noted that PIA suffered a drop in business, planes became <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1771459">dysfunctional</a> and the pilots’ reputation was tarnished. He highlighted that overseas Pakistanis used the airline due to cheaper and direct routes.</p>
<p>Asif hailed the civil aviation regulator and ministry officials for the “historic” day, saying that the decision has restored confidence in the national airline and aviation industry. He also thanked the UK and EU regulators for their guidance to plug loopholes and meet international standards.</p>
<p>The next step was privatising PIA, Asif noted, adding that the restoration of routes will assist the process as the government will receive a higher bid price. He asserted that the private sector would be able to revive the airline with higher investment, induct a new fleet and open new routes.</p></p>

            <p><p>Two policemen were gunned down in a “terrorist” attack on Wednesday in Kulachi area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district, police said.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, DI Khan Police Spokesperson, Yaqoob Khan, said, “The two police personnel were on their way to buy food when the terrorists opened fire on them.”</p>
<p>The deceased have been identified as head constable Ghulam Muhammad and constable Shahzad, both of whom were ex-servicemen.</p>
<p>Following the attack, police and Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) personnel tracked down the terrorists and killed one of them during an operation, while the other two, though injured, fled.</p>
<p>“Weapons and ammunition have been recovered from the slain terrorist, while a search operation is underway for the terrorists at large,” according to the spokesperson.</p>
<p>Federal Minister for Interior Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack, paying tribute to the martyred personnel.</p>
<p>He saluted the “sacrifices made by the brave sons” of KP in their fight against terrorism. Expressing sympathy for the families of the deceased, he said that the government stands with them at this difficult time.</p>
<p>Naqvi vowed that “their sacrifices will not go in vain”.</p>
<p>“KP police is leading the fight against terrorism in the country,” he noted.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents, with a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a> across Peshawar, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, and Bajaur in the past few months.</p>
<p>On June 21, KP Police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918714">killed</a> a terrorist and injured two others belonging to the TTP group in Dera Ismail Khan as they attempted to attack the police.</p>
<p>On June 3, terrorist <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915202">attacks</a> on two police stations in KP’s Bajaur and Bannu districts injured four police personnel. In May, two policemen were martyred and two were injured in a suicide <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911459">attack</a> in Peshawar, while in a separate incident, two cops <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912410">lost</a> their lives as a result of an attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu.</p>
<p>Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.</p>
<p>On July 5, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP’s Tipu Gul group were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922269">killed</a> in a joint operation by the CTD.</p>
<p>Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p></p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Wednesday that the performance of ministries will be evaluated every two months following the determination of key performance indicators, state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/16-07-2025/performance-of-ministries-to-be-evaluated-every-two-months-pm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>Chairing a meeting of the federal cabinet in Islamabad, the prime minister said the ministries demonstrating strong performance will be commended.</p>
<p>“From this year, we will determine key performance indicators for the ministries to evaluate their performance every two months,” he said, emphasising that enhancing ministries’ performance was ultimately about delivery and service to the nation.</p>

<p>Expressing satisfaction over the stock market <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924347/psx-breaches-137000-points-in-intraday-trade">touching</a> record levels this week, the prime minister said that the development reflected the positive business sentiment and that collective efforts were being made for the economic growth of the country.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also expressed grief and sorrow over the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924283">loss of lives</a> in recent monsoon rains across the country. He especially regretted the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920992/12th-body-swept-away-in-swat-river-flash-flood-recovered-from-charsadda">incident</a> in Swat, emphasising the need to take effective measures in the future to prevent such incidents.</p>
<p>Mons­oon rains in Pakistan have been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924283">linked</a> to more than 110 deaths, including dozens of children, since they started in late June, according to government figures released on Monday.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924394">reiterated</a> their commitment to working together with each other for the country’s sake.</p>
<p>“The meeting involved discussions on the country’s political, economic, and security situation. The state of law and order in the country and measures against terrorism were also discussed,” according to a press release by the Presidency.</p>
<p>Last week, PM Shehbaz said that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923847">transforming</a> the outdated system into a modern, digital and effective governance model is among the government’s top priorities, as economic development and prosperity are not possible without modernising the system to meet contemporary demands.</p></p>
