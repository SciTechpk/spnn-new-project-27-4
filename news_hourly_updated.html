                <h2>Govt to continue assisting in Dr Aafia Siddiqui‚Äôs case, PM Shehbaz assures her sister</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif assured Dr Fouzia Siddiqui on Friday that the government would continue to provide all possible legal and diplomatic support in the matter of her sister, Dr Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist serving a prison sentence in the United States, the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-meets-dr-aafia-siddiquis-sister-assures-all-possible-legal-diplomatic-support/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) Registrar Office <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924527">put</a> on hold the processing of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925717/contempt-notice-to-pm-cabinet-after-unsanctioned-hearing">contempt of court notices</a> issued to PM Shehbaz and his cabinet members as the dealing staff decided to ascertain its validity first.</p>
<p>IHC Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq on July 21 had issued a contempt of court notice to the entire federal government, including the prime minister and all ministers, for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921306">refusing</a> to file an amicus brief to support Dr Aafia‚Äôs case in the US.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe government is in no way negligent regarding the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui,‚Äù the prime minister was quoted as having said by <em>APP</em> in a meeting today with Dr Fouzia.</p>
<p>On the instructions of PM Shehbaz, the government has previously provided diplomatic and legal assistance in the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui, a statement issued by the PM Office said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFurthermore, the prime minister not only wrote a letter to then-US president Joe Biden regarding this issue but also formed a committee headed by Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar to ensure further progress in the matter,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe committee will remain in contact with Dr Fouzia and work to provide the necessary support in this regard.‚Äù</p>

<p>Dr Aafia, a neuroscientist and educator, was convicted by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on charges of attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan and has been serving her <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924527">sentence</a> at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Carswell in the US since 2010.</p>
<p>On July 12, the IHC expr¬≠essed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923643">dissatisfaction</a> over the federal government‚Äôs failure to submit a report in the case concerning Dr Aafia‚Äôs release, health and repatriation, with Justice Ishaq threatening to ‚Äúsummon the entire cabinet‚Äù if the report was not presented.</p>
<p>In February, the IHC was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893509">told</a> that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1496759">proposal</a> to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1384547">exchange</a> Shakil Afridi for Dr Aafia was unfeasible.</p>
<p>The law officer representing the federal government informed the court that Dr Aafia‚Äôs American lawyer Clive Smith had suggested the swap, but Pakistan and the US did not have any agreement for such an exchange.</p>
<p>Last year in October, PM Shehbaz had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866050">requested</a> that Biden pardon and release Dr Aafia from jail.</p>
<p>In a letter dated October 13, which has been seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, the prime minister expressed his concerns about Dr Aafia‚Äôs ‚Äúfragile mental and frail physical health‚Äù while in prison. ‚ÄúNow 52 years old, she has served 16 years behind bars in the US.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNumerous Pakistani officials have paid consular visits to Dr Siddiqui ‚Ä¶ all of them have raised their serious concerns about the treatment she has received,‚Äù the letter read. ‚ÄúIn fact, they fear she may take her own life.‚Äù</p>
<p>Consequently, the US State Department <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867024">declined</a> to comment on the letter written by PM Shehbaz to the Biden administration.</p>
<p>When a journalist inquired about the letter, spokesperson Vedant Patel had stated: ‚ÄúCertainly, we would not get into private diplomatic communications,‚Äù seemingly confirming receipt of the correspondence.</p></p>

                <h2>Chinese leadership lauds Pakistan‚Äôs role in regional peace during meeting with COAS Munir</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Chinese leadership has lauded the role of the Pakistan Army and hailed it as a ‚Äúcornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor‚Äù for peace in the region, the military‚Äôs media affairs wing said on Friday.</p>
<p>Pakistan and China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/china-says-it-backs-pakistan-in-defending-sovereignty">share</a> a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation, and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors, including trade, energy, infrastructure, and defence collaboration, with initiatives like the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879166">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.</p>
<p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir is currently on an official visit to China. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement today that he held meetings with senior Chinese political and military leadership in Beijing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúChinese military leadership reiterated full confidence in the strength of the bilateral defence partnership and acknowledged Pakistan‚Äôs pivotal role in promoting regional peace,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>COAS Munir called on Chinese Vice President Han Zheng and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the statement read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDiscussions focused on the evolving regional and global political landscape, connectivity initiatives under the CPEC, and the need for coordinated responses to shared geopolitical challenges,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBoth sides expressed satisfaction over the depth of bilateral engagement and reiterated their shared commitment to sovereign equality, multilateral cooperation, and long-term regional stability.‚Äù</p>
<p>The statement continued that the ‚ÄúChinese leadership lauded the Pakistan Armed Forces as a cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor to peace in South Asia‚Äù.</p>

<p>The military engagement between both sides included ‚Äúcomprehensive exchanges on defence and security cooperation, including counterterrorism collaboration, joint training, defence modernisation, and enhanced institutional linkages‚Äù, THE ISPR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEmphasis was placed on improving operational interoperability and strategic coordination to confront hybrid and transnational threats,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir held meetings with various Chinese military leaders, the statement read, adding, ‚ÄúUpon arrival at the  People‚Äôs Liberation Army Headquarters, the COAS was presented with a guard of honour, symbolising the longstanding camaraderie between the two armed forces.‚Äù</p>
<p>The COAS appreciated China‚Äôs ‚Äúconsistent support‚Äù and reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to ‚Äúfurther expanding military-to-military cooperation across all domains‚Äù, the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>The statement said that the visit ‚Äúreflects the growing depth of politico-military ties between the two brotherly nations and underscores their shared resolve to advance regional security through sustained high-level dialogue and engagements‚Äù.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926296/pakistan-signs-maritime-mou-with-chinese-shipping-giant-to-boost-collaboration">signed</a> a memorandum of understanding with Chinese shipping giant, Shandong Xinxu Group, in a move that is set to bring about a ‚Äúmajor transformation‚Äù in the shipping sector.</p>
<p>Last week, Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar met with the Chinese foreign minister, where both sides <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924658">reaffirmed</a> their commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation and promoting regional peace, stability and development.</p></p>
