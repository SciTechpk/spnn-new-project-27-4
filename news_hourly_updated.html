                <h2>We won the war but seek peace: PM Shehbaz invites India to live as ‚Äòpeaceful neighbour‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said Pakistan won the war but sought peace and invited India to live as a ‚Äúpeaceful neighbour‚Äù, as the country celebrated Operation Bunyanum Marsoos‚Äôs success with a ceremony.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan began after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> air strikes on Pakistan, causing civilian casualties. Both sides exchanged missiles over the following week, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> tensions. An <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">American intervention</a> led to a ceasefire. On Monday, the directors general of military operations held the <a class="link--external" href="https://On%20Monday,%20the%20director%20general%20of%20military%20operations%20for%20both%20sides%20held%20the%20first%20round%20of%20talks%20via%20hotline%20after%20the%20ceasefire." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first round of talks</a> after the ceasefire.</p>
<p>Today‚Äôs ceremony, marking the Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanksgiving Day), was held at the Pakistan Monument in Islamabad and attended by PM Shehbaz, armed forces chiefs, and other civil and military leaders. It began with the recitation of the Holy Quran, opening speeches, a flypast, and national songs.</p>

<p>Beginning his speech, PM Shehbaz praised the martyrs, their families, his cabinet members, service chiefs, and the nation for successfully responding to the Indian aggression.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have won the war but we want peace. We have taught our enemy a lesson but we condemn aggression, he said. ‚ÄúWe want this part of the world to be as prosperous and progressive as others through hard work, undying efforts and living like peaceful neighbours.‚Äù</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz said he had had a meeting with the services chiefs on the night between May 9 and 10, in which it was decided that since the enemy had crossed ‚Äúthe last limit‚Äù and rejected Pakistan‚Äôs offer of an international investigation, a ‚Äúmeasured response‚Äù must be given.</p>
<p>He detailed that around 2:30am that night, the army chief had told him on a secure telephone call that India had launched its ballistic missiles on Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe told me, ‚ÄòMr prime minister, grant us permission to strike the enemy with such force that they never forget it‚Äô.‚Äù</p>
<p>The premier added that later that night after Pakistan retaliated, the army chief had told him: ‚ÄúWe have given a befitting response and now we are being requested for a ceasefire. So, what do you think?‚Äù</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said that he had responded: ‚ÄúWhat could be greater than landing a blow that leaves the enemy‚Äôs head spinning and desperate for a ceasefire? Go ahead and accept the offer.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is a brief account of a long story from that day,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He informed the audience that the technology used by the Pakistan Air Force had stunned the enemy and sent the trust and confidence of allies soaring. ‚ÄúThis is a historic development that God brought about within a matter of hours,‚Äù PM Shehbaz said, adding that the military‚Äôs prowess was being talked about from the United States to Japan.</p>
<p>The premier said no major power can now block Pakistan‚Äôs path, with the entire nation united from Peshawar to Karachi, standing behind and supporting the army. He also reiterated his gratitude to allied nations for their efforts in achieving the ceasefire.</p>
<p>He went on to say that the conflict solved nothing, only bringing more poverty, unemployment and other problems to both sides.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe lesson is that we have to sit down at the table like peaceful neighbours and settle our outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir. Without resolving these issues, I don‚Äôt think we will have peace in this part of the world on a long-term basis.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf we want permanent peace then we need permanent solutions of Jammu and Kashmir and water distribution. Then once we resolve these issues, the sky‚Äôs the limit. We can talk of trade, exchange of business communities and cooperate in the field of counter-terrorism,‚Äù the prime minister emphasised.</p>

                <h2>Police launch investigation as Ahmadi doctor shot dead in Sargodha</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The police launched an investigation into the murder of locally renowned Ahmadi doctor, Sheikh Muhammad Mahmood, 58, who was shot dead in Punjab‚Äôs Sargodha on Friday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe cannot comment on whether the doctor was targeted on a religious basis or for some other reason as it would be premature to say,‚Äù Sargodha District Police Officer Sohaib Ashraf told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>He said one person was involved in the murder and the police were already gathering information after launching an investigation.</p>
<p>The first information report of the incident was filed at Shahid Shaheed Police Station by a relative of Dr Mahmood under Pakistan Penal Code Section 302 (murder).</p>
<p>It said the deceased was a practitioner at Sargodha‚Äôs Fatima Hospital and a renowned individual of the city. The complainant said he reached the hospital with the deceased around 2:35pm.</p>
<p>The FIR stated that an individual wearing a uniform of the  ‚ÄòSaaf Suthra Punjab‚Äô initiative approached the deceased and took out a pistol while saying: ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt spare you today Mahmood,‚Äù and shot the doctor two times in the back.</p>
<p>It added that the culprit soon fled, with the relative following after him to catch him but the former turned his weapon on the latter as well. The FIR said that another person arrived on a motorcycle and two soon fled away.</p>
<p>A press release by Ahmadi community spokesperson Amir Mehmood said the gastroenterologist had been receiving threats for a while from extremist elements, which had forced him to change the location of his job.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe was a very charitable person and had no enmity with anyone,‚Äù Mehmood said about the deceased, saying Dr Mahmood was a well-known Ahmadi and was receiving threats because of his faith.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe spokesperson said that this was the third Ahmadi to be targeted in the past month. The sudden increase in the continuous target killing of Ahmadis due to differences in faith is indicating a systematic wave. This is increasing the sense of insecurity among Ahmadis. This requires immediate attention and effective measures from the law enforcement agencies,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>The spokesperson alleged that extremist elements were active against Ahmadis in Sargodha for some time now, as in other areas with baseless cases being registered and hate speeches being made to prevent the community from performing religious rituals.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe continuous increase in hate incidents against Ahmadis is condemnable. The higher authorities should take notice of these incidents and bring the perpetrators to justice according to the law.‚Äù</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906527/2-arrested-for-allegedly-killing-ahmadi-man-injuring-another-in-punjabs-kasur-police">Two suspects</a> were arrested last month for the alleged murder of an Ahmadi man and injuring another in Punjab‚Äôs Kasur district.</p>
<p>Earlier in April, a 46-year-old businessman was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905048">lynched</a> when a few hundred supporters of a religiopolitical party stormed a place of worship belonging to the Ahmadi community in Karachi‚Äôs Saddar area to prevent it from observing religious rituals, according to officials.</p>
<p>In March, the Human Rights Com¬≠¬≠mission of Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895896/mob-led-attacks-on-ahmadis-growing-says-hrcp">said</a> it had observed a growing trend of mob-led attacks on the homes of families belonging to religious minorities, as well as their places of worship.</p>

It documented at least four faith-based killings, three of which targeted the Ahmadi community.</p></p>
