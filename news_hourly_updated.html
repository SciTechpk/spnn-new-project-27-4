                <h2>UAE denies granting lifetime Golden Visas to certain nationalities</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) late on Tuesday night denied widespread media reports that claimed it had begun granting lifetime Golden Visas to select nationalities under a ‚Äúnew nomination-based‚Äù scheme, according to the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.wam.ae/en/article/bkkw61s-uae-denies-rumours-about-lifetime-golden-visa-for" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Emirates News Agency</em></a> (<em>WAM</em>).</p>
<p>The <a class="link--external" href="https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/residence-visas/golden-visa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Golden Visa</a> is a long-term residence visa that enables foreign talent to live, work, or study in the UAE while enjoying a range of exclusive benefits. According to the UAE government‚Äôs official portal, eligible categories include investors, entrepreneurs, scientists, outstanding students and graduates, humanitarian pioneers, and frontline heroes.</p>
<p>This week, several Indian media outlets, including <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.ptinews.com/editor-detail/Indians-can-now-get-UAE-s-Golden-Visa-without-trade-license--property-purchase/2704586" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Press Trust of India</a></em> and <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indians-can-now-get-uaes-golden-visa-without-trade-license-property-purchase/article69782170.ece" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Hindu</a></em>, reported that the UAE government had initiated a ‚Äúnew nomination-based visa policy‚Äù, allowing Indians to ‚Äúenjoy the UAE‚Äôs Golden Visa for life by paying a fee of AED100,000‚Äù.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uae-golden-visa-how-indians-can-now-get-lifetime-residency-without-investment-key-details/amp_articleshow/122288489.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Times of India</a></em> reported that the newly launched scheme was in its pilot phase and was currently available to applicants from both India and Bangladesh, with over 5,000 Indian applications expected in the first three months. Dubai-based <em><a class="link--external" href="https://gulfnews.com/uae/good-news-bangladeshis-can-now-apply-for-uae-golden-visa-remotely-1.500189952" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gulf News</a></em> also reported on Monday that Bangladeshi citizens could apply for the Golden Visa remotely if they meet the requirements.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has denied the accuracy of rumours circulated by some local and international media outlets and websites regarding the United Arab Emirates granting lifetime Golden Visas to certain nationalities,‚Äù the <em>WAM</em> report said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúICP clarified that the categories, conditions, and regulations of the Golden Visa are clearly defined in accordance with official laws, legislations, and ministerial decisions.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to <em>WAM</em>, the ICP emphasised that ‚Äúall Golden Visa applications are handled exclusively through official government channels within the UAE, and that no internal or external consultancy entity is recognised as an authorised party in the application process‚Äù.</p>
<p>The federal authority said it had ‚Äúrecently observed news articles from a consultancy office based in another country, suggesting that lifetime Golden Visas could be obtained for all categories from outside the UAE via consulting or commercial entities under simplified conditions‚Äù.</p>
<p>The <em>WAM</em> report further added: ‚ÄúThese claims have no legal basis and were made without coordination with the relevant authorities in the UAE. The federal authority reaffirmed its commitment to providing a safe and transparent environment for applicants.‚Äù</p>
<p>It also stated that legal action would be taken against entities ‚Äúspreading such false information in an attempt to illegally collect money from individuals aspiring to live and reside in the UAE, exploiting their hopes for a dignified and secure life.‚Äù</p>
<p>The federal authority urged individuals wishing to visit, live, or invest in the UAE not to respond to inaccurate rumours and false news aimed at a quick profit. They should avoid paying any fees or submitting personal documents to any party claiming to provide these services, the report said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI checked with the authorities here, and they say they have no such information. So, the news is likely to be untrue,‚Äù Iqbal Marconi, ex-chief executive officer of ECH Group (which <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.khaleejtimes.com/kt-network/golden-horizons-iqbal-marconis-ech-digital-pioneers-uaes-golden-visa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Khaleej Times</a></em> has described as the largest golden visa facilitator in the region), told <em>Economic Times</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe only new update they have is that crypto investors won‚Äôt be considered for the Golden Visa scheme. I checked with the GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs Dubai) also; they too said they don‚Äôt have any information on this, ‚Äú Marconi said.</p>
<p>He added that a ‚Äúcouple of officials [‚Ä¶] in the same line of work‚Äù whom he contacted also did not have any information in this regard.</p></p>

            <p><p>Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan arrived in Islamabad on an official visit early Wednesday morning to hold discussions on bilateral issues, the Foreign Office said in a statement.</p>

Fidan also <a class="link--external" href="https://www.mfa.gov.tr/turkiye-pakistan-relations.en.mfa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paid a visit</a> to Pakistan in May last year.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring his official engagements in Pakistan, all important issues of mutual interest will be discussed,‚Äù the Foreign Office said in a post on X. ‚ÄúThe visit reflects the close and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, rooted in shared history, culture, and mutual trust.‚Äù</p>

<p>Pakistan and Turkiye enjoy strong bilateral ties built on shared cultural, religious, and historical bonds, as well as mutual respect.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922785">extended condolences</a> to Turkiye after 12 Turkish soldiers died of methane exposure in Iraq during a search mission in the Claw-Lock Operation zone a day earlier.</p>
<p>Last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met on the sidelines of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) summit in Khankendi, Azerbaijan, to reaffirm their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties.</p>
<p>The two leaders <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/turkiye/efforts-ongoing-to-deepen-turkiye-pakistan-cooperation-in-various-fields-turkish-president/3622179" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discussed</a> deepening cooperation in key areas, including trade, energy, defence, connectivity and investment. PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs unwavering commitment to working closely with Turkiye to promote peace, stability and sustainable development in the region.</p>
<p>In February, President Erdogan also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891671">visited</a> Pakistan, during which both nations pledged to ensure bilateral trade worth $5bn.</p></p>
