            <p><p>The Foreign Office on Tuesday condemned the recent remarks towards Pakistan by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a speech in Gujarat, calling it a “reckless provocation”.</p>
<p>The developments follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.</p>
<p>On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>. After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting drones</a> sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> was reached.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ANI/status/1926983867820326946" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> shared by Indian news outlet <em>ANI</em>, Modi says: “The people of Pakistan must come forward to rid their country of terrorism. Their youth will have to come forward.”</p>
<p>He went on to say: “Live a life of peace, eat your bread or [choose my] bullet,” to applause from the crowd, with many adorned in orange and white outfits.</p>

<p>A statement by the FO early on Tuesday said Pakistan has taken note of Modi’s remarks “delivered in Gujarat with the theatrical flourish of a campaign rally rather than the sobriety expected of the leader of a nuclear-armed state.</p>
<p>“The hate-driven invocation of violence in his remarks is deeply disturbing, not only for its content but for the dangerous precedent it sets in region already burdened by volatility,” the FO said.</p>
<p>“We regret the continued erosion of maturity and decorum in Indian statecraft.”</p>

<p>The FO noted that such statement “blatantly violate” the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, which obliges member states to resolve disputes peacefully and to refrain from the threat or use of force against the sovereignty or political independence of other states.</p>
<p>“Pakistan views these remarks as a reckless provocation, intended to distract from the ongoing human rights abuses and demographic engineering in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu &amp; Kashmir.</p>
<p>“Pakistan’s record as a leading contributor to UN peacekeeping and its consistent cooperation in global counter-terrorism efforts speak louder than any hostile soundbite.</p>
<p>“If extremism is indeed a concern for the Indian government, it would do well to turn inward-toward the alarming rise of majoritarianism, religious intolerance, and the systematic disenfranchisement of minorities under the increasingly brutal Hindutva ideology,” the FO said.</p>
<p>It added that Pakistan remains committed to peace based on mutual respect and sovereign equality.</p>
<p>“However, any threat to its security or territorial integrity will be met with firm and proportionate measures, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.</p>
<p>“The international community must take serious note of India’s escalating rhetoric, which undermines regional stability and the prospects for lasting peace.”</p></p>

            <p><p>The government on Tuesday extended the deadline for expressions of interest in purchasing Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) to June 13, the privatisation ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The government’s failed first <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894375">attempt</a> to privatise PIA cost the national exchequer $4.3 million, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Privatisation was informed on February 26.</p>
<p>In March, Privatisation and Investment Minister Abdul Aleem Khan said that the government would complete all the steps to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896181">privatise PIA by May</a>, while the pri­vatisation commission <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898843">approved</a> a transaction structure for the second attempt to privatise the national carrier based on a divestment of 51 to 100 per cent of its shares of capital.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906353#:~:text=The%20investors%20can%20submit%20an%20expression%20of%20interest%20by%20June%203%2C%20with%20the%20bidding%20process%20expected%20to%20take%20place%20between%20October%20and%20December.">earlier deadline</a> was June 3, with the bidding process expected to take place between October and December.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the ministry, the deadline for submission on expressions of interest till 4pm on June 19.</p>
<p>Last month, a PIA spokesperson said that the carrier’s bo­­ard of directors approved its fin­ancial results for 2024, which showed the airline achieving a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903037/pia-achieves-net-profit-after-21-years">net profit</a> after around 21 years.</p>
<p>According to the results for FY2024, PIA earned an operational profit of Rs3.9 billion and a net profit of Rs2.26bn. The airline’s operating margin was more than 12pc, which is on a par with the performance of any of the best airlines in the world, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>PIA began to be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1788332">unprofitable</a> in 2011, requiring government subsidies. By the end of 2016, the national flag carrier was saddled with $3bn in debt. At the end of 2018, the airline was burdened with $3.3bn in debt, up from $2.97bn the year before. Government bailouts were required for the carrier’s continued operation.</p>
<p>Last year in June, the then-government had agreed to overhaul loss-making state-owned enterprises, including PIA, under a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $3bn bailout. But in February 2024 — right before the general elections — the election commission had asked the then-caretaker administration to “refrain” from finalising the deal.</p></p>

            <p><p>India’s defence minister has approved a framework for building the country’s most advanced stealth fighter jet, the defence ministry said on Tuesday, amid a new arms race with Pakistan weeks after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">military conflict</a> between the neighbours.</p>
<p>Indian state-run Aeronautical Development Agency, which is executing the programme, will shortly invite initial interest from defence firms for developing a prototype of the warplane, envisaged as a twin-engine 5th generation fighter, the ministry said.</p>
<p>The project is crucial for the Indian Air Force, whose squadrons of French, Russian and ex-Soviet aircraft have fallen to 31 from an approved strength of 42 at a time when rival China is expanding its air force rapidly.</p>
<p>Pakistan has one of China’s advanced warplanes, the J-10, in its arsenal, which it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911307">claims</a> to have used to shoot down India’s latest French Rafale jets in the recent fighting.</p>

<p>Militaries of nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan faced-off in four days of fighting this month, which saw use of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911123">fighter jets</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">missiles</a>, drones and artillery by both sides before a ceasefire was announced by US President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>It was the first time both sides utilised drones at scale and the South Asian powers are now locked in a drones arms race, according to <em>Reuters</em>’ interviews with 15 people, including security officials, industry executives and analysts in the two countries.</p>
<p>India will partner with a domestic firm for the stealth fighter programme, and companies can bid independently or as a joint venture, the defence ministry said in a statement, adding that the bids would be open for both private and state-owned firms.</p>
<p>In March, an Indian defence committee had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895761">recommended</a> including the private sector in military aircraft manufacturing to shore up the capabilities of the Indian Air Force and reduce the burden on state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, which makes most of India’s military aircraft.</p>
