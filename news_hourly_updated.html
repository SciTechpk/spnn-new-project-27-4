                <h2>Pahalgam tensions: Army leadership warns of decisive response against any Indian attempt to impose war</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The army‚Äôs top brass on Friday warned India of a ‚Äúsure and decisive‚Äù response should it attempt to impose war, as relations deteriorated between Islamabad and New Delhi amid rising tensions after last week‚Äôs attack in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">killed 26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> and India‚Äôs premier granting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">‚Äúoperational freedom‚Äù</a> to the military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an Indian incursion within 24‚Äì36 hours, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension">diplomatic channels</a> have been engaged to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907785/any-military-misadventure-by-india-will-be-met-with-swift-resolute-notch-up-response-coas">warned</a> a day ago that ‚Äúany military misadventure by India will be met with a swift, resolute, and notch-up response.‚Äù</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7271" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said the army chief presided over a special session of the Corps Commanders‚Äô Conference (CCC) at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi today in which the military brass conducted a comprehensive review of the prevailing geo-strategic environment, with particular emphasis on the current Pakistan-India standoff and the broader regional security calculus.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile reaffirming Pakistan‚Äôs abiding commitment to peace, stability, and prosperity, the forum made clear that any attempt to impose war will be responded to, surely and decisively and aspirations of people of Pakistan shall be respected at all costs,‚Äù the ISPR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe forum reaffirmed the unflinching resolve of the Pakistan Armed Forces to uphold the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country against any aggression or misadventure,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The ISPR said the army‚Äôs top brass reiterated that Pakistan‚Äôs path to peace and development would not be deterred by terrorism, coercion or aggression ‚Äî whether directly or through proxies.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDeliberate destabilisation efforts by the Indian government will be confronted and defeated with resolve and clarity,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>The ISPR said COAS Munir lauded the military‚Äôs ‚Äúunwavering professionalism, steadfast morale and operational preparedness‚Äù, saying that it stood in unity with the nation to defend the homeland at all costs.</p>
<p>The army chief also highlighted the critical importance of ‚Äúheightened vigilance and proactive readiness‚Äù across all fronts amid the situation.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The statement said the CCC participants expressed grave concern over the ‚Äúintensification of Indian atrocities‚Äù in occupied Kashmir in the attack‚Äôs aftermath, as well as the continued targeting of innocent civilians along the Line of Control by Indian occupation forces.</p>
<p>They reiterated that such ‚Äúinhumane and unprovoked acts‚Äù served only to escalate regional tensions and would be met with a ‚Äúresolute and proportionate response‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe forum noted, with serious concern, India‚Äôs consistent pattern of exploitation of crises to achieve political and military objectives. They have been following a predictable template ‚Äî whereby internal governance failures are externalised. These incidents have often coincided with unilateral moves by India to alter the status quo, as seen in 2019 when India similarly exploited the Pulwama incident to unilaterally alter the status quo of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, through revocation of Article 370.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the latest instance, the Pahalgam episode appears to be part of a deliberate strategy to divert Pakistan‚Äôs focus away from the western front, as well as ongoing national efforts for economic revival; the two fronts where Pakistan is decisively and sustainably gaining grounds. Such diversionary tactics aimed at providing operational breathing space to Indian terror proxies will never succeed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the same vein, the forum expressed serious concern that India is now exploiting the Pahalgam incident to undermine the longstanding Indus Waters Treaty, seeking to usurp Pakistan‚Äôs legitimate and inalienable water rights. This constitutes a dangerous attempt to weaponise water, threatening the livelihood and sustenance of over 240 million Pakistanis and escalating strategic instability in South Asia,‚Äù the ISPR said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>It added that the CCC members also ‚Äúvoiced deep alarm over credible evidence of direct Indian military and intelligence involvement in orchestrating terrorist activities‚Äù inside Pakistan.</p>
<p>The ISPR said these state-sponsored actions were in blatant violation of international norms and were universally unacceptable.</p>
<p>The statement said the meeting concluded with the COAS expressing ‚Äúcomplete confidence in the operational readiness, deterrence posture and morale of all formations and strategic forces to defend the nation across the entire threat spectrum‚Äù.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said morale was high among the armed forces and the public under COAS Munir‚Äôs command,</p>
<p>Speaking on <em>Geo News</em> programme ‚ÄòNaya Pakistan‚Äô, the defence minister lauded the army chief for his ‚Äúhigh resolve‚Äù following today‚Äôs corps commander meeting, calling his command ‚Äúbefitting‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOver the past five days, the way he (the army chief) has met troops in the various cantonments, the LoC and the working boundary has contributed to high morale among the armed forces and the people,‚Äù Asif said. ‚ÄúGod willing, the situation will be just like the communique after the corps commander meeting.‚Äù</p>
<p>The defence minister reiterated that India‚Äôs allegations held no credibility and that Indians were turning against Modi‚Äôs narrative.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter the attack, they filed an FIR and levelled allegations, raising a hue and cry,‚Äù Asif said. ‚ÄúReports are emerging that there were preparations for the attack and that allegations would be made against Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTill now, there is not a shred of evidence,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThey carried this out for their political gains. Otherwise, there is no credibility.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The defence minister highlighted that ‚Äúno country in the world‚Äù believed India‚Äôs version of events or supported them following the incident.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNobody is believing their story, even his (Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs) people and media are not standing behind it,‚Äù Asif said, noting: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a desperate man, you can expect anything from him, but this is a major defeat against the narrative he has tried to create.‚Äù</p>
<p>Asked about an interview with a former indian intelligence chief, Asif said he saw the interview and noted that his diction indicated Modi‚Äôs credibility.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf you base your politics on lies on such a heightened pitch ‚Ä¶ then you will ultimately fall flat on your face, and they have,‚Äù Asif said.</p>
<p>In response to a question about the potential suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and weaponisation of water, Asif said Pakistan would pursue legal action against India‚Äôs suspension of the treaty.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt deny us our rights [under the treaty],‚Äù Asif said. ‚ÄúBased on what I know of geography, the Chenab and Jhelum flow from Kashmir. Its location does not allow for them to be diverted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúArchitecturally, practically, this is not possible,‚Äù the defence minister said. ‚ÄúThis is an established treaty ‚Ä¶ violating it is not easy.‚Äù</p>
<p>Asked if any diversions of waterways counted as an act of war, Asif said, ‚ÄúAbsolutely. If they construct any structure to divert water, then we have the right to strike it; it is an act of war.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor the time being, we are approaching all fora ‚Äî including the IWT ‚Äî and pursuing action.‚Äù</p></p>

            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907975/govt-insists-programme-on-track-amid-reports-of-india-asking-imf-to-review-pakistan-loan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <h2>Govt insists programme on track amid reports of India asking IMF to review Pakistan loan</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Shehzad on Friday said the country‚Äôs International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme was ‚Äúcompletely on track‚Äù, noting a smooth review process despite reports that India had raised concerns with the lenders over Pakistan‚Äôs loans and sought a review.</p>
<p>Relations between the two neighbouring countries turned hostile following an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam that killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">rejected</a> the accusation and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the attack, India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274">suspended</a> the Indus Water Treaty, and the two countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907663#:~:text=PAF%E2%80%99s%20prompt%20response.-,Airspace%20concerns,-With%20tensions%20running">closed their airspace</a> to each other‚Äôs airlines.</p>
<p>Pakistan secured a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845536">$7 billion bailout programme</a> from the IMF last year and was granted a new $1.3bn <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900322">climate resilience loan</a> in March.</p>
<p>The IMF Executive Board will meet on May 9 to discuss the country‚Äôs staff-level agreement for a new arrangement, along with the first review of Pakistan‚Äôs ongoing bailout programme, the global lender said earlier this week.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em> today, Shehzad said that the programme was ‚Äúcompletely on track‚Äù and the review was ‚Äúdone well‚Äù.</p>
<p>He said that they conducted ‚Äúvery productive meetings‚Äù with the IMF, World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other International Financial Institutions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile in the spring meetings in DC, we did about 70 meetings within (a) span of six days,‚Äù he said, adding that interest was very high for investing and supporting Pakistan as the economy turned around and raters gave a positive outlook while upgrading the ratings as well.</p>
<p>Separately, India raised concerns with the IMF on its loans to Pakistan, asking for a review, a government source told <em>Reuters</em> without elaborating.</p>
<p>The IMF and India‚Äôs finance ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment by <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>The programme is critical to the $350bn economy and Pakistan said it has stabilised under the bailout that helped it stave off a default threat.</p>
<p>The soaring tensions between the two countries have drawn global attention and calls for cooling tempers.</p>
<p>US Vice President JD Vance said <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907930/us-hopes-that-indias-response-to-pahalgam-attack-doesnt-lead-to-broader-regional-conflict-vance">yesterday</a> that Washington hoped Pakistan would cooperate with India to hunt down the assailants.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd we hope, frankly, that Pakistan, to the extent that they‚Äôre responsible, cooperates with India to make sure that the terrorists sometimes operating in their territory are hunted down and dealt with,‚Äù Vance had said.</p></p>
