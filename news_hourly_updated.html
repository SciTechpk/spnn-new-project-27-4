                <h2>COAS Munir stresses potential for ‚Äòbroader, multidimensional‚Äô ties with US built on mutual respect</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir has stressed the ‚Äúimmense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect‚Äù with the United States, the military‚Äôs media wing said on Friday.</p>
<p>COAS Munir is on a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917414">five-day</a> official visit to the US, where he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093/trump-coas-munir-talk-counterterrorism-and-trade-in-cordial-meeting-ispr">met with</a> President Donald Trump over luncheon, becoming the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">first</a> serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. National Security Advisor Lt Gen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907660/in-a-first-isi-chief-made-national-security-adviser">Muhammad Asim Malik</a> ‚Äî also the intelligence chief ‚Äî has accompanied Gen Munir.</p>
<p>COAS Munir held an interaction in Washington DC with prominent US think tanks and representatives of the strategic affairs institutions, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7326" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>Senior scholars, analysts, policy experts and representatives of leading international media outlets were also part of the ‚Äúcomprehensive and candid exchange‚Äù, ISPR added.</p>
<p>The army chief ‚Äúunderscored the immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect, shared strategic interests, and economic interdependence‚Äù, the statement said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Evaluating the Pakistan-US partnership, Gen Munir underlined the ‚Äúhistorical convergences between the two nations, particularly in areas such as counterterrorism, regional security and economic development‚Äù.</p>
<p>In his remarks, the army chief also highlighted Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúunwavering commitment to regional peace and stability, and its constructive role in fostering a rules-based international order‚Äù.</p>
<p>The army chief also noted the ‚Äúmalign influence of certain regional actors in sponsoring and perpetuating terrorism as a tool of hybrid warfare‚Äù, the statement added.</p>
<p>He mentioned this as he alluded to the details and analysis of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910729/operation-bunyanum-marsoos-11-soldiers-martyred-78-wounded-while-defending-pakistan">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a> during the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186">conflict</a> with India and ‚Äúelaborated on Pakistan‚Äôs perspective on terrorism‚Äù.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir emphasised that Pakistan had been on the ‚Äúfront lines of the global war against terrorism, having rendered immense sacrifices ‚Äî both human and economic ‚Äî in pursuit of a safer and more secure world‚Äù.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has repeatedly <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a> that Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911617#:~:text=which%20lost%2090%2C000%20lives%20and%20over%20%24150%20billion%20economic%20losses">lost</a> 90,000 valuable lives and incurred $150 billion worth of economic losses over the past few decades.</p>
<p>During the session, COAS Munir also invited international partners to explore collaborative opportunities in various sectors to ‚Äúunlock shared prosperity‚Äù.</p>
<p>He highlighted Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúremarkable untapped potential, particularly in the domains of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915901">information technology</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1871762">agriculture</a>, and its vast and underexploited reserves in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903248">mining</a> and mineral sectors‚Äù, echoing topics discussed in his meeting with Trump and previous Pak-US interactions.</p>
<p>The army chief also provided a detailed exposition of Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúbalanced approach to regional and global conflicts, advocating for dialogue, diplomacy, and adherence to international law‚Äù, the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He reaffirmed that Pakistan continues to play a ‚Äúresponsible and proactive role in mitigating regional tensions and promoting cooperative security frameworks‚Äù. The statement comes amid heightened tensions in the Middle East amid the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/israel-iran-conflict">Israel-Iran war</a> as the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918216/how-trump-a-self-proclaimed-peacemaker-embraced-israels-campaign-against-iran">weighs</a> whether to intervene militarily or not.</p>
<p>Participants, the ISPR said, noted the ‚Äúopenness and clarity of the COAS‚Äôs perspectives and appreciated Pakistan‚Äôs consistent and principled policies‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe interaction was marked by a spirit of mutual understanding and was widely regarded as a positive step toward enhancing strategic dialogue between Pakistan and the United States,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The interaction also provided an opportunity to articulate Pakistan‚Äôs principled stance on key regional and global issues, and to deepen understanding of Pakistan‚Äôs strategic outlook, the military‚Äôs media wing noted. It reflected the country‚Äôs ‚Äúcommitment to transparent diplomacy, international engagement, and the pursuit of peaceful coexistence through principled and proactive dialogue‚Äù.</p></p>

                <h2>Sana Yousaf murder case: Islamabad court extends suspect‚Äôs physical remand by 3 days</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>An Islamabad court on Friday extended the physical remand of the main suspect in the murder case of social media influencer Sana Yousaf for another three days.</p>
<p>Islamabad Police had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915163/faisalabad-suspect-held-for-17-year-old-social-media-influencers-islamabad-murder-over-repeated-rejections">arrested</a> Umar Hayat, the main suspect in the 17-year-old‚Äôs murder, on June 3, nearly a day after she was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915163/murder-case-filed-after-17-year-old-social-media-influencer-shot-dead-in-islamabad">gunned down</a> in her house in the federal capital. Police had claimed the man murdered Sana because she repeatedly refused his advances.</p>
<p>Hayat was presented before the court of Judicial Magistrate Mohammad Hafeez upon the completion of his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917547/accused-in-sana-yousuf-murder-case-given-in-police-custody">four-day</a> physical remand. His <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915468">14-day judicial remand</a> at the Adiala Jail for his identification parade had already been completed, with the victim‚Äôs mother and aunt identifying him.</p>

<p>Deputy district public prosecutors (DDPPs) Adnan Ali and Raja Naveed Hussain, along with Investigation Officer (IO) Mazhar Bashir Khan, appeared on behalf of the state before Magistrate Hafeez.</p>
<p>Hussain informed the judge that the vehicle used by the suspect had been recovered, while his phone was yet to be taken into custody. ‚ÄúThe suspect is quite clever and understands the gravity of the crime, which is why he is not letting us recover his mobile phone,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>IO Bashir then requested the court to extend the detained man‚Äôs remand by seven days for further ‚Äúinvestigation and recovery‚Äù, according to the written order.</p>
<p>However, the magistrate approved the remand for another three days, directing the police to produce the suspect before the court on June 23.</p>

<p>Sana‚Äôs mobile phone and the murder weapon had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915163#:~:text=recovered%20the%20murder%20weapon%20and%20pistol%20from%20the%20man%2C%20as%20well%20as%20the%20mobile%20phone%20used%20by%20the%20slain%20girl">recovered</a> from the suspect‚Äôs possession when he was arrested.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe ruthless killer took the phone with him after the murder to destroy evidence. In order to apprehend the accused, raids were conducted at over 11 locations in three cities. The accused is a 22-year-old unemployed man who repeatedly attempted to contact the victim. Upon her refusal to respond, he committed the murder,‚Äù said the police.</p>
<p>The incident had sparked widespread outrage across the country, including from <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193702/the-murder-of-teenage-tiktok-star-sana-yousaf-is-exposing-the-rot-in-our-society">citizens</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915375/mahira-khan-saba-qamar-other-stars-call-for-justice-for-sana-yousaf-in-a-world-that-keeps-failing-girls">celebrities</a> and even President Asif Ali Zardari‚Äôs daughter, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916285/dont-let-them-silence-you-says-aseefa-on-sana-yousaf-murder">MNA Aseefa</a>.</p></p>
