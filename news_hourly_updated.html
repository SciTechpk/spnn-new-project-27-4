                <h2>Missing toddler found murdered in Rawalpindi</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>RAWALPINDI: A toddler who went missing while playing in the street was found dead in a sewerage line in Ratta Amral on Thursday,  allegedly murdered by a boy, a close relative of the little girl.</p>

<p>Maryam, one-year-old girl, while playing outside her house in Mohalla Qazian Ratta Amral with other children, went missing.</p>

<p>After the disappearance, Maryam‚Äôs parents started a search for her, but failing to find clues, her grandmother, Ms Musarat Bibi, sought police help and registered a case under the relevant section of the law.</p>

<p>During the search, the missing girl‚Äôs body was found in the main sewerage line of Dhoke Ratta on Thursday. The local police reached the spot and shifted the body to the District Headquarters Hospital for post-mortem. An investigation launched to ascertain the facts behind the tragic death of the little girl.</p>

<p>Later on, police arrested the accused, who was identified as Azan Sultan, 10 and a half years old, and lived in the same house. The accused boy was shifted to the protection bureau by the local court.</p>

<p>During the initial investigation, the accused revealed that he had picked up the girl and put her head in the sewerage line water, which claimed her life. The police investigating officer said while quoting the accused as: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt like her.‚Äù</p>

<p>Police said that the CCTV footage helped the police to trace the accused as he could be seen picking up the girl from the street and taking her away. The girl‚Äôs body was handed over to her parents after the postmortem.</p>

<p>The girl‚Äôs father was an employee in the cantonment board. The father of the accused is an addict, as his mother had left his house and resided with her parents. </p>

                <h2>Trump-Musk bromance descends into brawl over contracts and impeachment</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to cut off government contracts to Elon Musk‚Äôs companies and the world‚Äôs richest man suggested the US president should be impeached, marking a stark end to an unlikely alliance and leaving onlookers wondering what was next.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914033">hostilities</a> between the former allies intensified when the president criticized Tesla CEO Musk in the Oval Office and the pair then lobbed verbal barbs at each other on their social media platforms: Trump‚Äôs Truth Social and Musk‚Äôs X.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon‚Äôs Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,‚Äù Trump posted.</p>
<p>Tesla shares closed down over 14 per cent on Thursday, losing about $150 billion in market value in the largest single-day decline in value in its history.</p>
<p>Minutes after the closing bell, Musk replied, ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù to a post on X saying Trump should be impeached, an unthinkable move in Congress where Trump‚Äôs Republicans hold majorities in both chambers.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The trouble between the two started brewing days ago, when Musk denounced Trump‚Äôs sweeping tax-cut and spending <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912732">bill</a>.</p>
<p>The president initially held his tongue while Musk campaigned to torpedo the bill, saying it would add too much to the nation‚Äôs $36.2 trillion in debt.</p>
<p>Trump broke his silence on Thursday, telling reporters he was ‚Äúvery disappointed‚Äù in Musk.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLook, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don‚Äôt know if we will anymore,‚Äù Trump said.</p>
<p>As Trump spoke, Musk responded in real time on X.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWithout me, Trump would have lost the election,‚Äù <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930667528696828120" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Musk, who spent nearly $300 million backing Trump and other Republicans in last year‚Äôs election.</p>
<p>In another post, Musk asserted that Trump‚Äôs signature tariffs would push the US into a recession later this year.</p>

<p>Musk‚Äôs businesses also include rocket company and government contractor SpaceX and its satellite unit Starlink.</p>
<p>Musk, whose space business plays a critical role in the US government‚Äôs space program, said that as a result of Trump‚Äôs threats he would <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930718684819112251" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">begin decommissioning</a> SpaceX‚Äôs Dragon spacecraft. Dragon is the only US spacecraft capable of sending astronauts to the International Space Station. Late on Thursday, Musk backed off the threat.</p>
<p>And in a sign of a possible detente to come, Musk subsequently <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930798791806050496" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not wrong,‚Äù in response to billionaire investor Bill Ackman saying Trump and Musk should make peace.</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#punching-back" id="punching-back" title="Permalink"></a>Punching back</h2>
<p>Trump and Musk are both political fighters with a penchant for using social media to attack their perceived enemies, and many observers had predicted a falling out.</p>
<p>Musk had become one of Trump‚Äôs most visible advisers as <a class="link--external" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1892748&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjusoOngNyNAxV6YEEAHbShKVcQFnoECBkQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0tNrfyso1xR9c5bRAX-fQK" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">head</a> of the Department of Government Efficiency, which mounted a sweeping and controversial effort to downsize the federal workforce and slash spending.</p>
<p>After leaving that role, Musk this week targeted what Trump has named his ‚Äúbig, beautiful bill‚Äù, calling it a ‚Äúdisgusting abomination‚Äù that would deepen the federal deficit.</p>
<p>His attacks amplified a rift within the Republican Party that could threaten the bill‚Äôs prospects in the Senate.</p>
<p>Nonpartisan analysts say Trump‚Äôs bill could add $2.4tr to $5tr to the nation‚Äôs $36.2tr in debt.</p>
<p>A prolonged feud between the pair could make it harder for Republicans to keep control of Congress in next year‚Äôs midterm elections if it leads to a loss of Musk‚Äôs campaign spending or erodes support for Trump in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>‚ÄúElon really was a significant portion of the ground game this last cycle,‚Äù said a Republican strategist with ties to Musk and the Trump administration who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf he sits out the midterms, that worries me.‚Äù</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Musk posted that ‚Äúin November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.‚Äù</p>
<p>Musk had already said he planned to curtail his political spending in the future. Musk‚Äôs increasing focus on politics provoked widespread protests at Tesla sites, driving down sales while investors fretted that Musk‚Äôs attention was too divided.</p></p>
