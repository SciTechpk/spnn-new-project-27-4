            <p><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday disqualified the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders, Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza and other PTI lawmakers following their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">convictions</a> in cases related to the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">arrest</a>, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">attacking</a> the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.</p>
<p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Faisalabad last week senten­ced over 100 leaders and workers of the PTI, including several key opposition figures, to jail terms of up to 10 years in connection with the May 9 riots. Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan, Opposition Leader in the Senate Shibli Faraz, MNA Zartaj Gul, Raza, Sheikh Rashid Shafique (nephew of former interior minister Sheikh Rashid), Kanwal Shauzab, Farah Agha, Rai Haider Kharal and Muhammad Ahmad Chattha were among those sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment.</p>
<p>A notification from the ECP today said Faraz, Ayub, Kharal, Raza, MNA Rai Hassan Nawaz Khan, Gul, MPA Muhammad Ansar Iqbal, MPA Junaid Afzal Sahi and MPA Rai Muhammad Murtaza Iqbal were now disqualified under Article 63(1h) (a person shall be disqualified from being elected [if] … he has been, on conviction for any offence involving moral turpitude, sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years) of the Constitution and their seats were vacant.</p>
<p>Ayub lambasted the ATC’s “bogus verdict” in a post on X today, saying that he would contest it and the ECP’s disqualification in court.</p>

<p>The development follows other recent disqualifications of PTI leaders and lawmakers.</p>
<p>On July 29, the ECP had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927477/haste-raises-eyebrows-as-ecp-disqualifies-another-pti-lawmaker">disqualified MNA Abdul Latif</a> from the NA-1 constituency (Upper and Lower Chitral), raising questions over the haste with which a flurry of similar decisions were taken in recent days.</p>
<p>On July 28, the commission had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927202">disqualified</a> Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, MNA Mohammad Ahmed Chatta and MPA Ahmad Khan.</p>
<p>On December 21 and 26 last year, a military court had sentenced over 50 PTI leaders and activists, including Imran Khan’s nephew Hassaan Niazi, to up to 10 years for their involvement in the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>The ATCs have been hearing May 9-related cases daily to meet a deadline set by the Supreme Court for the conclusion of trials by August.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#faisalabad-atc-sentencing" id="faisalabad-atc-sentencing" title="Permalink"></a>Faisalabad ATC sentencing</h2>
<p>The ATC had convicted the PTI lawmakers under Section 109 (punishment for abetment) and Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) in FIR No. 835/2023, registered at Ghulam Muhammadabad police station.</p>
<p>In FIR No. 1277/2023 of the same police station, 60 out of 67 accused were convicted, while seven were acquitted.</p>
<p>In FIR No. 832/2023, registered at the Civil Lines police station, 107 out of 108 accused were sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment while one person received a three-year sentence. The judge acquitted 77 accused in this case, stating that the prosecution had failed to establish charges against them.</p>
<p>Former federal minister Fawad Chaudhry, MNA Zain Qureshi (son of PTI’s Shah Mehmood Qureshi), MPA Khayal Ahmad Kastro and Faizullah Kamuka were acquitted in all three FIRs.</p>
<p>The judge had issued arrest warrants for those convicted who were not present in court and had directed the police to arrest all convicts and bring them before the court for imprisonment.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928869/bangladesh-to-hold-elections-in-february-2026-yunus' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh to hold elections in February 2026: Yunus</strong></a>
            <p><p>Bangladesh will hold elections in February 2026, interim leader Muhammad Yunus said on Tuesday, the first polls since a mass uprising <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245">overthrew</a> the government last year.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the interim government, I will write a letter to the chief election commissioner requesting that the election be arranged before Ramazan in February 2026,” Yunus said in a broadcast on the one-year anniversary of the ousting of ex-prime minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>
<p>Nobel Peace Prize winner Yunus, 85, is leading the caretaker government as its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850894">chief adviser</a> until elections, and has said he will step down after the vote.</p>
<p>“We will step into the final and most important phase after delivering this speech to you, and that is the transfer of power to an elected government,” he said.</p>
<p>Yunus had earlier said elections would be held in April, but key political parties have been demanding he hold them earlier and before the month of Ramazan.</p>
<p>“I urge you all to pray for us so that we can hold a fair and smooth election, enabling all citizens to move forward successfully in building a ‘New Bangladesh’,” he added.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the government, we will extend all necessary support to ensure that the election is free, peaceful and celebratory in spirit. “</p>
<p>In an earlier address, he said: “Together, we will build a Bangladesh where tyranny will never rise again.”</p>
<p>He paid tribute to those who sacrificed their lives.</p>
<p>“Fallen autocrats and their self-serving allies remain active,” however, he added, urging unity to protect the gains of the uprising while his government holds reform talks with political parties and civil society.</p>
<p>His interim government had launched sweeping reforms, he added, while trials for those responsible for the “July killings” were progressing swiftly.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Police were on high alert throughout the capital, with armoured vehicles patrolling the streets to deter any attempt by Hasina’s banned Awami League to disrupt the day’s events.</p>
<p>“Let this anniversary not be a day of retrospection, but a rallying cry for a brighter tomorrow,” Hasina said in an open letter to the people of Bangladesh, adding that she had never resigned from her duties as prime minister.</p>
<p>“Bangladesh has overcome adversity before, and we will rise again, stronger, more united, and more determined to build a democracy that truly serves its people.”</p>
<p>The July Declaration formally recognises the 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850304">student-led uprising</a> and the shift away from authoritarian rule to democratic renewal.</p>
<p>Despite some opposition, it is backed by major political groups, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912466">Bangladesh Nationalist Party</a> (BNP), led by former premier Khaleda Zia.</p>
<p>Supporters see the charter as a foundation for institutional reform; critics have warned its impact could be largely symbolic in the absence of a legal framework or parliamentary consensus.</p></p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif termed India’s occupation of Kashmir the “defining conflict” of South Asia as Pakistan marked six years on Tuesday since New Delhi deprived the held region of its special autonomy.</p>
<p>Pakistan is observing Youm-i-Istehsal (Exploitation Day) today to mark the sixth anniversary of India revoking Kashmir’s special autonomy and to show solidarity with Kashmiris.</p>
<p>On Aug 5, 2019, India’s Narendra Modi-led government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1498227">stripped</a> the Muslim-majority territory of its special status by repealing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1763985">Article 370</a> of the constitution, splitting the former state into two territories directly ruled by New Delhi.</p>
<p>“India’s illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir remained the defining conflict of the South Asia region, and the driver of India’s continued rogue behaviour,” PM Shehbaz said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-says-kashmir-dispute-resolution-key-pillar-of-pakistans-foreign-policy-calls-for-reversing-indian-unilateral-actions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>

<p>The premier also recalled the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">India-Pakistan conflict</a>, noting: “India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">unprovoked aggression</a> against Pakistan in May 2025, and its swift and comprehensive <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">military defeat</a> are only the latest evidence of the urgent need for the international community to ensure that the resolution of the Kashmir dispute becomes a global priority.</p>
<p>“The will and aspirations of the Kashmiri people, in accordance with UN Security Council <a class="link--external" href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/111955/?ln=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resolutions</a>, are the only path forward,” he stressed.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz noted that a “just resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was a key pillar of Pakistan’s foreign policy”.</p>
<p>The prime minister reiterated “strongest condemnation” of India’s illegal and unilateral actions to alter the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898092">demographic structure</a> and political landscape of India-occupied Kashmir (IoK).</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He also flayed India’s efforts to silence genuine Kashmiri leaders as part of the “wider hegemonic and extremist agenda” that informed its illegal occupation of the disputed region.</p>
<p>“The imprisonment of Kashmiri leaders and activists, including <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1202138">Shabbir Ahmed Shah</a>, Muhammad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1869419">Yasin Malik</a> and Masarrat Alam Bhatt, will never dim the resolve of our Kashmiri sisters and brothers,” he asserted.</p>
<p>Urging the international community to play a role in halting human rights crimes in IoK and reversing the 2019 action, the premier reaffirmed Pakistan’s “unflinching” stance, moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in his statement, President Asif Ali Zardari also referred to the recent conflict with India, emphasising that “this year’s ‘Youm-e-Istehsal’ assumes greater significance”.</p>
<p>“While the resounding success of the ‘<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a>’ is a matter of great pride for the people of Pakistan, the day also underscores the need for a settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people, for a lasting peace in South Asia,” the president said.</p>

<p>He highlighted that Indian authorities had taken a number of steps, aimed at changing the IoK’s demographic structure and political landscape, during the last six years.</p>
<p>“These measures include gerrymandering of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1688423">electoral constituencies</a>, allowing addition of non-Kashmiris to electoral rolls, issuance of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1577106">domicile certificates</a> to outsiders, granting more powers to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924441/opp-calls-for-held-kashmir-governor-to-step-down">lieutenant governor</a> in administrative matters, and introduction of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home">new laws</a> on ownership of land and property,” he noted.</p>
<p>“The Kashmiri people are confronted with the danger of becoming a disempowered community in their own land. The genuine leadership of the Kashmiri people remains behind bars. The intimidation of innocent people, arbitrary detentions, and the so-called ‘cordon and search’ operations have become a matter of routine,” Zardari said.</p>
<p>To mark Youm-i-Istehsal, a rally was taken out from Parliament House to D-Chowk in Islamabad to express solidarity with Kashmiris.</p>

<p>However, he warned that Pakistan’s armed forces and its people were “fully capable of delivering a resolute response to any act of aggression, as demonstrated” during the May conflict.</p>
<p>Addressing the rally, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar noted that the bonds between Kashmiris and Pakistan were “eternal which can never be broken by any Indian conspiracy”.</p>
<p>Recalling that bodies of Kashmiri icons, such as <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1282425">Burhan Wani</a>, were wrapped in the “colour of Pakistan’s flag, which was a manifestation of Kashmiris love and affection for Pakistan”.</p>
<p>Also mentioning the India-Pakistan conflict, Tarar asserted that the “victory in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> has boosted the morale of Kashmiri masses”.</p>

<p>In its session today, the National Assembly passed a unanimous resolution, condemning “all forms of Indian state violence and coercive tactics aimed at erasing the identity, culture, and political aspirations of the Kashmiri people, which have failed and will continue to fail”.</p>

<p>The resolution stressed that the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was “not an internal matter of India but a global issue requiring a just resolution in accordance with UNSC resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people”.</p>
<p>It called upon the global community to “stand for justice, not silence, in the face of Indian oppression and human rights abuses” in IoK.  The NA declared that “from Srinagar to Islamabad, the heart beats as one for the freedom and dignity of Kashmir”, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> added.</p>
<p>The NA affirmed that Pakistan’s moral, political and diplomatic support for the Kashmiri people remained “unshakable and enduring”, and committed to continue raising the Kashmir issue at every regional and international forum.</p>
<p>The House demanded the immediate implementation of all relevant UNSC resolutions, which call for a free and impartial plebiscite.</p>

<p>“India’s repressive actions, coupled with its belligerent posture and incendiary rhetoric, serve only to exacerbate regional instability and perpetuate human suffering,” the ISPR noted.</p>

<p>It added: “The armed forces of Pakistan fully support the legitimate and ongoing struggle of the Kashmiri people for their inalienable right to self-determination, as enshrined in international law and UN Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p>“The continued illegal occupation of IIOJK by Indian security forces — characterised by an unrelenting military siege, systemic human rights violations, and demographic engineering — constitutes a grave breach of international norms and remains a matter of deep concern.</p>
<p>The armed forces “pay solemn tribute to the martyrs of IIOJK and reiterate their enduring commitment to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Kashmiri people in their just and rightful struggle for freedom”.</p>

<p>Separately, court officials said today that India’s top court will hear a plea for the restoration of Kashmir’s federal statehood later this week.</p>
<p>The hearing, scheduled for August 8 in the Supreme Court, follows an application filed by two residents.</p>
<p>The removal of Article 370 of the constitution, which enshrined the region’s special status, was challenged by Kashmir’s pro-India political parties, the local Bar Association and individual litigants.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court in December 2023 upheld removing the region’s autonomy but called for Jammu and Kashmir to be restored to statehood and put on a par with any other Indian federal state “at the earliest and as soon as possible”.</p>
<p>“We have moved an application seeking a definitive timeline for the restoration of statehood,” said the petitioners’ lawyer, Soayib Qureshi.</p>
<p>“It has been quite some time since the court asked for it and elections have also been successfully held.”</p>
<p>Last November, the territory elected its first government since it was brought under New Delhi’s direct control, as voters backed opposition parties to lead its regional assembly.</p>
<p>But the local government has limited powers and the territory continues to be, for all practical purposes, governed by a New Delhi-appointed administrator.</p>
<p>Indian security forces were deployed in force in the Himalayan territory today, eyeing protests demanding the restoration of its special status.</p></p>
