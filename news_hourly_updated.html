                <h2>US makes deal to tap Pakistan‚Äôs oil reserves</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p><strong>‚Ä¢ Details remain sketchy despite Trump announcement; no word on tariff rate as Aurangzeb meets key officials<br />
‚Ä¢ India slapped with 25pc tariff, punished for buying Russian arms, oil through ‚Äòsecondary tariffs‚Äô<br />
‚Ä¢ Six Indian companies face State Dept sanctions for being part of Iran oil, petrochemical trade</strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that the US has concluded a deal with Pakistan that will allow the two allies to work together on developing Pakistan‚Äôs vast oil reserves.</p>
<p>The announcement, <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114943927434273211" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on his Truth Social account, did not specify whether the two countries have also reached an agreement on tariffs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have just concluded a Deal with the Country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive Oil Reserves,‚Äù Trump wrote.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are in the process of choosing the Oil Company that will lead this Partnership. Who knows, maybe they‚Äôll be selling Oil to India some day!‚Äù</p>
<p>Although Pakistan has long claimed to have large oil deposits along its coast, this marks the first high-level move towards tapping them.</p>
<p>The reference to India was also particularly poignant, as the US president earlier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927587/trump-says-india-to-pay-25pc-tariff-from-aug-1-with-additional-penalty-for-russian-energy-purchases">slapped</a> the country with a 25 per cent tariff on imports, mainly as a punishment for acquiring oil and military equipment from Russia.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLikewise, other Countries are making offers for a Tariff reduction. All of this will help reduce our Trade Deficit in a very major way,‚Äù he wrote, adding: ‚ÄúA full report will be released at the appropriate time.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a separate part of his post, Trump mentioned South Korea to illustrate the ongoing tariff discussions, in a way that could also be seen as inviting further offers from countries like Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSouth Korea is right now at a 25% Tariff, but they have an offer to buy down those Tariffs. I will be interested in hearing what that offer is.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pakistani officials have previously offered to reduce the country‚Äôs $3 billion trade deficit with the United States by increasing imports of US goods, including oil, rather than accepting higher tariffs.</p>
<p><strong>Aurangzeb holds talks</strong></p>
<p>Finance Minister Mohammad Aurangzeb, who is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927252/aurangzeb-to-arrive-in-us-for-final-round-of-tariff-talks">currently</a> in Washington for what officials describe as final-stage <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922229/pakistan-us-reach-accord-on-trade-and-tariffs">negotiations</a> on a tariff deal, also began meetings with senior US officials on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Pakistani delegation is keeping the details of the talks under wraps, but one official said, ‚ÄúWe hope to sign a deal before the (Aug 1) deadline expires.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe hope to conclude a mutually beneficial trade agreement‚Ä¶ hopefully in days, not in weeks,‚Äù said Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar during a recent event at the Atlantic Council in Washington.</p>
<p>Mr Dar, who was recently in New York to address the United Nations, said a committee had been formed to finalise the terms of the proposed deal.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs long as we are better than or equal to our peers, we should be fine,‚Äù Mr Dar said.</p>
<p>While the exact tariff rate being negotiated for Pakistan has not been publicly disclosed, Pakistani officials have said they‚Äôre seeking terms on a par with other recent US trade agreements ‚Äî particularly those with Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, where tariffs are reportedly set between 15pc and 20pc.</p>
<p><strong>Trump ‚Äòpunishes‚Äô India</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the 25pc tariffs, Trump also slapped an unspecified additional penalty on India for acquiring military equipment and oil from Russia, starting Aug 1.</p>
<p>However, he later said the US was currently negotiating a deal with India. ‚ÄúThey have one of the highest tariffs in the world now, they‚Äôre willing to cut it very substantially. But we‚Äôll see what happens,‚Äù Mr Trump told reporters.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>In a strongly worded <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114942106248731470" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on the social media platform Truth Social, Mr Trump accused India of imposing excessively high tariffs and maintaining some of the world‚Äôs most ‚Äústrenuous and obnoxious non-monetary trade barriers‚Äù. He also criticised New Delhi‚Äôs continued reliance on Russian arms and energy purchases.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia will therefore be paying a tariff of 25pc, plus a penalty for the above, starting on August 1,‚Äù Mr Trump wrote. ‚ÄúWhile India is our friend, we have done relatively little business with them because of their trade practices.‚Äù</p>
<p>The US president made it clear that no further extensions would be given to countries that failed to reach a deal by the end-of-week deadline.</p>
<p>The imposition of a penalty tariff on India for its purchases of Russian oil, if enacted, would be the first use of what Mr Trump has taken to calling ‚Äúsecondary tariffs‚Äù, a kind of penalty that would be imposed instead of the financial sanctions typically used against countries that do business with embargoed nations, according to <em>The New York Times.</em></p>
<p>In response, the Indian government said in a statement that it was studying the implications of Mr Trump‚Äôs announcements and remained dedicated to securing a fair trade deal with the US.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia and the US have been engaged in negotiations on concluding a fair, balanced and mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement over the last few months. We remain committed to that objective,‚Äù it said, according to <em>Reuters.</em></p>
<p>The news pushed the Indian rupee down 0.4pc to around 87.80 against the US dollar in the non-deliverable forwards market, from its close at 87.42 during market hours. Gift Nifty futures were trading at 24,692 points, down 0.6pc.</p>
<p><strong>Sanctions on six Indian firms</strong></p>
<p>Separately, the State Department announced sanctions against six Indian firms for ‚Äúengaging in Iranian petroleum, petroleum products, or petrochemical trade‚Äù.</p>
<p>The sanctioned entities include:</p>
<p>Kanchan Polymers, which ‚Äúimported and purchased over $1.3M worth of Iranian-origin petrochemical products‚Äù.</p>
<p>Alchemical Solutions, which imported and purchased Iranian-origin petrochemical products valued at over $84m.</p>
<p>Ramniklal, a petrochemical company that imported and purchased Iranian-origin products valued at over $22m.</p>
<p>Jupiter Dye Chem, which imported and purchased Iranian-origin petrochemical products valued at over $49m.</p>
<p>Global Industrial, which imported and purchased products, including methanol, valued at over $51m.</p>
<p>Persistent Petrochem Private Limited, which imported approximately $14m worth of shipments.</p>
<p>In addition, it also placed sanctions on a number of China and UAE-based companies and several oil tankers.</p>

                <h2>Digital proceeds tax to not apply on foreign goods and services ordered online: FBR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has said the digital proceeds tax on digitally ordered goods and services supplied from outside Pakistan will no longer apply with retrospective effect from July 1.</p>
<p>Last month, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916435">introduced</a> new taxes on local and foreign e-commerce marketplaces, which made online shopping costlier for Pakistani customers. The government has also introduced new taxes on goods purchased online from outside Pakistan through the Digital Presence Proceeds Tax Act, 2025.</p>
<p>A notification issued by the FBR on Wednesday, and seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, said: ‚ÄúThe Digital Presence Proceed Tax shall not apply to digitally ordered goods and services supplied from outside Pakistan, by any person, which are chargeable to tax under the said act.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Digital Presence Proceeds Tax Act, 2025, had targeted online marketplaces that sell to Pakistani customers but have little to no physical presence in the country.</p>
<p>Under section 3 of the proposed law, every foreign vendor with a ‚Äúsignificant digital presence in Pakistan‚Äù would have been charged a tax on goods sold online from outside Pakistan.</p>
<p>Typically, these vendors include online marketplaces such as AliExpress, Temu, and Amazon, among others.</p>
<p>Under the proposed law, customers would have been charged five per cent of the amount paid to the vendor for the purchase of goods from a foreign marketplace.</p>
<p>The tax would have been collected by banks, financial institutions, or payment gateways that facilitate transactions between customers and the online marketplace.</p>
<p>Customs were empowered to ensure that goods purchased online from foreign marketplaces were not delivered to customers unless the courier companies provided evidence of tax payment.</p></p>
