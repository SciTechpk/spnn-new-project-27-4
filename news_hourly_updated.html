<p>The latest fatalities in Israel, reported by Israel‚Äôs national emergency services, raised the death toll to 23 since Friday.</p>
<p>Israeli attacks in Iran have killed at least 224 people so far, including 70 women and children, while over 1,200 have been injured, the health ministry was quoted as saying earlier today by <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/at-least-224-killed-over-1-000-wounded-in-israeli-strikes-on-iran-health-ministry/3599882" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anadolu Agency</a></em>.</p>
<p>More than 90 per cent of the wounded were civilians, including women and children, health ministry official Hossein Kermanpour <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/HKermanpour/status/1934331936912326671" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X.</p>
<p>At least 100 more were wounded in Israel in the overnight blitz, part of a wave of attacks by Tehran in retaliation for Israel‚Äôs strikes targeting the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of sworn enemy Iran.</p>
<p>Search and location operations were underway in the coastal city of Haifa, where around 30 people were wounded, emergency authorities said, as dozens of first responders rushed to the strike zones.</p>
<p>Fires were seen burning at a power plant near the port, the media reported. Video footage showed several missiles over Tel Aviv and explosions could be heard there and over Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Israel‚Äôs military warned of a new missile salvo incoming from Iran. ‚ÄúA short while ago, the IDF identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the State of Israel,‚Äù the army posted on Telegram, using the acronym for its official name.</p>
<p>It said its air defences were working to intercept the threat but advised people to ‚Äúenter a protected space and remain there until further notice‚Äù.</p>
<p>Several residential buildings in a densely populated neighbourhood of Tel Aviv were destroyed in a strike that blew out the windows of hotels and other nearby homes just a few hundred meters from the US Embassy branch in the city.</p>
<p>The US ambassador to Israel said the building sustained minor damage, but there were no injuries to personnel.</p>
<p>British maritime security firm Ambrey said that fires were observed at the power plant in the vicinity of Israel‚Äôs Haifa port, <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>

<p>Ambrey said it observed video footage of the Israeli military intercepting the attack, followed by impacts from two hypersonic missiles.</p>

<p>Israel‚Äôs public broadcaster <em>Kan</em> reported that at least four areas were hit in the latest Iranian attacks on central Israel.</p>
<p>The predawn missiles also struck near Shuk HaCarmel, a popular market in Tel Aviv that typically draws large crowds of residents and tourists buying fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as popular bars and restaurants.</p>
<p>A residential street in nearby Petah Tikva and a school in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish city of Bnei Brak were also hit.</p>

<p>Iran does not intend to develop nuclear weapons but will pursue its right to nuclear energy and research, President Masoud Pezeshkian said today, reiterating Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1700780">religious edict</a> against weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>Iran had claimed the existence of the fatwa for years before making the text public for the first time in 2010, when it was being accused by the West and Israel of seeking to secretly acquire the atomic bomb</p>
<p>While asserting that Iran remains opposed to developing weapons of mass destruction, Esmaeil Baghaei, Iran‚Äôs foreign ministry spokesperson, said the Iranian parliament is preparing a bill to leave the nuclear <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1479334">Non-Proliferation Treaty</a> (NPT).</p>
<p>The Iranian president, speaking during a parliamentary session on Monday, also called for unity and solidarity ‚Äúmore than ever‚Äù against the Israeli aggression, <em>Press TV</em> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe enemy cannot remove us or our nation from the scene through violence, killings, and assassinations,‚Äù Pezeshkian said</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor every hero who falls, hundreds more will rise to carry the flag and stand against the oppression, injustice, crimes, and betrayal committed by these aggressors,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian asserted that Iran had the right to benefit from nuclear energy and research that served the nation‚Äôs interests, adding that no one had the right to deny this right.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have extended a hand of brotherhood to all Islamic nations ‚Äî for they are all our brothers. Today, most, if not all, of them stand with us and by our side,‚Äù he further said.</p>
<p>The president said the US violated international norms by ‚Äúallowing‚Äù Israel to attack Iran, stressing that Iran never sought war or initiated it.</p>
<p>On the slain nuclear researchers killed in Israel‚Äôs attacks, Pezeshkian asked: ‚ÄúWhat crime did a scientist commit to deserve being murdered, along with his family, by someone from the other side of the world?‚Äù</p>

<p>General Mohammad Kazemi, the intelligence chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), his deputy Gen Hassan Mohaqqeq, and Gen Mohsen Baqeri were among those killed in Israel‚Äôs attacks on Sunday, the IRGC <a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/06/16/3336218/irgc-intelligence-officials-martyred-in-israeli-attack" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said earlier today that it was striking surface-to-surface missile sites in central Iran, adding it was ‚Äúoperating against this threat in our skies and in Iranian skies‚Äù.</p>
<p>Israel has claimed strikes as far away as Iran‚Äôs holy city of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1835205">Mashhad</a> in the far east, 2,300 kilometres from Israel.</p>
<p>Iranian state television reported that at least five people were killed on Sunday by an Israeli strike that hit a residential building in downtown Iran.</p>
<p>Colonel Reza Sayyad, a spokesman for Iran‚Äôs armed forces, threatened a ‚Äúdevastating response‚Äù to Israel‚Äôs attacks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLeave the occupied territories (Israel) because they will certainly no longer be habitable in the future,‚Äù he warned in a televised address, adding shelters will ‚Äúnot guarantee security‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to <em>AFP</em>, residential areas in both countries have suffered deadly strikes since the hostilities broke out, with Israel‚Äôs Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slamming Iran on Sunday for allegedly targeting civilians.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIran will pay a very heavy price for the premeditated murder of civilians, women and children,‚Äù he said, during a visit to the site of a missile strike on a residential building in the coastal city of Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>His remarks came hours after Iranian missile fire killed another 10 people yesterday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a likely Iranian drone killed a woman in Syria, a Britain-based war monitor said, in what would be the first death on Syrian soil since the current hostilities between Iran and Israel began, reported <em>AFP.</em></p>
<p>The drone struck the woman‚Äôs home in western Tartus province, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p>
<p>Iran has executed a man who was found guilty of spying for Israel‚Äôs intelligence agency Mossad, the semi-official <em>Fars</em> news agency reported today, identifying the man as Esmail Fekri.</p>
<p>The execution is the <a class="link--external" href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-hanging-israel-mossad-spy-90089362075772025a0e0da5ee763be0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">third</a> in recent <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/30/iran-hangs-man-accused-of-spying-for-israel-mossad" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">weeks</a> related to the conduct of espionage on behalf of Israel.</p>
<p>Iranian media, including <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1404/03/25/3335833/%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%DB%8C-2-%D8%B9%D8%B6%D9%88-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%AC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tasnim</a></em>, reported on Sunday that police had arrested two suspects over alleged links to Israel‚Äôs Mossad spy agency. Israel, in turn, said it had taken two individuals into custody over alleged links to Iranian intelligence.</p>

<p>In Iran, a heavy cloud of smoke hung above Tehran after Israeli aircraft struck two fuel depots. Local media also reported an Israeli strike on the police headquarters in the city centre.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt been able to sleep since Friday because of the terrible noise,‚Äù said a Tehran resident who gave her name as Farzaneh.</p>
<p>‚ÄúToday, they hit a house in our alley, and we were very scared. So we decided to leave Tehran and head to the north of the country.‚Äù</p>
<p>Some, however, were determined to stay.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is natural that war has its own stress, but I will not leave my city,‚Äù 31-year-old Shokouh Razzazi told <em>AFP.</em></p>
<p><em>AFP</em> images from Israel‚Äôs Haifa, meanwhile, also showed a column of smoke rising on Sunday evening following an Iranian missile barrage.</p>

<p>Asked whether <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917243">regime change</a> in Iran was one of the objectives of Israel‚Äôs strikes, Netanyahu said that ‚Äúit certainly could be the result, because the Iran regime is very weak‚Äù.</p>
<p>In the same interview, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/netanyahu-trump-iran-fox-news-b2770483.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Independent</a></em> reported, Netanyahu claimed that Iran attempted to assassinate Trump twice ‚Äúthrough proxies‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThrough their intel, yes; they want to kill him,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs enemy number one,‚Äù the Israeli premier said, referring to the US president.</p>
<p>Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20shifting%20stance%20around%20the%20Israeli%20strikes%2C%20which%20he%20called%20%E2%80%9Cexcellent%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9Cvery%20successful%E2%80%9D%20in%20a%20series%20of%20media%20interviews%20on%20Friday">lauded Israel‚Äôs offensive</a> but said Washington had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917285#:~:text=Trump%20distances%20US%20from%20strikes%20on%20Iran%2C%20warns%20against%20attacks%20on%20it%20in%20%E2%80%98any%20way%E2%80%99">nothing to do</a> with it, while threatening to unleash ‚Äúthe full strength and might‚Äù of the US military if Iran attacked American interests.</p>
<p>However, seemingly contradicting his ally, Netanyahu claimed that American pilots were shooting down drones headed towards Israel. In the same interview, he also said that he and Trump were ‚Äúfully coordinated‚Äù.</p>
<p>Trump has urged the two foes to ‚Äúmake a deal‚Äù, adding, however, that ‚Äúsometimes they have to <a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-israel-iran-have-fight-out-believes-deal-possible" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fight it out</a>‚Äù first.</p>
<p>He <a class="link--external" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-us-gets-involved-israel-iran-conflict/story?id=122865561" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>ABC News</em></a> on Sunday that he would be ‚Äúopen‚Äù to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, being a mediator. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible we could get involved‚Äù in the ongoing battle in the Middle East, he said.</p>
<p>Two US officials said on Friday that the US military had helped shoot down Iranian missiles that were headed toward Israel, according to <em>Reuters</em>. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/after-sitting-out-the-iran-attack-u-s-steps-in-to-help-israel-intercept-missiles-16749866" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> the same.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi maintained Tehran had ‚Äúsolid proof‚Äù that US forces had supported Israel in its attacks.</p>
<p>He also told a meeting of foreign diplomats that Iran‚Äôs actions were a ‚Äúresponse to aggression‚Äù. ‚ÄúIf the aggression stops, naturally our responses will also stop,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Iran scrapped <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">planned</a> nuclear <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903561">talks</a> with the United States, saying it was ‚Äúmeaningless‚Äù to negotiate while under fire.</p></p>

                <h2>Air India Dreamliner returns safely to Hong Kong after technical issue mid-air</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>An Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner plane bound for New Delhi returned to its origin of Hong Kong as a precautionary measure on Monday, after the pilot suspected a technical issue mid-air, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>The incident comes days after an Air India flight to London, using the same type of Boeing aircraft, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916728/air-india-flight-with-242-onboard-crashes-near-ahmedabad-airport">crashed</a> in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad moments after take-off, killing 241 of the 242 people on board.</p>
<p>The Dreamliner aircraft flying Air India flight AI315 out of Hong Kong on Monday is now undergoing checks, said the source.</p>
<p>AI315 made a return to Hong Kong International Airport and requested local standby at around 1pm, then ‚Äúlanded safely at around 1:15pm‚Äù, the spokesperson of Airport Authority Hong Kong said.</p>
<p>The airport operations were not affected, the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>Flight AI315 took off from Hong Kong at around 12:20pm and landed just around an hour later.</p>
<p>It reached an altitude of 22,000 feet and then started descending, according to flight tracking website <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.airnavradar.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AirNav Radar</a></em>. The plane was seven years old.</p>
<p>Boeing and Air India did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Hong Kong-New Delhi flight.</p>
<p>Last week‚Äôs crash brings a new <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917141">challenge</a> for both Air India, which has for years been trying to revamp its fleet, and Boeing, which is trying to rebuild public trust following a series of safety and production crises.</p></p>
