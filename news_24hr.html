            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916533/jaishankars-bellicose-punchlines-show-indias-sheer-frustration-after-failed-military-misadventure-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Jaishankar’s bellicose punchlines show India’s sheer frustration after failed military misadventure: FO</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Wednesday slammed remarks by India’s Minister for External Affairs Subhramanyam Jaishankar regarding how India had the “right to strike Pakistan”, stating that New Delhi’s “bellicose punchlines” showed its “sheer frustration following an unsuccessful military adventure”.</p>
<p>The Indian minister’s comments come in the wake of a four-day military conflict between the nuclear powers last month.</p>
<p><a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/DrSJaishankar/status/1932319075566305578?t=KtjaHYvaq8HFBzffJ29Pkw&amp;s=19" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Speaking</a> in Brussels on Tuesday, Jaishankar said when India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi maintained that ‘Operation Sindoor’ was not over, it was a clear message that “we reserve the right to go after terrorists anytime, anywhere if they have done harm to us”.</p>
<p>According to the FO statement, Pakistan rejected Jaishankar’s comments, stating that top diplomats should aim to promote peace and harmony rather than producing “bellicose punchlines”. Criticising his conduct, the FO said the tone and tenor of a foreign minister “should be commensurate with his dignified status”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The FO further said: “For the last several years, India has been engaged in a malicious campaign to mislead the international community through a fictitious narrative of victimhood.</p>
<p>“However, India’s continued anti-Pakistan diatribe cannot hide its sponsorship of terrorism beyond its borders, nor can it cover up the state-sanctioned oppression in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.”</p>
<p>It added that instead of pointing fingers at others, India should “introspect on its own involvement in terrorism, subversion and targeted assassinations.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911376">Reiterating</a> that Pakistan believed in peaceful coexistence, the FO urged India to “stop concocting narratives” to justify its aggressive actions in the wake of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>“The narrative emerging from India betrays sheer frustration, following an unsuccessful military adventure against Pakistan,” the FO said. “Indian leaders would be well-advised to improve the standard of their discourse and discard their obsession with Pakistan.”</p>
<p>The FO stated that while Pakistan pursued peace, it would defend its sovereignty against aggression such as that by India last month.</p>
<p>“History will judge not by who shouted the loudest, but by who acted the wisest,” the statement concluded.</p>

<p>A day prior, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916324/india-a-belligerent-power-spinning-out-of-control-says-sherry-rehman-on-jaishankars-remarks">termed</a> India a “belligerent power spinning out of control” in response to Jaishankar’s remarks.</p>
<p>“Pakistan cannot be responsible for every attack in India, which is home to a dozen insurgencies,” she said, adding that “no lessons seem to have been learnt from the encounter with Pakistan, and no evidence provided”.</p>
<p>Pakistan and India have been at odds since the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which saw the killing of 26 tourists. New Delhi, without any evidence, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">blamed</a> Islamabad for the attack, while the latter strongly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">denied</a> the claims and offered a neutral probe. The two nations then fought a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">four-day conflict</a> before the US brokered a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> on May 10.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Pakis­tan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">launched</a> a broad-based engagement campaign to present its perspective on the recent conflict with India to the world and counter New Delhi’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">unproven</a> allegations. As part of its global outreach, a delegation — including Rehman — has visited the United States, is currently in London and will also head to Brussels.</p></p>

            <p><p>Punjab Prosecutor General Syed Farhad Ali Shah on Wednesday took notice of the Hafizabad gang-rape incident and declared it a “high-profile” case for the police to pursue.</p>
<p>Last week, Hafizabad police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915209">launched</a> raids to arrest eight suspects who allegedly abducted a couple in Hafizabad and subjected them to physical and sexual assault.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>A first information report (FIR) filed by the husband at the Kasoki Police Station said that the incident occurred on April 25 when the complainant and his wife were on a motorcycle and they stopped for a bit. As the wife got off the motorcycle, a man came towards them who verbally abused and hit her, it stated.</p>
<p>A group of armed men later arrived and took the couple to a secluded place near a graveyard, the FIR said, detailing how the couple were subjected to physical violence, sexual assault, and robbery.</p>
<p>According to a press release issued by the prosecutor general’s office today, the prosecutor general declared the case as “high-profile”,  summoning the investigating officer (IO) along with the record under Section (3)10C of the Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service Act, 2006.</p>
<p>The IO appeared with the record and briefed the Punjab government official regarding the investigation, it said.</p>
<p>“The prosecutor general of Punjab issued a line of inquiry and instructed the IO to complete the investigation on merit,” the press release added.</p>
<p>Shah was quoted as saying that, according to the vision of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, it was the responsibility of the state to protect the honour and dignity of women.</p>
<p>“The state will use all its resources to bring the culprits to justice,” he added.</p>
<p>On June 5, one of the four suspects involved in the incident was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915672">allegedly killed</a> in the firing by his own accomplices during an “encounter” with a Crime Control Department (CCD) team near Jorian bridge in Kassoki police precincts, Hafizabad district.</p>
<p>Sources in the CCD said the police had been informed about the presence of the suspects, upon which a team conducted a raid on a premises near Jorrian bridge along an open drain. On seeing the police party, the armed men had opened fire, which was returned by the policemen.</p>
<p>The sources had said that when the firing stopped, the police had found a body which was identified as that of one of the four gang-rape suspects. The sources claimed the suspect was killed in his accomplices’ firing.</p>
<p>They said that the remaining suspects had managed to flee the scene.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Investigation into the incident had taken a new turn a day later when two policemen were arrested for freeing an alleged rapist after taking bribe a few days after the April 25 incident.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Federal Investigation Agency had placed the names of two of the four alleged rapists on the Provisional National Identification List following reports that they were trying to escape abroad.</p>
<p>The list is maintained by the agency to prevent the travel or escape of individuals involved in “heinous crimes”.</p>
<p>Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1761373">death penalty</a> or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899694/two-arrested-for-kidnap-gang-rape-of-minor-girl-in-bahawalnagar">prevail</a> in the country.</p>
<p>In March, Punjab police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900045">arrested</a> three suspects for allegedly gang-raping a woman in Lahore.</p></p>

            <p><p>United States Central Command (Centcom) commander Army General Michael Kurilla on Wednesday praised Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner in the world of counter-terrorism”, citing the nation’s struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K).</p>
<p>Pakistan and the US reaffirmed the continuation of counter-terrorism cooperation during a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1833287">dialogue</a> in Washington on May 10. The dialogue underscored the cooperation between the two countries in addressing the most pressing challenges to regional and global security, including the threats posed by terrorist outfits such as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and IS-K.</p>
<p>The two nations are slated to have another counter-terrorism <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900767">dialogue</a> this month.</p>
<p>During a House Armed Services Committee hearing in Washington on Tuesday, the general was asked about the situation on the Afghan border with Pakistan, where he outlined that Pakistan has apprehended several “high-value” IS-K operatives.</p>

<p>Hailing a “phenomenal partnership” with Islamabad, Gen Kurilla highlighted that Pakistan has “gone after ISIS Khorasan (IS-K) killing dozens of them.”</p>
<p>“Through a relationship we have with them and providing intelligence, they have captured at least five ISIS Khorasan high-value individuals,” Kurilla said.</p>
<p>“They have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895923/trump-hails-pakistans-help-in-arresting-is-terrorist-behind-2021-kabul-airport-bombing">extradited</a> back Jaffar, who was one of the key individuals behind the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1642871">Abbey Gate bombing</a>,” he added, referring to IS-K operative Mohammad Sharifullah, an Afghan national who was arrested by Pakistan earlier this year.</p>
<p>Gen Kurilla added that he received a call from Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir after Sharifullah’s arrest, recounting, “He said ‘I’ve caught him, I’m willing to extradite him back to the United States, please tell the secretary of defence and the president’.</p>

<p>“We’re seeing Pakistan — with limited intelligence that we provided them — go after them using their means to do that and we’re seeing an effect on ISIS Khorasan,” he emphasised.</p>
<p>Gen Kurilla noted that there have been 1,000 terrorist attacks in “the western area” of Pakistan since the start of 2024, noting that they “are in an active counter-terrorism fight right now”.</p>
<p>“They have been a phenomenal partner in the counter-terrorism world,” the Centcom chief added.</p>
<p>Continuing his testimony, Gen Kurilla stated that the US needs to maintain ties with both Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>“We have to have a relationship with Pakistan and with India. I don’t believe it’s a binary switch that we can’t have one with Pakistan if we have one with India,” he argued. “We should look at the merits of the relationship for the positives that it has.”</p>
<p>In April, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the pair’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902727">first phone call</a>, where America’s top diplomat expressed interest in deepening cooperation in a variety of sectors, including counter-terrorism.</p>
<p>“During the call, DPM (Deputy Prime Minister)/FM Dar reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening its partnership with the United States,” the Foreign Office said in a statement.</p>
<p>“According to the statement, Dar highlighted Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts between 2013 and 2018, with Rubio appreciating Pakistan’s fight against terrorism and expressing the US’s “desire to further enhance counterterrorism cooperation”.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895923">address</a> to the US Congress in March, US President Donald Trump spoke about Sharifullah, praising Pakistan for the arrest.</p>
<p>“Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,” the US president told Congress. “I want to thank especially the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Florence in Italy could hit 39C as hot weather sweeps continent, while parts of South Africa brace for snow</p><p>The severe thunderstorms that have been lashing parts of Europe over recent days are expected to give way to high temperatures this week. Several regions could climb to 10C (50F) above seasonal norms, with Italy braced for the full force of the heat. Florence in Tuscany is forecast to soar to a sweltering 39C on Thursday and across the weekend.</p><p>Germany, France and Belgium will also face hot weather from Wednesday, with widespread highs at least 9C above the June average. Many other parts of Europe are forecast to experience temperatures 5-7C above normal. This is the result of a high-pressure system creating a heat dome over the region, whereby sinking air compresses and warms as it descends, trapping heat near the surface.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/09/weather-tracker-storms-summer-heat-europe-south-africa">Continue reading...</a></p>
