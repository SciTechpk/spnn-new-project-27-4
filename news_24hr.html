            <p><p>Pakistan’s envoy to the United States has asked President Donald Trump to step in and help ease soaring tensions with neighbouring India in the wake of a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir, according to an <a class="link--external" href="https://www.newsweek.com/exclusive-pakistan-calls-trump-help-prevent-nuclear-war-india-2066116" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exclusive report</a> by <em>Newsweek</em>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">civilian</a> and military leadership have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">rejected</a> the accusation and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> and India’s premier granting “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>” to his military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an incursion from India within the next 24-36 hours, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension">diplomatic channels</a> from other countries have been engaged to prevent a possible military confrontation.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh told <em>Newsweek</em> yesterday that for a president “standing for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration” — referring to Trump — there was no “higher or flashier flashpoint” than the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>“If we have a president who is standing for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration, to establish a legacy as a peacemaker — or as someone who finished wars, defied wars and played a role in de-confliction, resolving the disputes — I don’t think there is any higher or flashier flash point, particularly in nuclear terms, as Kashmir,” Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855847">Rizwan Saeed Sheikh</a> told <em>Newsweek</em>.</p>
<p>“We are not talking about one or two countries in that neighbourhood who <em>[sic]</em> are nuclear-capable. So, that is how grave it is,” he said in an interview with the US magazine.</p>
<p>According to <em>Newsweek</em>, Sheikh contended that the Trump administration would need to pursue a more comprehensive and sustained initiative than in past US attempts to defuse crises that have erupted between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>“I think with this threat that we are facing, there is a latent opportunity to address the situation by not just [focusing] on an immediate de-escalatory measure, or a de-escalatory approach,” the envoy said.</p>
<p>He called for a more durable and lasting solution to the Kashmir dispute, “rather than allowing the situation to stay precarious and pop up again and again at the next drop of a hat on this side or that side”.</p>
<p>During his interview, Sheikh emphasised that the Kashmir issue was the root cause of all troubles between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>“Until and unless that final settlement is made and the resolutions dictate the prescribed solution is allowed to play out, we will all keep having these problems,” Sheikh said. “That’s why we insist on the United States and others playing a role in this situation and getting the de-confliction part activated,” he added.</p>
<p>If the long-standing dispute was resolved, the ambassador said, the population of South Asia could live in peace. “All the other issues between Pakistan and India are not major issues,” he noted.</p>
<p>“We do not want to fight, particularly with a bigger country,” Sheikh said. “We want peace. It suits our economic agenda; it suits our nationhood. It suits every objective that we have currently. But we want peace with dignity.</p>
<p>“We would not want to do it, but if it is imposed, then we would rather die with dignity than survive with indignity,” Sheikh asserted.</p>
<p>The call for Trump to play a role in reducing the tensions came the same day as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was expected to speak to top Pakistani and Indian leaders.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>In his phone call with Rubio yesterday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif urged the US to press India to “dial down the rhetoric and act responsibly”.</p>
<p>In a readout of the call with PM Shehbaz, issued by the US State Department, Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said: “Both leaders reaffirmed their continued commitment to holding terrorists accountable for their heinous acts of violence.”</p>
<p>“The secretary (Rubio) urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in investigating this unconscionable attack. He also encouraged Pakistan to work with India to de-escalate tensions, re-establish direct communications, and maintain peace and security in South Asia,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile conversation with India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Rubio “encouraged India to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia”.</p>

<p>Sheikh, reiterating Pakistan’s stance, rejected any involvement of his country in the Pahalgam attack, arguing that the fallout of such an operation could only serve to harm rather than benefit Pakistan’s interests.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is focusing on a matter of a deliberate, considered, pronounced shift of our foreign policy, a pivot from geopolitics to geoeconomics,” the envoy told <em>Newsweek</em>.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“We are focused on the geoeconomics side of our geography and our foreign policy. We are currently economically ascendant,” the official said, stressing that Pakistan only needed a “peaceful neighbourhood” in terms of the broader region.</p>
<p>Terming it “so outlandish, so far-fetched, to blame Pakistan” for the Pahalgam attack, Sheikh said Islamabad was awaiting evidence from New Delhi to prove a link between the incident and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Moreover, the envoy said the attack could be a “false flag operation” conducted to intentionally lay the blame on Pakistan. He acknowledged he could not yet back up the claim, but there was “enough circumstantial evidence, history, […] immediate backdrop and setting […] to entertain that possibility.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Indian Embassy in Washington <a class="link--external" href="https://www.newsweek.com/indian-embassy-terrorists-behind-attack-will-brought-justice-2066403" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Newsweek</em></a> in a statement: “The terrorists behind the attack will be brought to justice.” It termed Sheikh’s remarks a “crude attempt to rewrite history and gloss over facts”.</p>

<p>Separately, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> shared a video showcasing the Pakistan Air Force’s (PAF) military prowess and capabilities, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1861418">JF-17 Block III</a> that other countries have also bought from Pakistan.</p>
<p>“PAF remains steadfast to defend [the] aerial frontiers of Pakistan,” the video captions said.</p>
<p><em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported that the PAF “fully prepared and determined to deliver a crushing response to any aggression”.</p>
<p>Noting that the PAF was equipped with the latest fighter jets, the report said the air force had “always fulfilled its professional responsibilities with utmost efficiency and dedication for the integrity of Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“The PAF is renowned worldwide for its technical expertise and courageous reputation,” it added.</p>

            <p><p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday reaffirmed the government’s commitment to the welfare and uplift of workers, state-media <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/01-05-2025/intl-labour-day-being-observed-today" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>As the world commemorated International Labour Day, the president and the premier issued separate messages to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>According to the <a class="link--external" href="https://normlex.ilo.org/dyn/nrmlx_en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:11210:0::NO::P11210_COUNTRY_ID:103166" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Labourers Organisation (ILO)</a>, Pakistan has yet to ratify 55 conventions and protocols. While labour laws <a class="link--external" href="https://www.riaabarkergillette.com/usa/wp-content/uploads/Labour-law-in-Pakistan.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exist</a> but enforcement is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881963">weak</a>, and despite government promises to create millions of jobs, issues like low pay, lack of social protection, and poor representation remain unresolved.</p>
<p>President Zardari paid tribute to the men and women labourers in the country and highlighted their struggles around the world, according to state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1917782980673823022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pakistan Television</a> (PTV)</em>.</p>

<p>In his statement, he said: “We reiterate our commitment to workers’ autonomy, fair wages, a safe environment and social security. Workers and the working class are the driving force of our economy and national development.”</p>
<p>He highlighted the role of workers “in building our infrastructure, developing industries, agriculture, and the economy”.</p>
<p>He added: “Our workers are our pride. Our national development is due to the hard work and character of workers. In a rapidly changing world, we must focus on skilling our youth and workers for a bright future. We need to equip our workers and youth with modern skills.”</p>

<p>The president also stressed the need to create a comprehensive system for the skill development of workers.</p>
<p>“We will have to work to create a fair labor environment and for the welfare of workers. Let’s promote meaningful policies, inclusive development, and a culture in the country where the role of every worker is respected,” he added.</p>

<p>“Our hardworking workforce is the driving force behind our nation’s progress and our resilience,” he said.</p>
<p>“The protection of fundamental rights of workers is enshrined in the Constitution of Pakistan and is fully consistent with the core conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), to which Pakistan is a committed signatory,” he added.</p>
<p>The premier highlighted that the country has undertaken legislative and administrative reforms to strengthen labour and workforce protection, including key international labour conventions, such as the Forced Labour Convention and the 2014 Protocol to the Maritime Labour Convention.</p>
<p>He stated, “For the first time, every worker in Pakistan is benefiting from a national occupational safety and health profile, ensuring safe and healthy workplaces across the country.”</p>
<p>He urged workers, activists, civil society and the government to play their role for “a society that respects workers, upholds their rights, and creates opportunities for decent work”.</p>

            <p><p>The ongoing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907397">heatwave</a> in Sindh is expected to subside from May 2, the Pakis­­tan Meteorological Depart­ment (PMD) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Climate change is a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1890909">pressing reality</a> for Pakistan, directly impacting millions of lives. Heatwaves, intensified by climate change, are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891214/pms-aide-highlights-escalating-climate-challenges-faced-by-developing-countries">becoming</a> more frequent, prolonged and severe, disproportionately affecting communities with limited resources to adapt.</p>
<p>“The prevailing heatwave condition over most parts of the province is expected to subside from tomorrow,” the PMD said in its advisory issued today.</p>
<p>“A westerly wave continues to grip the upper parts of the country,” it added.</p>
<p>According to the advisory, thunderstorms and light rain were expected in Jamshoro, Hyderabad, Mitiari, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Mirpurkhas, Sukkur, Badin, Tharparker, and Umerkot with occasional gaps from May 2 to 5.</p>
<p>“Strong windy conditions are likely in most parts of the province during [the] next two days,” the advisory said.</p>
<p>The forecast also said that Karachi was likely to experience hot and humid weather with occasional winds till May 3, adding that the maximum temperatures would be between 35°C and 37°C and the wind direction would be west and southwesterly.</p>
<p>PMD urged the public to take precautionary measures, avoid exposure to direct sunlight during the daytime and remain hydrated.</p>
<p>The advisory cautioned that “wind-thunderstorm/hailstorm and lightning may damage loose structures like electric poles, trees, vehicles and solar panels etc.”</p>
<p>“Farmers are advised to manage their crop activities keeping in view the weather conditions and take care of their livestock as well,” it added.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the PMD had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907452">predicted</a> wind and thunderstorm along with rain and isolated hailstorm in upper and central parts of the country from May 1 to 4, saying that the current heatwave conditions are likely to subside.</p></p>
