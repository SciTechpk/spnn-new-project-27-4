            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) gained a record nine per cent on Monday — the restored calm in the market mirroring that in the region after the recent Pakistan-India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> that boosted investor mood.</p>
<p>Saturday’s ceasefire, announced by US President Donald Trump, followed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">four days</a> of tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">strikes</a> between the nuclear-armed neighbours, as well as diplomacy and pressure from Washington.</p>
<p>The KSE-100 index opened with a gain of 9,929.48 points, or 9.26pc, to stand at 117,104.11 points from the previous close of 107,174.63 at 9:30am. Due to the massive gains, the PSX was suspended for an hour after opening to control excessive volatility.</p>
<p>Later in the day, the benchmark index reached as many as 117,327.78 points — 10,153.15 points (9.47pc) higher than yesterday’s close, at 3:15pm. This marked the highest intraday gain (points-wise) — more than double the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875103#:~:text=surged%204695.09%20points">4,700 points</a> surge in November 2024.</p>
<p>Finally, the KSE-100 closed at 117,297.73 points, with a gain of 10,123.10 points (9.45pc) compared to the previous close.</p>

<p>“The market has reacted jubilantly to the ceasefire announcement after Pakistan established effective <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910381/deterrence-re-established-say-armed-forces">deterrence against India</a>,” noted Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities.</p>
<p>“The PSX has saluted the Pakistan Air Force this morning with a surge of over 9pc in the KSE-100 Index,” he remarked, in reference to the PAF’s actions in response to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186">India’s strikes</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Farooq noted that the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908601/sbp-cuts-interest-rate-by-100bps-to-11pc">interest rate cut</a> and the approval of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">$1 billion tranche</a> by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) “further fueled investor enthusiasm”.</p>
<p>Commenting on the future investor mood, Farooq said market participants were now expected to shift their focus towards the upcoming federal budget for the next fiscal year, which is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909569">expected on June 2</a>.</p>

<p>Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, listed three main reasons for the robust market activity.</p>
<p>Other than the ceasefire and the IMF’s green light to the disbursement, Tariq mentioned US President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910382/kashmir-takes-centre-stage-as-fragile-ceasefire-holds">recent statement</a> on increasing trade with Pakistan.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">mediating</a> the halt of hostilities between the South Asian arch-rivals, Trump not only offered his help in resolving the Kashmir dispute but also announced he would “increase trade substantially” with both Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s international bonds also recorded strong gains today, adding as much as 5.7 cents in the dollar, Tradeweb data showed.</p>
<p>On May 8, when tensions deepened as Pakistan <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">took down 25 drones</a> sent by India into the country, the KSE-100 suffered the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909591">largest-ever plunge</a> of nearly 6,500 points in absolute terms. The intraday low of 8,410 points was the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902788#:~:text=The%20benchmark%20KSE%2D100%20index%20witnessed%20a%20record%20intra%2Dday%20plunge%20(points%2Dwise)%20of%208%2C687.68%20points">second-largest</a> single-day drop (points-wise).</p>
<p>Prominent industrialist Arif Habib, told <em>Geo News</em> at the PSX in Karachi, “We have already achieved macroeconomic stability, which has made Pakistan’s economic story presentable and better.”</p>
<p>He also highlighted the interest rate cut and the IMF’s approval as contributors to the positive market activity.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>On the ongoing political situation, Habib said it was a good opportunity for “these political matters” to be discussed and settled in the parliament. “There will be no more obstacles for Pakistan’s progress then,” he stressed.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, pointed out the heightened possibility of further improving ties with Gulf countries due to Pakistan’s enhanced geopolitical position.</p>
<p>“This brief conflict has also demonstrated our military and technological superiority over India, strengthening our geopolitical position. As a result, it is likely to enhance ties with Gulf countries amid regional tensions and support growth in our defence and technology exports,” Ashraf told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>While noting the investor zest in light of the Pak-India “conflict ending with dominance”, he said the attention was now expected to shift towards improving macroeconomic indicators, including <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908067">historically low inflation</a> and a record-high current account surplus.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s consumer inflation rate plunged to an all-time low of 0.3pc year-on-year <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908067">in April</a>, while the $1.195bn current account surplus <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904945">in March</a> was the highest-ever monthly surplus.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Indian shares also rallied today.</p>
<p>India’s benchmarks jumped over 3pc and were on track to log their best session in almost a year after the country reached and held a ceasefire with Pakistan.</p>
<p>The Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex gained about 3.25pc each to 24,787.8 and 81,958.04, respectively, as of 1:12pm IST (12:42pm PKT), on track to recover the 1.5pc they lost since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">India’s strikes on Pakistan</a> on May 7.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>If gains hold, the benchmarks will log their best single-day jump since June 5, 2024, when markets surged after the ruling National Democratic Alliance’s victory in the national elections.</p>
<p>“Assuming the ceasefire is adhered to by both countries, we keep all our macro forecasts unchanged,” Barclays said in a note.</p>
<p>“We see India grow at a solid 6.5pc year-on-year in FY25-26, benefitting from relative insulation to global trade uncertainty and strong progress in ‘trade talks’ with the US administration,” it added.</p>
<p>All 13 major sectors logged gains today. The broader small- and mid-caps rallied 4pc and 3.6pc, respectively.</p></p>

            <p><p>The United States and China announced on Monday an agreement to drastically reduce tit-for-tat tariffs for 90 days, de-escalating a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904617">trade war</a> that has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902788">roiled</a> financial markets and raised <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905525">fears</a> of a global economic downturn.</p>
<p>After their first talks since US President Donald Trump launched his trade war, the world’s two biggest economies agreed in a joint statement to bring their triple-digit tariffs down to two figures and continue negotiations.</p>
<p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the weekend talks with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and international trade representative Li Chenggang as “productive” and “robust”.</p>
<p>“Both sides showed a great respect,” Bessent told reporters.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903391">imposed</a> duties of 145 per cent on imports for China last month — compared to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902420">10pc</a> for other countries in the global tariff blitz he launched last month.</p>
<p>Beijing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903545">hit back</a> with duties of 125pc on US goods.</p>
<p>Bessent said the two sides agreed to reduce those tariffs by 115pc, taking US tariffs to 30pc and those by China to 10pc.</p>
<p>In their statement, the two sides agreed to “establish a mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations”.</p>
<p>China hailed the “substantial progress” made at the talks.</p>
<p>“This move… is in the interest of the two countries and the common interest of the world,” the Chinese commerce ministry said, adding that it hoped Washington would keep working with China “to correct the wrong practice of unilateral tariff rises”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>The dollar, which tumbled after Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905287">launched</a> his tariff blitz in April, rallied on the news while US stock futures soared. European and Asian markets also rallied.</p>
<p>The trade dispute between Washington and Beijing has rocked financial markets, raising fears the tariffs would rekindle inflation and cause a global economic downturn.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#bodes-well-for-the-future" id="bodes-well-for-the-future" title="Permalink"></a>‘Bodes well for the future’</h2>
<p>The head of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, praised the talks on Sunday as a “significant step forward” that “bode well for the future”.</p>
<p>“Amid current global tensions, this progress is important not only for the US and China but also for the rest of the world, including the most vulnerable economies,” she added.</p>
<p>Ahead of the meeting at the discreet villa residence of Switzerland’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Trump had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909866/trump-floats-cutting-china-tariffs-to-80pc">signalled</a> he might lower the tariffs, suggesting on social media that an “80% Tariff on China seems right!”</p>
<p>However, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified that the United States would not lower tariffs unilaterally, saying China would also need to make concessions.</p>
<p>The Geneva meeting came days after Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909458">unveiled</a> a trade agreement with Britain, the first with any country since he unleashed his blitz of global tariffs.</p>
<p>The five-page, nonbinding deal confirmed to nervous investors that Washington was willing to negotiate sector-specific relief from recent duties.</p>
<p>But Trump maintained a 10pc levy on most British goods, and threatened to keep it in place as a baseline rate for most other countries.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) announced on Monday its dissolution and the end of more than four decades of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909940">armed struggle</a> against the Turkish state, the pro-Kurd <em>ANF</em> news agency reported.</p>
<p>“The 12th PKK Congress has decided to dissolve the PKK’s organisational structure and end its method of armed struggle,” the group announced in a statement after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909940/outlawed-kurdish-group-discusses-plan-to-disarm-and-disband">holding</a> its congress last week.</p>
<p>The PKK’s announcement to dissolve itself heeds a call by its founder Abdullah Ocalan, jailed on an island off Istanbul since 1999, who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894807">urged</a> his fighters in February to disarm and disband.</p>
<p>In a letter, Ocalan urged the PKK to hold a congress to formalise the decision.</p>
<p>Days later, the PKK’s leadership accepted Ocalan’s call, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895092">declaring</a> a ceasefire.</p>
<p>In a speech on Saturday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hinted that news about a dissolution could come at any moment, adding that his government was determined to “save our country from the scourge of terrorism”.</p>
<p>“We are advancing with firm steps on the path to the goal of a terror-free Turkiye,” he said.</p>
<p>Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the dissolution, calling it a significant step toward lasting peace and a terror-free Turkiye.</p>

<p>“This historic development reflects the unflinching resolve of the Turkish leadership, under my dear brother President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the Turkish nation, to continue their march forward towards reconciliation, unity and stability,” the premier said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/CMShehbaz/status/1921868394195718628" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X.</p>
<p>“Together, Pakistan and Turkiye remain committed to root out terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” he added.</p>

<p>The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkiye, the United States and the European Union, has waged an insurgency since 1984.</p>
<p>Its original aim was to carve out a homeland for Kurds, who make up about 20 per cent of Turkiye’s 85 million people.</p>
<p>Since Ocalan was jailed, there have been various attempts to end the bloodshed, which has cost more than 40,000 lives.</p></p>
