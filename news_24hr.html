            <p><p>The PTI formally expelled its five members of the National Assembly (MNA) for voting in favour of the 26th Constitutional Amendment Bill last August, it emerged on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Constitution (Twenty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2024, also known as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866480/what-is-the-26th-constitutional-amendment">Constitutional Package</a>, is legislation that takes away the Supreme Court’s suo motu powers, sets the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowers the prime minister to appoint the next CJP from among the three most senior SC judges.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The party last October decided to take <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866814">legal action</a> against its lawmakers, who had voted in favour of the 26th Constitutional Amendment in violation of the party’s policy.</p>
<p>Expulsion notices — dated July 12 and available with <em>Dawn.com</em> — were issued to MNAs Aurangzeb Khan Khichi (NA-159, Vehari IV), Muhammad Ilyas Choudhry (NA-62, Gujrat I), Usman Ali (NA-142, Sahiwal II), Mubarak Zeb Khan (NA-8, Bajaur), and Zahoor Hussain Qureshi (NA-146, Khanewal III).</p>
<p>“[During] the PTI … parliamentary party meeting held on September 2, 2024 [in] Islamabad, … it was unanimously resolved that [the] PTI parliamentary party will not support the proposed amendments [to] the Constitution and will oppose the bill when it is moved in the National Assembly or is put to voting at any stage,” the notice read.</p>
<p>“You voted in favour of the bill and, therefore, you violated the directions and instructions of the PTI parliamentary party [that] were binding on you as a parliamentarian especially when you had won the election with support of [the] PTI and had taken oath that you would follow instructions of [the] PTI and that you would stand loyal to the party.”</p>
<p>The document recalled that show-cause notices were issued to the five MNAs in November to prove that they had not “defected” from the party, but they did not respond. Moreover, personal hearings were held for the MNAs, but they did not offer any explanation or defence, the notice read.</p>
<p>Two of the notices, addressed to Khichi and Mubarak Zeb, noted that they had defected and joined the PML-N. The remaining three notices took note of the fact that the recipients were sitting on treasury benches and “attended meetings of that [ruling] party”.</p>
<p>“Thus, you having voted in favour of the 26th Constitutional (Amendment) Act, 2024, have violated the party’s instructions and directions which were binding on you,” the notice read.</p>
<p>“Therefore, you are hereby declared to have violated your commitment, oath and loyalty to the party. You have acted contrary to the instructions of the party … and joined another parliamentary party in the National Assembly. You are therefore expelled from the party (PTI) forthwith. Needless to add that you also stand disqualified on account of aforesaid conduct.”</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923927/imf-representative-hails-pakistans-strong-economic-reform-progress' target='_blank'><strong>IMF representative hails Pakistan’s ‘strong’ economic reform progress</strong></a>
            <p><p>An International Monetary Fund (IMF) representative hailed Pakistan’s “strong” economic reforms carried out under the lender’s $7 billion loan programme, the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Pakis­tan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845536">secured</a> a three-year aid package deal in July 2024. The programme, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860850">approved</a> by the IMF two months later, is set to allow the country to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”.</p>
<p>IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan Mahir Binici noted that the country’s performance under the 2024 Extended Fund Facility (EFF) had been “strong so far”, according to a press release issued by the SDPI on its guest lecture in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Binici termed the EFF’s successful <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913147/pakistan-imf-agree-on-budget-blueprint">first review</a> — also encompassing agreement on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292">federal budget</a> blueprint — by the IMF Executive Board in May as a key milestone.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>He stressed that structural reforms remained central to Pakistan’s long-term economic sustainability, particularly reforms that strengthen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910790">tax equity</a>, improve the business climate and encourage <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916455">private-sector-led investment</a>.</p>
<p>Addressing economists, researchers and policy experts, the SDPI statement said, Banici reaffirmed the Fund’s continued support for the country’s economic and climate reform agenda.</p>
<p>In March, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900322">unlocked</a> a new $1.3 billion arrangement with the IMF under its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893193#:~:text=The%20country%20had%20requested%20%241bn%20from%20IMF%E2%80%99s%20Resilience%20and%20Sustainability%20Trust%20(RSF)%20in%20October">Resilience and Sustainability Facility</a> (RSF) to build resilience against climate catastrophes through adaptation.</p>
<p>Binici noted that the RSF was designed to help countries like Pakistan bolster resilience to climate-related vulnerabilities and meet international climate commitments, the SDPI press release said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The IMF official mentioned that the key areas of reform under the RSF included enhancing public investment planning, promoting efficient and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894835">sustainable use</a> of water resources, improving institutional coordination for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893742">disaster preparedness</a> and financing, along with expanding the availability and transparency of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1890593">climate-related data</a>.</p>
<p>Binici stressed that “support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory”.</p>
<p>The IMF official also shed light on the evolving economic landscape across the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) region and Pakistan. He stated that growth across the Mena region, as well as in Pakistan, was expected to strengthen in 2025 and beyond.</p>
<p>However, he cautioned that “elevated trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation and weakening global cooperation continue to generate exceptional uncertainty and weigh on the global economic outlook”, underscoring the urgent need for prudent and forward-looking policy actions.</p>
<p>SDPI Executive Director Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri welcomed the IMF representative’s outreach, noting the importance of informed economic dialogue and multilateral cooperation in Pakistan’s journey toward sustainable development.</p>
<p>The lecture concluded with an interactive discussion on fiscal and monetary policy frameworks, external buffers and the role of international institutions in fostering inclusive growth, the statement added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The IMF had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898053">praised</a> Pakistan’s implementation of the $7bn EFF as strong in March after both concluded the programme’s first biannual review on a positive note.</p>
<p>In May, an official said the IMF Executive Board found that Pakistan had “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912850">met all of the targets</a>” under the package and made progress on some of the reforms.</p></p>

            <p><p>A man was killed while two others were injured on Sunday when a vehicle belonging to a local political leader was caught in an explosion in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district, a police spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Khanzala Quraishi, spokesperson for the Bannu Regional Police Officer, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the Chairman of the Betani Qaumi Tehreek, Inamullah Khan, was returning from a weekly protest in the Pul Ahmadzai area when his vehicle was hit by an IED planted on Tejori road.</p>
<p>“Inamullah survived the attack,” Quraishi said. “However, initial reports suggest that a man was killed in the incident.”</p>
<p>Quraishi said that a police team had been dispatched to the site of the incident and that a detailed report would be submitted.</p>
<p>A police report shared later by Lakki Marwat Police’s Public Relations Officer, Aamir Khan, stated that the incident took place at 8pm on Sunday.</p>
<p>“Near Bukhmal Ahmadzai checkpoint, an IED exploded near Inamullah’s vehicle, causing it to catch fire,” the report, shared with <em>Dawn.com</em>, read.</p>
<p>“Inamullah and the remaining leaders of the movement are safe, but two people were injured in the explosion, while a man was killed.”</p>
<p>The report added that the injured have been moved to DHQ Hospital Tajazai for medical treatment.</p>
<p>In a video posted to Facebook, Inamullah can be seen appealing to the public to come out of their homes and “engage the attackers”, while gunfire can be heard in the background.</p>

<p>This incident comes days after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923308">assassination</a> of Awami National Party senior leader Maulana Khan Zeb by unidentified suspects in KP’s Bajaur district.</p>
<p>Bajaur District Police Officer (DPO) Waqas Rafiq told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the politician was shot dead in Shindai Mor while campaigning for the July 13 peace parade, adding that a policeman was also killed in the attack.</p>
<p>“Three other people were injured in the shooting,” DPO Rafiq said. “This was a targeted killing carried out by unidentified shooters on motorcycles.”</p>
<p>A first information report was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923530/police-conduct-probe-as-unidentified-attackers-booked-for-anp-leader-maulana-khan-zebs-murder">registered</a> by the Counter-Terrorism Department under Sections 302 (murder), 324 (attempted murder) and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs50) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 (terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.</p>
