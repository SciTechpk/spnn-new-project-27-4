                <h2>Pakistan slams Modi’s ‘inflammatory monologue’, urges India to honour international order</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office on Wednesday condemned the “inflammatory monologue” delivered by Indian PM Narendra Modi in Gujarat, urging India to “return to the core principles of international order”.</p>
<p>The developments follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.</p>
<p>On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>. After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> was reached.</p>
<p>In a video <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ANI/status/1927255026990264356" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> by Indian news outlet <em>ANI</em>, Modi, addressing India’s youth, calls into question the contents of the Indus Waters Treaty. He said, “If you study the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, you’ll be shocked.”</p>

<p>He continued, “It was decided that the dams built on the rivers of Jammu and Kashmir would not be cleaned… For 60 years, these gates were never opened. Reservoirs that were supposed to be filled to 100 per cent capacity have now been reduced to only 2pc or 3pc.”</p>
<p>Stating that the treaty has only been held in abeyance as of now, he added, “Right now, I haven’t done anything, and people are sweating there [Pakistan].”</p>
<p>Calling Modi’s remarks “unexpected”, the FO in its statement urged India to set aside its project of “historical revisionism”.</p>

<p>The FO termed India’s approach towards the treaty as a “troubling departure from international norms”, while drawing a contrast between Pakistan and India’s regional conduct and global ambitions.</p>
<p>“A leadership truly in pursuit of international respect might first look inward, and seek to cleanse its conscience before issuing threats to others,” the statement read.</p>
<p>It further added, “Pakistan urges India to return to the core principles of international order including respect for sovereign rights of others and its treaty obligations, as well as restraint in both language and action.”</p>
<p>The FO in its statement cautioned that “Jingoism may stir applause on the campaign trail, but it undermines long-term peace and stability”. It continued that “India’s youth, often the first casualty of chauvinistic nationalism, would do well to reject the politics of fear and instead work toward a future defined by dignity, reason, and regional cooperation”.</p>
<p>The statement read that such acts may serve domestic optics but cannot withstand international scrutiny or inspire India’s image as a responsible regional power, while highlighting that “the ideological followers of India’s current government have normalised mob violence, promoted hate campaigns and targeted religious minorities”.</p>
<p>“The Indian government is linked to extraterritorial assassinations and foreign subversion.</p>
<p>India is in occupation of foreign people and territories. Its record in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir is defined by systematic repression. It is ironic that such a state now attempts to claim the mantle of victimhood.“</p></p>

            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is attending a trilateral summit in Azerbaijan’s Lachin city today, as he continues his tour to friendly countries to appreciate their support for Pakistan during the recent conflict with India.</p>
<p>The premier is participating in the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit, alongside presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ilham Aliyev.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Addressing the summit, PM Shehbaz congratulated Aliyev and the Azerbaijani nation on their Republic Day. “The way Azeri nation fought for its liberation, you earned a high position in the community of nations.”</p>
<p>He also felicitated the Turkish president for “very skillfully resolving the issue” of the PKK, referring to the Kurdish rebels’ recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910519">decision to disband</a>.</p>
<p>According to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/28-05-2025/pm-shehbaz-to-spend-busy-day-in-lachin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em>, the prime minister will also address a ceremony marking Azerbaijan’s Independence Day later today.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz arrived in Lachin yesterday on the third leg of his four-nation tour after visiting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913346/pm-shehbaz-in-turkiye-to-elevate-strategic-partnership">Tukiye</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913442/ready-to-talk-with-india-pm-shehbaz-says-during-meeting-with-iranian-president-in-tehran">Iran</a>. He will later depart for Tajikistan, where he will attend the International Conference on Glaciers in Dushanbe.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the premier held a bilateral meeting with President <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913657">Ilham Aliyev</a> and thanked him for Azerbaijan’s support during the recent confrontation with India. Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir was also present on the occasion.</p>
<p>Both leaders “underscored the importance of coordinated efforts to promote regional stability, mutual prosperity, and principled positions on key international issues”, a press release by the PM’s Office said.</p>
<p>The prime minister thanked Azerbaijan for its “steadfast support during the recent Pakistan-India confrontation in the face of Indian provocation and acknowledged the public expressions of solidarity from both the leadership and the people of brotherly Azerbaijan,” the statement added.</p>
<p>He said that people of Azerbaijan celebrated Pakistan’s success in the Marka-e-Haq against India.</p>
<p>They reaffirmed their shared commitment to diversifying the strategic partnership through investment in mutually beneficial avenues.</p>
<p>The Azerbaijan side agreed to the exchange of delegations regarding the progress of Azerbaijan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845188">investment</a> in Pakistan. In this regard, it was agreed that delegation-level talks will be organised soon.</p>
<p>In a separate message, PM Shehbaz extended heartfelt felicitations to President Aliyev and the brotherly people of Azerbaijan on the joyous occasion of Azerbaijan’s Independence Day on the behalf of the people and Government of Pakistan.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/CMShehbaz/status/1927406750375801297" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, he said that Pakistan deeply values its close fraternal bonds with Azerbaijan-rooted in shared history, mutual trust and unwavering support for each other.</p>
<p>Shehbaz said that “it gives me great pleasure to be able to celebrate this historic day in Azerbaijan, alongside President Aliyev and our Azerbaijani brothers and sisters”.</p>
<p>The prime minister expressed confidence that under President Aliyev’s “wise and sagacious leadership, our multi-dimensional partnership will continue to grow from strength to strength”.</p>
