                <h2>Medium-level flood on Indus River at Punjab‚Äôs Kalabagh due to monsoon rains</h2>

            <p><p>Flooding at Punjab‚Äôs Kalabagh on the Indus river reached a ‚Äúmedium‚Äù level on Friday, while low-level floods were reported at four other locations on the river due to heavy monsoon rains and glacial melting, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said on Friday.</p>
<p>Rescue operations continued in Punjab after recent deadly rains wreaked havoc on and claimed at least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924761/section-144-imposed-across-punjab-emergency-in-parts-as-rains-claim-dozens-of-lives-in-past-24-hours">63 lives</a> across the province. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has forecasted that five more such spells of rain are expected in the coming days, leading to rising water levels, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-directs-ndma-ministers-for-climate-planning-to-prepare-comprehensive-disaster-management-plans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The next spell is expected to begin from July 21 and last till July 28, while the fifth is expected in the first week of August, the sixth in the second week of August and the seventh in its third week.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe flow of water in rivers is increasing due to monsoon rains and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660">glacial melting</a>,‚Äù a statement issued by the PDMA spokesperson said.</p>
<p>According to the data released by the Met Office‚Äôs Flood Forecasting Division at 1pm, there was a medium-level flood at Kalabagh with ‚Äústeady‚Äù water inflow (447,941 cusecs) and outflow (440,391).</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo loss of life has been reported yet due to anyone getting caught in the floodwater,‚Äù the PDMA DG claimed.</p>
<p>The district administration and Pakistan Army personnel participated in the rescue operations, he added. Citizens were evacuated via helicopters in many areas where rescue boats were unable to reach.</p>
<p>DG PDMA stressed that ‚Äúmonsoon rains are predicted to be more than usual this year‚Äù, vowing that all resources would be utilised to protect citizens.</p>

<p>Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the NDMA and the climate and planning ministers to engage the provinces for a comprehensive disaster management plan based on the lessons learnt from this year‚Äôs devastating rains and cloudburst events.</p></p>

                <h2>Security forces foil infiltration bid by terrorists on Pak-Afghan border: state media</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Security forces have foiled an infiltration attempt by terrorists along the Pak-Afghan border and arrested five ‚Äúalleged suicide bombers‚Äù, state-run <em>PTV News</em> reported on Friday.</p>
<p>Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">witnessed</a> an uptick in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistani security forces have foiled an infiltration attempt by <em>Khawarij</em> along the Pak-Afghan border,‚Äù <em>PTV News</em> reported, citing security sources.</p>
<p><em>Khawarij</em> is a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna">term</a> the state uses to refer to terrorists.</p>
<p><em>PTV</em> said, quoting security sources, that on July 17, at around 5pm, <em>Khawarij</em> tried to cross the border and enter Pakistan, but the forces, on receiving immediate information, set up checkpoints at various places and prevented them from proceeding ahead with their attempt.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe <em>Khawarij</em> advanced towards Azizkhel and Mandikhel, but due to the heavy presence of security forces, they were forced to take refuge in the mosque in Besikhel, where the forces immediately surrounded them and forced them to surrender,‚Äù the state broadcaster said.</p>
<p>All five suspects arrested are Afghan citizens aged between 15 and 18. Three of them also have Afghan identity cards. They have been shifted to an undisclosed location for further interrogation.</p>
<p>Security authorities have issued an alert in the border areas and are continuing search operations to stop potential terrorists, <em>PTV</em> added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecurity sources say that India is giving full support to the <em>Khawarij</em> separatist movement to fuel terrorism in Pakistan,‚Äù <em>PTV News</em> said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, security forces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922232/30-terrorists-killed-as-forces-thwart-border-breach">foiled</a> another infiltration attempt from Afghanistan by an ‚ÄúIndian proxy‚Äù, killing at least 30 terrorists in North Waziristan district, ISPR had said.</p>
<p>On July 9, security forces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908178">killed</a> eight militants attempting to infiltrate from Afghanistan into Bajaur district.</p>
<p>Official sources said the militants were killed in Lowi Mamund tehsil after they tried to cross into the district from Afghanistan‚Äôs Kunar province.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921445">witnessed</a> a slight overall decline in militant violence during June 2025 despite several high-profile attacks, according to data released by an Islamabad-based think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss).</p>
<p>The monthly security assessment shows there were a total of 78 militant attacks across the country in June, resulting in at least 100 fatalities, including 53 security personnel, 39 civilians, six militants, and two members of peace committees, the organisation said in a press statement.</p></p>
