                <h2>Iran president lands in Lahore, eyeing to boost trade ties</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian landed in Lahore on Saturday, eyeing to reaffirm his commitment to elevate the annual bilateral trade with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan has recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924349/dar-slams-israel-us-attacks-against-fellow-sco-member-iran-as-unacceptable">expressed solidarity</a> and a desire for cooperation with Iran, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927716/closer-pak-iran-cooperation-vital-to-securing-shared-interests-say-experts">experts say</a> is vital to securing shared interests in a shifting geopolitical environment.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian is paying a two-day official visit to Pakistan over the weekend, making it his first trip to Islamabad in his current role, the Foreign Office <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928047/iranian-president-to-visit-pakistan-on-saturday-fo">said</a>. Ahead of his trip, Pakistan yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919380/the-history-of-us-iran-tensions">pledged</a> to help defuse <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919380/the-history-of-us-iran-tensions">tensions</a> between Iran and the United States.</p>
<p>Ex-premier and MNA Nawaz Sharif and his daughter, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, received the distinguished guest upon his arrival in Lahore.</p>

<p>According to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1951592103957701076" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PTV News</a></em>, the Iranian president will pay a visit to Mazar-i-Iqbal and then head to Islamabad, where he will meet with President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz had met with Pezeshkian during his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913442/ready-to-talk-with-india-pm-shehbaz-says-during-meeting-with-iranian-president-in-tehran">visit to Iran</a> in late May, which was part of his regional tour to friendly countries aimed at expre­ssing gratitude for their support during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">conflict with India</a>.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian is the second Iranian president to visit Pakistan in as many years. Late Ebrahim Raisi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1828957">visited</a> the country in April last year, just a month before he died in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1834463">helicopter crash</a>.</p>
<p>According to Iran’s state media <em><a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85903178/Pezeshkian-Iran-aims-to-expand-trade-with-Pakistan-to-10-billion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IRNA</a></em>, before departing for Pakistan, Pezeshkian emphasised the plan to elevate their annual trade exchanges to $10 billion. The two countries had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1829136">agreed</a> in April last year to boost trade over the next five years.</p>
<p>The president termed the trade relations between Tehran and Islamabad as “good” and identified boosting trade with Pakistan via land, air and sea as priorities for this trip, the report added.</p>
<p>“Through Pakistan, Iran can connect to the Silk Road linking China and Pakistan, and the route can then extend through Iran to Europe,” he said.</p>
<p>Emphasising that security and border issues were of great importance to both Iran and Pakistan, he stressed that regional security must be achieved through cooperation, according to <em>IRNA</em>.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Pezeshkian noted that the two neighbours have “enjoyed good, friendly, and deep-rooted relations” since Pakistan’s independence. “The two countries cooperate in economic, scientific, cultural, and border areas, and a deep bond exists between the people of both sides,” he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian highlighted that during the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919798/ceasefire-brokered-with-iran-after-washington-request-for-liaison-qatars-pm-says">Israel-Iran war</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">United States’ strikes</a> against its nuclear facilities, “Pakistan was among the countries that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924349/dar-slams-israel-us-attacks-against-fellow-sco-member-iran-as-unacceptable">strongly condemned</a> this aggression and declared its readiness to provide any necessary support for Iran’s territorial integrity, as well as for the government and people of Iran”.</p>
<p>According to <em>IRNA</em>, the president also noted that “the enemy plans to create division among Muslims, but Iran will thwart the enemies’ plots”, adding that Tehran aims to maintain unity and solidarity between Iran and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian had left for Pakistan earlier today. He is accompanied by a high-level delegation, including Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, senior ministers and other high-ranking officials.</p>

                <h2>Pakistan Army inducts Z-10ME helicopters to ‘reinforce battlefield response’</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan Army has inducted Z-10ME attack helicopters to reinforce its “integrated battlefield response”, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Aviation Industry Corporation of China had displayed its Z-10 attack helicopter for the first time outside its home country at the Singapore Airshow in February 2024, according to <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reuters</a>. It also noted that as of then, the model had Pakistan as the only known export customer, but no sales had been announced at the air show.</p>
<p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir presided over the induction ceremony and later witnessed a firepower demonstration by the “newly inducted Z-10ME helicopters” at the Muzaffargarh Field Firing Ranges, the ISPR said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7375" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>, without specifying the number of the craft acquired.</p>
<p>“The induction of this potent system marks a major leap in the modernisation of Army Aviation, reinforcing its integrated battlefield response and capacity to deliver decisive effects against potential adversaries,” the military’s media affairs wing noted.</p>

<p>In 2021, <em>Defense News</em> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1612986#:~:text=The%20report%20noted%20that%20before%20the%20T129%20was%20chosen%2C%20China%20sent%20three%20of%20its%20CAIC%20Z%2D10%20helicopter">reported</a> that China sent three of its Z-10 helicopter gunships for trials in Pakistan, but they failed to sufficiently impress officials and were returned.</p>
<p>However, former Australian defence attaché to Islamabad, Brian Cloughley, had said it was “likely that the Pakistan Army will evaluate the Chinese Z-10ME attack helicopter”.</p>
<p>The ISPR highlighted: “This state-of-the-art, all-weather platform is capable of precision strike operations day and night.</p>
<p>“Equipped with advanced radar systems and cutting-edge electronic warfare suites, the Z-10ME significantly enhances the army’s capability to engage diverse aerial and ground threats.”</p>
<p>Interacting with troops at the Muzaffargarh firing ranges, COAS Munir lauded their exceptional morale, professionalism, and combat proficiency.</p>
<p>He appreciated the “successful demonstration of combined arms tactics, reflecting the army’s firm resolve to maintain a decisive edge in the evolving character of warfare”.</p>
<p>Separately, Field Marshal Munir stressed the importance of national unity and civil-military synergy in countering “hybrid threats”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>He made the remarks as he engaged with members of academia and civil society during an interactive session, following his visit to Multan Garrison.</p>
<p>“He underscored the significance of national unity, civil-military synergy and a whole-of-nation approach in countering hybrid threats and fostering societal cohesion,” the ISPR statement read.</p>
<p>At the garrison, COAS Munir was briefed on the formation’s operational preparedness and ongoing training activities, the report added. He reaffirmed the army’s “unwavering commitment to safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity”.</p>
<p>The army chief expressed satisfaction over the high standards of readiness.</p></p>
