            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday reiterated Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1714822">willingness</a> to hold talks with India on the Kashmir dispute and counterterrorism, stressing New Delhi wanted the same “in all sincerity”.</p>
<p>The prime minister participated in the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit alongside presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ilham Aliyev. The meeting comes as the premier continued his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913237">tour to friendly countries</a> to appreciate their support for Pakistan during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">recent conflict</a> with India.</p>
<p>Speaking at the summit, PM Shehbaz said: “I have said in all humility that we want peace in the region […] and that requires talks on the table on issues which need urgent attention and amicable resolution, that is the issue of Kashmir according to the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council and as per the aspirations of the people of Kashmir.”</p>
<p>The premier also touched upon the issue of terrorism: “I have said in all earnest that if India wants to talk on countering terrorism in sincerity of purpose, Pakistan would be willing to talk to India on this issue as well.</p>
<p>“But this is a fact of life that we are the biggest victims of terrorism around the globe; we lost 90,000 valuable lives in Pakistan and $150 billion worth of economic losses over the last many decades,” he highlighted.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also expressed willingness to resume trade if India was willing to cooperate on the issues, including counterterrorism.</p>
<p>“There cannot be a bigger commitment and intention to beat this menace (terrorism) for all times to come, and in that, if India wants in all sincerity honest cooperation, Pakistan would be willing, along with the promotion of trade with India. All these issues need to be discussed on the table.</p>
<p>“I would be extremely grateful for your support in this regard,” he said, addressing the Turkiye and Azerbaijan presidents.</p>

<p>On India’s unilateral move to hold the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a> in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">abeyance</a>, the premier said: “India tried to weaponise the Indus Waters Treaty, which is a lifeline for the people of Pakistan — 240 million people — for their agricultural use, for drinking and many other purposes.</p>
<p>“I think this is most unfortunate that India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911383">tried to threaten</a> to stop our flow of water to Pakistan. This is not possible, was never possible, and will not be possible, God-willing. We are making proper arrangements to ensure that India never ever does it,” he asserted.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>During his address, Shehbaz noted: “The world we live in faces numerous grave challenges, including armed conflict, climate change, diseases and economic crises.</p>
<p>“This is why the three of us have assembled here today, opting for compassion while rejecting conflict. We are confident that patience and wisdom will ultimately usher in peace and prosperity.”</p>
<p>“In today’s unpredictable and volatile world, political security, architectures, connectivity, alignments and emerging technologies are shaping the new reality. In such a situation, Pakistan is very fortunate to have sincere brothers like Turkiye and Azerbaijan who have stood together with us as impregnable rocks and whom we can trust without a second thought.”</p>
<p>Reiterating his gratitude to Erdogan and Aliyev for their diplomatic support during the recent conflict with India, which “was obviously very serious”. “It was an aggression from India against Pakistan for no rhyme and reason.”</p>
<p>He noted Erdogan’s “firm stand and solidarity with the people of Pakistan”, as well as Aliyev’s unwavering commitment to the people of Pakistan“ had earned the highest level of appreciation from his government and the nation.</p>

<p>The prime minister hailed the role of Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir during Pakistan’s response, noting the “great bravery and the highest level of professional acumen” of the armed forces under his leadership.</p>
<p>“I saw him during those moments God-fearing, fearless, firm and with an iron resolve, with patience and obviously with fortitude to face that aggression.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Addressing Aliyev, the premier thanked him for the hospitality shown to him and his delegation, noting that today’s summit “reflects the meeting of hearts and souls of genuine friends and sincere well-wishers”.</p>
<p>Recalling the “most fruitful discussions” at the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1843759">Shanghai Cooperation Organisation</a> summit last year in Kazakhstan, PM Shehbaz said, “We are now eagerly looking forward to taking our trilateral partnership to new heights that would be in consonance with the wishes and desires of our people.</p>
<p>“This would be no surprise to anyone as Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Turkiye are bound together by deep historical, cultural and spiritual ties forged through centuries of shared values and mutual support,” he asserted.</p>
<p>“This historical relationship has been further strengthened as we have stood by each other, whether it be on Karabakh, Kashmir or northern Turkish Cyprus. Our strength lies in our solidarity and mutual respect.”</p>
<p>Noting the “outpouring of love and affection in both Turkiye and Azerbaijan” for Pakistan, PM Shehbaz noted: “We could not but be mesmerised by the intensity of the fervour and enthusiasm of our common citizens during Pakistan’s recent conflict with India.”</p>
<p>He noted that India “not only <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">failed</a> to bring any credible evidence against Pakistan but also rejected our sincere and generous offer of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral, transparent investigation</a> into the so-called <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">incident in Pahalgam</a> by any international body”.</p>
<p>At the outset of his speech, the premier congratulated Aliyev and the Azerbaijani nation on their Republic Day. “The way the Azeri nation fought for its liberation, you earned a high position in the community of nations.”</p>
<p>He also felicitated the Turkish president for “very skillfully resolving the issue” of the PKK, referring to the Kurdish rebels’ recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910519">decision to disband</a>. “That goes to explain in volumes, my brother, your diplomatic skills to resolve this issue, and by virtue of this, you have earned a high place and influence not only in the region, but beyond.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911818/repatriation-of-afghans-continues#:~:text=So%20far%2C%20a%20total%20of%2055%2C865%20Afghan%20nationals%20including%2035%2C975%20ACC%20holders%20and%2019%2C890%20illegal%20migrants%20have%20left%20for%20Afghanistan%20since%20April%201%2C%20the%20day%20the%20second%20phase%20began%20after%20the%20deadline%20for%20repatriation%20of%20registered%20Afghan%20nationals%20ended%20on%20March%2031.">As of May 18</a>, a total of 55,865 Afghan nationals including 35,975 ACC holders and 19,890 illegal migrants have left for Afghanistan since April 1, the day the second phase began after the deadline for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1785519/govt-initiates-nationwide-operation-to-deport-illegal-foreign-nationals">repatriation</a> of registered Afghan nationals ended on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896556">March 31</a>.</p>
<p>The PEN International-led joint statement, signed by freedom of expression and human rights organisations, concerns the recent acceleration in the mass deportation of Afghans from Pakistan, including at-risk writers, journalists, artists, human rights defenders and others at risk of persecution from the Taliban for their peaceful expression.</p>

<p>More than a dozen organisations called on the government to “immediately halt the arbitrary mass deportation of Afghan nationals in line with the country’s human rights obligations, including the principle of non-refoulement.</p>
<p>“We urge the international community to continue to provide safety to at-risk Afghans, including writers, journalists, artists, human rights defenders and others who fled the Taliban’s persecution,” PEN International said.</p>
<p>It noted that the government’s decision to deport Afghan nationals, announced on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907871#:~:text=Since%20March%202025%2C%20Pakistan%20expelled%20an%20estimated%2080%2C000%20Afghans%20as%20part%20of%20its%20repatriation%20campaign%20that%20began%20in%20October%202023.">October 3, 2023</a>, drew “significant concern” from international institutions, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration, who urged the government to continue to protect at-risk Afghans.</p>
<p>“Despite the UNHCR’s active non-return advisory for Afghanistan and calls from UN experts to halt the deportations, the government of Pakistan has accelerated its forced returns in recent months, resulting in over 30,000 deportations in April alone,” the statement said.</p>
<p>“Included among those deported who are at greatest risk of persecution are writers, journalists, artists, and human rights defenders who continue to face significant threats of arbitrary arrest, torture and imprisonment for any form of expression that the Taliban deem incompatible with their ideology.</p>
<p>“Women and girls deported to Afghanistan will face overwhelming levels of repression impacting every aspect of their lives, amounting to what UN experts have described as ‘gender apartheid’,” the statement read.</p>
<p>Many of those who fled across the border into Pakistan following the Taliban’s return to de facto rule in August 2021 had planned to travel onwards to a country of safety, PEN International stated</p>
<p>“However, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home">suspension of humanitarian visa</a> pathways and inadequate support for at-risk Afghans in countries around the world, including the US, the UK and Germany, has left many stranded in a situation of abject precarity and insecurity.”</p>
<p>For the over one million Afghan refugees and asylum seekers who remain in Pakistan, the intensifying crackdown by Pakistani authorities, which includes mass arrests and other forms of harassment, has instilled a renewed sense of fear in a community already blighted by conflict and marginalisation, PEN International emphasised.</p>
<p>“In light of the severe risk posed by the Taliban, the undersigned organisations call on the government of Pakistan to immediately suspend its ‘Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan’.</p>
<p>“We also call on the international community to ensure safe and legal passage for Afghan refugees and asylum seekers, including writers, journalists, artists, human rights defenders, and others at risk of persecution for their peaceful expression.</p>

            <p><p>The Saudi government on Wednesday announced that its 937 Health Call Centre was now offering multilingual support to Haj pilgrims around the clock, including in Urdu.</p>
<p>Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870331">highest</a> Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>According to a press release from the Saudi Embassy, the call centre “plays a vital role in the Kingdom’s healthcare response during Haj.”</p>
<p>“The centre is designed to enhance access to health services, offer medical guidance, and ensure [a] timely response to emergencies,” the press release read.</p>
<p>“Available 24/7, the centre provides a wide range of services including real-time medical consultations, emergency assistance, handling of complaints, guidance on accessing health facilities, and support in locating missing or hospitalised pilgrims.”</p>
<p>The press release stated that the call centre operates in seven major languages: Urdu, Arabic, English, French, Indonesian, Farsi, and Turkish. This ensures “smooth, responsive, and inclusive service delivery regardless of nationality”, according to the statement.</p>
<p>The Saudi Ministry of Health called on all Haj pilgrims to utilise the services of the call centre, reaffirming it was ready to respond to all inquiries and medical emergencies.</p>
<p>The ministry underscored that these efforts are part of a broader strategy “to uphold the health, safety, and dignity of every pilgrim throughout their sacred journey”.</p>
<p>Last week, the ministry launched a health awareness kit, including one in Urdu, to promote the health and well-being of Haj pilgrims.</p>
<p>In a post on X, the Saudi health ministry said that the kit was available in eight languages. “In all languages, we care about pilgrims’ health. Explore the health awareness kit to promote health and well-being among pilgrims,” the post said.</p>

<p>The multilingual kit contained essential information for pilgrims, such as: preventing heat-related illnesses and managing health in extreme conditions, required vaccinations (meningitis, Covid-19, polio and yellow fever), managing chronic diseases, and accessing free health services during Haj. It also included short videos, social media assets, and printable posters.</p></p>
