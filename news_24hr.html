            <p><p>At least nine people have died as floods and landslides triggered by heavy rain continue to wreak havoc on Gilgit Baltistan, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as the region experienced cloudburst-induced floods that claimed lives and damaged infrastructure. On Monday, floods triggered by heavy rain <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> through GB’s Babusar area in Diamer district and Naran, leaving many stranded. Subsequently, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/pmd-issues-glof-alert-for-gb-kp-as-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-from-diamer-amid-floods">issued</a> a landslide alert for the northern areas of the country.</p>
<p>GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq, in a statement, confirmed that nine people have lost their lives in the floods and landslides across the region — including two women and two children — while the search for people swept away by the flood is still underway.</p>
<p>In his statement, he estimated that the “number of people swept away by floodwater could be around 12-14.” On the other hand, more than a dozen people were reported to be injured in the floods.</p>
<p>“Over 300 stranded tourists have been rescued so far,” he said, adding that rescue operations have been challenging as floods and landslides continue to ravage parts of the region.</p>
<p>Detailing the property damage caused by floods and landslides, he stated, “In total, more than 500 houses have been destroyed due to the floods and about 12 kilometres of roads have been destroyed as well.”</p>

<p>He went on to say: “A total of 27 bridges and 22 vehicles were also destroyed by the floodwaters across the region, along with countless shops, cattle sheds and logs of timber.”</p>
<p>Both the Pakistan Army and GB scouts played an active role in the rescue and search operation, he said.</p>
<p>“Efforts are also underway to provide water and electricity to thousands of people who are now deprived of these facilities as a result of damage to the water supply and electricity grids,” Faraq said in his statement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a search operation was underway to find the body of 17-year-old Arman, who was swept away while crossing a nullah in Gujar Khan on Wednesday, a Rescue 1122 official said on Friday.</p>
<p>“Rescue divers have combed through an area 12 km from the site of the accident without any success”, District Emergency Officer Rescue 1122 Rawalpindi Sibghatullah said in a statement.</p>
<p>“The heirs of the victim have expressed their satisfaction over the rescue efforts,” he added.</p>
<p>On Thursday, residents of the housing society where the teenager lived blocked Rawalpindi’s Grand Trunk Road after the rescue teams could not recover the body.</p>
<p>The boy was walking on a small passage when high-speed torrents swept him away in deep waters.</p>
<p>Two of his relatives jumped into the water to rescue him, but they told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the water was moving at high speed and the boy could not be saved.</p></p>

            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar arrived in Washington, DC on Thursday night, on the second leg of his eight-day visit to the United States, the Foreign Office said in a statement.</p>
<p>Dar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925622">arrived</a> in New York on Monday to attend “high-level signature events” of Pakistan’s United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency, including a conference on Palestine.</p>
<p>Upon arrival in the US capital, the foreign minister was received by Ambassador of Pakistan to the US, Rizwan Saeed Sheikh and senior embassy officials, the Foreign Office said on X.</p>
<p>Dar is scheduled to meet his counterpart, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, for a bilateral meeting at the Department of State on Friday, the FO said.</p>
<p>“The meeting will discuss important facets of Pak-US relations, exploring ways and means to strengthen bilateral ties, with a particular focus on promoting trade, investment and economic cooperation,” FO said.</p>
<p>He is also scheduled to speak at the US think tank, The Atlantic Council, “sharing Pakistan’s perspective on regional and global issues as well as the future of Pak-US relations.”</p>

<p>Dar’s visit comes as Pakistan holds the presidency of the UNSC this month. Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921308">assumed</a> the UNSC presidency for July, marking its first presidency since 2013. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026.</p>
<p>Addressing a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926068">reception</a> hosted by Pakistan’s Mission in New York on Wednesday, Dar called for an inclusive dialogue and cooperative diplomacy over confrontation amid growing turbulence across the world.</p>
<p>The deputy PM asserted that Pakistan’s leadership has been guided by “these very principles in both deliberations and concrete actions taken during its tenure”.</p>
<p>The UNSC unanimously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925923">adopted</a> Pakistan-sponsored <a class="link--external" href="https://press.un.org/en/2025/sc16125.doc.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Resolution 2788</a>, calling for the strengthening of international mechanisms to settle disputes through peaceful means.</p>
<p>Dar also announced Pakistan was seeking a seat at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for the 2026-2028 term, with the Asia-Pacific Group endorsing its candidacy. Pakistan last <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1584934">held</a> the membership from 2020 to 2023.</p>
<h1><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#gaza-ceasefire" id="gaza-ceasefire" title="Permalink"></a>Gaza ceasefire</h1>
<p>Chairing the UNSC’s Quarterly Open Debate on the “Situation in the Middle East including the Palestinian Question”, Dar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926099">urged</a> the UNSC and the international community to bring about an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, along with unrestricted humanitarian access amid a food crisis in the besieged territory.</p>
<p>“It is time to give the Palestinian people what they have been denied for too long: justice, freedom, dignity, and a state of their own. That is the path to durable peace and stability in the Middle East,” FM Dar said.</p>
<p>He emphasised that the path to lasting peace lay in upholding international law, ending foreign occupation, rejecting the use of force and advancing solutions through dialogue and diplomacy.</p></p>

            <p><p>A terrorist attack on the Basia Khel police station in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district was successfully foiled, with the attackers forced to flee after a swift response by security personnel, a statement issued on Friday said.</p>
<p>Bannu Police Spokesperson, Aamir Khan, told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “A big group of terrorists attacked the Basia Khel police station in the early hours of Friday using heavy weapons. However, the cops present at the police station bravely thwarted the attack.”</p>
<p>Terming the attack “cowardly”, he added that all the police personnel present at the station were safe.</p>
<p>“Station House Officer (SHO) Asmatullah Khan Niazi led the operation, and the collective and timely response of the police team forced the terrorists to flee,” said Khan.</p>
<p>Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan and District Police Officer Saleem Abbasi commended the Basia Khel police station personnel for “braving the situation and responding promptly to protect the police station and their colleagues from harm”, the statement said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">witnessed</a> a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces.</p>
<p>Attacks increased after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">broke</a> a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a>, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu this <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773/3-terrorists-killed-during-joint-operation-in-kps-bannu-police">month</a>.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a Frontier Corps (FC) constable <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926334">was killed</a> and two others were injured when terrorists attacked their vehicle in the Daryoba area of Bannu.</p>
<p>Six Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926062/terrorist-attack-injures-5-fc-personnel-in-kps-bannu-police">also injured</a> on Wednesday in a “terrorist attack” at a checkpoint in Bannu, according to a police spokesperson.</p>
<p>On Monday, a police official identified as Constable Hayatullah was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925895/police-constable-martyred-in-bannu-terrorist-attack">martyred</a> when terrorists attacked him in the district while he was returning home from duty.</p>
<p>On July 21, over a dozen terrorists <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1925535">attacked</a> a police station in the Bakkakhel town of Bannu. However, the cops responded effectively and thwarted their nefarious plan to take over the building. The police also thwarted a sabotage bid by defusing explosives in the Ghoriwala town of Bannu. An official said the explosives were seized during an intelligence-based operation in the area.</p>
<p>On July 19, two police officials, including an officer, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925051">injured</a> when terrorists carried out a quadcopter attack on Bannu’s Miryan police station.</p></p>
