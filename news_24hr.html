            <p><p>A teenager was killed while seven others were wounded after government offices came under attack by “India-backed” terrorists in Balochistan’s Mastung district on Tuesday, the provincial government said.</p>
<p>The military has said India was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">using its “assets”</a> to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, with ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry detailing “irr­e­futable evidence” of an Ind­ian military personnel’s involvement.</p>
<p>“Two terrorists were killed while another three were injured in an intense fire exchange between the security forces and the terrorists,” Balochistan spokesperson Shahid Rind said in a statement.</p>
<p>“<em>Fitna al Hindustan</em> attacked the tehsil office, government offices and a bank. A 16-year-old boy died while seven individuals were injured by the terrorists’ firing,” the statement read.</p>
<p>The term “<em>Fitna al Hindu­stan</em>” is a new phrase coined by Pakistan’s military, aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>

<p>“The Frontier Constabulary, Counter-Terrorism Department and Levies immediately cordoned off the area, crushing the terrorists,” Rind asserted.</p>
<p>An intense fire exchange occurred after the security forces “encircled” the terrorists, the government spokesperson added.</p>
<p>Action against the perpetrators was ongoing while a clearance operation was also underway, according to the statement.</p>
<p>Militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in the country last month, according to data <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914847/militant-attacks-increased-to-85-in-may-pakistan-institute-for-conflict-and-security-studies">released</a> by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, which recorded 85 attacks in May compared to 81 in April.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>

            <p><p>Bullish momentum continued at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday as the market crossed the 128,000 barrier on the first day of the new fiscal year 2025-26.</p>
<p>The KSE-100 index rose by 2404.51 points, or 1.9 per cent, to stand at 128,031.82 points at 12:15pm, from the last close of 125,627.31 points.</p>
<p>Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, attributed the rise to easing geopolitical tensions and the market “pricing in a gradual decline in interest rates alongside improving economic stability”.</p>
<p>“Investors are also anticipating a strong corporate results season and are rerating the market’s price-to-earnings ratio toward more normalised levels, the analyst said.</p>
<p>He added that in his opinion, the market had entered phase two of the bull run — characterised by increasing public participation and a broad-based rally across a wide range of stocks.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said investors are increasing exposure in equities from fixed income due to the higher taxation rate imposed on fixed income in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920303">recent budget</a>, choosing high-dividend-yield stocks.</p>
<p>“Continuation of monetary easing due to falling inflation driven by fiscal discipline, strong external account and focus on structural reforms would keep equities in limelight,” Ashraf said.</p>
<p>He anticipated that sectors benefiting from monetary easing and structural reforms, particularly related to the energy chain, would remain prominent.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the PSX <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921314/psx-ends-fy25-at-record-high-on-china-loan-boost">ended</a> the final session of the outgoing fiscal year on a bullish note, with the benchmark KSE-100 index soaring to a record high above 125,000. The rally was driven by aggressive buying at attractive valuations and strong year-end fund flows.</p>
<p>Also on Monday, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921312/government-sees-exports-rising-inflation-at-5-7pc-in-fy26">projected</a> a positive export outlook and a moderate rise in inflation to a range of 5-7 per cent for 2025-26, citing improved global economic conditions and domestic recovery trends.</p>
<p>In its Monthly Economic Update and Outlook for June, the Ministry of Finance said Composite Leading Indicators (CLIs) of Pakistan’s major trading partners — including the UK, US, Eurozone and China — were all operating above their long-term average of 100, suggesting a likely increase in demand for Pakistani exports.</p>
<p>For June, inflation is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921197/countrys-june-inflation-likely-to-remain-between-3-4pc-finance-ministry">expected</a> to remain between 3–4pc. The ministry also forecast a positive outlook for Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) in the coming months, driven by robust trends in cement despatches and automobile sales. “The uptick in private sector credit reflects growing production activity and improved investor confidence,” the report said.</p></p>

            <p><p>Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) has offered students to resit exams in the November session free of charge if they were affected by any of the three exam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912939/mailbox">papers leaked</a> in the recent May/June session.</p>
<p>The CIE board, which conducts O- and A-level exams, <a class="link--external" href="https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/candidates-and-their-families/?utm_campaign=VSI&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">admitted</a> last month that parts of its question papers for examinations in June had been leaked, and that said students will be given extra marks for those questions.</p>
<p>Just days prior to CIE’s admission of the leaks, a parliamentary panel was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916604">assured</a> on that findings of the inquiry report over the issue of alleged paper leaks of O/A level would be shared after June 16.</p>
<p>In a post on its Facebook page on Monday, CIE shared an update for students  who sat one or more of the three affected papers in the June 2025 exam series: Cambridge International AS and A Level Mathematics Paper 12, Cambridge International AS and A Level Mathematics Paper 42, and Cambridge International AS and A Level Computer Science Paper 22.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>“The results for these syllabuses will be released as normal,” CIE said.</p>
<p>“We’re offering free syllabus entry resits in the upcoming November 2025 exam series for students who sat one or more of the three affected papers in June 2025.</p>
<p>“We have sent a message to all candidates and their families through schools and will provide further information following the release of our June 2025 exam series results,” CIE added.</p>
<p>“Candidates are asked to contact their schools should they have further questions, and thank you once again to all students and families.”</p>
<p>While the May/June session was ongoing, students and parents had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911630">complained</a> of several papers being scheduled on the same day and demanded a revision in the date, claiming pressure on candidates who had to sit two or even three exams in one day.</p></p>
