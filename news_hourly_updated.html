                <h2>Death toll in Lyari building collapse stands at 27 as rescue operation ends on 3rd day</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Rescuers on Sunday concluded their operation to recover people from the site of a five-storey building which collapsed in Karachi earlier this week, with the final death toll standing at 27.</p>
<p>Rescue teams worked overnight on Friday to pull out more bodies from the rubble of the building situated in Lyari on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe rescue operation was completed on Sunday evening,‚Äù Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>. ‚ÄúNo more human casualties have been found; thus, the total death toll stands at 27 people, whose bodies were earlier recovered and transported to Civil Hospital Karachi.‚Äù</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that acting Rescue 1122 Director General Dr Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh remained on the ground for over 30 hours, directly commanding the rescue operation.</p>
<p>Khan said that the exact cause of the collapse would be determined later, but suggested it was ‚Äúbecause the building was dilapidated‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA day before the collapse, residents felt a ‚Äòshock‚Äô. It can be said now that it was not an earthquake, but the building‚Äôs structure being shaken or dislocated,‚Äù Khan said. ‚ÄúThere were 12 families, though some families had already left the building after the tremors.‚Äù</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#difficulties" id="difficulties" title="Permalink"></a>Difficulties</h2>
<p>The Rescue-1122 spokesperson said that there was a lack of coordination among different rescue organisations and that staffers from two private rescue organisations fought during the operation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey sustained injuries to the head during the scuffle,‚Äù Khan said. ‚ÄúIt would have been more appropriate if one organisation had been given command, under which all rescue institutions could have worked.‚Äù</p>
<p>Another problem, according to Khan, was that relatives remained at the site as they were not willing to be moved to any government or private shelter. The rescue workers faced ‚Äúimmense pressure‚Äù from the relatives, he added.</p>
<p>Khan added that there was difficulty in moving heavy machinery like cranes due to the narrow streets.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe used the same high-tech equipment that was used during the recent earthquake in Turkiye,‚Äù Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>. ‚ÄúThe use of such high-tech equipment, like life detectors helped rescue several people safely with some minor injuries. Without this equipment, the use of heavy machinery might have caused further injury.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that over 100 personnel took part in the operation for three days, working in different shifts.</p>
<p>At around 1:30pm, Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>, ‚Äúit will take five to six more hours to complete the rescue operation‚Äù.</p>
<p>A total of 27 bodies were recovered, including nine women, 15 men, a 13-year-old child, a 10-year-old child, and a one-year-old infant. The bodies were transported to Civil Hospital Karachi by Edhi Ambulance.</p>
<p>Ten people who were injured have been discharged.</p>
<p>While speaking to the media today after leading the Ashura procession, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah provided details on the building collapse.</p>
<p>‚ÄúImmediate rescue efforts were launched to save any survivors trapped under the rubble,‚Äù he said, adding that the bodies recovered had been handed over to the families.</p>
<p>He echoed Khan‚Äôs statement of rescue operations being expected to conclude today.</p>
<p>The chief minister assured that a detailed inquiry into the causes of the collapse would be conducted, with committees already formed to investigate the matter thoroughly.</p>
<p>He revealed that over 480 buildings in old city areas, mostly in District South, have been declared dangerous.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe government plans to assist affected residents in finding alternative housing,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>CM Murad added that the recently collapsed building was constructed only a few months ago, apparently without proper approval, and those responsible for unauthorised construction would face strict punishment.</p>
<p>He also urged the public to verify that any building they purchase has proper approval from the Building Control Authority.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that several people resist evacuation due to poverty and lack of alternatives, often buying or renting cheaper properties without checking safety approvals and later demanding government protection.</p>
<p>While empathising with these difficulties, he stressed that sometimes strict action is necessary to ensure public safety, as demonstrated by recent enforcement measures.</p></p>

                <h2>Ashura processions in major cities of country conclude safely</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Yaum-i-Ashura processions in major cities across the country safely concluded on Sunday evening amid tightened security.</p>
<p>Yaum-i-Ashura is observed every year on Muharram 10 with solemnity to pay homage to Imam Husain ‚Äî the grandson of Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) ‚Äî and other martyrs of Karbala.</p>
<p>So far, processions in Karachi, Hyderabad and Punjab have culminated, according to statements from senior officials.</p>
<p>The Ashura procession in Karachi safely culminated at Hussainiya Iraniyan Imam Bargah, with a police update sharing that the head of the procession reached the imam bargah at 6:20pm.</p>
<p>Additional IG Karachi Javed Alam Odho praised the Karachi Police for excellent security arrangements during Muharram, according to a statement from his office.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMajalis and processions were organised at several places in Karachi, including Nishtar Park,‚Äù he was quoted as saying, expressing appreciation for the Traffic Police for arranging alternative routes for the convenience of the general public during the main procession.</p>
<p>Additional IG Odho also thanked media representatives, procession organisers, mourners and other institutions for their cooperation, according to the statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah expressed his satisfaction over the peaceful end of Ashura and thanked the interior minister, police and Rangers for ‚Äúfoolproof‚Äù security arrangements and the local government minister, Karachi mayor and relevant staff for providing facilities, according to a statement from his office.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe peaceful conclusion of Ashura processions across Sindh is the government‚Äôs success,‚Äù Shah was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúDespite high security concerns, the Sindh Police did an excellent job, and the government made every effort to provide all facilities to the mourners.‚Äù</p>

<p>Shah praised the role of religious scholars in maintaining religious harmony, calling their role ‚Äúcommendable‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSindh is the land of Sufis. We are advocates of peace,‚Äù Shah stated.</p>
<p>Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar also congratulated Sindh Police for their excellent security strategy and performance during Ashura.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring this important occasion, security measures taken by all units of the Sindh Police, including the Traffic Police and Special Branch Police at the provincial level from Muharram 1 to Ashura, are commendable at every level,‚Äù he was quoted as saying in a statement.</p>
<p>Lanjar also praised and appreciated the performance of Rangers Sindh and other security agencies on this occasion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the central Ashura procession in Hyderabad culminated peacefully at Karbala Dadan Shah.</p>
<p>Every year, the procession departs from Qadam Gah Maula Ali and is managed by Anjuma-i-Hyderi, which was founded in 1948.</p>
<p>The entire route was sealed since the early morning with barbed wire, while police and Rangers personnel were deployed.</p>
<p>The procession reached St Mary‚Äôs Convent School roundabout, where mourners performed zohrain prayers. Subsequently, a majlis was addressed a small distance from the roundabout by Syed Wasim Hyder Zaidi, according to an Anjuman-i-Hyderi spokesman.</p>
<p>A majlis was also addressed by Allama Irfan Ali Kazmi before the procession departed from Qadam Gah.</p>
<p>The procession was delayed by over an hour at St Mary‚Äôs Chowk and passed the area at 5.15pm instead of the usual time of 4pm. This area also connects the route of the tazia procession from the city.</p>
<p>Police arrangements for security were also weak. No strict checking was seen and everyone was allowed to reach the procession route, especially from Universal Book Depot point. Some policemen who were initially seen for security purpose disappeared subsequently.</p>
<p>Deputy Inspector General Tariq Dharejo, Senior Superintendent of Police Adeel Chandio and Deputy Commissioner Zain Ul Abidin monitored the proceedings in the control room set up in the City police station.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a statement from the Punjab government stated that processions were culminating safely in multiple cities across the province. Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif congratulated her team, including Salman Rafique, ministers, institutions and others, for the ‚Äúexcellent arrangements‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor the first time, we had not only the best Muharram in terms of arrangements but also the most peaceful one,‚Äù Maryam was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúAlong with cleaning the roads, the dirt of hatred was also wiped away.‚Äù</p>
<p>Senior Provincial Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, accompanied by other ministers, arrived at the bridge of the Metro Bus Station, leaving Nisar Haveli in Lahore. She also visited the control room established at the Punjab Home Department and reviewed arrangements for Yaum-i-Ashura across the province in detail.</p>
<p>A briefing delivered to Aurangzeb confirmed that the processions were being monitored in real-time through 7,500 cameras across Punjab and that 113,000 personnel were deployed.</p>
<p>Additionally, more than 1,600 ‚Äúhate-spreading accounts‚Äù were reported by the Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãPatrol Cell of the Home Department and 170 people were arrested, according to the briefing.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb was also briefed on the provision of clean water and clean procession routes, where water was sprinkled to cool mourners amid the heat and the spraying of disinfectants was continuous. Mobile toilets were also provided and rescue personnel were on standby in case of emergency.</p>
<p>A coordinated plan was also prepared with the Water and Power Distribution Authority (Wapda) and other institutions for uninterrupted power supply during Yaum-i-Ashura.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Karachi Traffic Police issued a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921828">traffic plan</a> for Muharram 8 to 10, outlining the procession routes as well as alternative traffic flows.</p>
<p>Stringent security measures are being taken across the country, such as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920725/army-to-be-deployed-across-country-for-security-during-muharram">army deployment</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919931">crackdown</a> on sectarian content and hate mongers, ahead of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920308">Ashura</a> (Muharram 10), being observed today.</p>
