            <p><p>US President Donald Trump said US air strikes on Sunday “totally obliterated” Iran’s main nuclear sites, as Washington joined Israel’s war with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.</p>
<p>Condemning the US attacks as a violation of international law, Iran <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/IRIMFA_EN/status/1936675016365515052" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> it was “resolved to defend Iran’s territory, sovereignty, security and people by all force”.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Key developments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>US strikes Iran’s Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites</li>
<li>Iran warns of ‘everlasting consequences’, says US betrayed diplomacy</li>
<li>Pakistan condemns attacks, voices support for Tehran’s right to defend</li>
<li>Democrats criticise decision ‘without Congress approval’</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>The US president had stepped up his rhetoric against Iran since Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">first struck</a> Iran on June 13, repeating his insistence that it could never have a nuclear weapon. Tehran has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a> the claim, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p>
<p>Israel had launched wide-scale air strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences, killing top <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">commanders</a>, scientists and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918702">hundreds</a> others. Both countries have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918048/iran-israel-trade-fresh-air-attacks-as-trump-weighs-us-involvement">traded</a> wave after wave of devastating strikes since then.</p>
<p>In a televised address to the nation from the White House earlier today, Trump warned that the United States would go after more targets if Iran did not make peace quickly.</p>

<p>The intervention by a US president who had vowed to avoid another “forever war” in the region threatens to dramatically widen the conflict, with Iran having said it would retaliate if Washington got involved.</p>
<p>“Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success,” said Trump, adding that they targeted the crucial underground nuclear enrichment plant of Fordo along with facilities at Natanz and Isfahan.</p>
<p>“Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace,” said Trump.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump on the strikes, saying that “the awesome and righteous might of the United States will change history”.</p>

<p>Trump spoke to Netanyahu after the attacks, while the US also gave Israel a “heads up” before the strikes, a senior White House official told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Not long after, sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and explosions were heard from Jerusalem as Iranian state TV announced a fresh salvo of missiles launched.</p>
<p>Tehran said there were “no signs of contamination” after the US attacks and Saudi regulators said “no radioactive effects were detected” in the Gulf region.</p>
<p>Iranian media <a class="link--external" href="https://en.mehrnews.com/news/233460/Official-in-Iran-s-Qom-confirms-attack-on-Fordow-site" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that part of the Fordow plant, as well as the Isfahan and Natanz <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918984/what-are-the-key-sites-in-irans-nuclear-programme">nuclear sites</a>, were attacked.</p>
<p>Trump told <em>Fox News</em>’ Sean Hannity show that <a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/israel-iran-conflict-june-21-2025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">five to six</a> “bunker-buster” bombs were dropped on the deep-underground Fordow facility, while 30 Tomahawk missiles were fired against other nuclear sites.</p>
<p>US B-2 bombers were involved in the strikes, a US official told <em>Reuters</em>, speaking on condition of anonymity. Earlier today, there were reports that <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-b-2-bombers-bunker-busters-alternatives-2025-06-18/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">US B-2 bombers</a> — which carry so-called “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918152/read-why-israel-wants-us-bunker-busters-to-hit-irans-fordow-nuclear-site">bunker buster</a>” bombs — were headed out of the US.</p>
<p>Tehran had threatened reprisals on US forces in the Middle East if Trump attacked.</p>

<p>Denouncing the US attacks as “lawless and criminal”, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said his country has a right to defend its sovereignty.</p>
<p>“The events this morning are outrageous and will have everlasting consequences,” he <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/araghchi/status/1936638107169722536" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on X.</p>

<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/IRIMFA_EN/status/1936675016365515052" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> issued by its foreign ministry, Iran strongly condemned the “United States’ brutal military aggression against Iran’s peaceful nuclear facilities”.</p>
<p>It said the US actions — “carried out in collusion with the genocidal Israeli regime— once again laid bare the depth of depravity that governs American foreign policy and revealed the extent of hostility harboured by the US ruling establishment against the peace-seeking and independence-loving people of Iran”.</p>
<p>“The world must not forget that it was the United States that, in the midst of a diplomatic process, betrayed diplomacy by supporting the genocidal and lawbreaking Israeli regime to impose a war of aggression on the Iranian nation,” the ministry said.</p>

<p>Iran called for an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to condemn this “criminal act of aggression”.</p>
<p>It also urged the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which it accused of “evident bias in favour of warmongering parties”, to “carry out its legal responsibility” as Iran’s nuclear facilities were under the agency’s safeguards and monitoring.</p>
<p>It highlighted that the US attacks violated the UN Charter and UNSC’s <a class="link--external" href="https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/en/content/2231/background" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Resolution 2231</a> from 2015 on Iran’s nuclear issue, also terming it a “devastating blow” to the global non-proliferation system.</p>
<p>“Silence in the face of such blatant aggression would plunge the world into an unprecedented level of danger and chaos,” the statement added.</p>
<p>Pakistan also condemned the US attacks, saying it was “gravely concerned at the possible further escalation of tensions in the region”.</p>
<p>“We reiterate that these attacks violate all norms of international law and that Iran has the legitimate right to defend itself under the UN Charter,” a <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by the Foreign Office said.</p>

<p>“The unprecedented escalation of tension and violence, owing to ongoing aggression against Iran, is deeply disturbing. Any further escalation of tensions will have severely damaging implications for the region and beyond,” it warned.</p>
<p>It stressed that “recourse to dialogue, diplomacy, in line with the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, remains the only viable pathway to resolve the crises in the region”.</p>
<p>“We emphasise the imperative need to respect civilian lives and properties and immediately bring the conflict to end. All parties must adhere to international law, particularly International Humanitarian Law,” the statement asserted.</p>

<p>Trump had said on Thursday that he would decide “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918331#:~:text=a%20White%20House%20spokesperson%20said%20the%20president%20would%20make%20a%20decision%20on%20whether%20to%20attack%20Iran%20%E2%80%9Cwithin%20two%20weeks%E2%80%9D">within two weeks</a>” whether to join Israel’s campaign, in a move that many saw as a window of diplomatic opportunity.</p>
<p>But the Republican’s decision to strike Iran came far sooner.</p>
<p>Flanked by Vice President JD Vance, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump said that future attacks would be “far greater” unless Iran reached a diplomatic solution.</p>
<p>“Remember, there are many targets left,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump, however, made no mention of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917243">regime change</a>, despite having warned last week that Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was an “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917651">easy target</a>”.</p>
<p>The US contacted Iran diplomatically yesterday to say the strikes are all the US plans and it does not aim for regime change, <em>CBS News</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-launches-strikes-iranian-nuclear-facilities-trump-says/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20reached%20out%20to%20Iran%20diplomatically%20Saturday%20to%20say%20the%20strikes%20are%20all%20the%20U.S.%20plans%20and%20that%20regime%20change%20efforts%20are%20not%20planned%2C%20the%20sources%20said" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The raid on the Iranian nuclear sites was carried out by <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/b-2-bombers-moving-guam-amid-middle-east-tensions-us-officials-say-2025-06-21/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">B-2 stealth bombers</a> that dropped so-called “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918152/read-why-israel-wants-us-bunker-busters-to-hit-irans-fordow-nuclear-site">bunker buster bombs</a>”, along with submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles, US media <a class="link--external" href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/live-updates/israel-iran-live-updates?id=122881565&amp;entryId=123075528" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114724035571020048" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> earlier on his Truth Social site that a “full payload of bombs” was dropped on Fordow, adding that “all planes are safely on their way home.

<p>“There is not another military in the world that could have done this. Now is the time for peace!” he said.</p>
<p>In another post, the US president called it a “historic moment for the United States of America, Israel, and the world”. “Iran must now agree to end this war,” he <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114724124909451419" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>.</p>

<p>Iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons and says its programme is for civilian purposes only. The IAEA last week Tehran was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914610">in breach</a> of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years.</p>
<p>However, a US intelligence assessment found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was “years away from producing one”, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917691/us-assessment-finds-iran-years-away-from-nuclear-weapon-refutes-israeli-claims">report</a> from <em>CNN</em> released on Tuesday said.</p>
<p>Israel, which is not a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.</p>
<p>Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian had warned yesterday of a “more devastating” retaliation should Israel’s nine-day bombing campaign continue. He said Tehran’s right to pursue a civilian nuclear programme “cannot be taken away … by threats or war”.</p>
<p>Pictures posted by the White House showed Trump in a red “Make America Great Again” cap meeting with top national security officials in the Situation Room, shortly before the strikes were announced.</p>

<p>After the address, Trump warned Iran against “any retaliation”.</p>
<p>However, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard announced earlier today that “suicide drones” had been launched against “strategic targets” across Israel.</p>
<p>Iran and other armed groups have previously attacked US military bases in the region, including in Iraq.</p>
<p>Iran’s Houthi allies in Yemen had yesterday threatened to resume their attacks on US vessels in the Red Sea if Washington joined the war.</p>

<p>The US military strikes on Iran also threaten to cause political tensions at home for Trump.</p>

<p>However, the issue has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918298/prospect-of-iran-strike-exposes-divisions-in-trumps-maga-base">opened a split</a> in Trump’s “MAGA” movement, with many key Republican supporters calling on Trump to avoid embroiling the United States in another foreign war.</p>
<p>Trump’s first <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1295226">2016 election victory</a> in particular came on the back of his promises to get America out of its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Republican <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1936564082477531596" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> said, “There would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first.”</p>
<p>Pointing out that Israel was a nuclear-armed nation, she wrote on X: “This is not our fight.”</p>
<p>“Every time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war,” Greene said.</p>

<p>“We also don’t know if this will lead to further escalation in the region and attacks against our forces, events that could easily pull us even deeper into a war in the Middle East,” he said in a statement.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919022/power-division-instructs-discos-to-take-steps-to-ensure-uninterrupted-electricity-supply-in-muharram' target='_blank'><strong>Power Division instructs Discos to take steps to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply in Muharram</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Power Division on Sunday instructed power distribution companies (Discos) to take measures to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply in the month of Muharram keeping the heat waves in view, according to a press release by the department.</p>
<p>Muharram is a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844220">month</a> of mourning, observed in particular by Shia Muslims worldwide. It commemorates the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD, where amongst many, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), Imam Husain, was martyred, and other family members were martyred or subjected to humiliation.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the Punjab government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918677/section-144-announced-across-punjab-from-muharram-1-10">imposed</a> Section 144 across the province from Muharram 1 to 10 to ensure peace and religious harmony.</p>
<p>Federal Power Minister Awais Leghari, in a letter addressed to the officials of Discos, said, “Since the holy month of Muharram is falling in the month of July and heat waves are expected.</p>
<p>“It is very much imperative that all necessary measures are taken to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply to facilitate religious gatherings and avoid any inconvenience to the public. “</p>
<p>He instructed the Discos to take a series of measures to ensure uninterrupted supply.</p>
<p>This included conducting thorough inspections of all transmission and distribution networks, particularly in areas where majalis and processions are expected. The letter further instructed to ensure the repair of faulty equipment.</p>
<p>It also instructed regarding ensuring keeping emergency response teams on high alert throughout the month and in particular on Muharram 9 and 10 (Ashura).</p>
<p>Leghari also instructed to ensure the availability of standby generators and UPS systems at sensitive locations to provide backup power in case of any unforeseen grid issues.</p>
<p>“Ensure that a sufficient number of transformers and other materials are available in each subdivision, and inventory in this regard should be updated,” the letter read.</p>
<p>The letter further instructed Discos to ensure communication and coordination with local authorities and the public.</p>
<p>“The sanctity of Muharram demands our utmost commitment to serving the public with diligence and respect. Any negligence in this regard will be viewed seriously,” the letter concluded.</p>
<p>Separately, five companies of Pakistan Army and six companies of Rangers will be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918538/army-rangers-to-help-police-maintain-peace-during-muharram">deployed</a> in Rawalpindi to help the administration and police to maintain peace during Muharram.</p>
<p>Arrangements have been finalised for 4,374 majalis and 1,003 processions to be held in the Rawalpindi division.</p>
<p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917858/igp-promises-sectarian-harmony-in-muharram">said</a> earlier in the week that ensuring a peaceful Muharram was a major challenge for his force due to the prevailing security situation in the region.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918781/water-level-in-khanpur-dam-drops-to-critically-low-level' target='_blank'><strong>Water level in Khanpur Dam drops to critically low level</strong></a>
            <p><p>TAXILA: The water level in Khanpur Dam has fallen to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917068">critically low level</a>, just eight feet above the dead level, raising alarms about a looming crisis for its civic beneficiaries of Rawalpindi and Islamabad.</p>
<p>Water supply for irrigation purposes to both KP and Punjab had already been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912223">suspended</a> around a month ago.</p>
<p>According to Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the reservoir level stood at 1918 feet on Saturday which is significantly below the conservation level of 1980 feet and alarmingly close to the dead level of 1910 feet. The inflow into the dam has declined to just 29 cusecs while the outflow is being maintained at 106 cusecs.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>With the plummeted water level, water sports activities in the dam have declined to the lowest level of the year. During high temperatures the dam becomes a favourite tourist destination. Wapda authorities said presently civic agencies of Islamabad and Rawalpindi were receiving only 50 cusecs of water, which was also at the risk of being halted.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Officials are hopeful that onset of monsoon rains will help replenish reservoir</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Khanpur Dam reaches optimal levels during and after the monsoon season. However, changing weather patterns, prolonged dry spells and glacial melt mismanagement have resulted in erratic inflows. In June last year, the reservoir level stood around 1935 feet, with more than double the current inflow.</p>
<p>Officials were however hopeful that the onset of monsoon rains later this month will help replenish the dam’s reserves.</p>
<p>On the other hand, hydrologists blame climate variability, poor catchment management and increased urban demand for the current state of water stress. “This is not just a seasonal anomaly, it is a structural problem that needs long-term planning,” said an irrigation department official.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908900">Khanpur Dam</a> is a primary source of drinking water for Islamabad and Rawalpindi, in addition to irrigating agricultural lands in Haripur district and parts of Punjab. With water storage levels hitting a historic low for mid-June, residents may soon experience interrupted supply, reduced water pressure and increased dependence on tankers.</p>
<p>“Water shortages are already being felt in low-lying areas, where supply hours have been reduced,” said an official of the Capital Development Authority (CDA). “We may have no choice but to initiate emergency water conservation protocols if the situation doesn’t improve in the next two weeks.”</p>
<p>Authorities have appealed to the public to reduce water consumption and avoid unnecessary wastage. Water-intensive activities such as car washing, lawn watering and unnecessary pipeline flushing are being discouraged. At the same time, government agencies are under pressure to review water release protocols and launch public awareness campaigns.</p>
