<p>Iran subsequently issued evacuation warnings for Israeli news channels, Iranian state TV reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIran has issued an evacuation warning for the <em>N12</em> and <em>N14</em> channels of Israel. This order comes in response to the hostile attack of Zionist enemy against the Islamic Republic of Iran‚Äôs broadcasting service,‚Äù state TV said.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs UN Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani told the UNSC that Iran‚Äôs strikes on Israel were self-defence and were ‚Äúproportionate defensive operations directed exclusively at military objectives and associated infrastructure‚Äù.</p>
<p>He wrote in a letter that any cooperation by third countries with Israel‚Äôs strikes on Iran ‚Äúmakes them complicit in the legal responsibility and consequences of this crisis‚Äù. Under Article 51 of the founding United Nations Charter, the 15-member Security Council must immediately be informed of any action that states take in self-defence against armed attack.</p>
<p>Separately, Iranian media outlets <em>IRNA</em> and <em>Mehr</em> claimed that the air defence in Tabriz shot down another Israeli F-35 fighter jet.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis was the 4th Israeli F-35 fighter jet downed by Iran,‚Äù <em>Mehr</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://en.mehrnews.com/news/233230/Iran-destroys-another-Israeli-F-35-fighter-jet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country was ‚Äúon the road to victory‚Äù and claimed that his air force was ‚Äúin control of the skies over Tehran‚Äù, <em>Al Jazeera</em> reported.</p>
<p>Netanyahu made the remarks as he visited the Tel Nof airbase in central Israel, accompanied by Defence Minister Israel Katz and Chief of Staff Lieutenant-General Eyal Zamir, according to the Israeli media.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are on our way to achieving our two objectives: eliminating the nuclear threat and eliminating the missile threat,‚Äù he said. Netanyahu also threatened the citizens of Tehran, telling them to leave Iran‚Äôs capital. ‚ÄúWe are taking action.‚Äù</p>
<p>The latest military exchange between the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916920/a-timeline-of-the-long-standing-conflict-between-israel-and-iran">arch-rivals</a> began when Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/israel-launches-strikes-on-iran">struck</a> Iran‚Äôs nuclear and military sites on Friday, killing top <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">commanders and scientists</a>.

<p>Dangers of further escalation loomed over a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1917383">meeting</a> of G7 leaders in Canada, with US President Donald Trump expressing hope a day ago that a deal could be done, but no sign of the fighting abating on a fourth day of war.</p>
<p>Today, he said that Iran wanted to talk about de-escalating hostilities with Israel, and should do so immediately ‚Äúbefore it‚Äôs too late‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôd say Iran is not winning this war, and they should talk, and they should talk immediately before it‚Äôs too late,‚Äù Trump told reporters at the start of a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.</p>

<p>In turn, Iran called on Trump to force Israel to cease fire as the only way to end the four-day-old aerial war</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf President Trump is genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential,‚Äù Iran‚Äôs Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on X.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIsrael must halt its aggression, and absent a total cessation of military aggression against us, our responses will continue. It takes one phone call from Washington to muzzle someone like Netanyahu. That may pave the way for a return to diplomacy.‚Äù</p>

<p>Sources told <em>Reuters</em> that Tehran had asked Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman to press Trump to use his influence on Israel to agree to an immediate ceasefire. In return, Iran would show flexibility in nuclear negotiations, said the two Iranian and three regional sources.</p>
<p>The foreign ministers from France, Britain and Germany are expected to hold a call with Aragchi soon, a European diplomatic source said.</p>
<p>The three countries, known as the E3, are party to the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran and last week put forward a resolution that was approved by the UN watchdog‚Äôs Board of Governors, which declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted an evacuation order for citizens in Tehran on his X account.</p>
<p>The post ordered citizens living in a specific area of the Iranian capital to ‚Äúleave immediately‚Äù, warning that Israel would attack Iran‚Äôs military infrastructure in the area.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDear citizens, for your safety, please leave the mentioned area in the third district of Tehran immediately,‚Äù the order read, enclosing a map of the city. ‚ÄúYour presence in this area endangers your life.‚Äù</p>

<p>The area marked for evacuation is an upmarket part of the Iranian capital home to at least four hospitals and medical centres, a major police building and state broadcaster <em>IRIB</em>. It also houses several embassies, including those of Qatar, Oman and Kuwait, as well as UN offices and the <em>AFP</em> bureau.</p>

<p>Israeli officials said 11 people were killed by Iranian missiles overnight, taking the overall death toll since the attacks began on Friday to 24.</p>
<p>Israeli attacks in Iran have killed at least 224 people so far, including 70 women and children, while over 1,200 have been injured, the health ministry was quoted as saying earlier today by <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/at-least-224-killed-over-1-000-wounded-in-israeli-strikes-on-iran-health-ministry/3599882" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anadolu Agency</a></em>.</p>
<p>More than 90 per cent of the wounded were civilians, including women and children, health ministry official Hossein Kermanpour <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/HKermanpour/status/1934331936912326671" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X.</p>

<p>The aircraft carrier USS Nimitz was leaving Southeast Asia on Monday after cancelling plans to dock in Vietnam, amid reports it is headed to the Middle East to boost the US presence.</p>
<p>At 1:45pm GMT (6:45pm PKT), the carrier was traveling through the Malacca Strait toward the Indian Ocean, according to Marine Traffic, a ship-tracking site.</p>
<p>A Vietnamese government official confirmed to <em>AFP</em> that a planned reception aboard the USS Nimitz on June 20, as part of the ship‚Äôs expected June 19-23 visit to Danang, had been cancelled.</p>
<p>The official shared a letter from the US embassy announcing that the Defence Department was cancelling the event due to ‚Äúan emergent operational requirement.‚Äù The US Embassy in Hanoi declined to comment to <em>AFP</em>, as did a spokesman for the Nimitz.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amir Moqadam on the sidelines of the International Maritime Expo and Conference in Karachi, a statement from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office said on Monday.</p>
<p>The statement said, ‚ÄúPM [Shehbaz] reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs condemnation of the recent Israeli aggression on Iran and the entire nation‚Äôs sympathy with Iran over the deaths of innocent people.‚Äù</p>
<p>While discussing the current regional situation, the premier expressed Pakistan‚Äôs solidarity with Iran and its people during the tense situation, the statement added.</p>

<p>As the attacks did not seem to halt, Russia and Turkiye offered to facilitate the end of the ongoing war between Israel and Iran.</p>
<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan told his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian in a phone call today that his country ‚Äústands ready to undertake a facilitating role to end the conflicts as soon as possible and return to nuclear negotiations‚Äù.</p>
<p>Erdoƒüan ‚Äúemphasised the importance Turkiye attaches to the preservation of peace and stability in the region‚Äù, the Turkish presidency said.</p>
<p>The Kremlin said Russia remains ready to act as a mediator between Israel and Iran, and that Moscow‚Äôs previous proposal to store Iranian uranium in Russia remains on the table.</p>
<p>Before Israel launched strikes on the Islamic Republic, Russia said last week that it stood ready to remove highly enriched uranium from Iran and convert it into civilian reactor fuel as a potential way to calm the crisis.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis proposal remains on the table, it remains relevant. But, of course, with the outbreak of hostilities, the situation has become seriously complicated,‚Äù Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou know that we condemn those actions that have led to such a dangerous escalation of tension in the region,‚Äù Peskov stated.</p>
<p>He noted that the root causes of the conflict needed to be addressed and eliminated, and that the military strikes were escalating the entire crisis to beyond serious levels.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd secondly, we also note a significant consolidation of society in Iran against the background of the bombing that is currently being carried out by the Israeli side,‚Äù Peskov added.</p>
<p>Stating that Russia ‚Äúremains ready to do everything necessary to eliminate the root causes of this crisis‚Äù, Peskov said the situation was ‚Äúescalating more than seriously, and, of course, this is not affecting the situation for the better‚Äù.</p>
<p>Asked about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs remarks to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/netanyahu-reveals-iran-marked-trump-enemy-number-one-assassination-plot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News</a></em> on Sunday that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917243">regime change</a> in Iran could be a result of Israel‚Äôs military attacks, Peskov said that the Kremlin had seen the remarks.</p>
<p>The statement comes after Trump yesterday cited the possibility that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, could help. Speaking to <a class="link--external" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-us-gets-involved-israel-iran-conflict/story?id=122865561" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>ABC News</em></a>, Trump said he would be open to Putin being a mediator in the conflict. ‚ÄúHe is ready. He called me about it. We had a long talk about it,‚Äù the US president had said.</p>
<p>The European Union said Russia has ‚Äúzero credibility‚Äù as a potential mediator between Iran and Israel after Trump suggested that Putin could play a role.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere has been a recent Russia-Iran partnership agreement, which signals deepening cooperation across multiple areas, including foreign policy and defence,‚Äù EU spokesman Anouar El Anouni said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn light of such, Russia cannot be an objective mediator.‚Äù</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan condemned Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúact of force‚Äù against Iran and called for an immediate cessation of hostilities when they spoke by phone on Monday, the Kremlin said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBoth sides expressed the most serious concern about the ongoing escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict, which has already led to a large number of casualties and is fraught with serious long-term consequences for the entire region,‚Äù a Kremlin statement said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe leaders spoke in favour of an immediate cessation of hostilities and the settlement of contentious issues, including those related to the Iranian nuclear programme, exclusively by political and diplomatic means.‚Äù</p>
<p>The two sides agreed to remain in close cooperation, the statement said.</p>
<p>Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed in a phone call on Monday that the conflict between Iran and Israel must end and room must be made for diplomacy as soon as possible, the Turkish presidency said.</p>
<p>In a statement, the presidency also said Erdogan repeated his view that the only solution to the crisis was a return to nuclear talks.</p>

<p>Israel‚Äôs military warned of a new missile salvo incoming from Iran. ‚ÄúA short while ago, the IDF identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the State of Israel,‚Äù the army posted on Telegram, using the acronym for its official name.</p>
<p>It said its air defences were working to intercept the threat but advised people to ‚Äúenter a protected space and remain there until further notice‚Äù.</p>
<p>Several residential buildings in a densely populated neighbourhood of Tel Aviv were destroyed in a strike that blew out the windows of hotels and other nearby homes just a few hundred metres from the US Embassy branch in the city.</p>
<p>The US ambassador to Israel said the building sustained minor damage, but there were no injuries to personnel.</p>
<p>British maritime security firm Ambrey said that fires were observed at the power plant in the vicinity of Israel‚Äôs Haifa port, <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an Israeli official said after a gag order was lifted that an Iranian missile struck an oil refinery in Haifa on Sunday, killing three people.</p>
<p>The confirmation on Monday removed reporting restrictions imposed by Israel‚Äôs military censorship on the attack.</p>
<p>Thick black smoke could be seen rising from the the sprawling complex early today, according to an <em>AFP</em> journalist.</p>

<p>Iran does not intend to develop nuclear weapons but will pursue its right to nuclear energy and research, President Masoud Pezeshkian said today, reiterating Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1700780">religious edict</a> against weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>Iran had claimed the existence of the <em>fatwa</em> for years before making the text public for the first time in 2010, when it was being accused by the West and Israel of seeking to secretly acquire the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>While asserting that Iran remains opposed to developing weapons of mass destruction, Esmaeil Baghaei, Iran‚Äôs foreign ministry spokesperson, said the Iranian parliament is preparing a bill to leave the nuclear <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1479334">Non-Proliferation Treaty</a> (NPT).</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe have extended a hand of brotherhood to all Islamic nations ‚Äî for they are all our brothers. Today, most, if not all, of them stand with us and by our side,‚Äù he further said.</p>

<p>Iranian state television reported that at least five people were killed on Sunday by an Israeli strike that hit a residential building in downtown Iran.</p>
<p>Colonel Reza Sayyad, a spokesman for Iran‚Äôs armed forces, threatened a ‚Äúdevastating response‚Äù to Israel‚Äôs attacks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLeave the occupied territories (Israel) because they will certainly no longer be habitable in the future,‚Äù he warned in a televised address, adding shelters will ‚Äúnot guarantee security‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to <em>AFP</em>, residential areas in both countries have suffered deadly strikes since the hostilities broke out, with Israel‚Äôs Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slamming Iran on Sunday for allegedly targeting civilians.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIran will pay a very heavy price for the premeditated murder of civilians, women and children,‚Äù he said, during a visit to the site of a missile strike on a residential building in the coastal city of Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>His remarks came hours after Iranian missile fire killed another 10 people yesterday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a likely Iranian drone killed a woman in Syria, a Britain-based war monitor said, in what would be the first death on Syrian soil since the current hostilities between Iran and Israel began, reported <em>AFP.</em></p>

<p>However, seemingly contradicting his ally, Netanyahu claimed that American pilots were shooting down drones headed towards Israel. In the same interview, he also said that he and Trump were ‚Äúfully coordinated‚Äù.</p>
<p>Trump has urged the two foes to ‚Äúmake a deal‚Äù, adding, however, that ‚Äúsometimes they have to <a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-israel-iran-have-fight-out-believes-deal-possible" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fight it out</a>‚Äù first.</p>
<p>Two US officials said on Friday that the US military had helped shoot down Iranian missiles that were headed toward Israel, according to <em>Reuters</em>. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/after-sitting-out-the-iran-attack-u-s-steps-in-to-help-israel-intercept-missiles-16749866" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> the same.</p>
<p>FM Araghchi maintained Tehran had ‚Äúsolid proof‚Äù that US forces had supported Israel in its attacks.</p>
<p>He also told a meeting of foreign diplomats that Iran‚Äôs actions were a ‚Äúresponse to aggression‚Äù. ‚ÄúIf the aggression stops, naturally our responses will also stop,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Iran scrapped <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">planned</a> nuclear <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903561">talks</a> with the United States, saying it was ‚Äúmeaningless‚Äù to negotiate while under fire.</p></p>

                <h2>618 more Pakistanis repatriated from Iran, Iraq amid Middle East crisis</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan on Monday repatriated another 618 nationals from both Iran and Iraq amid Tehran‚Äôs ongoing conflict with Israel, according to the Foreign Office (FO) and a district official in Balochistan.</p>
<p>A day ago, the government was able to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917308/450-pakistani-pilgrims-evacuated-from-iran-more-to-follow-dar">repatriate</a> 450 <em>zaireen</em> (pilgrims) from Iran, with more to follow from the neighbouring country as well as from Iraq. Arrangements were made for the safe evacuation of Pakistani students currently residing in Iran, including 154 in the first batch.</p>
<p>The move came after Israel launched an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/israel-launches-strikes-on-iran">air offensive</a> against Iran on Friday, killing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">commanders and scientists</a> and bombing nuclear sites in a stated bid to stop Tehran from building an atomic weapon, which the latter has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a>, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p>
<p>Around 350 Pakistani pilgrims stranded in Iran returned to their homeland on Monday after crossing the border at Taftan, according to a district official in Balochistan.</p>
<p>Chagai Deputy Commissioner Attaul Muneem told <em>Dawn.com</em> that 350 Pakistanis, including 45 students and 305 pilgrims, crossed the border and that arrangements have been made to house them at Pakistan House in Taftan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe pilgrims and students who have arrived are being sent to Quetta,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>In a statement from his office, Muneem said that Pakistanis stranded in Iran are attempting to cross the land border due to the conflict.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe district administration is arranging medical care, food, accommodation and travel facilities in Taftan so that Pakistanis returning from Iran do not face any difficulties,‚Äù the DC was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the FO successfully repatriated 268 Pakistani <em>zaireen</em> through two special flights from the Iraqi city of Basra to Karachi and Islamabad, according to a statement.</p>
<p>The ministry said it is working closely with Iraqi Airways and Iraqi authorities to repatriate the <em>zaireen</em> and ensure their ‚Äúsafe and timely return‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll Pakistani <em>zaireen</em> currently in Iraq are advised to remain in close contact with the Pakistan Embassy in Baghdad, designated <em>mandoobs</em> (representatives) and their respective airlines for timely updates regarding their travel arrangements,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>The FO said that Iraqi Airways is operating daily flights on the Basra‚ÄìDubai route, which the <em>zaireen</em> used to return to Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThose interested in travelling via this route are encouraged to contact the nearest Iraqi Airways office for booking and assistance,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll <em>zaireen</em> are further advised to remain prepared for travel at short notice,‚Äù the FO said, adding that it is monitoring the situation closely and ‚Äúremains fully committed to facilitating the safe and orderly return of all Pakistani <em>zaireen</em>‚Äù.</p>
<p>On the day of the Israeli strikes, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916926">directed</a> all relevant authorities to provide every possible assistance for the safe return and protection of Pakistani <em>zaireen</em> in Iran following Israel‚Äôs deadly strikes.</p>
<p>In light of the PM‚Äôs directives, a Crisis Management Cell was established at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to monitor the situation and coordinate efforts.</p>
<p>The Pakistani Embassy in Iran has also been instructed to remain vigilant and actively assist the pilgrims. Earlier today, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar shared the embassy‚Äôs hotline number: (0098)-2166941388.</p></p>
