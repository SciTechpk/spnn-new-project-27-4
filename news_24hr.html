            <p><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday issued an alert for heavy rainfall in several parts of the country, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northeast Punjab, Azad Kashmir and parts of Balochistan, for the next two days.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1852031#:~:text=Monsoon%20rains%20across%20the%20region%20from%20June%20to%20September%20offer%20respite%20from%20the%20summer%20heat%20and%20are%20crucial%20to%20replenishing%20water%20supplies.%20They%20are%20also%20vital%20for%20agriculture%2C%20and%20therefore%20the%20livelihoods%20of%20millions%20of%20farmers%20and%20food%20security%20for%20South%20Asia%E2%80%99s%20nearly%20two%20billion%20people.">fall across</a> the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. They are also vital for agriculture, and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security for South Asia’s nearly two billion people. However, they also wreak havoc by triggering deadly floods, landslides, and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>The National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922678/19-killed-as-country-braces-for-more-rain">issued</a> an alert for heavy rainfall and a flood-like situation in various parts of the country, while 19 people lost their lives in Balochistan, KP, and the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi due to extreme weather. It said moderate to heavy monsoon rainfall is expected until July 10, particularly in the catchment areas of all major rivers, which will likely cause flash flooding in various regions of Pakistan, according to the NEOC.</p>
<p>In its latest weather update issued today, the Met Office said, “Monsoon rains continue to lash Pakistan, with further downpours expected in upper parts till July 10, 2025.</p>
<p>“Rain-wind/thundershower are expected today (July 8) in Punjab, KP, Azad Kashmir, GB, northeastern and southern Balochistan and Islamabad.”</p>
<p>The Met Office added that “heavy rainfall is also likely at isolated places in Kashmir, northeastern Punjab, Potohar region, and northeastern and southern Balochistan.”</p>
<p>“The public is urged to exercise caution and stay informed as rain continues in the coming days,” the weather agency advised.</p>
<p>The low-lying areas in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Nowshera and Peshawar are expected to be submerged due to heavy rainfall, it warned.</p>
<p>Islamabad and other areas will receive downpours with strong winds and thunderstorms, while Karachi and other areas of Sindh’s coastal belt could receive drizzling or light rainfall, it added.</p>
<p>The advisory warned against flooding in rainwater drains and local streams in Murree, Galliyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Abbottabad, Buner, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Nowshera, Swabi, Mardan, Islamabad/Rawalpindi, D.G. Khan, Kashmir and Baluchistan’s Barkhan, Kohlu, Musakhel, Dera Bugti, Naseerabad, Sibi, Loralai, Zhob, Qalat, Khuzdar, Lasbela, Awaran, Panjgur and Turbat districts.</p>
<p>It cautioned that heavy rainfall and downpours could cause landslides, leading to roadblocks and hurdles in traffic flow in KP districts, Murree, Galliyat and Azad Kashmir.</p>
<p>In the previous 24 hours, several cities recorded heavy to moderate rainfall across Pakistan. In Punjab, Sheikhupura received 48mm, Lahore (City and Airport, 40mm each), Islamabad (Saidpur, 16mm, Zero Point, 12mm, Golra, 9mm), Gujranwala, 6mm, Murree, 5mm, Faisalabad, 4mm, Sialkot, 2mm, Mandi Bahauddin and Hafizabad, 1mm each, and traces of rainfall in Toba Tek Singh, Bahawalnagar, Kasur, and Bahawalpur.</p>
<p>In KP, Balakot received the highest 40mm rainfall, Kakul, 31 mm, Malam Jabba, 17mm, Bannu, 8mm, Lower Dir, 4mm, Cherat, 2mm, Upper Dir, Bajaur, and Ghalanai, 1mm each, and traces of rain in Kalam and Peshawar.</p>
<p>In Sindh, Badin received 4mm of rainfall, Mithi, 2mm, while Jacobabad, Larkana, Hyderabad, and Karachi received traces, while in Balochistan, Kalat received 17mm, Ziarat 12mm, and Lasbella received light rainfall.</p>
<p>In Azad Kashmir, Bandi Abbaspur received 7mm, Muzaffarabad (City 7mm, Airport 6mm), and Rawalakot and Kotli received 1 mm each.</p></p>

            <p><p>As people continue to be evacuated from nearby structures following a deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050">building collapse</a> in Karachi’s congested Lyari neighbourhood that left <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922486/death-toll-in-lyari-building-collapse-stands-at-27-as-rescue-operation-ends-on-3rd-day">27 people dead</a>, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said on Wednesday it would not be possible for the government to provide housing to all residents living in dilapidated buildings.</p>
<p>The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market collapsed on Friday morning, with the rescue operations concluding on Sunday. The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, with the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) saying it had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=SBCA%20says%20issued%20multiple%20prior%20notices%20to%20vacate%20building">issued multiple prior notices</a> to residents to vacate the structure since 2023.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>GeoNews</em>, Memon said that there were 740 dilapidated buildings across Sindh, out of which 51 were in “extremely dangerous” condition, out of which 11 buildings had been vacated.</p>
<p>“Orders have been issued to vacate the others in the next 48 hours for residents’ safety,” Memon said.</p>
<p>“However, it won’t be possible for the government to provide housing to all residents living in dilapidated buildings,” the minister said, adding that there was no such law obligating the government to do so.</p>
<p>“Nonetheless, the government in the past had provided temporary shelters to flood victims and Covid-19 patients for quarantine,” he added.</p>
<p>“Whatever space is available with the government, we will provide that for housing to the most deserving residents who have no other option available [for housing].”</p>
<p>Memon’s comments come a day after the Sindh government announced the suspension of SBCA Director General Ishaque Khuhro over the building collapse.</p>
<p>According to Local Government (LG) Minister Saeed Ghani, other SBCA officials who were suspended included the director, deputy director and building inspectors assigned to Lyari. He also noted that the Sindh government has announced Rs1 million in compensation to the families of the 27 deceased people.</p>
<p>Major opposition parties — the PTI, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and Jamaat-i-Islami — have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922336/sindh-govt-sbca-earn-oppositions-ire-over-lyari-tragedy">condemned</a> the PPP’s Sindh government, the SBCA and other authorities, accusing them of “criminal negligence” that led to the disaster.</p>
<p>They not only demanded compensation and alternative residences for the affected families but also called for the registration of manslaughter cases against the officials responsible for the tragedy.</p>

<p>In April, a 10-year-old girl <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907402/minor-girl-dies-in-building-collapse">died</a> when a three-storey building in Bhains Colony suddenly collapsed, while a man and a woman were pulled alive from the debris.</p>
<p>In October 2023, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1780534/five-killed-as-another-building-going-up-illegally-collapses">five people</a> were killed and four others injured when an under-construction building collapsed in Shah Faisal Colony.</p>
<p>The city witnessed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1579454/2-killed-10-injured-as-second-building-collapses-in-karachi-in-less-than-72-hours">two</a> such <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1578939">incidents</a> within 72 hours in September 2020, claiming the lives of at least three people and injuring over a dozen.</p>
<p>Lyari also faced a similar incident in June 2020, when <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1562672">22 people</a> were killed after a five-storey residential building housing about 40 apartments <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1561975/1-dead-4-injured-after-residential-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari-neighbourhood?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20dawn-news%20%28Dawn%20News%29">collapsed</a>.</p>
<p>A building collapse in Karachi’s Gulbahar area in March 2020 killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1539325">27 people</a>. A similar 2011 incident in Lyari’s Musa Lane neighbourhood took <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/650268/death-toll-from-karachi-building-collapse-at-33">33 lives</a>.</p></p>

            <p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he has nominated Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, presenting the US president with a letter he sent to the prize committee.</p>
<p>The move comes as Israel continues its onslaught on Gaza, which has so far killed 57,523 Palestinians. Last year, the UN-backed International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1874034">issued</a> arrest warrants for Netanyahu, citing allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court said he, along with ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, “intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival”, including food, water, medicine, fuel, and electricity.</p>
<p>“He’s forging peace as we speak, in one country, in one region after the other,” Netanyahu said at a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922520">dinner</a> with Trump at the White House.</p>

<p>Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514">nominations</a> from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years and has made no secret of his irritation at missing out on the prestigious award.</p>
<p>The Republican has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514#:~:text=Trump%20complains%20about%20not%20getting%20Nobel%20prize%20for%20%E2%80%98stopping%E2%80%99%20multiple%20wars">complained</a> that he had been overlooked by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">mediating role</a> in conflicts between India and Pakistan, as well as Serbia and Kosovo.</p>
<p>In 2024, he <a class="link--external" href="https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/trump-grumbles-about-obama-s-nobel-peace-prize-and-claims-he-deserved-it-more/ar-AA1sVZiM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">insisted</a> that he was more deserving of a Nobel than ex-president Barack Obama, and complained how it was unfair that “anybody else” but him would have been honoured with one.</p>
<p>In June, Pakistan had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514/govt-to-recommend-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize-for-decisive-diplomatic-intervention-in-india-pakistan-crisis">decided</a> to formally recommend Trump for the coveted prize, given his role in de-escalating the India-Pakistan conflict when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">US mediation</a>.</p>
<p>However, as the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">joined</a> Israel’s war with Iran and launched attacks on three Iranian nuclear facilities, Pakistani lawmakers, activists, authors and ex-diplomats <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919128/fazl-others-urge-govt-to-review-decision-to-nominate-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize">criticised the move</a>.

<p>A day earlier, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PressSec/status/1942291101811106169" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that Trump has delivered “wins for the American people” and referenced

<p>Trump has also demanded credit for “keeping peace” between Egypt and Ethiopia and brokering the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements aiming to normalise relations between Israel and several Arab nations.</p>
<p>He campaigned for office as a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20what%20I%20want%20to%20be%3A%20a%20peacemaker%20and%20unifier.">peacemaker</a>” who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging more than five months into his presidency.</p></p>
