<p>After months of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917469/fact-check-trump-netanyahu-viral-comments-about-pakistan-on-iran-israel-clash-are-fake">attacking</a> Gaza ‚Äî flattening homes, targeting hospitals, and starving a besieged population ‚Äî Israel expanded its assault by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">launching</a> wide-scale air strikes against Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences on June 13, killing top commanders, scientists and civilians. A day earlier, President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">said</a> US air strikes  ‚Äútotally obliterated‚Äù Iran‚Äôs main nuclear sites, as Washington joined <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919362/we-will-end-this-war-iran-warns-gambler-trump">Israel‚Äôs war</a> with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.</p>
<p>The strikes on Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities, which came four days after Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917868">meeting</a> with Trump and a day after the government said it decided to formally recommend Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize for his role during the recent conflict with India, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919259/pakistan-backed-security-council-resolution-seeks-immediate-de-escalation">condemned</a> by Pakistan. A meeting of the NSC,  the highest forum for security deliberations comprising the civil and military top brass, was subsequently convened.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif chaired the meeting, with Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir also attending the important moot, and reviewed the evolving regional situation following the Israeli aggression against Iran.</p>

<p>Sources in the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office had told <em>Dawn</em> that Field Marshal Munir would brief the committee on the details of his meeting with Trump.</p>
<p>A press release from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office said: ‚ÄúThe committee strongly condemned Israel‚Äôs acts of aggression and expressed regret that these military attacks coincided with a constructive negotiation process between Iran and the US. These reckless actions have escalated tensions, threatening to ignite a wider conflict and diminishing the opportunities for dialogue and diplomacy. The NSC reaffirmed Iran‚Äôs right to self-defence as enshrined in the UN Charter.‚Äù</p>
<p>The committee members also conveyed their condolences to the Iranian government and people on the loss of innocent lives and offered prayers for the recovery of those injured.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile reiterating Pakistan‚Äôs stated position, the NSC expressed grave concern over the potential for further escalation after the attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan on June 22 which violated the resolutions of the International Atomic Energy Agency, relevant international law and the UN Charter.‚Äù</p>
<p>The committee members also reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs close engagement with relevant parties in the situation and endorsed the government‚Äôs readiness to continue efforts and initiatives aimed at promoting regional peace and stability.</p>
<p>The NSC called on all relevant parties to resolve the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy in line with the UN Charter, underscoring the need to adhere to international human rights and humanitarian laws.</p>

<p>The US president had stepped up his rhetoric against Iran since Israel first struck the country, repeating his insistence that it could never have a nuclear weapon. Tehran has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a> the claim, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p>
<p>Condemning the US attacks as a violation of international law, Iran said it was ‚Äúresolved to defend Iran‚Äôs territory, sovereignty, security and people by all force‚Äù. It also responded with a volley of missiles at Israel that wounded scores of people in Tel Aviv.</p></p>

                <h2>FM Dar arrives in UAE to lead 12th JMC meeting</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday arrived in the UAE for the upcoming <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916924">12th session</a> of the Pakistan-UAE Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC) to be held in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>The 12th session of Pak-UAE JMC is being held following a hiatus of <a class="link--external" href="https://www.moib.gov.pk/News/64780" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">13 years</a> after it was scheduled in October 2024. The <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/11th-session-of-pakistan-uae-joint-ministerial-commission" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">last session</a> was held in Islamabad from 6-7 November 2013.</p>
<p>According to a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1937125230868361589" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by the Foreign Office (FO), Dar will lead the Pakistan delegation to the meeting scheduled on June 24.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe JMC serves as the highest institutionalised platform for bilateral cooperation between Pakistan and the UAE. The upcoming session will take forward the agenda of deepening strategic, economic and development cooperation between the two brotherly countries,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>It said that the delegation ‚Äúwill comprise secretaries and senior officials from key ministries including Economic Affairs, Commerce, Energy, Maritime Affairs and Interior‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe UAE side will be led by Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, along with high-level representation from relevant Emirati institutions,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>FO also said that the session will discuss progress across different areas of bilateral cooperation and explore new avenues for collaboration in trade, investment, energy, infrastructure development and IT.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA number of legal instruments are expected to be finalised during the session to institutionalise sectoral cooperation.‚Äù</p>
<p>The statement added, ‚ÄúThe session will provide an important opportunity for both sides to align their economic priorities and unlock the potential of enhancing [the] scope of mutually beneficial partnership.‚Äù</p>
<p>Dar also <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MIshaqDar50/status/1937035807627317435" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X that he had reached the UAE to lead Pakistan‚Äôs delegation at the JMC meeting.</p>
<p>The UAE is Pakistan‚Äôs third-largest trading partner after China and the United States, is home to more than a million Pakistani expatriates, and is the second-largest source of remittances to the South Asian country after Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Pakistan‚Äôs Ambassador to the UAE, Faisal Tirmizi, had said that the bilateral trade between Pakistan and the UAE <a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvworld/newsdetail/4542" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exceeded</a> US$10.9 billion in the fiscal year 2023‚Äì24, including goods and services.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916754/pm-shehbaz-discusses-regional-peace-bilateral-ties-with-uae-leadership">met</a> UAE President and Ruler of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan during his official one-day visit to the Gulf state, where he discussed matters of bilateral and regional interest.</p>
<p>The high-level engagement aimed at reaffirming Pakistan‚Äôs gratitude to friendly nations that supported Islamabad‚Äôs position during its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">recent standoff</a> with New Delhi.</p></p>
