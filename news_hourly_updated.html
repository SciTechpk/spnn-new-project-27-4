                <h2>JUI-F chief Fazl advises ‚Äòchange‚Äô in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa administration</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Saturday suggested that there should be a ‚Äúchange‚Äù in the PTI-led Khyber Pakht¬≠un¬≠khwa government, adding that it would be better if the change came from within the ruling party amid reports of possible efforts afoot to bring a ‚Äúregime change‚Äù in the province.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921763">met</a> two key leaders from the province, ostensibly to get a handle on the political situation. The PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre believes that the PTI government in KP has failed to deliver for over a decade, and recent events have further cemented their conviction that the provincial government is failing to safeguard the lives of the people. Meanwhile, the PTI has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921760/pti-warns-against-attempt-to-topple-provincial-set-up">warned</a> against any attempt to topple the provincial government through constitutional means.</p>
<p>Addressing the matter at a press conference in Peshawar today, the JUI-F chief said, ‚ÄúMy advice would be that there should be a change in the province but if the PTI is in the majority, then the change should be from within the majority of the PTI. If the same people come together to bring a change in the provincial government, then it will be better.‚Äù</p>
<p>Fazl said he preferred this option rather than the opposition coming together and bringing a change in the government.</p>
<p>He added that it was his belief and that of his party that the majority of the province was ‚Äúfake‚Äù and a product of rigging but it could not tolerate any political struggle or uncertainty, thus it would be better if there was a change from within the ruling PTI.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Speaking on the prevailing security situation in the province, Fazl said, ‚ÄúThe common citizen‚Äôs life is insecure today.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf the opposition parties contact us then will we talk to them and also try to hold an all party conference to discuss this issue and come up with a strategy to deal with it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Speaking about the merger of Fata with KP, he said, ‚ÄúWe strongly opposed the merger when it was being done.‚Äù</p>
<p>Fazl said that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922671/pti-muqam-spar-over-ex-fata-jirga-committee">committee</a> formed to bring reforms in ex-Fata did not have representation from KP.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFrom all the parties, only we have been asked for representatives for the committee, but we haven‚Äôt given our representatives,‚Äù he added. The JUI-F chief said that the party would take its decision in consultation with tomorrow‚Äôs grand tribal jirga.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIs this decision an admission of the failure of the previous decision (Fata merger) or another ploy to gain access to the minerals of the area?‚Äù he asked.</p>
<p>The JUI-F chief said that if he was content with the federal government‚Äôs decisions, then he would have joined them. ‚ÄúBoth the federal and the provincial governments were a result of electoral rigging,‚Äù Fazl said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi said that the ex-Fata committee was not ‚Äúabout reversing the merger of Fata and the province‚Äù.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Peshawar, he said, ‚ÄúThe committee was formed when the prime minister and Field Marshal [Asim] Munir visited and a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915208">jirga</a> was held.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe provincial government said that the jirga system that had ended in the merged districts should be revived, and this is what the committee was formed for.‚Äù</p></p>

                <h2>Javelin aces Arshad Nadeem, Neeraj Chopra to clash in Poland next month</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan‚Äôs Olympic javelin champion Arshad Nadeem and India‚Äôs Neeraj Chopra are set to lock horns next month at the Diamond League event in Silesia, Poland, in their <a class="link--external" href="https://www.olympics.com/en/news/neeraj-chopra-vs-arshad-nadeem-record-head-to-head-rivalry-india-pakistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first</a> head-to-head contest since the Paris Olympics, it emerged on Saturday.</p>
<p>The match-up comes amid heightened political tensions between Pakistan and India, which have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923614">spilt over</a> into the world of sports.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://silesia.diamondleague.com/stars-galore-in-silesia-bukowiecka-and-lisek-announce-new-names/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> from the Diamond League, issued on July 9, announced the athletes taking part in the upcoming competition in Poland, including Kenyan middle-distance runner Faith Kipyegon.</p>
<p>The contest between Nadeem and Chopra was described as ‚Äúthe first opportunity for revenge after the Paris Olympics‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Pakistani‚Äôs form remains something of a mystery, as he rarely appears on the European circuit,‚Äù the press release read. ‚ÄúThe exception he will make on August 16 results from his desire to face Chopra.‚Äù</p>
<p>The press release noted that Chopra threw 90 metres this spring, adding that he is ‚Äúyearning for more‚Äù. Last week, Chopra <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922485/indias-javelin-hero-chopra-leverages-star-power-as-crowds-flock-to-self-titled-event">headlined</a> the ‚ÄòNeeraj Chopra Classic‚Äô ‚Äî billed as India‚Äôs inaugural world-class field competition ‚Äî and walked away with another gold medal.</p>
<p>In May, Nadeem threw a massive 86.4m to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914503">win gold</a> in the men‚Äôs javelin final at the Asian Athletics Championship in Gumi, South Korea.</p>
<p>A day before an April 22 terrorist attack in occupied Kashmir, Chopra had announced that the world‚Äôs top throwers, including Nadeem, had been invited to the first Neeraj Chopra Classic. However, the attack in Kashmir prompted heavy criticism of Chopra‚Äôs decision to invite Nadeem.</p>
<p>Nadeem ultimately did not attend the event.</p></p>
