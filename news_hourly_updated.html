<p>The development comes less than a month after the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench, by a majority of 3-2, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918332">upheld</a> the constitutionality of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889123">transferring three judges</a> from other provincial high courts to the IHC and referred the matter of seniority determination to the president.</p>
<p>The matter of Justice Dogar and two other judges’ transfer to the IHC in February had sparked a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889623">controversy</a> as he was made the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889639">senior puisne judge</a>, paving the way for his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891705">appointment</a> as the acting IHC chief justice after Justice Aamer Farooq’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891044">elevation</a> to the SC.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the high courts in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan also saw their chief justices taking oaths as regular top judges.</p>
<p>In separate ceremonies, Justice Syed Muhammad Attique Shah took oath as the Peshawar High Court (PHC) chief justice, Justice Rozi Khan Barrech was sworn in as Balochistan High Court’s (BHC) top judge, and Justice Junaid Ghaffar took the helm of the Sindh High Court (SHC).</p>
<p>Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori administered the oath to Justice Ghaffar at a ceremony held at the Governor House in Karachi.</p>

<p>After taking oath, Justice Ghaffar visited the Mazar-i-Quaid, where he laid a floral wreath. Responding to a reporter’s query there, he said the confusion of cases being heard by the regular bench or the constitutional bench would “settle down with time”.</p>
<p>Noting that it was the first time that cases had been categorised in such a manner after the 26th Amendment, Justice Ghaffar said whenever there was a confusion of jurisdiction, a larger bench was formed to decide it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891964">Justice Shah</a> assumed the responsibilities as the PHC chief justice in a permanent capacity as KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi administered the oath to him.</p>
<p>He was serving as the PHC acting chief justice since February 14, following the elevation of Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim to the SC.</p>
<p>KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, Minister for States and Frontier Regions Amir Muqam, and KP Assembly’s opposition leader Ibadullah Khan attended the ceremony.</p>
<p>KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed, Peshawar Commissioner Riaz Masood and other top officials were also present.</p>

<p>“I reiterated my full support for stronger collaboration between institutions to uphold the Constitution and address public grievances effectively,” the governor asserted.</p>

                <h2>29 schoolchildren, driver injured after van skids off road in AJK</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least 29 schoolchildren and their driver were injured after a van plunged off a treacherous hilly road in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Tuesday, police said.</p>
<p>Fatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain and poor infrastructure.</p>
<p>The van, carrying boys and girls from the private Islamia Public School in Chikar, was returning students to their homes when it met with the accident near a spot known as Tambrial Mor, Jhelum Superintendent of Police (SP) Mirza Zahid Hussain told <em>Dawn.com.</em></p>
<p>Chikar, a town and hill station in AJK’s Jhelum Valley district, is situated at an altitude of 5,272 feet above sea level and lies about 46 kilometres from Muzaffarabad, the state capital.</p>
<p>As a winter resort, Chikar’s educational institutions do not observe extended summer vacations, unlike other areas.</p>
<p>“It is assumed that after negotiating a bend, the vehicle went out of the driver’s control and fell down the road, causing injuries to almost everyone on board,” the SP said.</p>
<p>He said 16 people that were rushed to Chikar Tehsil Headquarters Hospital were later allowed to go home after treatment while of the 13 students hospitalised in Haitian Bala District Headquarters Hospital, two were kept there, and four others, including the driver, were referred to the Muzaffarabad Combined Military Hospital owing to their serious wounds.</p>
<p>“The rest of the school children were sent home,” he said.</p>
<p>A video clip shared by the SP showed the overturned van resting on a steep, forested slope, surrounded by local residents rushing to help.</p>
<p>“Had it not been for the tall trees that broke the fall, the van could have rolled further down the slope, resulting in heavier losses,” Hussain said.</p>
<p>Last week, six members of a family were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922093/6-dead-as-car-plunges-into-ajks-neelum-valley-officials">killed</a> in AJK’s Neelum valley when their car veered off the road and plummeted hundreds of feet, crashing onto the right bank of the river, officials had said.</p>
<p>In May, an assistant director, three inspectors and a constable of the AJK police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913950">lost</a> their lives when their vehicle plunged into a deep ravine in the Poonch division.</p></p>
