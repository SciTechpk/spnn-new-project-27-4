                <h2>Israel orders military to block Gaza-bound aid boat</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Israel‚Äôs defence minister on Sunday ordered the military to block an aid boat headed for Gaza with 12 activists on board, including Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have instructed the military to prevent the Madleen flotilla from reaching Gaza,‚Äù Israel Katz said in a statement from his office. ‚ÄúTo Greta the antisemite and her companions, Hamas propaganda mouthpieces, I say clearly: turn back because you will not reach Gaza.‚Äù</p>
<p>The organisers of the Madleen‚Äôs voyage said on Saturday that they had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916004/madleen-ship-set-to-arrive-in-palestinian-waters-in-24-hours-eu-lawmaker">reached</a> Egyptian waters and were nearing Gaza, where the conflict between Israel and Hamas entered its 21st month.</p>
<p>The Madleen, a sailing boat operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915389">left</a> Italy on June 1 with the stated aim of delivering humanitarian aid and breaking the Israeli blockade on the Palestinian territory.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIsrael will not allow anyone to break the naval blockade of Gaza, which is aimed at preventing weapons from reaching Hamas ‚Äî a murderous terrorist group holding our hostages and committing war crimes,‚Äù Katz said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIsrael will act against any attempt to break the blockade or support terror groups ‚Äî by sea, air or land,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>The coalition responded in a statement on X, saying it expected ‚Äúinterception and an attack from Israel at any moment‚Äù and calling for the governments of those on board to protect them.</p>
<p>The post added that the Madleen is 160 nautical miles from Gaza and that jamming ‚Äúbriefly disrupted our location, but our tracker is functioning again‚Äù.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, activists aboard the vessel have said they will continue their journey ‚Äúuntil the last minute‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll stay mobilised until the last minute ‚Äî until Israel cuts the internet and networks,‚Äù European parliament member Rima Hassan told <em>AFP</em> from the boat. ‚ÄúThere are twelve of us civilians on board. We are not armed. There is only humanitarian aid.‚Äù</p>
<p>Hassan voiced concern over the lack of official response from countries whose citizens are part of the crew.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo state has responded. The message being sent is that Israel is being allowed to act with impunity, without any guarantee of protection for us,‚Äù she added.</p>
<p>In a post on X, Hassan said that the activists have ‚Äúless than 24 hours‚Äù before they are detained by Israeli authorities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen we are no longer able to communicate with you, I‚Äôm counting on you to continue the mobilisation that has been so valuable to us throughout this journey,‚Äù she wrote.</p>

<p>Nationals of Germany, France, Brazil, Turkey, Sweden, Spain and the Netherlands are on the boat.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not scared of them,‚Äù said German human rights activist Yasemin Acar, also on board. ‚ÄúThe message they have been sending us, that we cannot come closer, is not making us step back.‚Äù</p>
<p>On Sunday, French Minister for Foreign Trade and French Nationals Abroad Laurent Saint-Martin said that France was obliged to ensure ‚Äúconsular protection‚Äù for its nationals aboard the Madleen.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe six French citizens on this boat are entitled to consular protection,‚Äù he told a state TV channel.</p>
<p>The conflict was sparked by Hamas‚Äôs October 7, 2023 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1779807">attack</a> on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an <em>AFP</em> tally of official figures.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the health ministry in Gaza said that the overall toll for the Gaza war had reached 54,880, the majority being civilians. The UN considers these figures reliable.</p></p>
