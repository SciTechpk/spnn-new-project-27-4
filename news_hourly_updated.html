                <h2>Any military misadventure by India will be met with swift, resolute, notch-up response: COAS</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir on Thursday warned that any ‚Äúmisadventure‚Äù by India, amid fraught tensions with Pakistan that has seen continued shelling across the Line of Control after a militant attack in occupied Kashmir last week, would be met with a quick and decisive response.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">rejected</a> the accusation and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> and India‚Äôs premier granting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">‚Äúoperational freedom‚Äù</a> to his military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an incursion from India within the next 24-36 hours, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension">diplomatic channels</a> from other countries have been engaged to prevent a possible military confrontation.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7270" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said COAS Munir visited the  Tilla Field Firing Ranges in Jhelum to witness ‚ÄúExercise Hammer Strike‚Äù, a high-intensity, field training exercise conducted by the military‚Äôs Mangla Strike Corps.</p>
<p>Addressing the troops amid the exercise, the ISPR said the army chief reaffirmed the military‚Äôs ‚Äúunyielding resolve‚Äù to defend the nation‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet there be no ambiguity: any military misadventure by India will be met with a swift, resolute, and notch-up response. While Pakistan remains committed to regional peace, our preparedness and resolve to safeguard national interests is absolute,‚Äù he was quoted as saying by the ISPR.</p>
<p>It said the COAS lauded the ‚Äúhigh morale, combat proficiency, and warfighting spirit‚Äù of the officers and troops, terming them the ‚Äúembodiment of Pakistan Army‚Äôs operational excellence‚Äù. Senior military leadership, formation commanders and dignitaries from various services also witnessed the exercise.</p>
<p>‚ÄúExercise Hammer Strike stands as a testament to Pakistan Army‚Äôs pursuit of continuous transformation through rigorous training, doctrinal innovation, and technological modernisation,‚Äù the ISPR said.</p>
<p>It added that the exercise was meticulously designed to validate combat readiness, battlefield synergy and the operational integration of cutting-edge weapon systems under near-battlefield conditions. A diverse array of advanced capabilities, including multirole fighter aircraft, combat aviation assets, long-range precision artillery, and next-generation field engineering techniques, were employed to simulate conventional battlefield scenarios.</p>
<p>The ISPR said troops from all arms and services demonstrated ‚Äúexceptional tactical cohesion, agility, and lethality during synchronised offensive manoeuvres ‚Äî reflecting an extraordinary level of training and professionalism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNotably, the exercise showcased Pakistan Army‚Äôs increasing absorption of niche and emerging technologies to augment its kinetic and non-kinetic operational capabilities.‚Äù</p>

<p>A day ago, Pakistani officials had said the country would exercise restraint in the face of heightened tensions with India but warned it would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907662/pakistan-wont-sit-idle-in-the-face-of-indian-aggression">respond ‚Äústrongly‚Äù and ‚Äúdecisively‚Äù</a> if attacked, invoking its right to self-defence under international law.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan will not be the first one to resort to any escalatory move; however, in case of any escalatory move by the Indian side, we will respond very strongly,‚Äù Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had said during a joint media briefing with military and Foreign Office spokespersons.</p>
<p>Dar said a similar message had been communicated to the international partners. ‚ÄúAny misadventure will be responded to in a befitting and decisive manner at the time and place of our choosing.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur response would be befitting, decisive and assured,‚Äù ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had said. ‚ÄúWe are ready for all eventualities. If they choose military confrontation, that would be their choice, but we would then determine its (conflict‚Äôs) future direction.‚Äù</p>
<p>Gen Chaudhry emphasised that Pakistan‚Äôs armed forces were fully capable and prepared to defend the country across all domains. ‚ÄúWe are vigilant and our response and counter-measures would be appropriate and decisive,‚Äù he said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#president-pm-discuss-security-situation" id="president-pm-discuss-security-situation" title="Permalink"></a>President, PM discuss security situation</h2>
<p>Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday called on President Asif Ali Zardari to discuss the current security situation.</p>
<p>A statement from the President House said the two leaders expressed deep concern over India‚Äôs ‚Äúbelligerent attitude and provocative statements, which posed a threat to regional peace and stability‚Äù. They reaffirmed that Pakistan would never compromise on the country‚Äôs territorial integrity and sovereignty, and would respond to any act of aggression in a ‚Äúbefitting manner‚Äù.</p>

<p>They stated that the Pakistani nation was united and stood behind its military which was capable of responding to any threat or aggression. They also reviewed Pakistan‚Äôs response to India‚Äôs ‚Äúbelligerent posture and any possible acts of aggression‚Äù.</p>
<p>The two also expressed regret over the Indian leadership‚Äôs accusations regarding the Pahalgam attack, noting that they were made without any investigation. It was highlighted in their talks that Pakistan had been a victim of terrorism, suffering immense human and economic losses for over two decades.</p>
<p>They said that the international community should take note of India‚Äôs involvement in funding, training and sending militants into Pakistan to carry out terrorist activities.</p>
<p>The statement said President Zardari commended the government‚Äôs response to Indian baseless accusations and handling of the situation in a responsible manner. He reaffirmed that Pakistan would take all necessary steps to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and vital national interests at all costs.</p>
<p>The two also highlighted the urgency of implementing United Nations Security Council resolutions to grant the Kashmiri people their right to self-determination, noting it would help bring lasting peace and stability to the region.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also enquired after the president‚Äôs health after his recovery from <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901612">Covid-19</a>.</p>
<p>FM Dar and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar were also present during the meeting.</p>

<p>According to security sources, the exercises included ‚Äúpractical demonstrations of modern weaponry in view of war strategy‚Äù. The sources said the primary objective of the war exercises was to deliver a strong and decisive response to any aggression from the enemy.</p>
<p>They emphasised that the Pakistan Army remained fully prepared at all times to give a crushing reply to any hostile action.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOfficers and soldiers are actively showcasing their professional capabilities during the drills,‚Äù <em>Radio Pakistan</em> stated.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPAF remains steadfast to defend [the] aerial frontiers of Pakistan,‚Äù the video captions said.</p>
<p><em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported that the PAF ‚Äúfully prepared and determined to deliver a crushing response to any aggression‚Äù.</p>
<p>Noting that the PAF was equipped with the latest fighter jets, the report said the air force had ‚Äúalways fulfilled its professional responsibilities with utmost efficiency and dedication for the integrity of Pakistan‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe PAF is renowned worldwide for its technical expertise and courageous reputation,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Navy has also released a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwJ9mV5Fpn0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a>, titled ‚ÄòReady at all times‚Äô, featuring Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou must be battle-ready. The time has come to utilise our capabilities effectively,‚Äù Admiral Ashraf tells his troops in the video, which shows clips of various naval exercises.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou get few opportunities to prove yourself. Our nation has a lot of expectations of us. We have to deliver, and deliver to the best possible efficiency before the enemy,‚Äù the naval chief says.</p>

<p>India‚Äôs navy today issued warnings for several firing drills in the Arabian Sea off the coasts of Maharashtra and Gujarat states. Gujarat shares a border with Pakistan.</p>
<p>The navy did not respond to a <em>Reuters</em> request for comment on the warnings.</p>
<p>As tensions remain high, both countries‚Äô troops reportedly exchanged small arms fire along the Line of Control (LoC) in AJK for the seventh night <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers#:~:text=troops%20exchanged%20fire%20overnight%20across%20the%20Line%20of%20Control%20(LoC)%20in%20Kashmir">since April 25</a>, <em>Reuters</em> said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Indus is more than just a river; it is our history and our culture,‚Äù he stated, adding that the river birthed the Indus Valley Civilisation 3,000 years ago.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs culture is also linked with the river; they love the Indus for this reason,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe will not give their PM the opportunity to choke the Indus and we do not want war, but we are ready to fight until the end.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf he targets our water, he will see whether the Indus flows with water or blood,‚Äù Bilawal warned.</p>

                <h2>PM Shehbaz thanks China for ‚Äòendorsing‚Äô Pakistan‚Äôs proposal of neutral probe into Pahalgam attack</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday thanked China‚Äôs envoy for endorsing his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">offer</a> to conduct a neutral probe into the Pahalgam attack, following India‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">actions</a> against Pakistan that have heightened the risks of a military confrontation between the two countries.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">civilian</a> and military leadership have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">rejected</a> the accusation and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> and India‚Äôs premier granting ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>‚Äù to his military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an incursion from India within the next 24-36 hours, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension">diplomatic channels</a> from other countries have been engaged to prevent a possible military confrontation.</p>

<p>He also conveyed that India‚Äôs ‚Äúbelligerent actions could distract Pakistan from its ongoing counterterrorism efforts‚Äù against the militant Islamic State Khorasan Province (IS-K), Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), who were ‚Äúoperating from inside Afghanistan‚Äù.</p>
<p>The past few years have witnessed a rise in the frequency of attacks targeting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900434">Chinese nationals</a> working in Pakistan, with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1877910">20 Chinese citizens</a> killed and 34 injured in terrorist attacks across the country since 2021.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the military accused India of activating its ‚Äúassets‚Äù to inte¬≠nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan. The military spokesperson specifically cited the recent killing of 54 TTP militants during an infiltration attempt, saying it was ‚Äúsponsored, facilita¬≠ted, and abetted by India‚Äù.</p>

<p>In his meeting with the Chinese envoy, PM Shehbaz asserted that Pakistan had always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. He highlighted that as a ‚Äúfrontline state‚Äù in the war against terrorism, Pakistan had sacrificed over 90,000 lives and suffered over $152 billion in economic losses.</p>
<p>Ambassador Zaidong thanked the prime minister for sharing Pakistan‚Äôs perspective on the ‚Äúemerging situation due to Indian baseless propaganda and unilateral action‚Äù, <em>APP</em> quoted a press release from the PMO as saying.</p>
<p>He also affirmed that China would always support Pakistan to achieve the common desire of both countries to secure peace and stability in South Asia.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz conveyed his warm wishes to President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang, expressing sincere thanks to China for its strong and steadfast support to Pakistan amid the prevailing situation in the region.</p>
<p>Recalling a telephonic conversation between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and FM Ishaq Dar on April 27, the premier thanked China for understanding Pakistan‚Äôs principled position vis-√†-vis India‚Äôs actions since April 22.</p>

<p>Separately, Pakistan‚Äôs envoy to the United States has asked President Donald Trump to step in and help ease soaring tensions with India, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.newsweek.com/exclusive-pakistan-calls-trump-help-prevent-nuclear-war-india-2066116" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> by <em>Newsweek</em>.</p>
<p>Pakistan‚Äôs Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh told <em>Newsweek</em> yesterday that for a president ‚Äústanding for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration‚Äù ‚Äî referring to Trump ‚Äî there was no ‚Äúhigher or flashier flashpoint‚Äù than the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúIf we have a president who is standing for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration, to establish a legacy as a peacemaker ‚Äî or as someone who finished wars, defied wars and played a role in de-confliction, resolving the disputes ‚Äî I don‚Äôt think there is any higher or flashier flash point, particularly in nuclear terms, as Kashmir,‚Äù Pakistan‚Äôs Ambassador to the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855847">Rizwan Saeed Sheikh</a> told <em>Newsweek</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are not talking about one or two countries in that neighbourhood who <em>[sic]</em> are nuclear-capable. So, that is how grave it is,‚Äù he said in an interview with the US magazine.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=Overseas%20wars%20and%20plans%20for%20peace">inaugural speech</a> as the US president, Trump had said: ‚ÄúMy proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.‚Äù A ceasefire, which has now been violated, was secured between <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886289">Israel and Hamas</a> following Trump‚Äôs election, and he has also been engaging with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906950">Ukraine and Russia</a> to halt their war.</p>
<p>According to <em>Newsweek</em>, Sheikh contended that the Trump administration would need to pursue a more comprehensive and sustained initiative than in past US attempts to defuse crises that have erupted between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think with this threat that we are facing, there is a latent opportunity to address the situation by not just [focusing] on an immediate de-escalatory measure, or a de-escalatory approach,‚Äù the envoy said.</p>
<p>He called for a more durable and lasting solution to the Kashmir dispute, ‚Äúrather than allowing the situation to stay precarious and pop up again and again at the next drop of a hat on this side or that side‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>During his interview, Sheikh emphasised that the Kashmir issue was the root cause of all troubles between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUntil and unless that final settlement is made and the resolutions dictate the prescribed solution is allowed to play out, we will all keep having these problems,‚Äù Sheikh said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we insist on the United States and others playing a role in this situation and getting the de-confliction part activated,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>If the long-standing dispute was resolved, the ambassador said, the population of South Asia could live in peace. ‚ÄúAll the other issues between Pakistan and India are not major issues,‚Äù he noted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe do not want to fight, particularly with a bigger country,‚Äù Sheikh said. ‚ÄúWe want peace. It suits our economic agenda; it suits our nationhood. It suits every objective that we have currently. But we want peace with dignity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe would not want to do it, but if it is imposed, then we would rather die with dignity than survive with indignity,‚Äù Sheikh asserted.</p>
<p>The call for Trump to play a role in reducing the tensions came the same day as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was expected to speak to top Pakistani and Indian leaders.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In his phone call with Rubio yesterday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif urged the US to press India to ‚Äúdial down the rhetoric and act responsibly‚Äù.</p>
<p>In a readout of the call with PM Shehbaz, issued by the US State Department, Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said: ‚ÄúBoth leaders reaffirmed their continued commitment to holding terrorists accountable for their heinous acts of violence.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe secretary (Rubio) urged Pakistani officials‚Äô cooperation in investigating this unconscionable attack. He also encouraged Pakistan to work with India to de-escalate tensions, re-establish direct communications, and maintain peace and security in South Asia,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile conversation with India‚Äôs External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Rubio ‚Äúencouraged India to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia‚Äù.</p>

<p>Sheikh, reiterating Pakistan‚Äôs stance, rejected any involvement of his country in the Pahalgam attack, arguing that the fallout of such an operation could only serve to harm rather than benefit Pakistan‚Äôs interests.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan is focusing on a matter of a deliberate, considered, pronounced shift of our foreign policy, a pivot from geopolitics to geoeconomics,‚Äù the envoy told <em>Newsweek</em>.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are focused on the geoeconomics side of our geography and our foreign policy. We are currently economically ascendant,‚Äù the official said, stressing that Pakistan only needed a ‚Äúpeaceful neighbourhood‚Äù in terms of the broader region.</p>
<p>Terming it ‚Äúso outlandish, so far-fetched, to blame Pakistan‚Äù for the Pahalgam attack, Sheikh said Islamabad was awaiting evidence from New Delhi to prove a link between the incident and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Moreover, the envoy said the attack could be a ‚Äúfalse flag operation‚Äù conducted to intentionally lay the blame on Pakistan. He acknowledged he could not yet back up the claim, but there was ‚Äúenough circumstantial evidence, history, [‚Ä¶] immediate backdrop and setting [‚Ä¶] to entertain that possibility.</p>
<p>Speaking about India‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">unilateral suspension</a> last week of the IWT, Sheikh warned that if there was ‚Äúeven an attempt or a semblance of an attempt‚Äù to stop or hold water, then it would be a declaration of war.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>While contending that it was ‚Äúphysically impossible‚Äù to hold water, the envoy said ‚Äúall bets are off if it‚Äôs about food security of 250 million people‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf you threaten me with this kind of a situation, which is existential, what is your expectation of response?‚Äù he asked.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Indian Embassy in Washington <a class="link--external" href="https://www.newsweek.com/indian-embassy-terrorists-behind-attack-will-brought-justice-2066403" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Newsweek</em></a> in a statement: ‚ÄúThe terrorists behind the attack will be brought to justice.‚Äù It termed Sheikh‚Äôs remarks a ‚Äúcrude attempt to rewrite history and gloss over facts‚Äù.</p>
