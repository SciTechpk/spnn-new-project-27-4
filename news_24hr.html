            <p><p>The White House on Thursday said that no visit of United States President Donald Trump was scheduled to Pakistan “at this time” after widespread reports of a trip.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, some local television news channels reported, citing sources, that Trump was expected to visit Pakistan in September. The news channels said that Trump would also visit India after arriving in Islamabad in September. The channels later withdrew their reports.</p>
<p>The White House dismissed the rumours. “A trip to Pakistan has not been scheduled at this time,” a White House official said.</p>
<p>Talking to <em>Dawn.com</em> on the reported visit earlier, Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said: “We have no information about this matter.”</p>
<p>Similarly, a US embassy spokesperson in Islamabad told <em>Reuters</em>, “We have nothing to announce,” and said that the White House might be able to provide confirmation on the president’s schedule.</p>
<p>George W Bush was the last US president to visit Pakistan in 2006.</p>

<p>US-Pakistan relations saw a major boost when Trump hosted Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House last month in an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093">unprecedented meeting</a>.</p>
<p>India is due to host the summit of the so-called Quad countries this year, but dates for the meeting have not been announced yet.</p>
<p>The Quad grouping includes the US, India, Australia and Japan and is focused on countering China’s rise in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Britain’s King Charles will host Trump from September 17 to 19 for his unprecedented second state visit to Britain, Buckingham Palace said on Monday.</p></p>

<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar made the announcement in a post on X from Kabul, where he arrived earlier today on a day-long visit for the signing.</p>
<p>“I congratulate the people and governments of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan on the signing of the Framework Agreement on the Joint Feasibility Study for the Naibabad–Kharlachi rail link under the UAP Railway Corridor.</p>
<p>“I also thank the foreign ministers of Uzbekistan and Afghanistan for their support and commitment for timely signing of the agreement. We remained closely engaged throughout the negotiation process to finalise the details.”</p>

<p>He hailed the UAP Railway Corridor as a major milestone in advancing regional connectivity and economic integration that would connect Central Asian countries to Pakistani seaports through Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Dar said the signing of today’s agreement was a result of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s leadership and commitment, who had tasked him as finance minister of the Pakistan Democratic Movement-led government to lead the effort with the countries.</p>
<p>“We collectively laid the foundation for this transformational project.”</p>
<p>The foreign ministers of the three countries held a meeting before the signing.</p>
<p>“The meeting reaffirmed strong ties and a shared commitment to peace, connectivity, trade and regional development. The three sides emphasised the importance of sustained cooperation to unlock the region’s economic potential and ensure long-term prosperity for their peoples,” the Foreign Office (FO) said.</p>

<p>In 2023, the three countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1765547">agreed</a> on the UAP Railway project to build a rail link, which will pass through Termiz in Uzbekistan, Mazar-i-Sharif and Logar in Afghanistan and enter Pakistan via the Kharlachi border crossing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The project will facilitate regional, transit, and bilateral trade among­­st participating countries, while supporting both passenger and freight services.</p>
<p>Dar arrived in Kabul earlier today, accompanied by Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi, the special representative for Afghanistan, and the secretary of the Ministry of Railways.</p>

            <p><p>Pakistan and the European Union (EU) on Thursday agreed on bolstering cooperation in security and counter-terrorism among other sectors during a bilateral dialogue, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/european-union-and-pakistan-hold-10th-political-dialogue" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> issued by the Foreign Office (FO).</p>
<p>EU Ambassador to Pakistan Dr Riina Kionka in March had announced that European companies recognised Pakistan as a potential business destination and were exploring new avenues for economic partnership.</p>
<p>The EU is Pakistan’s sec­ond-largest trading partner, with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1888846#:~:text=The%20EU%20is%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20sec%C2%ADond-largest%20trading%20partner,%20with%20the%20GSP+%20status%20allowing%20the%20country%20to%20enjoy%20duty-free%20or%20minimum%20duty%20on%20European%20exports.">GSP+ status</a> allowing the country to enjoy duty-free or minimum duty on European exports.</p>
<p>According to the press release, Pakistan and the EU held their 10th Political Dialogue in Brussels and discussed key regional and international issues, including multilateral cooperation. Both sides agreed to deepen dialogue and discussions on security during the event.</p>
<p>“The EU and Pakistan reaffirmed their commitment to the implementation of the Strategic Engagement Plan (<a class="link--external" href="https://www.eeas.europa.eu/sites/default/files/eu-pakistan_strategic_engagement_plan.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SEP</a>) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1490471">signed</a> in 2019,” the FO stated. “Both sides aim to further deepen cooperation in all areas covered under the SEP.”</p>
<p>Additionally, both sides agreed to continue close engagement under the GSP+ framework. They also acknowledged meaningful cooperation on various aspects of migration, with the third Comprehensive Migration and Mobility Dialogue slated for later in 2025, the FO stated.</p>
<p>According to the FO, the EU and Pakistan acknowledged the importance of multifaceted cooperation on security matters, including counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics.</p>
<p>“They condemned all forms of terrorism,” the press release read. “Both sides agreed on the need for efforts based on dialogue and diplomacy in order to solve contentious issues and underscored the importance of upholding international law and the sanctity of international agreements [and] treaties.”</p>
<p>The FO stated that both sides also exchanged views on the situation in Ukraine and Indian-occupied Kashmir and stressed the need to pursue peaceful solutions to conflicts, in respect of the principles of international law and the UN Charter.</p>
<p>“They agreed on the urgent need to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza,” the statement read. “Both sides called for the resumption of a ceasefire and expressed support for initiatives that contribute to a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in Palestine, in accordance with the two-state solution.”</p>
<p>Pakistan and the EU reaffirmed their aspiration to convene the 7th Strategic Dialogue in 2025 to strengthen Pakistan-EU cooperation. According to the FO, they agreed to hold the next Political Dialogue meeting in Islamabad next year.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch led Pakistan’s delegation, while the EU delegation was headed by Olof Skoog, Deputy Secretary General of the European External Action Service.</p>
<p>The EU is not the only Western power with whom Pakistan has experienced improved relations.</p>
<p>US-Pakistan relations saw a major boost when US President Donald Trump hosted Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House last month in an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093">unprecedented meeting</a>.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Trump “lauded Pakistan’s ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counterterrorism cooperation between the two states”, a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations said.</p>
<p>Additionally, United States Central Command chief Army General Michael Kurilla last month <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524/us-centcom-chief-lauds-phenomenal-partner-pakistan-in-counter-terrorism-efforts">praised</a> Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner in the world of counter-terrorism”, citing the nation’s struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K).</p></p>
