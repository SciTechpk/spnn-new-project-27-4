            <p><p>Eight passengers died and 18 others were injured after the bus they were travelling on fell into a ditch near Balkassar Interchange in Punjab’s Chakwal district on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson of Chakwal Rescue 1122, the bus was heading to Lahore from Islamabad when one of its tyres burst near the Balkassar Interchange on the Islamabad-Lahore Motorway (M2).</p>
<p>The driver lost control of the bus, causing the vehicle to fall into a ditch and overturn. As a result, eight passengers died on the spot, while 18 others were injured, the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 had dispatched six rescue vehicles to the crash site, while personnel of National Highways and Motorway Police, the Chakwal police and a team of the Frontier Works Organisation also reached the incident site.</p>
<p>The injured were rushed to Kallar Kahar Tehsil Headquarters Hospital and Chakwal District Headquarters Hospital, where the bodies were also taken.</p>

<p>Dr Mukhtar Sarwar Niazi, medical superintendent at Chakwal DHQ Hospital,  told <em>Dawn.com</em> that four out of 12 injured persons brought there were “critically injured” and were being referred to Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>According to the Rescue 1122 statement, there were between 35-40 passengers on the bus.</p>
<p>As per the list issued by the rescue service, the dead included three children, aged eight months, one year and two years, with the eldest person aged 45 years. The injured were aged between 14 and 55 years.</p>
<p>Chakwal District Police Officer Ahmed Mohiuddin took notice of the incident and sent a team comprising senior police officials. “The site has been cordoned off and police are acting as per law”, a spokesperson of Chakwal Police said.</p>
<p>Chakwal Rescue and Safety Officer Shaukat Ali said: “Our rescue teams responded with professional expertise, providing immediate medical aid to the injured and transporting the deceased to the hospital.”</p>
<p>He urged the public to ensure complete vehicle fitness checks — especially tyre, brake and steering system inspections — before embarking on long journeys to prevent such tragic incidents.</p>
<p>Fatal road accidents on highways <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906089">occur frequently</a> in Pakistan, mainly due to overspeeding, hazardous overtaking and disregard for traffic rules.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926910/israel-declares-gaza-fighting-pause-amid-deepening-hunger-crisis' target='_blank'><strong>Israel declares Gaza fighting pause amid deepening hunger crisis</strong></a>
            <p><p>Israel declared a “tactical pause” in fighting in parts of Gaza on Sunday and said it would allow the UN and aid agencies to open secure land routes to tackle a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926644/quarter-of-gaza-hasnt-eaten-for-days-wfp">deepening hunger crisis</a>.</p>
<p>The military also said it had begun air-dropping food into the territory and angrily rejected allegations it was using starvation as a weapon against Palestinian civilians.</p>
<p>In a statement, the army said it coordinated its decisions with the UN and international organisations to “increase the scale of humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip”.</p>
<p>There was no immediate official response from the UN or non-governmental aid agencies operating in Gaza, and privately sceptical humanitarian sources said they were waiting to see the results on the ground of the Israeli announcement.</p>
<p>The pause in fighting would be limited to areas where the military says Israeli troops are not currently operating — Al-Mawasi, Deir el-Balah and Gaza City — and last from 10am (12pm PKT) until 8pm every day.</p>
<p>But the Israeli statement added that “designated secure routes” had been opened across all of Gaza to enable the safe passage of UN and humanitarian aid organisation convoys delivering and distributing food and medicine.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said these operations, alongside its ongoing campaign against Palestinian armed groups, should disprove “the false claim of deliberate starvation in the Gaza Strip”.</p>
<p>Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza on March 2 after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895179">ceasefire talks</a> broke down. In late May, it began allowing a small trickle of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914097">aid</a> to resume, amid warnings of a wave of starvation.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#activist-boat-seized" id="activist-boat-seized" title="Permalink"></a>Activist boat seized</h2>
<p>Before Israel announced the airborne delivery of seven pallets of food, the United Arab Emirates had said it would restart aid drops and Britain said it would work with partners including Jordan to assist them.</p>
<p>On Saturday alone, the Palestinian civil defence agency said over 50 more Palestinians had been killed in Israeli strikes and shootings, some as they waited near aid distribution centres.</p>
<p>“We ask God and our Arab brothers to work harder to reach a ceasefire before we all die,” Gaza resident Hossam Sobh told <em>AFP</em>, adding that he had feared death as he recovered a bag of flour under the nose of an Israeli tank.</p>
<p>Also on Saturday, Israeli troops boarded a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925256">boat</a> carrying activists from the Freedom Flotilla Coalition as it attempted to approach Gaza from the sea to challenge a naval blockade.</p>
<p>The humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territory has gravely deteriorated in recent days, with more than 100 NGOs warning this week that “mass starvation” was spreading in Gaza.</p>
<p>On Telegram, the Israeli military announced it “carried out an airdrop of humanitarian aid as part of the ongoing efforts to allow and facilitate the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip”.</p>
<p>Humanitarian chiefs are deeply sceptical that air drops can deliver enough food safely to tackle the deepening hunger crisis facing Gaza’s more than two million inhabitants.</p>
<p>But British Prime Minister Keir Starmer backed the idea, vowing to work with Jordan to restart air drops. The United Arab Emirates said it would resume air drops “immediately”.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#starving-civilians" id="starving-civilians" title="Permalink"></a>‘Starving civilians’</h2>
<p>A number of Western and Arab governments carried out <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1818770/us-makes-its-first-gaza-aid-airdrop">air drops</a> in Gaza in 2024, when aid deliveries by land also faced Israeli restrictions, but many in the humanitarian community consider them ineffective.</p>
<p>“Air drops will not reverse the deepening starvation,” said Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.</p>
<p>“They are expensive, inefficient and can even kill starving civilians.”</p>

<p>Israel’s military insists it does not limit the number of trucks going into Gaza, and alleges that UN agencies and relief groups are not collecting aid once it is inside the territory.</p>
<p>But humanitarian organisations accuse the army of imposing excessive restrictions, while tightly controlling road access within Gaza.</p>
<p>A separate aid operation is under way through the Israeli- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.</p>
<p>But it has faced fierce international criticism after Israeli fire killed hundreds of Palestinians near distribution points.</p>

<p>On Saturday evening, the live feed on the Handala boat belonging to pro-Palestinian activist group Freedom Flotilla showed Israeli troops boarding the vessel.</p>
<p>The soldiers moved in as the boat approached Gaza and three video live feeds of the scene broadcasting online were cut minutes later.</p>
<p>Media restrictions in Gaza and difficulties in accessing many areas mean <em>AFP</em> is unable to independently verify tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency and other parties.</p>
<p>Israel launched its military campaign in Gaza after Hamas’s October 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, most of them civilians, according to an <em>AFP</em> tally based on official figures.</p>
<p>The Israeli campaign has killed 59,733 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926853/dispute-erupts-over-punjab-cotton-output-data' target='_blank'><strong>Dispute erupts over Punjab cotton output data</strong></a>
            <p><p>LAHORE: A major controversy has emerged over the methodology used by the Crop Reporting Centre (CRC) Punjab in determining provincial cotton output, with serious allegations of inflated and misleading statistics surfacing.</p>
<p>It has been revealed that CRC Punjab is allegedly estimating total cotton production using hypothetical calculations — extrapolating yields based on the number of bolls per plant across an acre or, in some districts, from small sample plots as small as eight feet by six feet.</p>
<p>This has exposed a long-standing discrepancy between the figures reported by CRC Punjab and those of the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA), with the former consistently reporting significantly higher production.</p>
<p>Ihsan-ul-Haq, Chairman of the Cotton Ginners Forum, stated that this variance has long complicated decision-making for stakeholders in the cotton industry. He noted that while some attribute the CRC’s inflated figures to unrecorded lint sales by certain ginners, the presence of two conflicting national datasets has damaged Pakistan’s credibility in international cotton forums.</p>
<p>“As of July 15, the PCGA reported Punjab’s cotton production at 145,000 bales, while CRC Punjab claimed 335,000 bales — a staggering difference,” Haq said, adding that such figures appear divorced from ground realities. “It is entirely inaccurate to determine provincial output from a handful of bolls or a couple of micro-plots,” he stressed.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>CRC’s figures sharply contradict PCGA data, raising concerns over planning and international credibility</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He urged the CRC to adopt a more grounded data collection approach, similar to that of the PCGA, which gathers cotton and lint sales and stock data on a fortnightly basis from every ginning factory. Haq proposed that CRC staff collect real-time data from ginneries and grain markets to provide more accurate and credible figures.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In response, CRC Punjab Director-General Dr Abdul Qayyum defended the Centre’s methodology. Speaking to <em>Dawn</em> by phone, he said around 1,600 staff members in cotton-growing areas gather data weekly from approximately 4,000 locations.</p>
<p>“Our teams measure boll size and weight, count bolls per plant, and monitor picking activity in the field,” he explained.</p>
<p>Dr Qayyum asserted that the CRC’s calculations are based on standardised field practices with no incentive to inflate or deflate figures. He attributed the divergence from PCGA data to differences in collection points.</p>
<p>“While we report from the picking stage, PCGA collects data at the ginning stage — where under-invoicing by ginners to evade sales tax is a known issue, as acknowledged by the industry itself,” he said.</p>
<p>Despite these explanations, the growing gap between CRC and PCGA data continues to raise concern among cotton stakeholders, who warn that unreliable production figures could undermine effective policymaking and market confidence.</p>
