            <p><p>The Punjab government has imposed Section 144 across the province from Muharram 1 to 10 to ensure peace and religious harmony.</p>
<p><a class="link--external" href="https://punjabpolice.gov.pk/faqs#:~:text=What%20is%20section%20144%20and%20what%20does%20it%20imply?,-Top&amp;text=Section%20144%20of%20the%20Code,a%20specific%20period%20of%20time." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Section 144</a> is a legal provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period.</p>
<p>A Punjab Home Department order issued on Friday, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, stated that the section was imposed to prevent “disruption of public peace and instability”, along with ensuring the public’s “safety and security of lives and property”.</p>
<p>The notification cited “potential threat to the public peace and tranquillity, religious harmony, and general law and order situation in the province from miscreants, violent extremists, and antisocial elements”.</p>
<p>For the first 10 days of Muharram, which is likely to begin on <a class="link--external" href="https://hamariweb.com/islam/islamic-calendar.aspx#google_vignette" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">June 27 or 28</a> in Pakistan, the government has prohibited “innovations of Muharram processions [and] <em>majalis</em>”.</p>
<p>It has also banned carrying any article that may be used as a weapon of offence — including bamboo sticks (batons), knives, daggers and spears — as well as combustible material at public places without a competent authority’s permission.</p>
<p>There will also be a complete ban on slogans and gestures “that may incite public sentiments, or directly or indirectly hit the belief of any sect, community or group”.</p>
<p>Dissemination of information or making “abusive or derogatory remarks through any information system or device” that provoke or are likely to provoke interfaith, sectarian or racial hatred will be prohibited as well.</p>

<p>Spectators will be barred from the rooftops of buildings on the routes and in front of shops located along the routes during processions, the order added. It further banned the construction of <em>morchas</em> (firing bays) on rooftops of such buildings and the collection of stones, bricks, bottles or garbage along the procession routes.</p>
<p>On Muharram 9 and 10, pillion riding will also be prohibited except for senior citizens, women and law enforcement personnel, the order added.</p>

<p>The Punjab home department has started <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917053">taking measures</a>, including deployment of armed forces where required, to ensure peace in the province during Muharram.</p>
<p>It has sought each district’s need for army and Rangers troops, along with requirements for mobile jamming, with specific location and duration. It has also stated that a ban on loudspeakers should be fully enforced under the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1156305">Punjab Sound Systems (Regulation) Act 2015</a> during Muharram.</p>
<p>Deputy commissioners have been asked to discuss and develop contingency plans, update lists of firebrand orators to be gagged or banned, and prevent misuse of loudspeakers during the month.</p>
<p>The DCs have also been informed about the guidelines for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918568/home-dept-issues-sops-for-sabeels-during-muharram">setting up <em>sabeels</em></a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918538/army-rangers-to-help-police-maintain-peace-during-muharram">Rawalpindi</a>, five companies of the Pakistan Army and six companies of Rangers will be deployed to help the administration and police maintain law and order.</p>
<p>The district administration has banned the entry of 169 religious leaders and <em>zakireen</em> in the district and also issued gagging orders for 89 clerics during Muharram. As many as 184 people have been placed in the Fourth Schedule.</p>
<p>Section 144 was also imposed during Muharram in Punjab <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844201">last year</a>, with the Pakistan Army and Rangers being <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844623">deployed</a> across the country after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1843992">requests</a> from all provincial governments.</p>
<p>While the Punjab government had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1843876">requested</a> the interior ministry to shut down social media apps from Muharram 6 to 11 in a bid to avoid sectarian violence, the ministry had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844147">deferred</a> the decision. However, Facebook was reportedly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1846386">restricted</a> across Pakistan on Muharram 10, Yaum-i-Ashura.</p>
<p>In the past, militants have targeted Muharram processions several times, including a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1767347">bomb blast</a> that killed more than 40 people attending the main Ashura procession on Karachi’s MA Jinnah Road in December 2009.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Pakistani government has decided to formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” during the recent India-Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">crisis</a>.</p>
<p>The move by Pakistan was another indication of improved bilateral ties with the US.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/GovtofPakistan/status/1936159807326900577?t=_SkHHZ9STzyca0C7Nrq5_g&amp;s=19" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> shared on X, the government said the international community had “bore witness to unprovoked and unlawful Indian aggression, which constituted a grave violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, resulting in the tragic loss of innocent lives, including women, children, and the elderly”.</p>

<p>Following the Indian aggression, Pakistan “launched Operation Bunyanum Marsoos  — a measured, resolute, and precise military response”, the post read.</p>
<p>It noted that the response was executed to exercise the country’s “fundamental right to self-defence” and “carefully to re-establish deterrence”, defending its “territorial integrity while consciously avoiding civilian harm”.</p>
<p>The post further read that “at a moment of heightened regional turbulence”, Trump “demonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi”.</p>
<p>It continued that the US president “de-escalated a rapidly deteriorating situation, ultimately securing a ceasefire and averting a broader conflict between the two nuclear states that would have had catastrophic consequences for millions of people in the region and beyond”.</p>
<p>“This intervention stands as a testament to his [Trump’s] role as a genuine peacemaker and his commitment to conflict resolution through dialogue,” it added.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The government also acknowledged President Trump’s “sincere <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910785/fo-reiterates-support-for-trump-offer-to-resolve-kashmir-issue">offers</a>” to help resolve the longstanding dispute of Jammu and Kashmir between India and Pakistan — an issue that lies at the heart of regional instability.</p>
<p>“Durable peace in South Asia would remain elusive until the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Jammu and Kashmir,” it observed.</p>
<p>The government noted that President Trump’s leadership during the 2025 Pakistan-India crisis “manifestly showcases the continuation of his legacy of pragmatic diplomacy and effective peace-building”.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the post read that Pakistan remains hopeful that Trump’s “earnest efforts” will continue to contribute towards regional and global stability,  particularly in the context of ongoing crises in the Middle East, including the humanitarian <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918018">tragedy</a> unfolding in Gaza and the deteriorating <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917457/iran-state-tv-resumes-programming-after-israeli-attack-on-tehran-trump-reiterates-negotiations?_gl=1*1r5z0it*_ga*QUtLaWptVVNieFVlMFppeHc2Rl9TcWk0SW5zbHpRaGZVMjdfQnhWb3N6SHZvZHE5NjE3Mm5SQjRucVBhOUhCVQ..*_ga_C521GRS8DF*MTc1MDQ1NzIzMC40OC4xLjE3NTA0NTc5ODAuMC4wLjA.">escalation</a> involving Iran.</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly said that the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours agreed to a ceasefire after talks mediated by the US, and that the hostilities ended after he urged the countries to focus on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911719">trade</a> instead of war.</p>
<p>However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917877/modi-maintains-there-was-no-us-mediation-in-ceasefire-with-pakistan">maintained</a> in a recent conversation with Trump that the ceasefire was achieved through talks between the two countries’ militaries and not US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912153">mediation</a>.</p>

<p>Shortly later, in a <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114717932061341718" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on his Truth Social platform, Trump complained that he had been overlooked by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for his mediating role in conflicts between India and Pakistan, as well as Serbia and Kosovo.</p>
<p>“I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for this, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the war between India and Pakistan, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the war between Serbia and Kosovo, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for keeping peace between Egypt and Ethiopia,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump campaigned for office as a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20what%20I%20want%20to%20be%3A%20a%20peacemaker%20and%20unifier.">peacemaker</a>” who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end wars in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging five months into his presidency.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Trump’s claims for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910973">Abraham Accords</a> being able to “unify the Middle East” have yet to be realised, with war breaking out between Israel and Iran, and no end in sight to the relentless bombardment by US ally Israel in Gaza.</p>
<p>Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize nominations from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years.</p>
<p>He has made no secret of his irritation at missing out on the prestigious award, bringing it up as recently as February during an Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Former US president Barack Obama <a href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home">won the prize</a> soon after taking office in 2009, and Trump complained during his 2024 election campaign that his Democratic predecessor was not worthy of the honour.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918575/mango-production-in-rahim-yar-khan-hit-by-climate-change-water-shortage' target='_blank'><strong>Mango production in Rahim Yar Khan hit by climate change, water shortage</strong></a>
            <p><p>RAHIM YAR KHAN: Climate change, shortage of irrigation water and weather conditions suitable for pest attack reduced the mango yield by up to 45pc this year. The most affected variety is Chaunsa, which is also called Samar Bahisht in Rahim Yar Khan and Multan areas.</p>
<p>Similarly, the impact of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917651/in-dramatic-escalation-trump-says-wont-kill-khamenei-for-now-demands-irans-unconditional-surrender">Iran-Israel war</a> has also totally suspended the export of Sindhri mango variety, a favourite in Iran.</p>
<p>There are many mango orchards in Rahimabad, Bhong, Jamaldinwali, Sheikh Wahan, Yousafabad, Mianwali Qureshian, Sardar Garh, Zahirpir, Khanbela and Taranda Muhammad Pannah in district Rahim Yar Khan where the fruit is cultivated on over more than 60,000 acres of land.</p>
<p>According to the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority (Smeda), there are around 2,300 to 2,500 orchards of medium and large size growing in Rahim Yar Khan and there about 2,300 growers in the area. Some sources give the estimate of total mango production from Rahim Yar Khan alone as 250,000 to 300,000 tonnes.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Yield is estimated to be 45pc less this season: Iran-Israel war affects exports</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the mango orchard owners have mainly the variety of Chaunsa, which is most sweet and delicious and popular among most of the people in the country, there are also other varieties, including Dussehri, Malda, Lahotiya, Anwar Ratol, Langra, Sanglafia, Tota Pari, Kala Chaunsa, Sufaid Chaunsa and Desi. The yield of Dussehri, Sindhri and Anwar Ratol is less by up to 30pc but the most affected variety is Chaunsa, says Jam Farooq Ahmed Ganga, a mango orchard owner in Yousufabad in Rahim Yar Khan along the National Highway.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn</em>, he says that last year the mango yield was comparatively better but it is 40 to 50pc less than normal this year.</p>
<p>According to him, the main reason is climate change as in the months of February and March when the temperature of day was high and at night, it was low. This change in temperature affected the flowering process. Similarly, the weather condition was more suitable for the pests like thrips and hoppers which attacked the fruit.</p>
<p>“This year, the mango farmer was very much happy because there were no windstorms in the district but still there was less yield of mango.”</p>
<p>Muhammad Yousuf, a trader who purchases the mango orchards on lease on a yearly basis in the Sheikh Wahan and Pallo Shah areas, says that the mango orchard rates are higher this year. He says that the mango orchard owners were demanding Rs1m to Rs3m more for the last year. Regarding expenses, he says, “Last year, there were expenses of Rs3m on a mango orchard worth Rs30m but this year, the expenses increased to Rs4.5m.”</p>
<p>Yousuf told that in the start of mango season the rate of mango was better in big cities and it was also being exported to Iran but after the start of the Iran-Israel war, the export closed. He adds, “The export rate of Sindhri was Rs7,500 per 40kg which has dropped to Rs5,000 per 40kg now. Similarly, the 10kg crate of Sindhri was Rs2,200 which is now Rs1,200 and the crate of Dussehri was Rs1,500 but it’s now being sold at Rs900 to Rs1,000,”</p>
<p>Aun Muhammad, a resident of Rahim Yar Khan who works in a mango juice and pulp factory in Karachi, says that this year they are purchasing mango at Rs300 to Rs500 per 40kg rate. He says that during the current year, the mango of Rahim Yar Khan matured on time but the mango of Multan division has not matured yet which affects its sweetness and weight. “The price of pulp, which is mostly exported, will ultimately increase due to less production of mango,” he predicts.</p>
<p>Mian Arshad, a mango farmer of Chak Abbas, says there is no horticulture specialist in the agriculture department in Rahim Yar Khan to guide the mango farmers for maximum yield.</p>
<p>He says there is neither any grading or packing plant at the government level in the district nor any cargo flights from the Sheikh Zayed International Airport (SZIP) that’s why the exporters of Karachi, Lahore and Multan are earning the best profits compared to hardworking mango farmers of his area.</p>

Many Zambians have raised the issue of this looting for years, but have met coordinated resistance. Consequently, Zambia’s treasury loses billions of dollars in revenue. These losses are driven by well-known multinationals working in concert with certain insiders close&nbsp;to the Zambian state.</p><p>Your editorial also says: “The US decision to cut $50m a year in aid to Zambia … is dreadful, and the reason given, corruption, rings hollow.” Alas, I disagree and wish to place this in context.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/ordinary-zambians-lose-out-twice-to-global-looting-and-local-corruption">Continue reading...</a></p>
