                <h2>SBP cuts interest rate by 100bps to 11pc</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) cut the policy rate on Monday to 11 per cent, amid trade and industry sectors advocating for a significant cut.</p>
<p>The central bank‚Äôs policy rate, after being slashed by 1,000bps from 22pc since June 2024 in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1888017">six intervals</a>, previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897015">stood at 12pc</a>.</p>
<p>April inflation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908067/inflation-hits-all-time-low-of-03pc">stood</a> at a low of 0.3pc, largely due to a high base a year ago. The reduction is also primarily attributed to lower prices of key food staples such as wheat and its derivatives, onions, potatoes and certain pulses, as well as a cut in electricity and fuel charges. These items carry significant weight in the inflation basket ‚Äî the Consumer Price Index (CPI) ‚Äî meaning minor price changes can heavily influence the overall rate.</p>
<p>According to a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.sbp.org.pk/press/2025/Pr-05-May-2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a> issued by the SBP today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the interest rate, noting that inflation in April turned out to be lower than expected, mainly due to a drop in prices of perishable food items and electricity and fuel charges.</p>
<p>According to the statement, core inflation declined in April, primarily reflecting favourable base-effect amid moderate demand conditions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOverall, the MPC assessed that the inflation outlook has improved further relative to the previous assessment,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>The committee viewed that the heightened global uncertainty surrounding trade tariffs and geopolitical developments could pose challenges for the economy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn this backdrop, the MPC emphasised the importance of maintaining a measured monetary policy stance,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>The committee also noted key developments since the last meeting.</p>
<p>It said that the provisional real GDP growth for Q2-FY25 was reported at 1.7 per cent year-on-year whereas Q1 growth was revised up to 1.3pc from 0.9pc.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecond, the current account recorded a sizable surplus of $1.2 billion in March, mainly due to record-high workers‚Äô remittances,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>It said that the surplus and SBP‚Äôs foreign exchange purchases partially cushioned the impact of large ongoing debt repayments on the SBP‚Äôs foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>It also said that recent surveys suggested further improvement in both consumer and business sentiments, adding that shortfall in tax collection has continued to widen.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGlobal uncertainty, particularly around tariffs, has led the IMF to sharply downgrade its 2025 and 2026 growth projections for both advanced and emerging economies,‚Äù the statement said, adding that the tariff uncertainty also triggered heightened financial market volatility and a sharp decline in global oil prices.</p>
<p>‚ÄúConsidering the evolving developments and risks, the MPC viewed that the real policy rate remains adequately positive to stabilise inflation in the target range of 5pc to 7pc, while ensuring that the economy grows on a sustainable basis,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>Separately, the statement said that headline inflation, continuing its downtrend, fell to 0.3pc y/y in April, driven primarily by food and energy prices.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA sharp decline in wheat and allied product prices, moderation in global commodity prices and downward adjustment in electricity tariffs were the major drivers of this ease in food and energy prices,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese factors also contributed to the moderation in inflation expectations of consumers,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>Moreover, core inflation, after remaining sticky at around 9pc over the past few months, declined to 8.0pc y/y in April, it added.</p>
<p>The statement said that going forward, the committee anticipated inflation to gradually inch up in the coming months and stabilise within the target range of 5pc to 7pc.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis outlook is, however, subject to both upside and downside risks emanating from volatility in wheat and other food prices, timing and magnitude of energy price adjustments, potential global supply-chain disruptions and uncertain commodity price outlook.‚Äù</p>
<p>Earlier, it noted that despite a long-term decline in inflation and real interest rates above 11pc, opinions on the central bank‚Äôs likely decision on the policy rate were divided, with trade and industry sectors advocating for a significant cut.</p>
<p>Researchers had conducted polls to gauge market sentiment, but the 0.3pc inflation in April has caused division among those who were confident there would be no change in the interest rate.</p>
<p>However, many experts <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908316">believed</a> the SBP would cut the rate by 50bps. Some had also found reasons for a likely status quo as they feel the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">war-like situation</a> between India and Pakistan has created uncertainty that may escalate prices.</p>
<p>This situation may force the central bank to adopt a cautious approach in the face of sudden shocks of higher inflation.</p>
<p>The SBP‚Äôs MPC met today to set the key interest rate for the next two months. In March, the central bank delivered a surprise by leaving its policy rate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897015">unchanged</a> in the last review, disappointing the business community.</p></p>

                <h2>May 9 riots: SC reserves verdict on military trials case, will announce decision this week</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Supreme Court‚Äôs (SC) Constitutional Bench on Monday reserved its verdict on the appeals against the decision to declare the trial of civilians in military courts null and void, saying it would announce the verdict later this week.</p>
<p>The development came as the CB resumed hearing a case pertaining to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783105">military trials</a> and the subsequent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881338">sentencing of civilians</a> for their role in attacks on army installations during the riots that followed ex-premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">Imran Khan‚Äôs arrest</a> on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9, 2023</a>.</p>
<p>The CB resumed hearing a set of 38 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1797503">intra-court appeals</a> (ICAs) moved by the federal and provincial gover¬≠nments as well as Shuhada Forum Balochistan, among others, against the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783105">widely-praised</a> October 2023 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783065/may-9-riots-sc-declares-military-trials-of-civilians-null-and-void">ruling</a> by a five-judge bench that unanimously declared that trying the accused civilians in military courts <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783065/may-9-riots-sc-declares-military-trials-of-civilians-null-and-void">violated the Constitution</a>.</p>
<p>The bench ‚Äî led by Justice Aminuddin and also including Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, and Shahid Bilal Hassan ‚Äî is reviewing whether the trial of civilians in military courts is constitutional or not.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#the-hearing" id="the-hearing" title="Permalink"></a>The hearing</h2>
<p>At the outset of today‚Äôs hearing, Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan said he would begin by speaking about what happened on May 9.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur country is in a state of war almost all year round,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúArmy installations were attacked under a well-thought-out plan; on May 9, 49 places were attacked from 3pm onwards,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He noted that a prime minister had been hanged in Pakistan ‚Äî referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1160422">hanging of ex-PM Zulfikar Ali Bhutto</a> ‚Äî but even then, there was no such protest. ‚ÄúNo political party had attacked the army in the past.‚Äù</p>
<p>The attorney general further referenced Pakistan‚Äôs political history, saying that all parties had been banned during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1208863">Movement for the Restoration of Democracy</a> (MRD).</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúThe entire MRD leadership was in chains ‚Äî Asghar Khan was under house arrest for three and a half years,‚Äù the AGP said. ‚ÄúEven during this time, no one took a step like people did on May 9.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúEven if this was a reaction to May 9, it cannot be allowed; ours is not an ordinary country,‚Äù the AGP said. ‚ÄúDue to geography, we face a lot of threats.‚Äù</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail remarked that the question before the court was not about whether a crime was committed, saying: ‚ÄúYou come to the appeal, tell us about the appeal.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he continued his arguments, AGP Awan said that the army took departmental action for negligence in the Jinnah House attack.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThree senior officers were retired without pension and benefits, including a lieutenant general, a brigadier and a lieutenant colonel,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDissatisfaction was expressed with the performance of 14 officers, dislike and distrust mean that they cannot get any further promotion,‚Äù the AGP said.</p>
<p>To this, Justice Mandokhail asked whether the army had initiated criminal proceedings against any army officer.</p>
<p>The attorney general said that criminal action would have been taken only when a crime had been committed, noting that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1761893">departmental action had been taken</a> for not stopping the incidents of May 9.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Army Act is clear that departmental action will also be accompanied by criminal punishment,‚Äù Justice Mandokhail replied.</p>
<p>AGP Awan then said that he would present arguments on May 9, as well as the July 21 decision and appeal.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere were 23 incidents in Punjab, eight in KP, seven in Sindh and one in Balochistan. General Headquarters, Lahore, Mianwali Air Base, and ISI offices were attacked.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll the incidents on May 9 were not accidental ‚Äî the entire corps was inactive from 5:30pm to 9pm. If there was an external aggression on Lahore on May 9, it could not have been responded to,‚Äù the AGP said.</p>
<p>Justice Hassan Azhar Rizvi remarked that at the time of Bhutto‚Äôs execution, people were making arrests and people set themselves on fire and self-immolated. ‚ÄúNo one set property on fire at that time.‚Äù</p>
<p>The attorney general was in agreement, saying that his father himself had faced cases as a political activist yet it never occurred to anyone to damage the property by burning it.</p>
<p>Justice Hilali asked whether the gate of Jinnah House was broken open or if someone had opened it from inside. ‚ÄúIf someone opened it from inside, it would be a crime of collusion,‚Äù she added.</p>
<p>The AGP said he would check about it and then apprise the court.</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail asked whether what happened on May 9 was done with the intention of committing a crime.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWas the intention to register a protest or to attack? Maybe the intention was to protest but the matter got out of hand. It should not have gone beyond the limit but it did,‚Äù Justice Mandokhail said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat happened on May 9 was a crime,‚Äù AGP Awan asserted.</p>
<p>Here, Justice Afghan told the attorney general that he had gone down the wrong path.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe did not allow anyone to talk about the merits of the May 9 incident. Talking about the merits will affect the cases in the trial and appeal. If we go into the details of May 9, many questions will arise.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMany questions arise that you may not be able to answer, such as whether the general who retired without pension was the Lahore Corps Commander,‚Äù Justice Afghan said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#military-courts-sentences" id="military-courts-sentences" title="Permalink"></a>Military courts‚Äô sentences</h2>
<p>On Dec 13, 2024, the SC‚Äôs constitutional bench <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783105">conditionally allowed</a> military courts to pronounce reserved verdicts of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279#:~:text=A%20year%20on%2C%20as%20of%20May%209%2C%202024%2C%2085%20of%20these%20civilians%20are%20still%20in%20military%20custody.">85 civilians</a> who were in custody for their alleged involvement in the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>Subsequently, on December 21, military courts <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880141">sentenced 25 civilians</a> to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their involvement. Days later, another <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881338">60 civilians</a> were handed jail terms of a similar period over the matter.</p>
<p>On January 2, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884089">mercy petitions</a> of 19 accused were accepted on humanitarian grounds, while 48 other pleas have been processed to Courts of Appeal.</p>
<p>The sentencing of civilians by military courts was not only condemned by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880270">PTI</a>, but the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880757/may-9-riots-us-joins-uk-eu-in-voicing-concerns-over-military-trials-of-civilians">United States</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880609/trying-civilians-in-military-courts-lacks-transparency-uk-says-after-may-9-fgcm-convictions">United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880384">European Union</a> also raised concerns, saying the move contradicted international laws.</p>
