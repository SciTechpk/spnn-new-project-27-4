<p>“Sirens sounded in several areas across Israel following the identification of missiles from Iran toward the state of Israel,” the military said in a statement.</p>
<p>“At this time, the (air force) is operating to intercept and strike where necessary to eliminate the threat,” it said, instructing citizens to seek shelter as <em>AFP</em> journalists heard sirens in Jerusalem.</p>

<hr />
<p>Earlier today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran would pay “a very heavy price for the premeditated murder of civilians, women and children” during a visit to the site of a missile strike on a residential building in the coastal city of Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>Two missile-like projectiles hit two locations in central Tehran, leading to explosions, the semi-official <em>Tasnim</em> news agency reported on Sunday, saying the blast occurred near the central Valiasr Square.</p>
<p>Iranian media said an Israeli strike hit the Tehran police headquarters in the city centre.</p>
<p>“The Greater Tehran Police Command was hit by one of the enemy’s drones,” <em>ISNA</em> news agency reported, citing a police statement. It added that the attack caused “minor damage” and injured “a number” of police personnel.</p>
<p>President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran’s responses to Israeli attacks will be “more decisive and severe” if Israel’s hostile actions continue, according to state media.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian added that Iran’s military has so far responded “strongly and appropriately”, the report said.</p>
<p>The Iranian president also urged Iraq to block Israel from using its airspace and territory to launch attacks on the Islamic republic.</p>
<p>“We emphasise that the Iraqi government must exercise greater vigilance and protection of its borders and airspace so that Iraqi territory is not misused against the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Pezeshkian said in a call with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, according to the Iranian presidency website.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Tehran said Israel wanted to “drag the conflict to the Persian Gulf” after the latter attacked the world’s largest gas field that Iran shares with Qatar, igniting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours">another</a> round of deadly tit-for-tat missile barrages.</p>
<p>A day after Israel wiped out the top echelon of Iran’s military command, it hit Iran’s oil and gas industry for the first time. Iran then partially suspended gas production at the South Pars gas field, which it shares with Qatar.</p>
<p>At least 10 people were killed overnight, including three children, and more than 140 were injured by missiles that had hit homes in northern and central Israel, authorities said, according to <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>Rescue teams combed through the rubble of residential buildings destroyed in strikes, using flashlights and sniffer dogs to look for survivors.</p>

<p>Following the fresh exchange of missiles, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran does not want its conflict with Israel to expand to neighbouring countries unless the situation is forced, adding its response had been based on self-defence.</p>
<p>Araghchi said Tehran had been responding to foreign aggression, and that if this aggression stopped, Iran’s reactions would also cease.</p>
<p>The foreign minister said the Israeli strikes on the offshore South Pars gas field that Iran shares with Qatar were a “blatant aggression and a very dangerous act”.</p>
<p>“Dragging the conflict to the Persian Gulf is a strategic mistake, and its aim is to drag the war beyond Iranian territory,” he said.</p>

<p>The foreign minister accused Israel of seeking to sabotage ongoing Iran-US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903561">nuclear talks</a>, which, according to him, could have opened the way for an agreement. Tehran was set to present a proposal this Sunday during a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">sixth round</a> of talks, which were cancelled following recent escalations.</p>
<p>“Israel’s attack would never have happened without the US green light and support,” Araghchi said, adding Tehran does not believe American statements that Washington had taken no part in recent attacks.</p>
<p>“It is necessary for the United States to condemn Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities if they want to prove their goodwill.”</p>
<p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/after-sitting-out-the-iran-attack-u-s-steps-in-to-help-israel-intercept-missiles-16749866" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that the US military was “operating in the air, on land and at sea to shoot down Iranian missiles fired at Israel”. “US jet fighters, Navy destroyers and ground-based air-defence systems had [been] positioned to help counter any attack”, it said, citing US officials.</p>
<p><em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/14/israel-iran-war-us-nuclear-program-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Axios</a></em> quoted a US official as saying that Israel has urged the Trump administration to join the war, but said currently the administration was not considering it.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Israel’s Oil Refineries said its pipelines and transmission lines in Haifa had been damaged by missile strikes by Iran, according to a regulatory filing to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>It said that no injuries or casualties were reported at the sites, with refining facilities continuing to operate despite a shutdown of some downstream operations.</p>
<p>It said it is examining the impact of the damage on its operations and implications on its financial results.</p>
<p>Explosions echoed through Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as missiles streaked across the skies overnight, as interceptor rockets were launched in response. The military lifted its shelter-in-place advisory nearly an hour after issuing the warning.</p>
<p>Israeli media said at least 35 people were missing after a strike hit Bat Yam, a city south of Tel Aviv. A spokesperson for the emergency services said a missile hit an eight-storey building there and while many people were rescued, there were fatalities.</p>
<p>It was unclear how many buildings were hit overnight.</p>
<p>The latest wave of Iranian attacks began shortly after 11pm on Saturday (1am PKT Sunday), when air raid sirens blared in Jerusalem and Haifa, sending around a million people into bomb shelters.</p>
<p>Around 2:30am local time (4:30am PKT), the Israeli military warned of another incoming missile barrage and urged residents to seek shelter.</p>
<p>So far, at least 13 people in Israel have been killed and over 300 others injured since Iran launched its retaliatory attacks on Friday.</p>

<p>Brigadier General Ali Mohammad Naeini, the spokesperson for the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), said in a televised statement that Israel’s fuel production facilities for fighter jets and energy supply centres were targeted with a large number of drones and missiles, <em>Press TV</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/06/14/749850/Iran-IRGC-attack-Israel-fighter-jet-fuel-energy-sites-missiles-drones" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The IRGC spokesperson also claimed that the IRGC aerospace defense system had “successfully intercepted and destroyed” three Israeli cruise missiles, 10 drones, and dozens of “hostile mini-drones in the affected regions”.</p>
<p>The elite force warned Tehran’s attacks will be “heavier and more extensive” if Israel continues its hostilities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new commander of Iran’s Khatam al-Anbia Central Headquarters vowed that the Islamic Republic will keep conducting military operations against the Zionist regime vigorously to make the criminal enemy regret its aggression, <em>Tasnim</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/06/15/3335855/iran-s-operations-to-continue-unabated-until-israel-shows-remorse-senior-general" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>In comments on Sunday, Major General Ali Shadmani underlined that Iran’s retaliatory military operations against the Israeli regime will continue relentlessly.</p>
<p>“The chain of military operations by the Iranian Armed Forces that have brought pride to the country will continue in a much more massive and harsh manner than the past until the criminal and aggressive Zionist enemy regrets what it did completely,” he stated.</p>
<p>Iran said it had <a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1404/03/25/3335833/%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%DB%8C-2-%D8%B9%D8%B6%D9%88-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%AC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arrested two individuals</a> it accused of being members of Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad in Alborz province while they were preparing explosives and electronic devices, <em>Tasnim</em> reported today.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Yemen’s Houthis also said they targeted Israel in coordination with Iran, the first time a regional group has publicly announced joint cooperation on attacks with Tehran.</p>
<p>The Yemeni group targeted central Israel’s Jaffa with several ballistic missiles in the last 24 hours, military spokesperson Yehya Sarea <a class="link--external" href="https://snn.ir/fa/news/1274093/%DB%8C%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B4%DA%A9%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%88%D9%82%E2%80%8C%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%AA-%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%BA%D8%A7%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%81-%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF%DB%8C%D9%85-%D9%81%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%85" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a televised address.</p>
<p>“Triumphing for the oppressed Palestinian and Iranian peoples […] This operation was coordinated with the operations carried out by the Iranian army against the criminal Israeli enemy,” he added.</p>
<p>Israel’s El Al Airlines said it has cancelled flights to and from many European cities as well as Tokyo and Moscow until June 23.</p>

<p>The Israeli military warned Iranians living near weapons facilities to evacuate, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks by Israel so far were nothing compared with what Iran would see in the coming days.</p>
<p>“The Israeli military will strike these sites and will continue to peel away the Iranian snake’s skin in Tehran and everywhere — targeting nuclear capabilities and weapons systems,” Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.</p>
<p>Just after his country’s attacks on Iranian oil and gas sites, Katz had <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/Israel_katz/status/1933997323161583831" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on X:“Tehran is burning”.</p>

<p>In Iran, nearly 140 people have been killed since Friday, with 78 on the first day of Israel’s campaign, and scores more yesterday, including 60 when a missile brought down a 14-storey apartment block in Tehran, where 29 of the dead were children.</p>
<p>Iranians can seek shelter in mosques and schools during Israeli attacks, as well as subway systems, which will be open at all times from tonight, government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani told state TV on Sunday.</p>
<p>“There is no problem with the provision of food, medicine, fuel,” she added.</p>
<p>The Shahran oil depot in Tehran was targeted in an Israeli attack, Iran said, but added the situation was <a class="link--external" href="https://snn.ir/fa/news/1274102/%D8%A2%D8%AA%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%86%D9%81%D8%AA-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88-%D9%85%D8%AE%D8%B2%D9%86-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%AE%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A8-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AA-%DA%A9%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%84-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">under control</a>.</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump said earlier today that if Iran attacks the United States in “any way, shape or form”, it would face the might of the US military “at levels never seen before”.</p>
<p>Trump said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114685507052179501" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on his Truth Social platform that the US had nothing to do with an attack on Iran overnight and that “we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict!!!”</p>

<p>Three drones were launched toward the Ain al-Asad air base housing US forces in western Iraq following Israel’s strikes on Iran, the <em>Associated Press</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-iran-war-latest-06-14-2025-19c175edc115d99f0d35c24b38ab1773#:~:text=Drones%20launched%20toward%20base%20housing%20US%20forces%20in%20Iraq%20shot%20down" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>, citing a US military official and a second US official.</p>
<p>The drones were shot down, the officials said. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the report.</p>
<p><em>AP</em> further said that for a second day, supporters of armed factions in Iraq held a demonstration in Baghdad to denounce Israel’s bombing of Iran but did not attempt to breach a high-security zone where the US Embassy is located.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Germany, France and Britain are ready to hold immediate talks with Iran over Tehran’s nuclear programme in a bid to de-escalate the situation in the Middle East, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said.</p>
<p>Wadephul, who is on a visit to the Middle East, said he was trying to contribute towards a de-escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran, adding that Tehran had previously failed to take the opportunity to enter into constructive talks.</p>

<p>“I hope that’s still possible,” Wadephul told German public broadcaster <em>ARD</em> late on Saturday.</p>
<p>“Germany, together with France and Britain are ready. We’re offering Iran immediate negotiations about the nuclear programme, I hope ]the offer] is accepted.”</p>
<p>“This is also a key prerequisite for reaching a pacification of this conflict, that Iran presents no danger to the region, for the state of Israel or to Europe.”</p>
<p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz spoke to Oman’s Sultan Haitham bin Tariq al-Said on Sunday morning and both agreed it was important that the conflict in the Middle East should not escalate, a German government spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“The chancellor thanked (the sultan) for Oman’s mediation efforts towards ending Iran’s nuclear programme. He emphasised that Iran must never have nuclear weapons,” the spokesperson said in a statement, adding that both leaders underlined their willingness to help end the conflict through diplomatic means.</p>
<p>Tehran called off <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912795">nuclear talks</a> that Washington had said were the only way to halt Israel’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours">bombing</a>. Netanyahu claimed Israel’s strikes had set back Iran’s nuclear programme “possibly by years” and rejected international calls for restraint.</p>

<p>A round of US-Iran nuclear talks that was due to be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">held in Oman</a> on Sunday was cancelled, with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi saying the discussions could not take place while Iran was being subjected to Israel’s “barbarous” attacks.</p>

<p>Britain could potentially support Israel in its conflict with Iran, but the decision to send additional military jets to the Middle East was made mainly to protect British bases and personnel, British finance minister Rachel Reeves said today.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Sky News</em>, Reeves called for a de-escalation in the conflict and said the decision to send additional jets to the region was a “precautionary move”.</p>
<p>Asked if Britain would come to Israel’s aid if asked, Reeves said: “We have, in the past, supported Israel when there have been missiles coming in.”</p>
<p>She added: “We’re sending in assets to both protect ourselves and also potentially to support our allies.”</p>

<p>Iran did not send any message to Israel via a third country, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said on Sunday, after Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said earlier Tehran had asked Nicosia to convey “some messages” to Israel.</p>
<p>Since yesterday, Iran’s foreign minister has contacted his <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/IRIMFA_EN/status/1933974812785016842" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chinese</a>, <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/IRIMFA_EN/status/1933978477352665174" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Russian</a>, <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/IRIMFA_EN/status/1933946335905894671" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Azerbaijani</a> and <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/IRIMFA_EN/status/1933917165674983814" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Armenian</a> counterparts to discuss the regional developments.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#gas-field-attack" id="gas-field-attack" title="Permalink"></a>Gas field attack</h2>
<p>In the first apparent attack to hit Iran’s energy infrastructure, the semi-official <em>Tasnim</em> news agency said Iran partially suspended production at the world’s biggest gas field after an Israeli strike caused a fire there on Saturday.</p>
<p>The South Pars field is located offshore in Iran’s southern Bushehr province and is responsible for the lion’s share of gas production in Iran, the world’s third largest gas producer after the United States and Russia.</p>
<p>The strike caused a fire, which has been extinguished, the Iranian oil ministry said. The fire broke out in one of the four units of Phase 14 of South Pars, halting production of 12 million cubic metres of gas, <em>Tasnim</em> said.</p>
<p>Iran produces around 275 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas per year or some 6.5pc of global gas output, and consumes it domestically as it cannot export gas due to sanctions.</p>
<p>Iran shares the field with Qatar, which calls the field North Field. Qatar produces 77 million tonnes of liquefied gas from the field with the help of global majors such as Exxon and Shell and supplies the gas to Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Fears about potential disruption to the region’s oil exports had already driven up oil prices 9 per cent on Friday, even though Israel spared Iran’s oil and gas on the first day of its attacks.</p>
<p>An Iranian general, Esmail Kosari, said on Saturday that Tehran was reviewing whether to close the Strait of Hormuz, controlling access to the Gulf for tankers.</p>

<p>With Israel saying its operation could last weeks, and Netanyahu urging Iran’s people to rise up against their rulers, fears have grown of a regional conflagration dragging in outside powers.</p>
<p>B’Tselem, a leading Israeli human rights organisation, said on Saturday that instead of exhausting all possibilities for a diplomatic resolution, Israel’s government had chosen to start a war that puts the entire region in danger.</p>
<p>Tehran has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916637/iran-threatens-to-target-us-bases-if-conflict-breaks-out">warned</a> Israel’s allies that their military bases in the region would come under fire too if they helped shoot down Iranian missiles.</p>
<p>Israel sees Iran’s nuclear programme as a threat to its existence, and said the bombardment was designed to avert the last steps to production of a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>Tehran has repeatedly said the programme is entirely civilian and that it does not seek an atomic bomb. However, UN’s nuclear watchdog IAEA <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916895">reported</a> it this week as violating obligations under the global non-proliferation treaty.</p></p>

<p>Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/israel-launches-strikes-on-iran">launched</a> an air offensive against Iran on Friday, killing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">commanders and scientists</a> and bombing nuclear sites in a stated bid to stop Tehran building an atomic weapon, which the latter has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a>, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p>

<p>He noted that 450 Pakistani <em>zaireen</em> (pilgrims) had been evacuated from Iran yesterday. Arrangements have been made for the safe evacuation of Pakistani students currently residing in Iran, including 154 in the first batch.</p>
<p>“Our Embassy in Iraq is in contact with Pakistani <em>zaireen</em> who are stranded due to the closure of airspace,” Dar said on X. “Measures are underway to ensure their safe stay in Iraq and possible evacuation.”</p>
<p>He noted that the Crisis Management Unit at the Foreign Office is operational 247 and can be contacted at:</p>

<p>The Foreign Office also advised all pilgrims from Pakistan to reconsider their travel plans to Iran and Iraq in view of the evolving security situation in the region.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s ambassador to Iran Mudasir Tipu is currently in his home country for official meetings, the FO said.</p>
<p>“The embassy under the instructions of the foreign minister along with Ministry of Foreign Affairs are working to extend all possible facilitation to Pakistanis in Iran,” it added.</p>

            <p><p>Group of Seven (G7) leaders will gather in the Canadian Rockies starting on Sunday amid growing splits with the United States over foreign policy and trade, with host Canada striving to avoid clashes with US President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>While Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says his priorities are strengthening peace and security, building critical mineral supply chains and creating jobs, issues such as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810">US tariffs</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917285/iran-says-israel-aims-to-drag-war-to-gulf-region-after-attack-on-worlds-largest-gas-field">conflicts</a> in the Middle East and Ukraine are expected to feature heavily.</p>
<p>US ally Israel launched a barrage of strikes across Iran on Thursday, a blow to Trump’s diplomatic efforts to prevent such an attack.</p>
<p>The summit will take place in the mountain resort of Kananaskis, some 90 kilometres west of Calgary.</p>
<p>The last time Canada played host, in 2018, Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1413281">left the summit</a> before denouncing then Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as “very dishonest and weak” and instructing the US delegation to withdraw its approval of the final communique.</p>
<p>“This will be a successful meeting if Donald Trump doesn’t have an eruption that disrupts the entire gathering. Anything above and beyond that is gravy,” said University of Ottawa international affairs professor Roland Paris, who was foreign policy adviser to Trudeau.</p>

<p>Trump has often mused about <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1883667">annexing</a> Canada and arrives at a time when Carney is threatening reprisals if Washington does not lift <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914658">tariffs</a> on steel and aluminum.</p>
<p>“The best-case scenario … is that there’s no real blow-ups coming out of the back end,” said Josh Lipsky, the chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council think tank and a former White House and State Department official.</p>
<p>Carney’s office declined to comment on how the Israeli strikes would affect the summit.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#no-joint-communique" id="no-joint-communique" title="Permalink"></a>No joint communique</h2>
<p>Diplomats said Canada has ditched the idea of a traditional comprehensive joint communique and would issue chair summaries instead, in hopes of containing a disaster and maintaining engagement with the US.</p>
<p>A senior Canadian official told reporters Ottawa wanted to focus on actions the seven members — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States — could take together.</p>
<p>Canadian Senator Peter Boehm, a veteran former diplomat who acted as Trudeau’s personal representative to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1413066">2018 summit</a>, said he had been told the summit would last longer than usual to give time for bilateral meetings with the US president.</p>
<p>Expected guests for parts of the Sunday to Tuesday event include leaders from Ukraine, Mexico, India, Australia, South Africa, South Korea and Brazil, who all have reasons to want to talk to Trump.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>“Many will want to talk to President Trump about their own particular interests and concerns,” Boehm said by phone.</p>
<p>A senior US official said on Friday working discussions would cover trade and the global economy, critical minerals, migrant and drug smuggling, wildfires, international security, artificial intelligence and energy security.</p>
<p>“The president is eager to pursue his goals in all of these areas including making Americas trade relationships fair and reciprocal,” the official said.</p>
<p>The visit of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the Oval Office in February descended into <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894932">acrimony</a> and has served as a warning for other world leaders about the delicate dance they face in negotiating with Trump.</p>
<p>But diplomats say the frustration of dealing with the Trump administration has made some keener to assert themselves.</p>
<p>Canada has long been one of Ukraine’s most vocal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1816803">supporters</a>. Trump came to power promising to end the war with Russia within 24 hours but diplomatic <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914985">efforts</a> to end the conflict have stalled.</p>
<p>One Ukrainian official involved in preparations for the summit said hope had faded for a strong statement in support of Ukraine. Instead, success for Kyiv would merely constitute an amicable meeting between Trump and Zelensky.</p>
<p>A European official said the G7 summit and the Nato summit in The Hague later in June provided an opportunity to underscore to Trump the need to press ahead with a sanctions bill put together by US senators alongside a new European package to pressure Russia into a ceasefire and broader talks.</p>

<p>Trump’s first international summit will offer some early clues on whether Trump is interested in working with allies to solve common problems, said Max Bergmann, a director at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.</p>
<p>“The big overarching question here is, basically, is the United States still committed to formats like the G7? That is going to be the big test,” Bergmann said.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron has said he has a good, but frank relationship with Trump despite differences on subjects such as Ukraine or climate change.</p>
<p>Macron said on Friday that a United Nations conference co-hosted between France and Saudi Arabia scheduled after the G7 to work towards a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians has been postponed.</p>

<p>The two-day visit is part of a broader diplomatic outreach to European nations. Cyprus assumes the rotating EU presidency for six months in early 2026. The two countries have close relations through their shared membership of the Commonwealth.</p></p>
