            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920702/rs75tr-black-hole-soes-losses-and-pensions-outpace-development-defence' target='_blank'><strong>Rs7.5tr black hole: SOEs’ losses and pensions outpace development, defence</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Losses of Rs342bn in six months seen as ‘Rs1.9bn daily drain’ on public finances<br />
• Circular debt crosses Rs4.9tr; unfunded pensions, weak governance deepen fiscal strain</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: With relentless financial haemorrhaging of nearly Rs342bn in just six months, the cumulative losses and unfunded pension liabilities of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have crossed Rs7.5tr — almost three times the country’s defence allocation of Rs2.55tr for FY26, and over seven times the upcoming year’s Public Sector Develop­ment Programme (Rs1tr).</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance informed the Cabinet Commit­tee on State-Owned Enterprises (CCoSOEs) on Friday that total SOE losses now exceed Rs5.8tr — nearly one-third of the recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920477">passed</a> Rs17.5tr federal budget for 2025-26.</p>
<p>Presided over by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurang­zeb, the meeting was briefed by the Central Monitoring Unit of the Finance Division on the biannual performance of federal SOEs for the period July to December 2024.</p>
<p>The report outlined the worsening state of SOEs, including cumulative losses of Rs5.8tr, with Rs342bn incurred in just six months.</p>
<p>Despite repeated <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878236">increases</a> in electricity and gas tariffs over the past three years, circular debt in the oil, gas and power sectors has surged to over Rs4.9tr — almost double the defence budget — severely affecting cash flows and asset valuations.</p>
<p>The committee was told that government fiscal support to SOEs — via grants, subsidies, loans and other injections — also exceeded Rs600bn in just six months, equivalent to nearly 10pc of total revenue receipts.</p>
<p>Unfunded pension liabilities in power distribution companies (Discos) and other SOEs, estimated at Rs1.7tr, remain off the government’s books, as do the pension obligations of Pakistan Railways.</p>
<p>Government guarantees currently stand at Rs2.2tr, while costs related to debt rollovers and financial restructuring further tighten fiscal space. The meeting was informed of persistent governance issues, particularly weak transparency in beneficial interest disclosures under IFRS Section 30, and other regulatory compliance gaps. A lack of strategic alignment and operational inefficiencies were identified as urgent areas for reform.</p>
<p>The cabinet committee noted with concern the staggering Rs5.8tr in cumulative losses, including Rs342bn in just six months — a daily average loss of Rs1.9bn, according to an official statement.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Aurangzeb deplored inefficiencies in Disco operations, delays in grid upgrades by NTDC, and ballooning pension obligations. He warned that weak governance standards are undermining fiscal space and deterring investor confidence.</p>
<p>He stressed the need for urgent reform in the power and energy sectors, where circular debt has crossed Rs4.9tr, and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to enhancing transparency, financial discipline, and accountability across SOEs.</p>
<p>He vowed to push through governance and operational reforms to ensure the financial sustainability of public sector entities.</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb also directed that all government-nominated directors on SOE boards exercise due diligence and actively contribute to improving financial and operational performance through informed decision-making.</p>
<p>Ironically, each SOE board includes at least one senior official from the finance ministry — alongside representatives from relevant line ministries — who receive generous remunerations for attending quarterly board meetings, yet the financial bleeding remains unchecked.</p>
<p>The finance minister underscored the importance of aligning business plans with national priorities and tackling operational challenges in a coordinated and timely fashion. The meeting was also attended by ministers from the ministries of Power, Maritime Affairs, and Science and Technology.</p>
<p>The committee approved the appointment of chairpersons for Quetta Electric and Gujranwala Electric, as well as the constitution of the Board of Directors for the Independent System Market Operator (ISMO) and an independent director for GENCO Holding Company Ltd (GHCL), as proposed by the Power Division.</p>
<p>It also approved the nomination of independent directors for the boards of Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO), Power Information Technology Company (PITC), and the formation of the board for Energy Infrastructure Development and Management Company (EIDMC).</p>
<p>Additionally, the committee approved a summary from the Ministry of Railways seeking the winding up of three railway subsidiaries — RAILCOP, PRACS, and PRFTC.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920716/dar-rules-out-pakistan-joining-abraham-accords' target='_blank'><strong>Dar rules out Pakistan joining Abraham Accords</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Reiterates firm support for two-state solution to Israel-Palestine conflict<br />
• Insists Trump’s Nobel nomination a joint civil-military decision<br />
• Dismisses claim Islamabad sought ceasefire</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Foreign Mini­ster Ishaq Dar on Friday ruled out the possibility of Pakistan joining the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910973">Abraham Accords</a>, stating that such a move would effectively mean abandoning the country’s longstanding support for a two-state solution to the Palestinian conflict and recognising Israel.</p>
<p>Speaking at a news conference at the Foreign Office, Mr Dar, who also serves as deputy prime minister, reiterated Pakistan’s firm support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
<p>His comments came in response to recent remarks by US Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff, who suggested that more countries, which were not previously “contemplated”, were preparing to join the US-brokered accords, which normalise ties with Israel.</p>
<p>Witkoff had joined President Donald Trump at the White House <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917868">lunch</a> for Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir.</p>
<p>“We are not ready to recognise Israel until the two-state solution to the Palestine conflict is accepted,” Mr Dar said. “There is no change in our stated policy on the Palestine issue.”</p>
<p>He added that signing the Abraham Accords would be tantamount to abandoning Pakistan’s long-standing demand for a Palestinian state with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, based on pre-1967 borders. “Let it be clear to everyone that our seven-decades-long policy rem­ains unchanged,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Trump’s Nobel nomination</strong></p>
<p>Addressing criticism over Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514">nomination</a> of President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, Mr Dar said the decision was made jointly by the country’s civilian and military leadership.</p>
<p>He emphasised that the nomination, submitted prior to the start of the Israel-Iran <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">conflict</a>, was based on Trump’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914608">role</a> in de-escalating tensions between India and Pakis­tan and his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916758">remarks</a> regarding the Kashmir dispute.</p>
<p>The foreign minister recalled that Trump “tweeted 15 or 16 times about that”.</p>
<p>Trump’s repeated cla­i­ms on social media about his role in facilitating the May 10 ceasefire between Pakistan and India have irritated New Delhi.</p>
<p>“The decision to nominate President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize was in the context of his role in the India-Pakistan conflict and his statements on the Kashmir issue,” Mr Dar said.</p>
<p>“It was a collective decision by the civil-military leadership. I signed the letter on June 11, days before the Iran-Israel war began. The prime minister’s approval was obviously part of the process.”</p>
<p>Mr Dar referred to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s remarks at a June 4 event at the US Embassy, where he reportedly called Trump “a man of peace”.</p>
<p>The nomination has stirred controversy within Pakistan, with many questioning the rationale behind the move.</p>
<p><strong>Indian ceasefire claims</strong></p>
<p>Responding to Indian officials’ statements that claimed Pakistan had sought a ceasefire, FM Dar dismissed the assertions and reiterated Islamabad’s position that dialogue must be based on equality.</p>
<p>“We didn’t ask anyone for a ceasefire, nor would we ask anyone for dialogue,” he said.</p>
<p>“If India wants talks, we are ready. But we are a dignified nation, we won’t beg. Pakistan is prepared to talk on all outstanding issues, including Kashmir and terrorism, at any venue, but in a respectful manner. The ball is in their court. It takes two to tango.”</p>
<p>His remarks directly challenge New Delhi’s narrative and reaffirm Pakistan’s readiness for dialogue grounded in mutual respect and national dignity.</p>

            <p><p>China has expanded the economic safeguards for segments of its population affected by flood control schemes in times of extreme rainfall, including pledges of direct compensation from the central government and payments for livestock losses.</p>
<p>In China, diverting floodwaters to areas next to rivers is a major step in managing downstream flooding. As extreme <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1920179">rainfall</a> grows in frequency, China is increasingly utilising such areas, some of which have been unused until now and have been populated by farms, croplands and even residential buildings, stoking social tensions.</p>
<p>According to revised rules on compensation related to flood diversions released late on Friday, the central government will now bear 70 per cent of all compensation funds, with local governments responsible for the rest. Previously, the ratio was to be decided based on actual economic losses and the fiscal situation of local governments.</p>
<p>Livestock and poultry that cannot be relocated in time before the arrival of diverted floodwaters will also be included in the compensation scheme for the first time. Previously, only the loss of working animals could be claimed for compensation.</p>
<p>In the summer of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768536">2023</a>, almost 1 million people in Hebei, a province on the doorstep of Beijing, were relocated after record rain forced authorities to divert water from swollen rivers to some populated areas for storage, triggering anger over the homes and farms sacrificed to save the Chinese capital.</p>
<p>China currently has 98 designated flood diversion areas spanning major river basins including the Yangtze River basin, home to a third of the country’s population. During the 2023 Hebei floods, eight flood storage areas were used.</p>
<p>Since the start of the East Asia monsoon in early June, precipitation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze has been up to two times higher than usual, officials from the China Meterological Administration told reporters on Friday.</p>
<p>In other parts of China, daily rainfall measured by 30 meteorological stations in provinces such as Hubei and Guizhou broke records for the month of June, they said.</p>
<p>Guizhou was the focal point of China’s flood alleviation efforts this week, with one of its cities hit by flooding on a scale that meteorologists said could only happen once in 50 years, and at a speed that shocked its 300,000 residents.</p>
<p>That prompted Beijing to issue pledges on Thursday to move vulnerable populations and industries to low-flood areas and allocate more space for flood diversion.</p></p>
