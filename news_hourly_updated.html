                <h2>Search continues as death toll from Lyari building collapse rises to 15</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Rescue teams pulled more bodies from the rubble of a five-storey <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050">building collapse</a> in Karachi overnight, taking the toll on Saturday to 15 as the recovery operation continued for a second day,</p>
<p>The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, which was further weakened by recent rains, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922231#:~:text=DIG%20South%20Syed%20Asad%20Raza%20told%20Dawn">said</a> Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza.</p>
<p>Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed confirmed to <em>Dawn.com</em> that the toll had risen to 15. She added that there were nine wounded people since yesterday, out of whom six had been discharged and one had serious injuries.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRescue operation is still underway in Baghdadi, Lyari where the building had collapsed on Friday,‚Äù DIG Raza told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.</p>
<p>Karachi, home to more than 20 million, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.</p>
<p>There were conflicting reports of the death toll, with Rescue 1122 stating it as 16 and DIG Raza saying that a 17th body was recovered from the rubble.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn one side, debris has been removed up to the ground floor, while on the other side, the rescue team has removed debris up to the third floor,‚Äù the police officer added.</p>
<p>The deceased included nine men, six women and a child, according to a statement by Rescue 1122. Their bodies had been taken to the Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK).</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy daughter is under the rubble,‚Äù 54-year-old Dev Raj told <em>AFP</em> at the scene.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe was my beloved daughter. She was so sensitive but is under the burden of debris. She got married just six months ago.‚Äù</p>
<p>Rescue teams worked throughout the night, and families said that at least eight people were still believed to be trapped as temperatures climbed to 33 degrees Celsius in the morning.</p>
<p>Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, leading the Rescue 1122 efforts at the scene, told <em>AFP</em> that the operation continued through the night ‚Äúwithout interruption‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt may take eight to 12 hours more to complete,‚Äù he said earlier today.</p>
<p>Up to 100 people had been living in the building, senior police officer Arif Aziz told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>The incident came days after a portion of a building <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921188/no-casualties-reported-as-22-rescued-from-partially-collapsed-building-in-karachis-kharadar">collapsed</a> in the city‚Äôs Kharadar area. However, no casualties or injuries were reported.</p>
<p>The Public Account Committee of the Sindh Assembly had directed the provincial government in December to take urgent steps to evacuate over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879565">570 buildings</a> declared ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù by authorities across Karachi.</p>

<p>The Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=SBCA%20says%20issued%20multiple%20prior%20notices%20to%20vacate%20building">said</a> it had declared the plot as dangerous through its Technical Committee for Dangerous Buildings after a thorough inspection conducted in October 2022.</p>
<p>The authority said it had issued three ejectment notices to the residents since then, as well as asked K-Electric, Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) to disconnect utility services.</p>
<p>But Imran Khaskheli, an owner and resident watching the rescue operation on Saturday, denied receiving notices.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDo you think we are out of our senses to stay in an unsafe building with our families?‚Äù he said, speaking to <em>AFP</em>. He said he had seen cracks in the pillars of the building early on Friday morning.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúI knocked on all the doors and asked families to leave immediately,‚Äù Khaskheli said, adding that around 40 families lived in the building but that many did not heed his warning.</p>
<p>More than 50 buildings in the district have been declared unsafe, with six evacuated since yesterday, Karachi (South) Deputy Commissioner Javed Nabi Khoso told <em>AFP</em>.</p>

<p>Heavy machinery faced difficulty in reaching the site amid the narrow alleys of Lyari, a low-income neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Police even had to baton-charge a crowd that had gathered around the site to make way for machinery, officials added.</p>
<p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah sought a report on the collapse and details of dilapidated buildings from the SBCA.</p>
<p>Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani said a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=Saeed%20Ghani%20stresses%20timely%20evacuation%20of%20unsafe%20buildings">high-level committee</a> has been formed that will submit a report on the incident by Monday.

            <p><p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916217">total debt</a> of Pakistan has swelled by 12 per cent compared to last year to reach nearly Rs76.05 trillion at the end of May, according to statistics released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).</p>
<p>In its <a class="link--external" href="https://www.sbp.org.pk/ecodata/cengovdebt.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">debt bulletin</a> issued on Friday, the SBP reported the central government debt at Rs76.045tr, showing an increase of more than Rs8.31tr (12.3pc) in a year, when it stood at Rs67.73tr in May 2024.</p>
<p>The domestic debt stood at Rs53.46tr, posting a year-on-year growth of 15.9pc. The external debt was stated as nearly Rs22.59tr, 4.52pc higher than the same month last year.</p>
<p>The central government debt has grown by Rs45 billion from <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916217">March</a> till May, according to the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916059/fantastic-story-on-inflation-economic-survey-shows-ambitious-gdp-growth-for-fy25">released</a> last month.</p>

<p>The government‚Äôs total debt and liabilities had stood at Rs89.83tr at the end of March, according to the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.sbp.org.pk/reports/stat_reviews/Bulletin/2025/Jun/Chap-5.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data</a> released by the SBP in June.</p>
<p>The SBP data showed that Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) contributed around Rs35.24tr to the public debt ‚Äî surging from Rs27.70tr in May 2024 ‚Äî compared to Rs8.04tr by the market treasury bills, which have declined from Rs9.44tr last year.</p>
<p>SBP data from earlier this year <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885574">showed</a> that PIBs‚Äô long-term contribution to the central government‚Äôs debt had increased compared to the short-term treasury bills.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb had said the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916456#:~:text=Finance%20Minister%20Muhammad%20Aurangzeb%20said%20the%20government%20saved%20Rs850%20billion">saved Rs850bn</a> through refinancing while the central government‚Äôs debt increased by Rs5.36tr to Rs52.52tr in April 2025.</p>
<p>In contrast, the central government‚Äôs debt stood at Rs47.16tr in June 2024.</p>

The growth was largely driven by higher mobilisation through long-term instruments, while short-term and other components saw a decline.</p></p>
