            <p><p>Two people were killed while 10 others were injured in a bomb blast in the Wana tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lower South Waziristan district on Thursday, police said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">surge</a> in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">broke</a> a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.</p>
<p>Lower South Waziristan’s District Police Officer Tahir Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “Two people died, while two policemen were among 10 individuals injured in a blast in the Wana bazaar.”</p>
<p>He added that the wounded were immediately taken to the Wana District Headquarters Hospital. Security forces have cordoned off the area and initiated a search operation to trace the perpetrators, DPO Khan added.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Investigation was also underway to determine the nature of the bomb used, the officer noted.</p>
<p>The incident follows residents’ complaints of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929167/action-sought-against-armed-men-roaming-wana-bazaar">open display of firearms</a> and the free movement of armed men in Wana’s Rustam Bazaar, an important commercial hub of Lower South Waziristan.</p>
<p>Sources said no one was allowed to roam Rustam Bazaar openly carrying weapons, and that strict measures would be implemented soon to curb the practice.</p>
<p>Pakistan witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928076/militant-attacks-see-slight-rise-in-july-says-think-tank">slight uptick</a> in militant violence in July, according to a report released by the think tank Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss). KP, including its tribal districts, remained the epicentre of militancy, accounting for 53 of the 82 attacks recorded nationwide.</p>
<p>A day ago, a police constable was among <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929116/2-injured-as-upper-south-waziristan-dcs-vehicle-comes-under-attack">two people injured</a> when Upper South Waziristan Deputy Commissioner Asmatullah Wazir’s vehicle came under attack in the district’s Ladha tehsil.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, four security personnel and a policeman were among <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929080">seven people martyred</a> in two separate firing incidents in KP’s Karak and Peshawar districts.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>On Tuesday, unidentified attackers fired a rocket targeting a Scout camp in Wana. Although there were no reports of casualties or property damage, the explosion caused widespread fear and concern among residents.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, two militant commanders and the brother of a tribal elder were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928528/two-terrorists-elders-brother-killed-in-waziristan-clash">killed in a clash</a> between the banned TTP (Gul Bahadar group) and family members of elder Malik Ashiq Noor in the Dana area of Lower South Waziristan’s Birmal tehsil.</p>

            <p><p>Four workers trapped 900 feet underground in a Swat emerald mine were rescued during an operation, Rescue 1122 said on Thursday.</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, a major rescue operation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929128/rescue-operation-underway-after-emerald-mine-collapses-in-kps-malook-abad">was launched</a> after a section of the emerald mine collapsed, trapping multiple workers underground. According to initial reports by Rescue 1122 Swat, the mine caved in suddenly during extraction activity.</p>
<p>“Rescue 1122 medical teams are providing immediate medical assistance to the rescued workers,” Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi told <em>Dawn.com</em>. “The operation continued for several hours after the mine collapsed, in which more than 40 personnel participated.”</p>
<p>The rescue operation was led by District Emergency Officer Swat Rafiullah Marwat, as per Faizi.</p>
<p>“The trained personnel and modern equipment of Rescue 1122 made the operation successful,” Faizi said.</p>
<p>Mining in Swat’s lush mountains, particularly for emeralds, has long been criticised for poor regulation and inadequate oversight, often putting the lives of workers at <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875437">serious risk</a>.</p>
<p>The current incident has once again brought attention to the pressing need for standardised safety frameworks and proper training for mine workers in the region.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, the mining industry in Swat has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921194/washed-away-how-unregulated-mining-turned-the-swat-river-into-a-killer">seen a boom</a>, with around 350 crush plants established along the path of the 240km-long river, from Kalam to downstream Kanju.</p>
<p>In November, two workers <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875437">were killed</a> after elevator in an emerald mine collapsed. The tragic incident occurred when an elevator rope snapped, causing two workers to fall to their death.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929253/currency-crunch-as-govt-pushes-dollar-down' target='_blank'><strong>Currency crunch as govt pushes dollar down</strong></a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: The government’s efforts to artificially bring down the dollar rate are faltering, with market forces pushing back against a Rs250 exchange rate target and foreign currencies reportedly vanishing from the open market.</p>
<p>A crackdown on dollar smuggling <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927423/govt-crackdown-on-black-market-dollar-trade-pushes-deals-online">launched</a> on July 23 has led to a minor depreciation of around Rs3 in both the open and interbank markets. However, this has done little to bridge the gap between market sentiment and official expectations. The dollar continues to trade above Rs280, and a noticeable shortage has emerged.</p>
<p>In recent meetings held in Islamabad with banks, currency dealers, and jewellers, authorities reportedly reiterated their desire to bring the dollar down to Rs250. However, participants in the meetings described the target as unrealistic. Some bankers estimate the real market parity to be closer to Rs281.</p>
<p>Currency dealers say major foreign currencies — including the US dollar, British pound, and euro — are largely unavailable. “You might find a few hundred dollars at some counters, but most dealers are facing acute shortages,” said a senior dealer from an ‘A’ category exchange company.</p>

<p>Market pushback thwarts govt’s bid to bring greenback down to Rs250</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Malik Bostan, President of the Forex Association of Pakistan, recently dismissed reports of a currency shortage and claimed readiness to meet demand, most dealers disagree.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Many suspect that an illegal parallel market has resurfaced, where the dollar is selling at higher rates than those quoted by the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP).</p>
<p>On Wednesday, ECAP quoted the dollar at Rs285.15 in the open market and Rs282.87 in the interbank.</p>
<p>“There is no real shortage — the resistance to price controls is fuelling the perception of one,” said a senior interbank market analyst.</p>
<p>Atif Ahmed, a dealer operating in the interbank market, explained that banks with State Bank approval to sell dollars to importers are prioritising their own clients and setting higher rates acceptable to buyers. “Opening a letter of credit (LC) for $0.5 million has become a tough task for importers,” he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Although imports in FY25 have increased, indicating a relatively easier import regime than last year, analysts believe the current forex dynamics will make it difficult to achieve the Rs250 target. While the rupee may briefly strengthen into the 270s, sustained appreciation appears unlikely.</p>
<p>“The economy does not support a stronger rupee at this stage,” said a senior banker. “We remain dependent on the US dollar’s performance in global markets — and even though it has weakened slightly in 2025, that won’t be enough to pull the rupee to Rs250.”</p>
