            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914325/district-official-killed-by-terrorists-in-balochistans-surab-govt-spokesperson' target='_blank'><strong>District official killed by terrorists in Balochistan’s Surab: govt spokesperson</strong></a>
            <p><p>A district official was killed when his house was attacked by terrorists in Balochistan’s Surab city on Friday, a statement from the provincial government said.</p>
<p>Balochistan Government Spokesperson Shahid Rind, in a statement, termed the incident a “nefarious attempt to challenge the writ of the state”.</p>
<p>“A bank was looted and the homes of several government officials were attacked, including Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) Hidayatullah Buledi.</p>
<p>“Buledi was martyred while defending his home during the attack,” Rind said in the statement, adding that the official “set a new example of bravery” through his sacrifice.</p>
<p>“Women and children were also present at the residence during the attack,” he added.</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that “Indian-sponsored proxies have taken action on (India’s) behalf”, adding that a search operation was underway in the area.</p>
<p>“We are determined to thwart efforts of anti-state elements,” he said, according to the statement.</p>
<p>Frontier Corps and Levies personnel had arrived at the scene, he said.</p>
<p>Separately, Rind spoke to <em>DawnNews TV</em> and said that “geo-fencing is being used to track down the attackers.”</p>
<p><em>Dawn.com</em> has reached out to the police and local administration in Surab for comment.</p>
<p>Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">accused</a> India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.</p>
<p>“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said, using the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.</p>
<p>The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897969">Balochistan Liberation Army</a>, in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.</p>
<p>In March, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419/jaffar-express-hijacking-state-media-reports-190-rescued-2nd-day-of-operation-underway-in-balochistan">Jaffar Express</a> train was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area, resulting in the deaths of 26 hostages, including 18 security personnel. Five more security personnel were martyred during the operation.</p>
<p>However, a significant improvement was seen in Pakistan’s internal security landscape in April 2025, “as both militant attacks and resultant casualties dropped sharply compared to March”, according to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907799">data</a> released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS).</p>
<p>Pakistan ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p></p>

            <p><p>An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Islamabad on Friday sentenced PTI members, including Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Abdul Latif, to 27 years of imprisonment for attacking a police station during the violent May 9 riots.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1752003">PTI supporters</a>, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">arrest</a>, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">attacking</a> the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.</p>
<p>ATC Special Court-II judge Tahir Abbas Sipra handed down the punishment under different sections of the Pakistan Penal Code after finding the accused guilty of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1858445">attacking</a> the Ramna police station during the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>The accused were sentenced to a total of 27 years in prison along with a fine worth Rs327,000. The sentences shall run concurrently, the judge said.</p>
<p>MNA Abdul Latif, who was elected from NA-1 Chitral, was not present in the court when the verdict was announced. The lawmaker will be disqualified for five years after the conviction.</p>
<p>The judge told the accused that 20 witnesses, including magistrates recorded their testimonies against them, noting that protests should be held peacefully and participants should never take the law into their own hands.</p>
<p>“You are accused of attacking the Ramna Police Station in Islamabad. If you attack your own police stations, the country will no longer be livable,” the judge remarked.</p>
<p>A case had been registered against the accused in Ramna police station under various sections for offences including burning a motorcycle and attacking police personnel.</p>
<p>The eleven accused who were convicted were Zariyab Khan, Muhammad Akram, Meera Khan, Abdul Latif, Sameol Robert, Wazeerzada, Abdul Basit, Shan Ali, Shahzaib, Muhammad Yousaf, and Sohail Khan.</p>
<p>Following the verdict, the police took the four accused present in the court, namely Mira Khan, Muhammad Akram, Shahzeb, and Sohail Khan, into custody. The court also issued arrest warrants for other PTI supporters accused of involvement in the riots but was absent from the court.</p>
<p>The sentences ranged from ten years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs200,000 for terrorism provisions under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, five years in prison and a fine of Rs50,000 for the murderous attack on policemen under Section Section 324 (attempted murder) of the PPC.</p>
<p>Additionally, the accused were sentenced to four years in prison and fined Rs40,000 for burning a motorcycle under Section 426 (punishment for mischief); and a separate sentence of four years in prison and a fine of Rs40,000 under Section 440 (mischief committed after preparation made for causing death or hurt) for vandalising a police station.</p>
<p>A sentence of three-month imprisonment was imposed for interfering in the work of the police under Section 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), one month for violating Section 144 (joining unlawful assembly armed with a deadly weapon), and two years for committing a crime in a group under Section 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in prosecution of common object).</p>
<p>Prosecutor Raja Naveed conducted the testimony and cross-examination against the accused.</p>
<p>In December 2024, <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7126" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">military courts</a> had sentenced 85 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their involvement in violent attacks on military installations during the riots on May 9.</p>
<p>The military’s media wing said in a statement that the trials of those accused of the May 9 riots under military custody had been “concluded under the relevant laws”, and the “convicts retained the right to appeal and other legal recourses, as guaranteed by the Constitution and law”.</p>
<p>Imran’s nephew <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1770793">Hassan Khan Niazi</a>, who was handed into military custody in August 2023, was among the two people sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment.</p>
<p>The military’s press wing later announced that 19 civilians convicted for their involvement in the riots were granted <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1882621">pardon</a>. It said the mercy petitions of 19 convicts were accepted on “humanitarian grounds”.</p></p>

            <p><p>Pakistan on Friday announced its elevation of diplomatic representation in Afghanistan from Charge d’Affaires to Ambassador level as bilateral ties “move on a positive trajectory.”</p>
<p>Pakistan and Afghanistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912541/china-makes-taliban-regime-islamabad-agree-on-ties-upgrade">agreed</a> to upgrade their <a class="link--external" href="https://The%20understanding%20was%20reached%20during%20an%20informal%20trilateral%20meeting%20of%20foreign%20ministers%20from%20Pakistan,%20China,%20and%20Afghanistan%20in%20Beijing.%20The%20talks%20were%20part%20of%20Beijing%E2%80%99s%20broader%20effort%20to%20ease%20regional%20tensions%20and%20advance%20connectivity%20through%20its%20Belt%20and%20Road%20Initiative." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">diplomatic relations</a> by exchanging envoys — a key step towards normalising ties after years of strained relations between Islamabad and the Taliban administration in Kabul.</p>
<p>Ties between the two neighbouring countries had turned sour due to frequent border skirmishes and Islamabad repeatedly demanding that Kabul take action against the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) for using Afghan soil to launch attacks in Pakistan. Kabul has denied the allegations.</p>
<p>The recent understanding was reached during an informal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910314">trilateral meeting</a> of foreign ministers from Pakistan, China, and Afghanistan in Beijing earlier this month. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in the Chinese capital.</p>
<p>In a post on X, Dar said, “Pakistan-Afghanistan relations are on positive trajectory after my very productive visit to Kabul with Pakistan delegation on 19th April 2025.</p>
<p>“To maintain this momentum, I am pleased to announce the decision of the Government of Pakistan to upgrade the level of its Chargé d’Affaires in Kabul to the level of Ambassador.</p>
<p>“I am confident this step would further contribute towards enhanced engagement, deepen Pak-Afghan cooperation in economic, security, [counterterrorism] and trade areas and promote further exchanges between two fraternal countries.”</p>

<p>Although no country has formally recognised the Taliban regime since its return to power in 2021, several including China, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia maintain ambassadors in Kabul.  China and the UAE also host Taliban-appointed ambassadors, while Russia has agreed to accept a Taliban ambassador in Moscow.</p>
<p>Recent diplomatic efforts have aimed to turn the tide. In March 2025, Special Envoy for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq visited Kabul for the first time in over a year. His mission was followed by a high-level visit by Dar on April 19, where both sides pledged to prevent their territories from being used for terrorist activities and agreed on trade facilitation measures.</p></p>
