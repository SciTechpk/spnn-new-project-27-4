                <h2>Youm-i-Tashakur: Ceremony to celebrate Operation Bunyanum Marsoos underway in Islamabad</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A ceremony to celebrate the success of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos against India ‚Äî a part of Marka-i-Haq ‚Äî is being held in Islamabad on Friday at the Pakistan Monument to honour the armed forces and the nation.</p>
<p>The ceremony, marking the Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanksgiving Day), is attended by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, armed forces‚Äô leadership, and other civil and military leaders. The day is being celebrated across the country today.</p>
<p>The event began with the recitation of the Holy Quran, opening speeches, a flypast, and national songs.</p>
<p>Beginning his speech, PM Shehbaz praised the martyrs, their families, his cabinet members, service chiefs, and the nation for successfully responding to the Indian aggression.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA day such as today was seldom given to nations in world history,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe whole nation had been praying for the military against the enemy.‚Äù</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said he had had a meeting with the services chiefs on the night between May 9 and 10, in which it was decided that since the enemy had crossed ‚Äúthe last limit‚Äù and rejected Pakistan‚Äôs offer of an international investigation, a ‚Äúmeasured response‚Äù must be given.</p>
<p>He added that around 2:30am that night, the army chief had told him on a secure telephone call that India had launched its ballistic missiles on Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe told me, ‚ÄòMr prime minister, grant us permission to strike the enemy with such force that they never forget it‚Äô‚Äù.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week.

<p>On Monday, the director general of military operations for both sides held the <a class="link--external" href="https://On%20Monday,%20the%20director%20general%20of%20military%20operations%20for%20both%20sides%20held%20the%20first%20round%20of%20talks%20via%20hotline%20after%20the%20ceasefire." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first round of talks</a> after the ceasefire.</p>

<p>In a statement, PM Shehbaz said that the brave and professional armed forces have written a ‚Äúgolden chapter‚Äù in military history by giving an effective and forceful response to the enemy and foiling the enemy‚Äôs intentions, state media  <em>Pakistan Television</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvnews/urdunewsdetail/6422" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. He added that innocent Pakistani citizens were martyred in this cowardly attack.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn response to the enemy‚Äôs aggression, our falcons struck such effective blows that the enemy‚Äôs military bases, weapons depots and air bases were turned into ruins,‚Äù the premier continued.</p>
<p>He also praised the leadership of Chief of Army Staff General (COAS) Syed Asim Munir and paid tributes to Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu and his falcons as well as the security of the maritime borders of the Pakistan Navy under the leadership of Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf.</p>

            </a>
            <p><p>Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan on Friday urged India to maintain the ceasefire agreed with Pakistan, warning that the country would respond if the neighbour resumed aggression.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>.

<p>During his weekly press conference today, the spokesperson said: ‚ÄúThe recent announcement of a Pakistan-India ceasefire is a positive development. We urge India to faithfully adhere to its implementation.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said Pakistan appreciated the role of friendly countries in facilitating the ceasefire and reiterated support for US President Donald Trump‚Äôs announcement on engaging with Pakistan and India to seek a resolution to the Kashmir dispute.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said the ceasefire was achieved by the role of several countries. ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs portrayal of Pakistan as acting out of despair and frustration of Pakistan is baseless,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>He informed that the military operations chiefs of both countries had maintained periodic contact since May 10 and both had agreed on a ‚Äústructured mechanism for phased de-escalation‚Äù.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said that Pakistan had also returned a constable of the Indian Border Security Force on Wednesday as a gesture of ‚Äúgoodwill‚Äù in return for a sepoy of the Pakistan Rangers.</p>
<p>He said that at a time when the internal community was promoting regional peace and stability, ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs rhetoric reflects a persistent tendency to distort facts, justify aggression and cast unwarranted aspersions on Pakistan‚Äôs nuclear assets.‚Äù</p>
<p>In contrast, the spokesperson said that ‚ÄúPakistan is a responsible state and remains committed to the ceasefire and taking necessary steps towards de-escalation and regional stability.‚Äù</p>
<p>He requested Pakistan‚Äôs international partners to ensure India honoured its commitments and refrained from further aggression due to its ‚Äúbelligerent posture‚Äù. ‚ÄúShould India resume hostilities, Pakistan will have no choice but to respond,‚Äù he warned.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said Pakistan always believed in dialogue and the restoration of peace and wanted a solution to all issues, including occupied Kashmir, through negotiations.</p>

<p>Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and discussed regional developments, including the ceasefire.</p>

<p>Both sides exchanged views on the post-ceasefire situation between Pakistan and India with Naqvi expressing gratitude to Trump and the American ambassador for their pivotal role in bringing about the ceasefire.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe credit for the ceasefire between two nuclear powers goes to President Donald Trump,‚Äù he said.</p>
