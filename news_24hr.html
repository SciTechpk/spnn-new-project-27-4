            <p><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Monday said Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur was “in contact” with the relevant administration over the incident of protesters being shot in Khyber district’s Tirah Valley.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927004">Seven people</a> were shot on Sunday after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926949">demonstration</a> outside the Brigade Headquarters in Bagh-Maidan Markaz against the death of a minor girl in a mortar strike in Tirah’s Zakhakhel.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the “firing on peaceful citizens by khawarij” — a term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). However, according to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927004#:~:text=Security%20personnel%20guar%C2%ADding%20the%20installation%20reportedly%20opened%20fire%20to%20control%20the%20crowd%2C%20according%20to%20sources.">sources</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926949#:~:text=some%20of%20the%20protesters%20alleged%20that%20the%20forces%20at%20the%20gates%20fired%20at%20them">protesters</a>, security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly had opened fire to control the crowd.</p>
<p>Besides the seven killed, at least 16 others also received bullet injuries, sources said. There has been no official statement from the local administration or the military about the mortar strike or Sunday’s killings.</p>
<p>“The chief minister is in constant contact with the relevant administration,” CM Gandapur’s public relations adviser, Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, said in a statement today.</p>
<p>He said the KP chief minister was “monitoring” the Tirah incident himself. “The KP government is extremely saddened over the incident,” Saif added.</p>
<p>“The provincial government is standing side by side with the affected families in this moment of sorrow and grief,” the official asserted.</p>

<p>Saif also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926565/saif-blasts-parties-boycotting-mpc-says-militancy-shared-challenge">again</a> slammed the KP opposition parties for not attending a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926456/gandapur-rails-against-good-taliban-bad-taliban-distinction">multi-party conference</a> (MPC) held last week over the security situation in the province, stressing that the moot had been organised “to prevent such incidents”.</p>
<p>The statement recalled that the provincial government will be holding a series of jirgas with tribal elders next week, including one in Peshawar. This is also based on the MPC’s decision to convene a jirga comprising elders, parliamentarians and stakeholders from each district.</p>
<p>According to CM Gandapur, a grand jirga, whose members will be nominated by the first jirga, would be organised 15 days after that to devise a strategy to implement the MPC’s declaration.</p>

<p>On Sunday, hundreds of tribesmen had brought the body of a girl, who they claimed was killed in a mortar strike in the Darbar locality of Peer Mela in Zakhakhel a day earlier, to the Brigade Headquarters.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Sources and eye-witnesses said the situation turned violent when an angry mob, comprising mostly young men, ignored calls by local elders to remain calm.</p>
<p>They first torched an excavator parked outside Brigade Headquarters, then tried to force open its main gate, following which security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly opened fire to control the crowd, according to sources.</p>
<p>However, in a statement from his office, PM Shehbaz said TTP terrorists were behind the incident as he expressed his grief over the “martyrdom of innocent and peaceful civilians”. The statement, carried by state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/27-07-2025/pm-expresses-grief-over-deaths-of-civilians-in-tirah-valley" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> and <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-expresses-grief-over-martyrdom-of-innocent-citizens-in-firing-in-tirah-valley/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">APP</a></em>, did not mention any protest.</p>
<p>He directed the authorities to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured.</p>
<p>“The nefarious designs of terrorists cannot shake our resolve,” the premier asserted, reaffirming the government’s commitment to eliminate terrorists and terrorism.</p>

<p>Videos circulating on social media showed an excavator on fire. Some protesters were also seen pelting stones at the Brigade Headquarters while trying to forcibly open the main gate.

<p>The injured were transported to the Frontier Corps Hospital in Shah Kas Jamrud, Dogra Hospital in Bara and Hayatabad Medical Complex in Peshawar. One of the injured is said to be in critical condition.</p>
<p>Following the incident, security officials met with a delegation of Tirah elders at Brigade Headquarters and announced compensation for the victims on their demand. The KP government has also announced separate Rs10 million for the deceased and Rs2.5m for the injured.</p>
<p>Security officials said the local sector commander met with the Tirah elders and assured them of his full support in meeting their legitimate demands.</p>

<p>Residents in Peer Mela have claimed that mortar shelling by security forces has so far killed at least three persons over the last 10 days. They claimed that mortars were being fired as security forces conducted operations against armed militant groups in Zakhakhel, Shalobar, Adakhel and Malakdin Khel localities.</p>
<p>While a report on the mortar strike that was being protested could not be found, similar incidents in the Zakhakhel area took place in <a class="link--external" href="https://voicepk.net/2025/04/38196/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">April</a> this year and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878779">December 2024</a>, killing a child in each.</p>

            <p><p>The Babusar Highway was partially reopened on Monday as the search for missing people continued after heavy rains last week prompted flash floods in Gilgit-Baltistan.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719">devastating impacts</a> of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">heat­­waves</a>, erratic weat­her patterns and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660">glacial melting</a> have triggered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a> and intense floods across the region.</p>
<p>On July 21, floods swept across GB, causing landslides and leaving many <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926193">stranded</a>, and damaging more than <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926487">500 houses</a>, roads and other infrastructure.

<p>In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said: “The Babusar-Naran Highway has been reopened for one-way traffic.”</p>
<p>He noted that heavy machinery was used to reopen it, while work for complete restoration was underway. He also advised passengers to be cautious and avoid unnecessary travel.</p>
<p>Faraq further said, “Several families, including five members of a TV anchor’s family, have contacted the government about the missing people and appealed for help in the search.”</p>
<p>The wallet of the TV anchor Shabana Liaquat was found among the flood debris, which also included her and her child’s student cards, he added.</p>
<p>“The provincial government has enlisted the help of Pakistan Army sniffer dogs to search for those buried under the rubble,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Separately, the National Highway Authority (NHA) initiated swift road restoration operations in northern areas after orders by Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/road-restoration-underway-in-northern-areas-on-federal-ministers-orders/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">APP</a></em> reported.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Aleem said that key highways, including the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad (N-15) and Skardu-Jaglot Road, were blocked due to landslides and cloudburst. “NHA teams have cleared multiple obstruction points, ensuring partial restoration of traffic and improved accessibility for travellers,” he said.</p>
<p>The minister described the 242-kilometre-long N-15 as a “critical route for tourism and regional connectivity”, which was blocked at various locations.</p>
<p>According to officials, landslides along the route were successfully cleared, while restoration work from Naran to Babusar Top and Chilas was ongoing, he added.</p>
<p>Communication Secretary Ali Sher Mehsud and NHA chairman were present on-site to oversee the restoration activities, the report said.</p>
<p>“We are committed to restoring all major highways at the earliest,” Mehsud said, adding that travel towards Kaghan and Naran had resumed.</p>
<p>NHA managed to clear 20 out of 25 landslide-affected points on the Skardu-Jaglot Road.</p>
<p>“To maintain pace, NHA has placed all field officers on 24-hour alert, cancelled staff leave and activated its emergency response plan across Gilgit-Baltistan. Heavy machinery remains operational across the region to tackle any further disruptions,” the report added.</p>

<p>Separately, the National Disaster Management Authority issued an alert for the northern areas of the country, predicting rainfall from July 28 to 31 and warning about risks of urban flooding, glacial surges and landslides, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/northern-regions-brace-for-intense-rains-ndma-advises-caution/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">APP</a></em> reported.</p>

<p>According to the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC), rain was expected in Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, and Shigar areas of GB, as well as in Muzaffarabad, Neelum Valley, and Bagh in Azad Jammu and Kashmir during the forecast period.</p>
<p>“These rains may lead to flooding, while heavy showers in hilly regions may also trigger landslides,” it stated.</p>
<p>In Chitral Valley, Buni and Reshun areas, rainfall combined with melting glaciers may raise the water flow of River Chitral, according to NEOC. “Urban flooding is also likely in Muzaffarabad and Bagh due to heavy downpours,” it added.</p></p>

            <p><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police foiled a terrorist attack bid in the Nurar area of Bannu district late last night, an officer said on Monday.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a>, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773/3-terrorists-killed-during-joint-operation-in-kps-bannu-police">this month</a>.</p>
<p>Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “A terrorist group was attempting to plant an improvised explosive device (IED) in the Nurar area.”</p>
<p>Upon receiving timely information, police and security forces took immediate action and surrounded the area, he added.</p>
<p>During the action, the police targeted the terrorists through drones and thwarted their plans.</p>
<p>“According to initial reports, the terrorists were killed while attempting to plant the IED,” the police official added.</p>
<p>“Bannu police are fully alert and ready to deal with any kind of threat, and all resources are being utilised to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the public,” DPO Kulachi said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">surge</a> in terrorist activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">broke</a> a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.</p>
<p>Attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel and security forces. In response, the state has also intensified its counterterrorism <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926694">operations</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, in a series of assaults in KP, a police official was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926664/cop-martyred-in-karak-attack-on-bannu-police-station-foiled">martyred</a> in Karak district while police thwarted a separate late-night terrorist assault on a police station in the Basyakhel area of Bannu, officials said.</p>
<p>Also last week, a Frontier Corps constable was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926334/fc-constable-killed-2-injured-in-terrorist-attack-on-vehicle-in-kps-bannu-police">killed</a> and two others were injured when terrorists attacked their vehicle in the Daryoba area of Bannu district, according to the police.</p></p>
