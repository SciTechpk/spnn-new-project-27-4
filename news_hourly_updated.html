                <h2>FM Dar says remarks about Dr Aafia Siddiqui ‚Äòtaken out of context‚Äô, vows continued support until release</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday that his comments in the United States about the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui were being ‚Äútaken out of context‚Äù in the wake of criticism of the remarks by her lawyer.</p>
<p>FM Dar is currently on a visit to the US. Dar spoke at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC, a day ago, during which he had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926640">drawn a parallel</a> with the case of Dr Aafia, who has spent years in a US prison, when responding to a question about former prime minister Imran Khan‚Äôs incarceration.</p>
<p>He noted that Pakistan did not interfere in that process because ‚Äúthe Americans had followed their judicial system‚Äù. Similarly, he said, Imran was sentenced by Pakistan‚Äôs judiciary, which followed the due process of law. ‚ÄúWhen the due process is followed, others do not have the right to interfere,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Dr Aafia, a neuroscientist and educator, was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924527">convicted</a> by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on charges of attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan and has been serving her sentence at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Carswell in the US since 2010.</p>
<p>FM Dar‚Äôs remarks were criticised by her lawyer as being ‚Äúidiotic‚Äù.</p>
<p>Subsequently, a post by FM Dar on X said: ‚ÄúYesterday, in response to a question about Imran Khan‚Äôs case at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, the reference to Dr Aafia Siddiqui‚Äôs case is being taken out of context. During the tenures of PML-N governments, we have consistently provided all diplomatic and legal assistance for Dr Aafia Siddiqui‚Äôs release, and we will continue to do so until the matter of her release is resolved.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said every country had its judicial and legal procedures, which were to be respected, whether it was Pakistan or the US.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur government‚Äôs stance on the issue of Dr Aafia Siddiqui‚Äôs release is clear and unequivocal.‚Äù</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to Dar‚Äôs comments earlier in the day, Dr Aafia‚Äôs lawyer Clive Stafford Smith OBE said: ‚ÄúSorry but this is idiotic! ‚ÄòDue process‚Äô does not equal something where Aafia had no witnesses, they lied &amp; it was all false. That‚Äôs called a miscarriage of justice not what‚Äôs ‚Äòdue‚Äô.‚Äù</p>

<p>Dar ‚Äúappeared to be going out of his way to undermine Aafia‚Äôs case yesterday by acting like she got ‚Äòdue process‚Äô when all she got was torture and a trial in New York when all the real witnesses were in Afghanistan‚Äù, he said in a separate post on X.</p>

<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, Smith said: ‚ÄúAs you may have seen from the deputy PM‚Äôs statement, he was trying to justify what is happening to Imran Khan by using the Aafia Siddiqui case ‚Äî saying her case is a result of ‚Äòdue process of law‚Äô in the US and so therefore it is only something a judge can deal with.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe goes on to say that disagreeing with a legal verdict against him does not give Imran Khan the right to provoke people to dissent, which should be done through the courts.‚Äù</p>
<p>Smith said that in his opinion, ‚ÄúI suspect we can all disagree with what he is saying: in all of the scores of people whom I have exonerated in the US, I have used publicity to help force the system to correct its mistakes, and obviously, in Aafia‚Äôs case, I tried to do that through the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866050">clemency process</a> with Biden too.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that FM Dar‚Äôs analogy was ‚Äúunwise as well as misplaced‚Äù.</p>
<p>On the PTI founder‚Äôs incarceration and legal troubles, he said: ‚ÄúI suspect many people will disagree with the notion that Imran Khan has received anything that approaches ‚Äòdue process of law‚Äô in the cases against him, just as we can agree that Aafia is where she is today due to the criminal actions of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), along with others, rather than any ‚Äòdue process‚Äô.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that FM Dar should not talk about Dr Aafia‚Äôs case in the context of Imran‚Äôs cases.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn every instance, Pakistan‚Äôs officials need to be towing the consistent line, set out in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif‚Äôs excellent letter to Joe Biden, that no matter what you believe, Aafia has suffered enough,‚Äù Aafia‚Äôs lawyer added.</p>
<p>He added that he was very optimistic that Pakistan would continue with efforts to secure Dr Aafia‚Äôs release.</p>
<p>Speaking on the circumstances of her trial, Smith said: ‚ÄúThe defence brought no witnesses to New York, not one.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prosecution brought the people they wanted ‚Äî soldiers who all tried unsuccessfully to tell the same story, and an Afghan interpreter who was promised US residency and given a substantial amount of money.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that the physical evidence solidly disproved the prosecution‚Äôs theory, even then, but before trial, the defence did not locate the videotape that proved beyond argument that the holes in the wall were not from Dr Aafia shooting, since they were from earlier that day.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have promised to file her appeal in New York in the next week or ten days,‚Äù Smith said.</p>
<p>A day ago, PM Shehbaz had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926537">assured</a> Dr Fouzia Siddiqui that the government would continue to provide all possible legal and diplomatic support in the matter of her sister.</p>
<p>On July 12, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had expr¬≠essed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923643">dissatisfaction</a> over the federal government‚Äôs failure to submit a report in the case concerning Dr Aafia‚Äôs release, health and repatriation, with Justice Ishaq threatening to ‚Äúsummon the entire cabinet‚Äù if the report was not presented. IHC Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq on July 21 had issued a contempt of court notice to the entire federal government, including the prime minister and all ministers, for refusing to file an amicus brief to support Dr Aafia‚Äôs case in the US.</p>
<p>However, the IHC Registrar Office had on Wednesday put on hold the processing of the contempt of court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925717/contempt-notice-to-pm-cabinet-after-unsanctioned-hearing">notices</a> issued to PM Shehbaz and his cabinet members as the dealing staff decided to ascertain its validity first.</p>
<p>In February, the IHC was told that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1496759">proposal</a> to exchange Shakil Afridi for Dr Aafia was unfeasible. The law officer representing the federal government informed the court that  Smith had suggested the swap, but Pakistan and the US did not have any agreement for such an exchange.</p>
<p>Last year in October, PM Shehbaz had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866050">requested</a> that Biden pardon and release Dr Aafia from jail.</p>
<p>In a letter dated October 13, the prime minister expressed his concerns about Dr Aafia‚Äôs ‚Äúfragile mental and frail physical health‚Äù while in prison. ‚ÄúNow 52 years old, she has served 16 years behind bars in the US.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNumerous Pakistani officials have paid consular visits to Dr Siddiqui ‚Ä¶ all of them have raised their serious concerns about the treatment she has received,‚Äù the letter read. ‚ÄúIn fact, they fear she may take her own life.‚Äù</p>
<p>Consequently, the US State Department <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867024">declined</a> to comment on the letter written by PM Shehbaz to the Biden administration.</p></p>

                <h2>Pakistan fully committed to building secure, prosperous regional environment with allies: COAS</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Saturday said Pakistan was committed to building a secure and prosperous environment in the region with the help of partner nations.</p>
<p>Over the past week, Pakistan has made efforts to expand defence cooperation with other nations. Saudi Arabia‚Äôs naval chief <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926301/pakistan-and-saudi-arabia-stress-mutual-resolve-to-strengthen-defence-cooperation">met</a> with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza in Rawalpindi on Thursday, while COAS Munir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926523/china-appreciates-pakistans-role-for-regional-peace-in-meeting-with-coas-munir-ispr">met</a> Chinese senior political and military leadership in Beijing on Friday.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7368" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Islamabad hosted the Regional Chiefs of Defence Staff Conference under the theme of ‚ÄòStrengthening Bonds, Securing Peace‚Äô today, attended by senior military officials from the United States, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>The ISPR said COAS Munir formally welcomed the distinguished defence delegations and reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs steadfast commitment to peace, stability and constructive engagement across the region.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn an era defined by transnational threats and complex hybrid challenges, the imperative for deeper military-to-military cooperation, strategic dialogue and mutual trust is paramount. Pakistan remains fully committed to working with partner nations to build a secure and prosperous regional environment,‚Äù Field Marshal Munir was quoted as saying by the statement.</p>
<p>The ISPR said the session‚Äôs participants also discussed regional security dynamics, the evolving security environment in central and south Asia and the necessity of joint training initiatives, counter-terrorism cooperation and coordinated humanitarian responses.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis landmark multilateral engagement marked a significant stride toward advancing regional security cooperation, military diplomacy and strategic dialogue among participating nations,‚Äù the statement said.</p>

<p>According to the ISPR, the conference sought to reinforce security collaborations, enhance training initiatives and exchange the best practices in counterterrorism and other defence and security programmes.</p>
<p>The military‚Äôs media wing added that the participants collectively reaffirmed their resolve to uphold peace, respect, national sovereignty and confront common security threats such as terrorism, cybersecurity and violent extremism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúParticipants commended Pakistan‚Äôs leadership, hospitality, and initiative in fostering such inclusive and forward-looking defence diplomacy,‚Äù the ISPR said.</p>
<p>It further added: ‚ÄúThis strategic convergence reflects Pakistan‚Äôs enduring commitment to a secure, interconnected and cooperative region, anchored in shared security interests and regional solidarity.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pakistan‚Äôs role in regional peace was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926499">lauded</a> by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a meeting with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan has always played a positive role in global and regional peace,‚Äù the Foreign Office had quoted the US secretary of state as saying while the US State Department said he expressed appreciation for Pakistan‚Äôs continued willingness to play a constructive role in mediating conversations with Iran and its commitment to preserving regional stability.</p>

<p>Separately, the government conferred the Nishan-i-Imtiaz (Military) award upon Army General Michael Kurilla, Commander of United States Central Command (Centcom), ‚Äúin recognition of his exemplary service and pivotal role in advancing enduring military cooperation between Pakistan and the United States‚Äù, the ISPR announced in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926301/pakistan-and-saudi-arabia-stress-mutual-resolve-to-strengthen-defence-cooperation">statement</a>.</p>
<p>In a formal ceremony held at the Presidency, President Asif Ali Zardari conferred the decoration upon Gen Kurilla, acknowledging his contributions to regional security and his efforts in bolstering strategic defence ties between Islamabad and Washington. Upon his arrival, the Centcom chief was presented with a guard of honour.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGeneral Kurilla‚Äôs visionary leadership has been instrumental in fostering mutual understanding, enhancing defence collaboration, and deepening counterterrorism cooperation between the Pakistan Armed Forces and Centcom,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
