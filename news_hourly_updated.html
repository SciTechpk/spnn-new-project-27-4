However, <em>Al Jazeera</em> reported that Avichay Adraee, the Arabic spokesperson of the Israeli military, denied the reports.</p>
<p>Israel launched widescale strikes against Iran earlier today, saying it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders, and that this was the start of a ‚Äúprolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon‚Äù.</p>
<p>Iran promised a harsh response and the Israeli military said Iran launched around 100 drones, with air defences intercepting them outside Israeli territory, while neighbouring Jordan said it targeted drones and missiles that violated its airspace.</p>
<p>But around 0800 GMT (1pm PKT), Israeli media said an order to citizens to remain near protected areas had been lifted, suggesting that most or all the drones had been neutralised.</p>
<p>In a letter to the United Nations, Iran‚Äôs Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the attack as a ‚Äúdeclaration of war‚Äù and called on the UNSC to immediately address the issue, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Araghchi requested the meeting in a letter to the 15-member body, saying Israel ‚Äúhas now crossed every red line, and the international community must not allow these crimes to go unpunished‚Äù.</p>
<p>He wrote: ‚ÄúIran reaffirms its inherent right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter and will respond decisively and proportionately to these unlawful and cowardly acts.‚Äù</p>
<p>Article 51 of the UN Charter covers the individual or collective right of states to self-defence against armed attack.</p>
<p>An Israeli security source said Israeli Mossad commandos had operated deep inside the Islamic Republic before the attack and the Israeli spy agency and military had led a series of covert operations against Iran‚Äôs strategic missile array.</p>

<p>The Iranian retaliation came some time after Tehran‚Äôs defence system intercepted fresh projectiles as several explosions were heard in the city and its surrounding areas in the evening, more than 12 hours after a massive wave of Israeli attacks on the country.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere were reports of explosions heard in the west of Tehran province,‚Äù in the cities of Shahriar and Malard and around the neighbourhood of Chitgar in Tehran city, state news agency <em>IRNA</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/IRNA_1313/status/1933553891947192715" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>, while <em>Mehr</em> agency reported a blast in Pakdasht southeast of the capital.</p>

<p><em>IRNA</em> said Tehran‚Äôs defences were activated. ‚ÄúNews received indicates that enemy projectiles have been intercepted by Tehran‚Äôs defences,‚Äù it said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/IRNA_1313/status/1933569268806816020" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <em>Mehr</em> news agency said a ‚Äúmassive explosion‚Äù was heard in Isfahan, a major city in central Iran, in a province that is home to several nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA few minutes ago, a massive explosion was heard in Isfahan,‚Äù <em>Mehr</em> said without immediately elaborating.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said it struck Iran‚Äôs nuclear facility in Isfahan as it pressed on with its strikes on the Islamic Republic‚Äôs military and nuclear sites. ‚ÄúI can now confirm that we struck the nuclear facility in Isfahan. The operation is still ongoing,‚Äù military spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin told journalists.</p>
<p>He said Israel had so far struck more than 200 targets across Iran since it began the wave of air strikes. ‚ÄúWe are continuing to strike,‚Äù Defrin added.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said its strike on Iran‚Äôs nuclear facility in Isfahan dismantled infrastructure for reconverting enriched uranium.</p>
<p>Israeli ‚Äúfighter jets completed a strike on the Iranian regime‚Äôs nuclear site in the Isfahan area‚Äù, a military statement said, adding that ‚Äúthe strike dismantled a facility for producing metallic uranium, infrastructure for reconverting enriched uranium, laboratories, and additional infrastructure.‚Äù</p>
<p>Israel‚Äôs army chief said the military was keeping up ‚Äúfull force‚Äù to achieve its goals after launching the wave of strikes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are continuing with full force, at a high pace, in order to meet the goals we have set for ourselves,‚Äù Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir said in a statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere will be difficult moments, we need to be prepared for the range of scenarios we have planned for, very high readiness and discipline are required on the home front. ‚Äú</p>
<p>The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting at 1900 GMT (12am PKT) following Israel‚Äôs wave of airstrikes, current presidency Guyana announced.</p>
<p>The meeting was requested by Iran, and supported by Russia and China, a diplomatic source told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Iran said Israel‚Äôs deadly strikes on its military and nuclear facilities were a ‚Äúdeclaration of war‚Äù and called on the UNSC to act.</p>

<p>Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a recorded video message: ‚ÄúWe are at a decisive moment in Israel‚Äôs history.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMoments ago, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel‚Äôs very survival. This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.‚Äù</p>

<p>The United States said it had no part in the operation, which raises the risk of a fresh escalation in tensions in the Middle East, a major oil-producing region.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs foreign ministry summoned the ambassador of Switzerland, which represents US interests in Tehran, state media said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring the meeting, the Islamic Republic of Iran conveyed its deep outrage and strong protest over this act of aggression by Israel and the support extended to it by the United States,‚Äù <em>IRNA</em> reported.</p>
<p>Alongside extensive air strikes, Israel‚Äôs Mossad spy agency led a series of covert sabotage operations inside Iran, <em>Axios</em> reported, citing a senior Israeli official. These operations were aimed at damaging Iran‚Äôs strategic missile sites and its air defence capabilities.</p>
<p>At least six nuclear scientists were killed in Israel‚Äôs attacks, media outlets in the Islamic Republic reported.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs <em>Tasnim</em> news agency named the six scientists, including Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, who was the president of the Islamic Azad University of Iran. Fereydoun Abbasi, a former head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, was also among the scientists killed, it added.</p>
<p>The organisation added that most of the damage from Israeli air strikes targeting its underground uranium enrichment facility at Natanz was at ground level.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMost of the damage is on the surface level,‚Äù said the organisation‚Äôs spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi, adding that there had been ‚Äúno casualties‚Äù at the facility where the enrichment centrifuges are housed underground.</p>
<p>A fresh round of explosions was heard in northwestern Iran, state television reported, following Israel‚Äôs wave of early morning strikes on multiple cities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA few minutes ago, new explosions were heard in East Azerbaijan,‚Äù the broadcaster said, as the <em>Tasnim</em> news agency said an earlier wave of strikes had hit 10 sites in the province, killing at least three people.</p>
<p>The death toll from Israeli strikes in northwestern Iran increased to 18, state media reported, revising an earlier figure of eight dead.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo far, as a result of this brutal aggression, 18 individuals have attained martyrdom and 35 of our fellow citizens have been injured,‚Äù IRNA quoted East Azerbaijan provincial authorities as saying, reporting attacks on 11 locations in the province.</p>
<p>A loud blast was heard later in the afternoon near a military airbase in Iran‚Äôs western Hamedan province, state media reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA few hours ago, a loud blast was heard near Hamedan,‚Äù more than 300 kilometres from Tehran, the <em>IRNA</em> state news agency said, adding that ‚Äúit was heard near the Nojeh airbase‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWith a savage regime as this,‚Äù the statement read, referring to Israel, ‚Äúone shall not speak but with the language of power.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs of this moment, the Islamic Republic of Iran‚Äôs government has begun the necessary defensive, political and legal measures to make the illegitimate Israel regret [its aggression] and will deny the Israelis a moment‚Äôs rest,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe world now better understands Iran‚Äôs insistence on its right to enrichment and nuclear technology and missile power.‚Äù</p>
<p>Iran has in the past 200 years never started a war, the statement said, but would not hesitate for a second to defend itself.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe ending to this story will be written by Iran.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pezeshkian said that Iran would make Israel ‚Äúregret‚Äù its deadly attack.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Iranian nation and the country‚Äôs officials will not remain silent in the face of this crime, and the legitimate and powerful response of the Islamic Republic of Iran will make the enemy regret its foolish act,‚Äù Pezeshkian said in a video statement aired on state TV.</p>

<p>He said there was still time for the country to prevent further conflict with Israel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,‚Äù Trump said in a post on Truth Social.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>ABC News,</em> Trump added the Israeli attack on Iran was ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù and warned there was much more to come.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs been excellent. We gave them a chance and they didn‚Äôt take it. They got hit hard, very hard. They got hit about as hard as you‚Äôre going to get hit. And there‚Äôs more to come. A lot more,‚Äù Trump was quoted as saying by an <em>ABC</em> reporter on X.</p>

<p>Trump told <em>Reuters</em> in a phone interview that it was unclear if Iran still has a nuclear programme following Israeli strikes on the country.</p>
<p>Trump told <em>Reuters</em> the US still has nuclear talks planned with Iran on Sunday, but that he is not sure if they will still take place. He said it was not too late for Iran to make a deal.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI tried to save Iran humiliation and death,‚Äù Trump said.</p>
<p>He said he is not concerned about a regional war breaking out as a result of Israel‚Äôs strikes.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Trump said that Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb and that the US was hoping to get back to the negotiating table, in an interview with <em>Fox News</em> after the start of the Israeli air strikes on Iran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will see,‚Äù <em>Fox News</em> reporter Jennifer Griffin quoted Trump as saying in a post on X.</p>
<p>Trump would convene a meeting of the National Security Council on Friday morning, the White House said. He had said on Thursday that an Israeli strike on Iran ‚Äúcould very well happen‚Äù but reiterated his hopes for a peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>The US military is planning for the full range of contingencies in the Middle East, including the possibility that it might have to help evacuate American civilians, a US official told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs armed forces spokesperson said Israel and its chief ally, the US, would pay a ‚Äúheavy price‚Äù for the attack, accusing Washington of providing support for the operation.</p>
<p>While the US tried to distance itself from Israel‚Äôs military operation, an Israeli official told public broadcaster <em>Kan</em> that Israel had coordinated with Washington on Iran.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the country was not involved in the strikes and Tel Aviv had acted unilaterally for self-defence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,‚Äù Rubio said in a statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>The State Department issued an advisory saying that all US government employees in Israel and their family members should ‚Äúshelter in place until further notice‚Äù.</p>
<p>Lebanese group Hezbollah condemned Israel‚Äôs wave of strikes, warning that they threaten to ‚Äúignite the region‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis enemy adheres to no logic or laws and knows only the language of killing, fire, and destruction,‚Äù Hezbollah said in a statement that condemned the strikes as a ‚Äúbrutal‚Äù aggression.</p>

<p>UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said he was ready to travel to Iran to assess the situation there after Israel‚Äôs strikes hit the sprawling nuclear complex at Natanz.</p>
<p>In a statement to a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency‚Äôs Board of Governors, Grossi said the other main enrichment centre in Iran, Fordow, was not hit, and neither was another nuclear facility in Esfahan, citing Iranian authorities.</p>
<p>There are no elevated radiation levels at Natanz, he added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid further escalation. I reiterate that any military action that jeopardises the safety and security of nuclear facilities risks grave consequences for the people of Iran, the region, and beyond,‚Äù Grossi said in his statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have indicated to the respective authorities my readiness to travel at the earliest to assess the situation and ensure safety, security and non-proliferation in Iran.‚Äù</p>
<p>He did not say what the extent of the damage at Natanz was or what parts of the site were hit. The site includes a vast underground uranium enrichment plant and a smaller, above-ground pilot enrichment plant.</p>
<p>Iran is enriching to up to 60 per cent purity, close to the roughly 90pc of weapons-grade, at the pilot plant, but it is producing smaller quantities of that material there than at Fordow, a site dug into a mountain that military experts have said would be difficult for Israel to destroy through bombardment.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDespite the current military actions and heightened tensions, it is clear that the only sustainable path forward ‚Äî for Iran, for Israel, the entire region, and the international community ‚Äî is one grounded in dialogue and diplomacy to ensure peace, stability, and cooperation,‚Äù Grossi said.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Grossi said that nuclear facilities ‚Äúmust never be attacked‚Äù.</p>
<p>The UN nuclear watchdog said that Iranian authorities told it that no increase in radiation levels was observed at the Natanz uranium enrichment site following Israeli strikes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIranian authorities have informed the IAEA ‚Ä¶ that no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site,‚Äù the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a post on X, after earlier confirming that the facility was ‚Äúamong targets‚Äù of the strikes.</p>

<p>It added that Iran‚Äôs only nuclear power plant in the southern port city of Bushehr had not been targeted.</p>
<p>An exceptional meeting of the watchdog‚Äôs Board of Governors will be held on Monday to discuss Israel‚Äôs strikes after at least one country on the board requested one at Friday‚Äôs regular, quarterly session of the body, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Any country on the board of the IAEA can call a meeting under its rules.</p>
<p>Iran, which is not on the board, requested a meeting and its call was supported by board members Russia, China and Venezuela, diplomats said. The diplomats gave differing accounts as to which board member was the first to clearly make the request.</p>
<p>The meeting will start at 10am (0800 GMT) on Monday, diplomats at Friday‚Äôs closed-door meeting said before any public announcement of the emergency meeting.</p>
<p>There was no sign of any push for a resolution or other action on Monday by the 35-nation board, said the IAEA‚Äôs top policymaking body.</p>
<p>However, Iran‚Äôs atomic energy organisation confirmed in a statement that its nuclear facility in Natanz had been damaged, but investigations had not shown any radioactive or chemical contamination outside the site.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe attack has damaged several parts of the facility. Investigations are ongoing to assess the extent of damages,‚Äù the statement said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Israel‚Äôs neighbouring country Jordan‚Äôs military said it intercepted drones and missiles that had violated the kingdom‚Äôs airspace.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRoyal Air Force aircraft and air defence systems intercepted on Friday morning a number of missiles and drones that entered Jordanian airspace,‚Äù a military statement said.</p>
<p>Air raid sirens sounded in the Jordanian capital after Israel‚Äôs attack on Iran, while the public security directorate urged people to stay at home.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAdhere to the guidelines and stay in your homes,‚Äù said an announcement on loudspeakers in Amman.</p>
<p>Jordan had earlier said it would not allow its airspace to be violated and vowed not to become a ‚Äúbattleground‚Äù in any regional conflict. ‚ÄúJordan has not and will not allow any violation of its airspace, reaffirming that the Kingdom will not be a battleground for any conflict,‚Äù government spokesperson Mohammad Momani told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>The government condemned Israel‚Äôs attack, with foreign ministry spokesperson Sufian Qudah warning of ‚Äúthe consequences of such escalatory actions‚Äù.</p>
<p>Jordan also called the attack ‚Äúa blatant violation of the sovereignty of a United Nations member state and a clear breach of international law and the UN Charter‚Äù.</p>
<p>Tel Aviv‚Äôs Ben Gurion Airport was closed until further notice, and Israel‚Äôs air defence units stood at high alert for possible retaliatory strikes from Iran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFollowing the pre-emptive strike by the State of Israel against Iran, a missile and UAV (drone) attack against the State of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate time frame,‚Äù Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.</p>
<p>Israeli military Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir said tens of thousands of soldiers had been called up and ‚Äúprepared across all borders‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are amidst a historic campaign unlike any other. This is a critical operation to prevent an existential threat, by an enemy who is intent on destroying us,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Israeli Minister Gideon Saar was holding a ‚Äúmarathon of calls‚Äù with counterparts around the world regarding Israel‚Äôs attack on Iran, the foreign ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Pakistan was among several countries and international actors which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916907/world-reacts-to-israeli-strike-on-iran-over-nuclear-activity">condemned</a> Israel‚Äôs strikes, with the Foreign Office calling it ‚Äúunjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel.‚Äù</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned ‚Äúin the strongest possible terms today‚Äôs unprovoked attack on Iran by Israel‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI convey my deepest sympathies to the Iranian people on the loss of lives in this attack. This grave and highly irresponsible act is deeply alarming and risks further destabilising an already volatile region,‚Äù he <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/CMShehbaz/status/1933418673362120803" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a post on X.</p>

            <p><p>Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani on Friday distanced himself from the massive hike in the salaries of senior parliamentarians including himself, saying he was not consulted before the raise was approved.</p>
<p>The government recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916120">approved</a> a fivefold increase in the salaries of the Senate chairman and National Assembly speaker, taking it to Rs1.3 million a month. A May 29 notification revealed that the Senate chairman and NA speaker‚Äôs salaries have been raised from Rs205,000 to Rs1.3m, besides 50pc of the revised salary (Rs650,000) as the sumptuary allowance. The hike will take effect from January 2025.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have full respect for the defence minister. I have nothing to do with my salary increase,‚Äù Gilani told reporters at the Senate building when asked about the hike amid an economic crisis and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif‚Äôs criticism of the move.</p>
<p>The PPP stalwart said the decision regarding the raise will be made by the government. When asked if he would refuse the salary hike, he replied, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say about withdrawing. I have no connection with it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Gilani added he was not consulted when the hike was approved.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has taken <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916897/pm-thanks-uae-for-role-in-defusing-tensions-with-india">notice</a> of the increase in the salaries of the National Assembly speaker and Senate chairman and sought a report from the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.</p>
<p>The decision has drawn criticism from within the ruling PML-N as Defence Minister Khawaja Asif publicly criticised the move. In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KhawajaMAsif/status/1932846121933799902" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the senior PML-N leader termed the massive hike in salaries a ‚Äúfinancial obscenity, urging lawmakers to ‚Äúkeep in mind the life of a common man.‚Äù</p>
<p>During an <a class="link--external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJZgMbsHQzU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appearance</a> on <em>Geo TV</em> show ‚ÄòCapital Talk‚Äô hosted by Hamid Mir, the defence minister defended his stance, saying that while the hike will not have a significant financial impact, it reflected poorly on the image of the ruling elite and the parliament.</p>
<p>He said the salary hike was approved by the National Assembly‚Äôs finance committee despite government resistance. When asked if the prime minister opposed the move, Asif said it was ‚Äúlogical‚Äù to assume so. He added that the salary increase was not included in the budget.</p>
<p>The defence minister said the ruling elite should practice austerity and simplicity, noting that the prime minister does not receive a salary and poses no burden on the exchequer. However, Asif defended the increased expenditures of the President‚Äôs House and PM‚Äôs Office.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916663">defended</a> the steep hikes in the salaries of parliamentarians.</p>
<p>During the post-budget press conference on Wednesday, he insisted the hikes should be seen in the context that the salaries were last adjusted in 2016, compared to annual increases in the wages of employees in public and private sectors in line with inflation and other factors.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHad these been adjusted on an an¬≠¬≠n¬≠ual basis, there would have been no sudden jump,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Senior PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique had earlier slammed the pay raise, calling it ‚Äúincomprehensible‚Äù and lacking moral justification.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KhSaad_Rafique/status/1931430451916218602" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Rafique said: ‚ÄúA sudden increase of many times in the salaries of the Chairman Senate and Speaker National Assembly and a 50 per cent increase in allowance is an incomprehensible move.‚Äù</p></p>
