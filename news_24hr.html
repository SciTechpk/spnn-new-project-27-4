            <p><p>Two suspected terrorists were shot dead after an exchange or fire with police and Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) personnel in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s  Bannu district, a police officer said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Police and CTD conducted a joint operation against the criminals in Domel tehsil of Bannu, leading to an exchange of fire from both sides for over 20 minutes, a statement by Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan read.</p>
<p>“Resultantly, two terrorists were shot dead, while their accomplices managed to escape after taking advantage of darkness and nearby bushes,” the statement added.</p>
<p>The suspects were identified as Hussain Ahmed, and Inaam alias Tooru, resident of Haider Khel, North Waziristan.</p>
<p>“The slain terrorists were involved in several major attacks and IED blasts,” the police officer added.</p>
<p>The police recovered two AK-47 rifles, four hand grenades, six magazines, 150 bullets, and two mobile phones on the suspected terrorists.</p>
<p>The alleged terrorist Inaam was wanted by the police and CTD in five different cases for attacking and killing police officers, while Hussain Ahmed was wanted in three different terrorist incidents.</p>
<p>RPO Sajid said the Bannu police and CTD had averted a possible major terrorist attack due to timely action. He said an operation has been intensified to arrest the escaped suspects.</p>
<p>He vowed that CTD and police are determined to establish law and order in the area and completely eradicate terrorism.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, several suspects were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917310">arrested</a> and a cache of heavy weapons seized during a joint search and strike operation carried out by the police, counter terrorism department, and the army in Bannu.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921394/iran-linked-hackers-threaten-to-release-trump-aides-emails' target='_blank'><strong>Iran-linked hackers threaten to release Trump aides’ emails</strong></a>
            <p><p>Iran-linked hackers have threatened to disclose more emails stolen from US President Donald Trump’s circle, after distributing a prior batch to the media ahead of the 2024 US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870600">election</a>.</p>
<p>In online chats with <em>Reuters</em> on Sunday and Monday, the hackers, who go by the pseudonym Robert, said they had roughly 100 gigabytes of emails from the accounts of White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Trump lawyer Lindsey Halligan, Trump adviser Roger Stone and porn star-turned-Trump antagonist Stormy Daniels.</p>
<p>Robert raised the possibility of selling the material but otherwise did not provide details of their plans. The hackers did not describe the content of the emails.</p>
<p>US Attorney General Pam Bondi described the intrusion as “an unconscionable cyber-attack”.</p>
<p>The White House and the FBI responded with a statement from FBI Director Kash Patel, who said: “Anyone associated with any kind of breach of national security will be fully investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”</p>
<p>“This so-called cyber ‘attack’ is nothing more than digital propaganda, and the targets are no coincidence. This is a calculated smear campaign meant to damage President Trump and discredit honorable public servants who serve our country with distinction,” cyberdefense agency CISA said in a post on X.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Halligan, Stone and a representative for Daniels did not respond to requests for comment. Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not return a message seeking comment. Tehran has in the past denied committing cyberespionage.</p>
<p>Robert materialised in the final months of the 2024 presidential campaign, when they claimed to have breached the email accounts of several Trump allies, including Wiles.</p>
<p>The hackers then distributed emails to journalists.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> previously authenticated some of the leaked material, including an email that appeared to document a financial arrangement between Trump and lawyers representing former presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr — now Trump’s health secretary.</p>
<p>Other material included Trump campaign communication about Republican office-seekers and discussion of settlement negotiations with Daniels.</p>
<p>Although the leaked documents did garner some coverage last year, they did not fundamentally alter the presidential race, which Trump won.</p>
<p>The US Justice Department in a September 2024 indictment alleged that Iran’s Revolutionary Guards ran the Robert hacking operation. In conversations with Reuters, the hackers declined to address the allegation.</p>
<p>After Trump’s election, Robert told <em>Reuters</em> that no more leaks were planned. As recently as May, the hackers told <em>Reuters</em>, “I am retired, man.” But the group resumed communication after this month’s 12-day air war between Israel and Iran, which was capped by U.S. bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites.</p>
<p>In messages this week, Robert said they were organising a sale of stolen emails and wanted <em>Reuters</em> to “broadcast this matter”.</p>
<p>American Enterprise Institute scholar Frederick Kagan, who has written about Iranian cyberespionage, said Tehran suffered serious damage in the conflict and its spies were likely trying to retaliate in ways that did not draw more US or Israeli action.</p>
<p>“A default explanation is that everyone’s been ordered to use all the asymmetric stuff that they can that’s not likely to trigger a resumption of major Israeli/US military activity,” he said. “Leaking a bunch more emails is not likely to do that.”</p>
<p>Despite worries that Tehran could unleash digital havoc, Iran’s hackers took a low profile during the conflict. US cyber officials warned on Monday that American companies and critical infrastructure operators might still be in Tehran’s crosshairs.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921393/trump-signs-order-lifting-sanctions-on-syria' target='_blank'><strong>Trump signs order lifting sanctions on Syria</strong></a>
            <p><p>President Donald Trump signed on Monday an executive order terminating a US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1564119">sanctions</a> programme on Syria, allowing an end to the country’s isolation from the international financial system andbuilding on Washington’s pledge to help it rebuild after a devastating civil war.</p>
<p>The move will allow the US to maintain sanctions on Syria’s ousted former president Bashar al-Assad, his associates, human rights abusers, drug traffickers, people linked to chemical weapons activities, the Islamic State and ISIS affiliates and proxies for Iran, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters in a briefing.</p>
<p>Assad was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1877638">toppled</a> in December in a lightning offensive by Islamist-led rebels and Syria has since taken steps to re-establish international ties.</p>
<p>Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani said Trump’s termination of the Syria sanctions programme would “open door of long-awaited reconstruction and development,” according to a post by the foreign minister on social media platform X.</p>
<p>He said the move would “lift the obstacle” against economic recovery and open the country to the international community.</p>
<p>Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa and Trump met in Riyadh in May where, in a major policy shift, Trump unexpectedly announced he would lift US sanctions on Syria, prompting Washington to significantly ease its measures.</p>
<p>Some in Congress are pushing for the measures to be totally repealed, while Europe has announced the end of its economic sanctions regime.</p>
<p>“Syria needs to be given a chance, and that’s what’s happened,” U.S. Special Envoy for Syria Thomas Barrack told reporters in a briefing call. He described Monday’s move as “the culmination of a very tedious, detailed, excruciating process of, how do you unwrap these sanctions.”</p>
<p>The White House in a fact sheet said the order directs the Secretary of State to review the terrorism designations of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a rebel group that Sharaa led that has roots in al Qaeda, as well as Syria’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.</p>
<p>The White House said the administration would continue to monitor Syria’s progress on key priorities including “taking concrete steps toward normalising ties with Israel, addressing foreign terrorists, deporting Palestinian terrorists and banning Palestinian terrorist groups”.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#layers-of-us-sanctions" id="layers-of-us-sanctions" title="Permalink"></a>Layers of US sanctions</h2>
<p>A <em>Reuters</em> investigation published on Monday revealed the role of Syrian government forces in the killing of more than 1,500 Syrian Alawites over three days of massacres along the country’s Mediterranean coast in March. The Trump administration had no comment on the <em>Reuters</em> report.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear if Washington was lifting the sanctions on any of the factions that Reuters found were involved.</p>
<p>Syrians hope the easing of sanctions will clear the way for greater engagement by humanitarian organisations working in the country, encouraging foreign investment and trade as it rebuilds.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of Trump’s announcement in May, the US Treasury Department issued a general license that authorised transactions involving the interim Syrian government as well as the central bank and state-owned enterprises.</p>
<p>However, the US has imposed layers of sanctions against Syria, some of which are authorised by legislation, including the Caesar Act. Repealing the measures is necessary for Syria to attract long-term investment without parties fearing the risk of violating U.S. sanctions.</p>
<p>“We are now, pursuant to the executive order, going to look at suspension criteria for the Caesar Act,” a senior administration official said.</p>
<p>Most of the US sanctions on Syria were imposed on Assad’s government and key individuals in 2011 after civil war erupted in the country.</p>
<p>The dismantling of the US sanctions programme on Syria includes terminating from Tuesday a national emergency declared in 2004 and revoking linked executive orders, according to the order signed on Monday.</p>
<p>The executive order also directs additional actions, including some with respect to waivers of export controls and other restrictions, the order read.</p></p>
