            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920543/sc-dismisses-pti-petitions-making-party-ineligible-for-reserved-seats' target='_blank'><strong>SC dismisses PTI petitions, making party ineligible for reserved seats</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench on Friday dismissed the petitions filed by the PTI in the reserved seats case, declaring that the party will not be eligible for them in the national and provincial assemblies.</p>
<p>The verdict came as an 11-member bench of the SC, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, resumed the hearing of the reserved seats case today. However, Justice Salahuddin Panhwar recused himself. The bench previously had 13 members, but  Ayesha A. Malik and  Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had declared the applications  [inadmissible][11] and were not part of the subsequent proceedings, with the CB head judge noting they had stepped back voluntarily.</p>
<p>Among the remaining 10 members, the review petitions were accepted by a majority of seven judges, including Justices Aminuddin Khan, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhter Afghan, Shahid Bilal Hassan, Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi. The judges who rejected the petitions today included Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi.</p>
<p>As part of the verdict, the SC upheld the Peshawar High Court’s March 2024 decision and set aside its own July 2024 ruling. As a result, the PTI’s petitions were dismissed, rendering the party ineligible for the 39 reserved seats.</p>
<p>“For detailed reasons to be recorded later, by majority of seven, all civil review petitions are allowed and the impugned majority judgment dated July 12, 2024, is set aside,” the short order of today’s verdict, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, noted.</p>
<p>“As a consequence thereof, Civil Appeals number 333 of 2024 and 334 of 2024 filed by the SIC are dismissed and the judgment rendered by the Peshawar High Court is restored.”</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail partly allowed the review petitions and maintained his original order with regard to 39 seats, but reviewed the majority judgment to the extent of the remaining 41 seats.</p>
<p>The court instructed the Election Commission of Pakistan to examine and consider the nomination and declaration appers, as well as any other relevant documents, of all 80 returned candidates “by means of de novo exercise with regard to their affiliation and take appropriate decision in accordance with law and applicable rules for allocation of reserve seats”.</p>
<p>The ECP has 15 days from receiving the copy of the short order to carry out the court’s instructions.</p>

<p>Reacting to the verdict in a post on X, the PTI termed the decision “the funeral of constitutional, judicial traditions, and justice.”</p>

<p>PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Khan said he was disappointed by the “injustice and the violation of the Constitution.”</p>
<p>“I’m disappointed. This is a huge injustice. For the PTI, it seems that the shadow of Qazi Faez Esa still lurks in the Supreme Court,” he said while speaking to <em>Geo News.</em></p>
<p>“The right that has been snatched from us is a huge injustice. The framers of the Constitution could not have imagined that a party would get more seats than it won.”</p>
<p>He said the PTI deserved to receive 78 reserved seats, including 66 for women and 11 for non-Muslims. “They belong to the PTI and it is their right,” he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Gohar went on to say that the PTI contested elections from across the country and joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) as per the affidavit by the Election Commission of Pakistan (SIC) for an independent candidate to join a political party.</p>
<p>“There is no further legal recourse, but we will protest the decision in the assemblies and all forums against this injustice,” he said.</p>
<p>PTI leader Salman Akram Raja also criticised the verdict in a post on X, stating that the party contested the election and received votes “only because we were contesting under Imran Khan’s banner”.</p>
<p>“To deny the existence of PTI is to deny the people their voice,” he wrote.</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#phc-2024-decision" id="phc-2024-decision" title="Permalink"></a>PHC 2024 decision</h2>
<p>In March 2024, the PHC had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1821427">dismissed</a> the SIC’s petition challenging the ECP’s decision to reject the party allocation of reserved women and minority seats.</p>
<p>In a 4-1 verdict, the electoral watchdog ruled that the SIC was not entitled to claim quota for reserved seats “due to having non-curable legal defects and violation of a mandatory provision of submission of party list for reserved seats, which is the requirement of law”.</p>
<p>The SIC — joined by PTI-backed independents who won the elections sans their electoral symbol — had filed the petition through its chairman, Sahibzada Muhammad Hamid Raza, seeking directives of the court for the ECP to allocate reserved seats to the council based on their strength in the national and provincial assemblies.</p>
<p>The commission had also decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the PML-N and the PPP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1819514/pml-n-gets-lucky-as-reserved-seats-doled-out">becoming major beneficiaries</a>. The decision was challenged by the PTI in the top court.</p>
<p>On July 13, the apex court, in a unique majority <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">verdict</a>, declared the PTI eligible to receive reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the national and provincial assemblies, giving it a new lease of life in the legislature by declaring it to be a parliamentary party.</p>
<p>However, the ruling was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1868333">not implemented</a> by the National Assembly, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had raised some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859716">objections</a>. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1846084">PML-N</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847508/ppp-takes-cue-from-pml-n-files-review-petition-on-sc-reserved-seats-verdict">PPP</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850678#:~:text=ECP%20files%20review%20plea">ECP</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#todays-hearing" id="todays-hearing" title="Permalink"></a>Today’s hearing</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, as the Supreme Court resumed hearing the review petitions in the reserved seats case, Justice Panhwar recused himself from the bench after SIC counsel Hamid Khan raised an objection.</p>
<p>“Hamid Khan objected to judges who joined the Supreme Court after the 26th Amendment being part of the bench,” Justice Panhwar said, adding that he himself was among those judges.</p>
<p>“Public trust in the judiciary is crucial,” he remarked. “It is important that no party questions the composition of the bench. Given these objections, I cannot remain part of this bench.”</p>
<p>Hamid responded by saying he appreciated the recusal, prompting a stern exchange. Justice Aminuddin remarked, “There is no need for appreciation. This is the result of your conduct.”</p>
<p>Justice Mazahir Ali Akbar Naqvi added, “We’re listening to you out of respect. Otherwise, we were not bound to do so. Don’t misuse the opportunity you’ve been given.”</p>
<p>Following Justice Panhwar’s withdrawal, SIC’s counsel raised a fresh objection — this time to the constitution of the 10-member bench itself.</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail questioned the legal basis for the objection, asserting that the 10-member bench would continue hearing the case.</p>
<p>When asked to clarify, Hamid stated, “I object to a 12-member bench reviewing the decision of a 13-member bench.”</p>
<p>Justice Aminuddin dismissed the objection and directed him to proceed with his arguments.</p></p>

            <p><p>At least 18 people went missing after being swept away in flash floods triggered by heavy rains in the Swat River, officials said, adding that eight of them have been killed while a search operation to locate the remaining people was underway.</p>
<p>The floods in the district have inundated several areas, with reports of dozens stranded at different locations, according to an initial report by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122.</p>
<p>KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah confirmed that out of the 18 missing individuals, the bodies of eight have been found, while three of them have been rescued.</p>
<p>The incident prompted the provincial government to immediately launch a rescue operation, the statement said, adding, “Rescue operations are currently being conducted at eight different locations in Swat.”</p>
<p>The statement further said, “A total of 75 people were trapped at different places along the Swat River on the bypass road,” adding that 58 of them had been rescued.</p>
<p>The provincial government has formed a committee to inquire about the matter, it added.</p>

<p>According to the initial report by KP Rescue 1122, search and rescue operations were underway for the remaining bodies in several areas.</p>
<p>Three bodies have been recovered from Ingaroderai, while one body was also recovered from Ghalegy, where seven people were stranded and rescue operations are still underway.</p>
<p>At least 120 Rescue 1122 personnel have been deployed in rescue operations.</p>
<p>“More than 22 people were trapped in the water in Imam Dhirai, who were rescued safely by the team of Rescue Station 33,” the report stated, adding that the search operation of Rescue Station 44 was ongoing.</p>
<p>Seven people are also reported to be trapped in Manyar, with Rescue Stations 44 and 55 working jointly in rescue activities.</p>
<p>One person was trapped at Panjigram village, where a rescue operation was underway, while at least 20 to 30 people have been rescued from Bara Bamakhela, the report said.</p>
<p>“All Rescue 1122 teams are present on site and rescue operations are in full swing,” the report said.</p>
<p>A flood alert has been issued by the Charsadda Deputy Commissioner Qaiser Khan, directing relevant staff to be on high alert following the floods in Swat.</p>
<p>A notice from the DC’s office said the “discharge at Khwazakela in River Swat has increased to 77,782 cusecs, categorised as a very high flood.”</p>
<p>DC Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em> that rescue teams had been deployed to the banks of the River Kabul and River Swat.</p>
<p>“Announcements were made via mosque loudspeakers to inform the public about the dangers of floodwater,” the DC said, adding that officials were instructing people to move to safer places.</p>
<p>“We are keeping an eye on the Munda headworks; until 3pm, the flow was normal.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, former climate change minister and PPP Senator Sherry Rehman has said that the continued “sleepwalk” on climate stress was triggering such incidents.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/sherryrehman/status/1938536887544676708" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, she wrote, “The tragic drowning of several people in the River Swat is NOT the result of a random ‘natural disaster’.”</p>
<p>“We need to understand that this and other disasters are the deadly impact of super heavy monsoons in Swat, all triggered by climate stress, and it is not just one area,” she added.</p>
<p>Rehman also said that the district and provincial administration had been alerted, but “early warning systems are being ignored by the general public in KP”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan needs to understand that such hazards are triggered by global warming and climate change … So please stop calling it a natural disaster or a random flash flood that is disconnected from human actions or responsibility.”</p>
