                <h2>Ceasefire brokered with Iran after Washington request for liaison, Qatar‚Äôs PM says</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Qatar‚Äôs prime minister said on Tuesday that the country had brokered a ceasefire with Iran amid the ongoing war with Israel at the request of the United States to play a role as a liaison.</p>
<p>He also said that relations with Iran were scarred by an Iranian missile volley at a United States airbase in the Gulf Arab state, but added that he hoped ties would eventually ‚Äúcome back to normal‚Äù.</p>
<p>Iran responded to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842/trump-says-irans-key-nuclear-facilities-obliterated-by-us-airstrikes">US participation</a> in Israel‚Äôs air war against Iran by firing missiles on Monday at the Al Ubeid air base, but no one was hurt after Tehran gave warning, and a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919647/israel-reports-waves-of-iranian-missiles-soon-after-trump-announced-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> was announced hours later by Washington.</p>
<p>Qatar, situated just across the Gulf from Iran, has often acted as a mediator in regional conflicts, including between Iran and the US and between Israel and Hamas in the continuing Gaza conflict.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat happened will definitely have its scar on the relationship [with Iran], but I hope by the time everyone learns the lesson that this kind of neighbourhood relationship should not be violated and should not be undermined,‚Äù Qatar‚Äôs prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, told a press conference with his Lebanese counterpart in Doha.</p>
<p>The prime minister described the attack as ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù but said Qatar‚Äôs response would be ‚Äúdiplomatic and legal‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe attack on the State of Qatar is an unacceptable act, especially that the State of Qatar has been making great diplomatic efforts in order to have the situation de-escalated,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe partnership between Qatar and the US is just growing stronger ‚Ä¶ and I hope the good relationship with Iran comes back to normal as soon as possible,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Al Thani added that Qatar had liaised with Iran at Washington‚Äôs request to help facilitate the ceasefire.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe hope the ceasefire will continue as agreed upon, and we urge both the US and Iran to return to the negotiating table with the aim of reaching a comprehensive diplomatic solution, something that Qatar has consistently sought,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He added that Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian expressed regret in a phone call with Qatar‚Äôs ruling Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani that Tehran‚Äôs target in retaliating for US airstrikes was a military base in Qatar.</p>
<p>Sheikh Mohammed also urged Washington and Tehran to resume Oman-mediated talks on Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme that were frozen when Israel began striking Iran.</p>
<p>He said that Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, was working on resuming talks for a fresh ceasefire in the Gaza conflict.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are still continuing our efforts, and God willing, we will try to look for an opportunity during the next two days for having indirect negotiations between the two parties,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe hope that the Israeli side will not exploit the ceasefire with Iran to unleash what it wants to unleash on Gaza and continue its bombing of‚Äù the strip, Sheikh Mohammed added.</p>

<p>Separately, a source with knowledge of the talks said Qatar‚Äôs prime minister persuaded Iran to agree to the US-proposed ceasefire with Israel after Iranian missiles targeted the American base near Doha.</p>
<p>Sheikh Mohammed spoke to the Iranians at Washington‚Äôs request following Monday‚Äôs unprecedented attack on Qatari soil, the source told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the aftermath of the strikes on Al Udeid [military base], President [Donald] Trump told the Emir of Qatar [that] Israel had signed off on an American ceasefire proposal,‚Äù the source said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe US president then asked that Qatar help get Iran to agree to a deal,‚Äù the source added, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.</p>
<p>US Vice President JD Vance spoke to the Qatari prime minister, ‚Äúwho persuaded Iran to agree to the proposal in a call with the Iranians‚Äù, the source said.</p>
<p>Israel said today it had agreed to the ceasefire, which is now ‚Äúin effect‚Äù, according to Trump.</p>
<p>Iran has yet to formally accept the truce, but its top security body said the Islamic Republic‚Äôs forces had ‚Äúcompelled‚Äù Israel to ‚Äúunilaterally‚Äù cease fire.</p></p>

                <h2>Two soldiers martyred, 11 terrorists killed in South Waziristan IBO: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Two soldiers were martyred and 11 terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs South Waziristan district, the military‚Äôs media wing said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>According to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), ‚ÄúOn June 24 2025, security Forces conducted an IBO in the general area Sararogha, South Waziristan District, on [the] reported presence of <em>Khwarij</em> belonging to Indian Proxy, <em>Fitna-al-Khwarij.</em>‚Äù</p>
<p>In July last year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade">designated</a> the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em>, while mandating all institutions to use the term <em>khariji</em> (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan</p>
<p>The statement said that the troops effectively engaged the terrorists‚Äô location and ‚Äú11 Indian sponsored <em>khwarij</em> were sent to hell, while seven <em>khwarij</em> got injured‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, during the intense fire exchange, Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah (age: 37 years, resident of District Chakwal), a brave officer who was leading his troops from the front, fought gallantly and paid the ultimate sacrifice along with another brave son of soil Lance Naik Jibran Ullah (age: 27 years, resident of District Bannu),‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The ISPR said that Major Moiz was known for ‚Äúhis courage and daring actions in numerous operations conducted against the <em>khwarij</em>‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored khariji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve,‚Äù the ISPR added.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid rich tribute to the martyred soldiers for bravely fighting against the enemy during the operation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMajor Syed Moiz Abbas and Lance Naik Jibranullah sacrificed their lives for the secure future of the nation. They are true heroes who thwarted the malicious plans of Indian-backed terrorists and eliminated 11 militants,‚Äù Naqvi said in a statement.</p>
<p>The interior minister added that ‚Äúthese martyrs gave their lives to deliver a strong message to the enemy and are a proud example of bravery for the nation. Their heroic sacrifice will always be remembered by the people.‚Äù</p>
<p>Earlier this month, five terrorists were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917495">killed</a> during operations in KP‚Äôs Peshawar and North Waziristan districts, with the military terming them ‚ÄúIndian-sponsored‚Äù ones.</p>
<p>ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913266">accused</a> India of activating its ‚Äúassets‚Äù to inte¬≠nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting ‚Äúirr¬≠e¬≠futable evidence‚Äù of Ind¬≠ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind¬≠ian military personnel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPost-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitna-al-Khawarij and the independent terrorist cells ‚Ä¶ to increase their activity,‚Äù he had said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p></p>
