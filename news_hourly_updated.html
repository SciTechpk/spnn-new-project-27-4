                <h2>Security forces foil infiltration bid by terrorists on Pak-Afghan border: state media</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Security forces have foiled an infiltration attempt by terrorists along the Pak-Afghan border and arrested five ‚Äúalleged suicide bombers‚Äù, state-run <em>PTV News</em> reported on Friday.</p>
<p>Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">witnessed</a> an uptick in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistani security forces have foiled an infiltration attempt by <em>Khawarij</em> along the Pak-Afghan border,‚Äù <em>PTV News</em> reported, citing security sources.</p>
<p><em>Khawarij</em> is a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna">term</a> the state uses to refer to terrorists.</p>
<p><em>PTV</em> said, quoting security sources, that on July 17, at around 5pm, <em>Khawarij</em> tried to cross the border and enter Pakistan, but the forces, on receiving immediate information, set up checkpoints at various places and prevented them from proceeding ahead with their attempt.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe <em>Khawarij</em> advanced towards Azizkhel and Mandikhel, but due to the heavy presence of security forces, they were forced to take refuge in the mosque in Besikhel, where the forces immediately surrounded them and forced them to surrender,‚Äù the state broadcaster said.</p>
<p>All five suspects arrested are Afghan citizens aged between 15 and 18. Three of them also have Afghan identity cards. They have been shifted to an undisclosed location for further interrogation.</p>
<p>Security authorities have issued an alert in the border areas and are continuing search operations to stop potential terrorists, <em>PTV</em> added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecurity sources say that India is giving full support to the <em>Khawarij</em> separatist movement to fuel terrorism in Pakistan,‚Äù <em>PTV News</em> said.</p>

<p>A police assistant sub-inspector (ASI) and a constable were injured when the Meryan police station in KP‚Äôs Bannu area was struck by terrorists with a quadcopter drone today.</p>
<p>Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told <em>Dawn.com</em> that this was the sixth time the police station was attacked by quadcopters, resulting in injuries to two police officials.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe injured ASI and police constable were moved to the district headquarters hospital for medical assistance,‚Äù DPO Kulachi said, adding that Meryan police station was ‚Äúcrucial for combating terrorists in the district‚Äù.</p>
<p>The DPO said that terrorists had started using quadcopters to target police infrastructure and personnel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNational unity and support are significantly needed to fight collectively against the terrorists and eliminate them,‚Äù the DPO said ‚ÄúPolice alone cannot handle them without the cooperation of the public.‚Äù</p>
<p>Earlier this month, security forces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922232/30-terrorists-killed-as-forces-thwart-border-breach">foiled</a> an infiltration attempt from Afghanistan by an ‚ÄúIndian proxy‚Äù, killing at least 30 terrorists in North Waziristan district, ISPR had said.</p>
<p>On July 9, security forces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908178">killed</a> eight militants attempting to infiltrate from Afghanistan into Bajaur district.</p>
<p>Official sources said the militants were killed in Lowi Mamund tehsil after they tried to cross into the district from Afghanistan‚Äôs Kunar province.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921445">witnessed</a> a slight overall decline in militant violence during June 2025 despite several high-profile attacks, according to data released by an Islamabad-based think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss).</p>
<p>The monthly security assessment shows there were a total of 78 militant attacks across the country in June, resulting in at least 100 fatalities, including 53 security personnel, 39 civilians, six militants, and two members of peace committees, the organisation said in a press statement.</p></p>

            <p><p>Flooding at Punjab‚Äôs Kalabagh and Chashma on the Indus river reached a ‚Äúmedium‚Äù level on Friday, prompting the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) to issue a high-level flood warning for the two points, as water flows surged due to heavy monsoon rains.</p>
<p>Rescue operations continued in Punjab after recent deadly rains wreaked havoc and claimed at least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924761/section-144-imposed-across-punjab-emergency-in-parts-as-rains-claim-dozens-of-lives-in-past-24-hours">63 lives</a> across the province. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has forecasted that five more such spells of rain are expected in the coming days, leading to rising water levels, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-directs-ndma-ministers-for-climate-planning-to-prepare-comprehensive-disaster-management-plans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The next spell is expected to begin from July 21 and last till July 28, while the fifth is expected in the first week of August, the sixth in the second week of August and the seventh in its third week.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe flow of water in rivers is increasing due to monsoon rains and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660">glacial melting</a>,‚Äù a statement issued by the PDMA spokesperson said.</p>
<p>According to the data released by the Met Office‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://ffd.pmd.gov.pk/home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Flood Forecasting Division</a> at 4pm, there was a medium-level flood at Kalabagh and Chashma Barrage with falling water inflow and outflow at the former, and rising flows at the latter.</p>
<p>There was a low-level flood at Tarbela Dam, as well as at Guddu and Sukkur barrages in Sindh, as of 12pm. While the water inflows and outflows were falling at Tarbela and Guddu, they were rising steady at Sukkur.</p>

<p>In view of the situation, the PDMA issued a warning for an expected high-level flood at Kalabagh and Chashma during the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>‚ÄúActivate flood monitoring and early warning systems,‚Äù the advisory said. It also ordered authorities to strengthen embankments, establish relief and medical camps, as well as stockpile essential medicines and food.</p>
<p>In a statement, the PDMA urged residents living alongside the rivers to evacuate the areas with their cattle. ‚ÄúThe Punjab government will fully take care of you and your livestock,‚Äù PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Alerts had been issued to the Sargodha and Dera Ghazi Khan commissioners as well as the deputy commissioners of Mianwali, Layyah, Bhakkar, Kot Addu, Rajanpur and Muzaffargarh.</p>
<p>It directed the local administration, the agricultural, health, wildlife, livestock and transport departments, and Rescue 1122 to remain alert and be fully prepared. The PDMA stressed to ensure ample fuel stock for rescue operations.</p>

<p>Flood level at Kalabagh has been moderate since at least 6am, according to data issued by the PDMA earlier today.</p>
<p>In a statement, the authority said that the water levels at the Ravi, Chenab, and Sutlej rivers were normal, as well as those at Dera Ghazi Khan‚Äôs irrigation system.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe water level in Mangla Dam is 47 per cent and 79pc in Tarbela, whereas the water levels in Indian dams on Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi are up to 36pc,‚Äù said the statement.</p>
<p>According to the NDMA‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndma.gov.pk/sitrepm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>, monsoon rains since June 26 have killed 181 people across the country and injured 491 people.</p>

<p>Rescue 1122 stated that most of the casualties occurred in house collapse incidents  ‚Äî 351 since June 25 ‚Äî due to dilapidated buildings. It recorded 61 traffic accidents, 22 electrocutions and four lightning incidents, among others.</p>
<p>According to the statement, 15,000 rescue personnel were on high alert across Punjab with 800 boats.</p>
<p>Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
