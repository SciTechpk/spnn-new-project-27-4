                <h2>Pakistan‚Äôs outreach to Trump ‚Äòrattles‚Äô India, says Financial Times</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>PAKISTAN‚Äôs recent diplomatic <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927959">engagements</a> with the administration of United States President Donald Trump have led to a marked improvement in bilateral ties and drawn a strong reaction from India, the <em>Financial Times</em> reported in a detailed piece on Monday.</p>
<p>In a report by correspondents in Islamabad, New Delhi and Washi¬≠ngton, the <em>FT</em> described what it called an ‚Äúunexpected resurgence‚Äù in relations between Islamabad and Washington. The newspaper said Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir has twice been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929938">received</a> in high-level settings in the US this summer,  most recently in Florida, where he attended the retirement ceremony of Gen Michael Kurilla, head of US Central Command.</p>
<p>According to the  <em>FT</em>, Munir also met President Trump in June for a two-hour private <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">lunch</a>,  just a month after Pakistan and India experienced their bloodiest <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">confrontation</a> in decades. The meeting was notable given Mr Trump‚Äôs  earlier public criticism of Pakistan.</p>
<p>Michael Kugelman, a non-resident senior fellow at the Asia Pacific Foundation, told the <em>FT</em>:  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening in US-Pakistan relations is a surprise. I would describe the relationship now as one that‚Äôs enjoying an unexpected resurgence, even a renaissance. Pakistan has very successfully  understood how to engage with such an unconventional president.‚Äù</p>
<p>The <em>FT</em> attributed the change in tone to a diplomatic strategy by senior Pakistani officials, combining counterterrorism cooperation, outreach to individuals in Mr Trump‚Äôs business network, and agreements involving energy, mineral resources and cryptocurrency. These moves, it said, were accompanied by positive messaging towards the White House.</p>
<p>A key development cited in the report was the March arrest and transfer to US  custody of an ISIS-K suspect alleged to have organised the 2021 Kabul airport bombing. Mr Trump publicly commended Pakistan for the arrest in his State of the Union address.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The newspaper also detailed an April agreement between World Liberty Financial, a Trump-backed cryptocurrency initiative, and Pakistan‚Äôs crypto council. One of the venture‚Äôs co-founders remarked during a visit to Pakistan on the scale of the country‚Äôs mineral resources.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>On the regional response,  the <em>FT</em> said India reacted with ‚Äúdeep irritation‚Äù to the warming of ties,  particularly after facing a US tariff <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929231">increase</a> to 50 per cent, while Pakistan‚Äôs rate was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927992">set</a> at 19 per cent. Prime Minister Narendra Modi  <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917877/modi-maintains-there-was-no-us-mediation-in-ceasefire-with-pakistan">disputed</a> Mr Trump‚Äôs assertion that the US had mediated a May <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910060">ceasefire</a> between the two countries, with New Delhi emphasising that the agreement had been reached through direct channels between their armed forces.</p>

                <h2>US tariff on Indian rice opens market for Pakistan</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>WASHINGTON: The 50 per cent tariff <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929231">imposed</a> by the Trump administration on Indian goods, including basmati rice, has reshaped trade flows in the United States, providing Pakistan an opportunity to expand its share in the American aromatic rice market.</p>
<p>Pakistan‚Äôs basmati rice exports have witnessed steady growth in recent years. According to the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan (REAP), the country exported approximately 772,725 tonnes of basmati rice in FY24, generating $876.9m ‚Äî up from 595,120 tonnes worth $650.4m in the previous fiscal year. The average export price per tonne also increased from $1,092.93 to $1,134.86.</p>
<p>Data from Volza‚Äôs Global Trade platform shows that between November 2023 and October 2024, the United States accounted for 24pc of Pakistan‚Äôs total basmati exports through 1,519 shipments. Italy and the United Kingdom followed with shares of 14pc (908 shipments) and 11pc (716 shipments), respectively.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Together, these three markets consumed nearly 49pc of Pakistan‚Äôs basmati rice exports. Pakistan currently exports basmati rice to over 110 countries, with other key destinations including Australia, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Canada, the Netherlands, and Germany.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Basmati exports rose 35pc in FY24 to 772,725 tonnes, earning $876.9m</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), rice imports in the US have grown steadily over the past three decades ‚Äî from 7pc of the domestic market in 1993/94 to over 25pc by 2022/23. Over 60pc of these imports consist of aromatic varieties from Asia, mainly jasmine from Thailand and basmati from India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>While the US produces some aromatic rice domestically, these differ in quality and aroma from their Asian counterparts. The USDA projects continued growth in demand for aromatic rice imports in the coming years.</p>
<p>The tariff dispute emerged from US punitive measures targeting India‚Äôs trade and energy ties with Russia, resulting in broad tariffs on several Indian exports, including basmati rice, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. Although some sectors later received exemptions, basmati rice remained subject to the full 50pc tariff. In contrast, Pakistani basmati rice continues to face a lower <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927992">tariff</a> of 19pc, giving it a distinct pricing advantage in the US market.</p>
<p>Indian media reports suggest that the tariff hike could reduce India‚Äôs basmati exports to the US by 50-80pc, with prices climbing to nearly $1,800 per metric tonne. Pakistani basmati, by comparison, remains priced at around $1,450 per metric tonne, making it more competitive for US importers and retailers.</p>
<p>Retailers across the US are already reporting increased interest in Pakistani basmati rice. Khan Mohammed, a salesman at Super Halal grocery in Springfield, Virginia, noted: ‚ÄúPakistani rice is already popular.</p>
