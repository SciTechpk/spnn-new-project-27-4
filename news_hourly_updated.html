                <h2>Pakistan, Turkiye to establish special economic zone for Turkish entrepreneurs in Karachi: Dar</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday said Pakistan and Turkiye were pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) for Turkish entrepreneurs in Karachi.</p>
<p>The announcement came after Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan arrived in Islamabad earlier today on an official visit. Turkiye‚Äôs Minister of National Defence Yasar Guler is also visiting Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Turkiye enjoy strong bilateral ties built on shared cultural, religious and historical bonds, as well as mutual respect. In February, the two countries pledged to boost bilateral trade to $5 billion as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891671">visited</a> Islamabad.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone dedicated to Turkish entrepreneurs at Karachi,‚Äù Dar said, addressing a press conference alongside Fidan at the Foreign Office (FO).</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Dar also mentioned other engagements, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753314">revival</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1665062/freight-train-launched-to-link-istanbul-with-tehran-islamabad">Istanbul-Tehran-Islamabad</a> train, saying, ‚ÄúOur delegations are meeting in the coming weeks to finalise the roadmap for revival.‚Äù</p>
<p>The deputy PM further said that Pakistan has allocated land for the construction of a Maarif School in Muzaffarabad, referring to the Turkish Maarif Foundation, which Fidan said has more than 80 schools in Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA Maarif Foundation delegation is visiting Muzaffarabad today and visiting the site for evaluation,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Dar further stated that Turkish companies were being considered for undertaking the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1883728">Jinnah Medical Complex</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910839">Daanish University</a> megaprojects in Islamabad.</p>
<p>The Turkish companies will also be participating in offshore drilling projects and the privatisation of electricity distribution companies (Discos) in the power sector, he highlighted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are actively engaged in different activities, including capacity building and counterterrorism,‚Äù Dar asserted.</p>
<p>He appreciated Turkiye‚Äôs indigenisation of the defence industry from 20 per cent to 80pc in the last few years, adding: ‚ÄúWe would like to benefit from Turkiye‚Äôs experience and expertise.‚Äù</p>
<p>In his remarks, the Turkish foreign minister said defence cooperation will be further strengthened in the coming days, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/09-07-2025/pakistan-turkiye-vow-to-strengthen-economic-defence-ties" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Fidan called it a ‚Äústrategic step‚Äù, emphasising that it was very important for the security of Pakistan and Turkiye. He asserted that both countries will continue to support each other in countering terrorism. Over a month ago, the two nations conducted a joint operation and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914759/is-operative-captured-at-pak-afghan-border-in-joint-pak-turkiye-intelligence-operation">arrested</a> a high-ranking terrorist.</p>
<p>Referring to the recent Pakistan-India conflict, Fidan was ‚Äúappreciative of Pakistan‚Äôs wisdom-oriented attitude‚Äù, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> stated.</p>
<p>He noted that Turkiye and Pakistan were intensifying their cooperation in the field of energy, including mining, precious stones, natural gas and oil. The minister also highlighted that the two nations have expanded their relations in other fields, such as the economy, education and culture.</p>
<p>Fidan reiterated the countries‚Äô aim to increase their commercial relations to $5bn and expressed the firm resolve to take Pakistan-Turkiye relations to a higher level, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> added.</p>
<p>Following their meetings, Dar wrote on X: ‚ÄúHeld productive discussions on the entire gamut of bilateral relations and exchanged views on key regional and global developments.</p>
<p>‚Äô‚ÄúPakistan and T√ºrkiye share deep-rooted bonds of brotherhood, mutual trust, and strategic cooperation,‚Äù the deputy PM stressed.</p>

<p>He lauded PAF‚Äôs ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">exceptional performance</a> under the insightful leadership of the air chief in the recent conflict with India, commending its operational preparedness and resolute defence of national sovereignty‚Äù, the ISPR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHighlighting the longstanding fraternal ties between Turkiye and Pakistan, Yasar Guler conveyed Turkiye‚Äôs earnest desire to bolster bilateral defence relations through deeper industry-to-industry collaboration,‚Äù the ISPR highlighted.</p>
<p>Guler ‚Äúparticularly emphasised the need to explore joint ventures in cutting-edge domains, including niche disruptive technologies, advanced avionics and unmanned aerial systems‚Äù, the statement said.</p>
<p>The Turkish defence minister expressed his appreciation for PAF‚Äôs continued support in the pilot exchange programme, which he termed as a ‚Äúvital initiative for fostering professional growth and operational understanding‚Äù between the two air forces.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the Air Chief Marshal Sidhu highlighted the enduring brotherly ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, emphasising the common aspirations and strategic convergence that bind the two nations.</p>

                <h2>1 dead, 3 children injured in KP‚Äôs Bannu after quadcopter attacks by militants: police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>One person was killed while three children were injured after militants carried out two quadcopter attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Bannu district on Wednesday, according to police.</p>
<p>The incident comes after reports of multiple quadcopter and drone attacks in KP and Balochistan over the past year. In March, at least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901160/11-killed-in-mardan-security-action">11 people</a> were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, while in May, a suspected quadcopter munitions drop <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912007/locals-stage-sit-in-as-kp-minister-denounces-killing-of-3-children-in-alleged-north-waziristan-drone-strike">claimed</a> the lives of four children and injured five others in North Waziristan District‚Äôs Mir Ali tehsil. The military <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912393/security-forces-falsely-implicated-in-north-waziristan-incident-ispr">clarified</a> that security forces were ‚Äúfalsely implicated‚Äù in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told <em>Dawn.com</em>: ‚ÄúTwo quadcopter incidents occurred in the district today. In the first quadcopter attack by militants, one woman was killed while three children were injured, including two of the woman‚Äôs children.‚Äù</p>
<p>The woman‚Äôs body and the injured people were taken to the hospital for medical assistance, he added.</p>
<p>DPO Kulachi said that another quadcopter attack occurred where terrorists attacked the Maryan police station, damaging the station‚Äôs solar panels on the rooftop.</p>
<p>He said, ‚ÄúThe police personnel remained safe in the attack,‚Äù adding that it was the third such militant attack on the same police station.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA search operation was underway in the area to track down the terrorists,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities recently, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Bannu has seen several militant attacks over the past several months.</p>
<p>On Saturday, one person was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922294/jirga-member-killed-3-injured-by-armed-suspects-firing-in-bannu-police">killed</a> and three others were injured after armed assailants attacked a jirga in the district.</p>
<p>In March, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895956">16 terrorists</a> were killed while five soldiers were martyred as security forces responded to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895785">terrorist attack</a> on the Bannu Cantonment.</p>
<p>The incident resulted in the deaths of 13 civilians and injured 32 others after ‚Äúsevere destruction‚Äù of a mosque and a residential building due to the suicide blasts, causing the perimeter wall to partially collapse.</p></p>
