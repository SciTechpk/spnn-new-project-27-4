                <h2>1 dead, 3 children injured in KP‚Äôs Bannu after quadcopter attacks by militants: police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>One person was killed while three children were injured after militants carried out two quadcopter attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Bannu district on Wednesday, according to police.</p>
<p>The incident comes after reports of multiple quadcopter and drone attacks in KP and Balochistan over the past year. In March, at least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901160/11-killed-in-mardan-security-action">11 people</a> were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, while in May, a suspected quadcopter munitions drop <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912007/locals-stage-sit-in-as-kp-minister-denounces-killing-of-3-children-in-alleged-north-waziristan-drone-strike">claimed</a> the lives of four children and injured five others in North Waziristan District‚Äôs Mir Ali tehsil. The military <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912393/security-forces-falsely-implicated-in-north-waziristan-incident-ispr">clarified</a> that security forces were ‚Äúfalsely implicated‚Äù in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told <em>Dawn.com</em>: ‚ÄúTwo quadcopter incidents occurred in the district today. In the first quadcopter attack by militants, one woman was killed while three children were injured, including two of the woman‚Äôs children.‚Äù</p>
<p>The woman‚Äôs body and the injured people were taken to the hospital for medical assistance, he added.</p>
<p>DPO Kulachi said that another quadcopter attack occurred where terrorists attacked the Maryan police station, damaging the station‚Äôs solar panels on the rooftop.</p>
<p>He said, ‚ÄúThe police personnel remained safe in the attack,‚Äù adding that it was the third such militant attack on the same police station.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA search operation was underway in the area to track down the terrorists,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities recently, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Bannu has seen several militant attacks over the past several months.</p>
<p>On Saturday, one person was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922294/jirga-member-killed-3-injured-by-armed-suspects-firing-in-bannu-police">killed</a> and three others were injured after armed assailants attacked a jirga in the district.</p>
<p>In March, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895956">16 terrorists</a> were killed while five soldiers were martyred as security forces responded to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895785">terrorist attack</a> on the Bannu Cantonment.</p>
<p>The incident resulted in the deaths of 13 civilians and injured 32 others after ‚Äúsevere destruction‚Äù of a mosque and a residential building due to the suicide blasts, causing the perimeter wall to partially collapse.</p></p>

                <h2>Pakistan, Turkiye to establish Special Economic Zone for Turkish entrepreneurs in Karachi: Dar</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday said Pakistan and Turkiye were pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) for Turkish entrepreneurs in Karachi.</p>
<p>The announcement came as Dar and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who arrived in Islamabad earlier today on an official visit. Turkiye‚Äôs Minister of National Defence Yasar Guler is also visiting Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Turkiye enjoy strong bilateral ties built on shared cultural, religious and historical bonds, as well as mutual respect. In February, the twocountries pledged to boost bilateral trade to $5 billion as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891671">visited</a> Islamabad.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone dedicated to Turkish entrepreneurs at Karachi,‚Äù Dar said, as he addressed a press conference alongside Fidan.</p>

<p>A day ago, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs had <a class="link--external" href="https://www.mfa.gov.tr/no_-140_-sayin-bakanimizin-pakistan-i-ziyareti-hk.en.mfa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that Fidan, along with Guler, will visit Pakistan on July 9. Fidan also <a class="link--external" href="https://www.mfa.gov.tr/turkiye-pakistan-relations.en.mfa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paid a visit</a> to Islamabad in May last year.</p>
<p>Fidan arrived in the early hours of Wednesday to hold discussions on bilateral issues, the Foreign Office <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1942683653701521616" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDuring his official engagements in Pakistan, all important issues of mutual interest will be discussed,‚Äù the FO said. ‚ÄúThe visit reflects the close and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, rooted in shared history, culture, and mutual trust.‚Äù</p>
<p>It added that upon their arrival, the visiting dignitaries were received by Pakistan‚Äôs Additional Secretary for West Asia, Ambassador Syed Ali Asad Gillani.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922785">extended condolences</a> to Turkiye after 12 Turkish soldiers died of methane exposure in Iraq during a search mission in the Claw-Lock Operation zone a day earlier.</p>
<p>Last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met on the sidelines of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) summit in Khankendi, Azerbaijan, to reaffirm their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties.</p>
<p>The two leaders <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/turkiye/efforts-ongoing-to-deepen-turkiye-pakistan-cooperation-in-various-fields-turkish-president/3622179" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discussed</a> deepening cooperation in key areas, including trade, energy, defence, connectivity and investment. PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs unwavering commitment to working closely with Turkiye to promote peace, stability and sustainable development in the region.</p>
