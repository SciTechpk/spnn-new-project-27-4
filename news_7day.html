as Indian forces hunt assailants
ISLAMABAD / NEW DELHI: The country’s top security body will meet today (Thursday) to assess India’s sharp response — in the wake of a deadly attack in India-held Kashmir that claimed over two dozen lives — and formulate a comprehensive policy reaction to the slew of aggressive measures announced by New Delhi, which have ramped up tensions in the Subcontinent.
Among the Indian measures, the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty stood out as the most severe. The 1960 pact, brokered by the World Bank, has endured through wars and decades of hostility. Its suspension, therefore, marked a watershed moment in the already fraught relationship between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
India further lowered diplomatic ties by closing down the main border transit point, framing the attack as a grave provocation that warranted significant diplomatic, economic, and logistical pressure on Pakistan. Indian officials directly tied these measures to Islamabad’s alleged support for “cross-border terrorism”.
But Islamabad has denied any role and said it had nothing to do with the attack.
 
 

“Prime Minister Mohammad Shehbaz Sharif has convened the meeting of the National Security Committee on Thursday morning, 24th April 2025, to respond to the Indian Government’s statement of this evening,” Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar posted on X (formerly Twitter).
Appearing on a private television channel late on Wednesday, Dar lashed out at India’s approach, calling it “immature” and “hasty”.
“India has not given any evidence. They have not shown any maturity in their response,” Dar said. “This is a non-serious approach. They started creating hype immediately after the incident.”
Pakistan’s Foreign Office, in a separate statement earlier in the day, expressed regret over the loss of life.
“We are concerned at the loss of tourists’ lives in an attack in Anantnag district of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir. We extend our condolences to the near ones of the deceased and wish the injured a speedy recovery,” the statement said.
Diplomatic observers warn that the Indian response and Pakistan’s counter-messaging could push bilateral relations to new lows, further widening a rift that has persisted since the 2019 Pulwama-Balakot crisis. The treaty suspension, in particular, risks sparking long-term water disputes, while the downgrading of diplomatic ties could hinder any future de-escalation efforts.
Aggressive measures
The announcement of punitive measures came after Tuesday’s meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), chaired by Indian PM Narendra Modi.
“The CCS was briefed in detail on the terrorist attack on 22 April 2025 in Pahalgam, in which 25 Indians and one Nepali citizen were killed. A number of others sustained injuries. The CCS condemned the attack in the strongest terms and expressed its deepest condolences to the families of the victims and hoped for the early recovery of the injured,” Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told a press conference after the CCS meeting.
The statement said: “Recognising the seriousness of this terrorist attack, the CCS decided upon the following measures,” detailing how the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 will be held in abeyance “with immediate effect, until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.”
“The Integrated Check Post Attari will be closed with immediate effect. Those who have crossed over with valid endorsements may return through that route before May 1, 2025,” it said.
Additionally, Pakistani nationals will not be permitted to travel to India under the Saarc Visa Exemption Scheme. “Any SVES visas issued in the past to Pakistani nationals are deemed cancelled. Any Pakistani national currently in India under SVES visa has 48 hours to leave India.”
Furthermore, defence attaches and advisers at the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi had been declared ‘Persona Non Grata’ and given a week to leave India.
“India will be withdrawing its own Defence/Navy/Air Advisers from the Indian High Commission in Islamabad… The overall strength of the High Commissions will be brought down to 30 from the present 55 through further reductions,” Misri said.
The statement also said that security forces had been put on high alert. “As with the recent extradition of Tahawwur Rana, India will be unrelenting in the pursuit of those who have committed acts of terror, or conspired to make them possible,” the foreign ministry statement said.
‘Loud and clear’ response
Meanwhile, India’s defence minister vowed a swift response to those who carried out and planned the Pahalgam attack.
“Those responsible and behind such an act will very soon hear our response, loud and clear,” Rajnath Singh said in a speech in New Delhi, a day after gunmen killed 26 men at a tourist hotspot in the contested Himalayan region.
“We won’t just reach those people who carried out the attack. We will also reach out to those who planned this from behind the scenes on our land.” Singh did not identify those he believes are responsible for the killings, but said that “India’s government will take every step that may be necessary and appropriate”.
A hospital list verified by police recorded 26 men who were killed on Tuesday afternoon, when gunmen burst out of forests at a popular tourist spot in Pahalgam, and raked crowds of visitors with automatic weapons. All those killed were listed as residents of India, except one man from Nepal.
Meanwhile, an encounter was reportedly underway bet­ween Indian security forces and suspected militants in the Tan­gmarg area abutting Pah­algam, at the time of going to press.
In a separate incident in Baramulla on Wednesday, the army killed two people after a “heavy exchange of fire”, saying the gunmen were part of an “infiltration bid”, AFP reported.
World leaders express support “Strong expressions of support and solidarity have been received from many governments around the world,” Misri said.
US President Donald Trump was among the first to express solidarity with New Delhi. Following his lead, a whole host of US lawmakers and officials, including United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned the armed attack and extended his heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.
Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong said he was shocked by the attack in Pahalgam, while the leaders of France, Germany, the UK and the European Union also expressed their grief. The Israeli foreign ministry and the UAE foreign ministry also sent messages of solidarity with the government.
Analyst Michael Kugelman said the attack posed a “very serious risk of a new crisis between India and Pakistan, and probably the most serious risk of a crisis since the brief military conflict that happened in 2019”.

Published in Dawn, April 24th, 2025</p><small>2025-04-24 05:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/24103236f12171a.jpg?r=103947' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>What India’s Indus Waters Treaty suspension means for Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>India has just announced that it will no longer abide by the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, placing the agreement in “abeyance” until Pakistan, it claims, credibly and irrevocably renounces cross-border terrorism. This is a potentially historic moment.
For over 60 years, through wars, near-conflict, and complete diplomatic breakdowns, the treaty endured. Water, unlike so much else in the India-Pakistan relationship, had remained predictable. That predictability is now in question more than it has ever been.
The decision potentially marks a turning point in how the two countries manage the most essential shared resource between them. There will be many other discussions in the days ahead that dwell on geopolitics. The goal for this article is simpler: to understand the implications for Pakistan’s rivers, crops, people, and policymakers.
What matters most in the days and months ahead is not the threat of a sudden cutoff, but the erosion of reliability of a water system that millions depend on every single day.
How the treaty works
Before we get into what India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty might mean, it’s worth recalling what the treaty actually did. Signed in 1960 after years of negotiation, with the World Bank as broker, the Indus Waters Treaty has been one of the most durable transboundary water agreements in the world.
It divided the six rivers of the Indus Basin between the two countries. India received the three eastern rivers (the Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej). Pakistan received the three western rivers (the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab) which account for the majority (almost 80 per cent) of the shared basin’s water.
As part of the agreement, India retains the right to use the western rivers for non-consumptive purposes like hydropower, and for limited irrigation, but is not allowed to store or divert their flows in ways that harm downstream access. These constraints are deliberately specific and enforceable and include engineering design features and notification procedures. For Pakistan, this structure provides more than water. It provides the predictability needed to build an entire irrigation and water management system around.
 
 

The treaty also provides a standing mechanism for cooperation and conflict resolution. A Permanent Indus Commission exists, with one commissioner from each country, tasked with exchanging data, reviewing new projects, and meeting regularly.
Disagreements are resolved using a tiered process: technical questions go first to the commission, unresolved differences may be referred to a neutral expert, and legal disputes may be sent to an international Court of Arbitration, with the World Bank playing a role in both forums. This process has been used before to resolve disagreements over India’s Baglihar and Kishanganga dams — it is designed to prevent unilateral action. The treaty has no expiry date, and it includes no provision for suspension. Article XII makes clear that it can only be modified by mutual agreement. That has never happened.
The hydrologic reality
One common question that arises in moments like this is whether India can simply “stop the flow” of water into Pakistan. In the immediate term, the short answer is no. Certainly not at the scale that would make a meaningful dent in flows during the high flow season.
The Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab are enormous rivers. Between May and September, as snow melts, these rivers carry tens of billions of cubic meters of water. India has some upstream infrastructure on these rivers, including the Baglihar and Kishanganga dams, but none of it is designed to hold back these kinds of volumes. These are run-of-the-river hydropower projects with very limited live storage. Even if India were to coordinate releases across all its existing dams, all it may be able to do is slightly shift the timing of flows.
The overall volumes in the western rivers during this high-flow period are far too large to meaningfully disrupt without flooding its own upstream regions. India already utilises most of the flow from the eastern rivers allocated to it under the treaty, so any new actions on those rivers would have a more limited downstream impact.
A more pressing concern is what happens in the dry season when the flows across the basin are lower, storage matters more, and timing becomes more critical. That is where the absence of treaty constraints could start to be felt more acutely.
Over the medium to longer term, the picture becomes more complicated. If India chooses to act outside the treaty framework, it opens the door to developing new infrastructure that would give it greater control over the timing and volume of flows into Pakistan. But even then, the path is far from straightforward. Any large-scale dam or diversion project would take years to build. The sites available in Indian-occupied Kashmir for significant water storage are limited and geologically challenging. The financial cost would be enormous. And the political risk would be even greater.
Pakistan has long said that any attempt by India to construct major new storage on the western rivers would be viewed as an act of war. In today’s age of satellites, these structures would not be invisible. They would be contested politically and possibly militarily.
There are also hydrological constraints. Holding back high flows on rivers like the Chenab or Jhelum risks flooding upstream regions in India itself. And the idea of diverting water out of the Indus Basin entirely, into other parts of India would require enormous infrastructure and energy costs that would be hard to justify, even in peacetime.
 
 

Beyond the basin, there are reputational and strategic risks. India is itself a downstream riparian on the Brahmaputra and other rivers that originate in China. This (often overlooked) reality has historically shaped India’s approach to respecting downstream rights. By suspending the treaty and acting unilaterally, it sets a precedent that could one day be used against it. This is not a cost-free move and could complicate its efforts to frame itself as a reliable partner in other international negotiations.
Possible Implications for Pakistan
While the physical and political limits on disruptions by India are real, the erosion of treaty protections still matters. This is not because water will stop tomorrow, but because the system it supports was never built for uncertainty. The flows of the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab are the backbone of our agriculture, our cities, our energy system. At this moment, we simply do not have a substitute for these waters.
For Pakistan, the impact of India’s disruption (if manifested) could be far-reaching. Pakistan’s irrigation system is one of the largest in the world, and it depends almost entirely on the predictable timing of flows from the western rivers. Farmers plan their sowing around those flows. Canal schedules are designed based on assumptions that have held for decades. If that rhythm is even slightly disrupted, the water system will begin to fray.
 
 

The most immediate risk is to predictability. Even if the total volume of water coming into Pakistan does not change immediately, small changes in when that water arrives can cause real problems. A late-season delay during the wheat planting cycle, or an unexpected dip in flow during the dry winter months, can mean missed sowing windows, lower yields, and higher costs. The Indus Delta is already shrinking due to reduced freshwater outflows. Further uncertainty in upstream flows could accelerate that degradation, with consequences for coastal livelihoods and fisheries.
Any shortfall or shift in river timing will force the state to make hard choices about water allocation. This risks intensifying inter-provincial tensions, especially between Punjab and Sindh, where water-sharing debates are already politically charged.
Then there’s energy. A third of Pakistan’s electricity comes from hydropower, generated by water flowing through Tarbela, Mangla, and other reservoirs. If upstream flows are reduced or poorly timed, it could cut into generation capacity. None of this is speculative. Pakistan is already a water-scarce country, living close to the edge. A system that has long been run on thin margins now faces a new layer of uncertainty.
Historical context
This week’s announcement did not come out of nowhere. While the Indus Waters Treaty has long been praised for its durability, the last decade tells a story of mounting strain.
In 2013, a Court of Arbitration ruled in Pakistan’s favour by requiring India to release minimum environmental flows downstream of the Kishanganga project (upstream on Jhelum), and reinforced limits on reservoir drawdown. This successful resolution was a continuation of the treaty’s ability to manage complex engineering disagreements.
But that pattern began to shift after the 2016 Uri attack. India suspended routine cooperation, began fast-tracking dam projects it had long delayed, and started linking water to broader security narratives. Even then, India said it would work “within the pact.”
 


That too began to change in 2023, when India formally invoked Article XII(3) (the provision that allows for treaty modification only by mutual consent) and requested renegotiation, citing climate change, national development needs, and Pakistani obstruction. Pakistan refused to renegotiate.
In the months that followed, both countries doubled down on competing legal strategies. India pursued a neutral expert to review technical dam design questions; Pakistan pushed ahead with a Court of Arbitration. By early 2025, both mechanisms were active in parallel; this is something the treaty never envisioned.
This most recent announcement that India would “suspend” its obligations under the treaty marks the culmination of a long, escalating trajectory. For the first time since 1960, one country has effectively stepped outside the treaty’s procedural and cooperative framework. Whether this is a negotiating tactic or a permanent break remains to be seen. What comes next will test not just bilateral diplomacy, but the resilience of Pakistan’s water system in a world where guarantees no longer hold.
The Indus Waters Treaty is not perfect. But it does something few agreements between adversaries manage to do. It keeps the rivers flowing and gives both countries a reason to keep talking, even when everything else has broken down. That framework is now under strain. Whether the treaty is reinstated in full, renegotiated, or left to fade in practice, what follows will be harder.
Without clear rules, even small projects can provoke mistrust. Every monsoon, every reservoir, every dry spell becomes a potential source of tension. At a time when climate change is already intensifying droughts and floods, and when both countries face rising domestic water stress, the last thing the region needs is another layer of uncertainty. Yet that is where we now find ourselves.
The western rivers are not just shared rivers. They are Pakistan’s primary source of water. In the long run, there may be reforms or alternatives. But in the here and now, there is no substitute. These rivers sustain lives, livelihoods, and landscapes across the country. Pakistan can simply not afford to let it become collateral in a political fight. Thus, the flows must continue. Not out of goodwill, but because the consequences of stopping them are too great for either country to bear.
The Indus and its tributaries that have sustained civilisations for thousands of years, now test the capacity of two modern nuclear-armed nations to cooperate. The coming months and years will reveal whether wiser heads prevail, or if the subcontinent will enter a new, uncertain era of unilateralism on its most precious resource: water.</p><small>2025-04-24 05:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/24102542c840aea.jpg?r=102552' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906139/infant-dies-seven-hurt-as-water-tanker-hits-van-in-karachis-gulshan-i-hadeed' target='_blank'><strong>Infant dies, seven hurt as water tanker hits van in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Hadeed</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: An infant boy was killed while seven others, including six women, were injured when a water tanker hit a van in Gulshan-i-Hadeed on Wednesday evening, police and rescue services officials said.
Steel Town SHO Alan Khan Abbasi told Dawn that the heavy vehicle hit the van near Aljannat marriage hall.
The killed child was identified as one-and-a-half-year-old Sahil Naeem. The injured were Asif Barkat, 30, Bakhtawar Faisal, 17, Erum, 26, Aziza Ghazi Khan, 50, Kamala Husain, 50, Sakeena Naeem, 35, and Naeema, 22.
The officer said that the accident occurred apparently due to speeding. However, the police were further investigating the case.
 
 

The SHO claimed that the driver responsible for the incident was arrested and the tanker seized.
The body and injured were shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre.
Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that the condition of two women was critical as they had sustained serious injuries.
Meanwhile, police on Wednesday claimed to have arrested a man and his daughter for their alleged involvement in a robbery case.
Central SSP Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi said the New Karachi police arrested a suspect who used his daughter to snatch a motorcycle at gunpoint. He added that they were arrested with the help of CCTV footage.
The suspect was identified as Bilal Siraj and his daughter as Shumaila.

Some hints to watch for</strong></a><br><p>VATICAN CITY: No one knows who the world’s Catholic cardinals will choose to succeed Pope Francis as the new leader of the global Catholic Church. But for those watching attentively, there are sometimes hints about who might emerge as the next pontiff.
The process to choose a new pope is long and secretive. Most of the world’s 252 cardinals are coming to Rome to take part. Those under the age of 80, about 135 prelates, are preparing to enter into a conclave to elect the next pontiff.
Once it starts, which by Church law should be no earlier than May 6, the cardinals will be completely shut off from the modern world until a new pope is named.
In the meantime, they can attend public events and give interviews about what they are looking for in the next leader of the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics.

Vatican declares nine days of mourning

“Reading the pre-conclave signs to identify papal candidates is tricky, because the signs are usually very subtle,” said John Thavis, a Vatican correspondent who covered three papacies.
Pope Francis died on Monday aged 88. There is no clear frontrunner to succeed him.
As the pope was recovering from pneumonia over the Easter weekend, he asked retired cardinals over the age of 80 to preside in his place at the Vatican’s various celebrations of the holiday, possibly because he did not want to signal any favourite successor.
The pope’s funeral, on Saturday, April 26, will be the first big moment to watch for signs of who might be next.
Tens of thousands, including dozens of world leaders such as US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, are expected in St. Peter’s Square for the ceremony. Millions more will be watching across the globe.
The cardinals attending will listen closely to the sermon given by Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the ceremonial leader of the College of Cardinals and a retired Vatican official.
At the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005, the sermon was delivered by German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who offered what many thought was a stirring elocution on the late pope’s life and legacy. Eleven days later, Ratzinger would be elected as Pope Benedict XVI.
Re is 91 years old, cannot enter the conclave and is not a papal contender. But insiders expect he might still try to offer a guide for his confreres to follow in the way he chooses to describe Pope Francis’ papacy, or in any words he uses to describe the needs of the Catholic Church today.
Hints emerging slowly
The papal funeral marks the first of nine days of mourning for the global Church. Another Mass of mourning will be held in St. Peter’s Square on Sunday. That will be led by Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin, often cited as a leading papal contender.
“The cliche is he who enters the conclave a pope leaves a cardinal,” said Christopher Bellitto, an historian at Kean University in New Jersey who specialises on the Church.  “Only prophets know what is going to happen.”  Other hints for possible successors to Pope Francis will likely come out more slowly.
In 2013, as the cardinals gathered in Rome after Benedict’s surprise resignation, some of the US prelates preparing to take part in the conclave started giving press conferences. The wider group of the world’s cardinals later asked them to stop doing the briefings.
Even if there are no press conferences this time, cardinals spending time in Rome often celebrate Masses at churches across the city. The sermons they offer on those occasions could give indications of what they are thinking.
“Any signs will come in bits and pieces, or phrases used to describe what cardinals are looking for in the next pope,” said Thavis.
“Words like ‘openness’ and ‘reform’ may fit certain cardinals, while ‘administrative skills’ and ‘solid theology’ may describe others,” he said.
Behind closed doors
The biggest hints will come in the daily meetings the cardinals have in the week leading up to the conclave. In these meetings, known as  “general congregations”, the cardinals have an opportunity to speak freely and even, perhaps, to offer a vision for a future papacy under their own leadership.
In 2013, Argentine Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio offered a short reflection at one of those meetings. He said the Church, beset by sexual abuse and financial scandals, had become  “sick” and too  “self-referential”, according to a text that was later published. He said the Church needed to do a better job of trying to open itself up to the modern world. A few days later, Bergoglio would be elected as Pope Francis.
Nine days of mourning
The Vatican on Wednesday announced that nine days of mourning for Pope Francis will start on Saturday, the day of his funeral.
There will be prayer events every day at St Peter’s Basilica for the so-called  “novemdiales”, which will last until May 4. The announcement came as Catholic cardinals met to discuss the next steps following the death of the Argentine pontiff on Monday aged 88.
No date has yet been set for the conclave, the secret meeting of cardinals aged under 80 to elect a new pope. But it has to take place between 15 and 20 days after the pontiff’s death.

A Nov 27 ceasefire sought to end more than a year of hostilities between the two sides that began with Iran-backed Hezbollah’s cross-border fire at Israel in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas.
More than 4,000 people were killed in Lebanon, most of them during two months of all-out war that erupted in September, according to Lebanese authorities.
Among the dead were hundreds of Hezbollah fighters and a slew of senior commanders. HRW said “two unlawful Israeli strikes” on the town of Yunin in the eastern Bekaa Valley that killed more than 30 people “were apparent indiscriminate attacks on civilians”.
“At least one of the attacks used an air-dropped bomb equipped with a United States-produced Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) guidance kit,” it said. “The attacks should be investigated as war crimes.”
On Sept 25, a strike “killed a family of 23 people, all Syrians, including 13 children”, HRW said, while another on Nov 1 on a two-storey house “killed 10 people, including two children, one of them a year old”. HRW said it “did not find any evidence of military activity or targets at either site” and that the Israeli army did not issue evacuation warnings ahead of the strikes. The rights watchdog said it had contacted the Israeli military about its findings but had “not received a response”. Agency has also contacted the military for comment on the report.
HRW’s Ramzi Kaiss said in the statement that “more and more evidence is emerging that Israeli forces repeatedly failed to protect civilians or adequately distinguish civilians from military targets during its strikes across Lebanon”.
Washington’s supply of weapons to Israel “has made the US complicit in their unlawful use”, HRW added. It urged the Lebanese government to give “the International Criminal Court jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute crimes” and provide “a path for justice for grieving families”.

“Widows, like all citizens, are entitled to employment, dignity, equality, and autonomy without discrimination or reprisal,” observed Acting Chief Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah while heading a two-judge SC bench that had taken up an appeal by the chief commissioner of Regional Tax Office, Bahawalpur, against the Dec 21, 2022 judgement issued by the Lahore High Court’s Bahawalpur bench.
Petitioner Shaheen Yousaf’s husband, who was an employee of the Income Tax Department, had passed away while in service on Feb 14, 2006. Under the Prime Minister’s Assistance Package for the Families of Deceased Government Employees, the widow was appointed as a lower division clerk (LDC) on a two-year contract on May 26, 2010.
The contract was extended multiple times, but on January 4, 2016, her servi­ces were terminated via an office memorandum (OM) dated December 15, 2015. The memorandum stated that upon rema­r­riage, a widow becomes ineligible for co­m­passionate employment under the PM’s assistance package and is, therefore, to be terminated from the date of remarriage.

Justice Shah observes widows, like all citizens, deserve equal rights to jobs, dignity, non-discrimination

The widow challenged the OM the LHC, which disposed of the matter with a directive for the member (administration), Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), to treat it as a representation and address her grievances through a speaking order.
 
 

In compliance with the court’s directive, the FBR reviewed the matter and rejected her representation on May 11, 2017. The respondent then filed a second writ petition in the LHC, challenging the departmental order. The petition was allowed on Dec 21, 2022, and the widow was reinstated in service.
In a five-page order, ACJ Mansoor Ali Shah observed that any policy that makes public employment contingent upon a woman’s marital status not only entrenches dependency but also effectively penalises her for exercising a fundamental liberty. The law must serve as a shield against exclusion, not a tool for reinforcing outdated social hierarchies, he emphasised, adding that it was critical to consider the social context in which such executive decisions operate.
“Widowhood, in its simplest sense, refers to the status of a woman whose spouse has died. However, in many societies it carries a layered social identity often accompanied by stigma, isolation, and a diminished sense of social worth. Widows are too often viewed through the prism of loss and dependence, rather than as individuals with agency and resilience,” Justice Shah regretted, adding that this perception restricts their choices, particularly when it comes to remarriage or economic independence.
“The law must reject these harmful cultural narratives and affirm that widowhood is not a diminution of identity but a life circumstance deserving of dignity, protection, and equal opportunity. It is incumbent upon courts to ensure that public policy reflects this understanding and shields widows from both overt and covert forms of systemic discrimination,” the ACJ emphasised.
The judgement declared the OM manifestly discriminatory as it singles out widows, the female spouses of deceased government employees for disqualification from compassionate employment upon remarriage, without imposing a corresponding restriction on widowers, notwithstanding the assistance package which offers compassionate employment to both a widow and a widower.

Moscow has taken steps to normalise relations with the Taliban administration since the group seized power in Afghanistan in 2021 after the withdrawal of US troops. The Russian foreign ministry said Russian officials had held talks with Afghanistan’s foreign and internal ministers.
“The representatives of the Afghan leadership were informed that, following the decision announced by the Supreme Court of Russia to suspend the ban on the Taliban movement, the Russian side has decided to upgrade the diplomatic mission of Afghanistan in Moscow to the level of ambassador,” it said in a statement. It added the Afghan side  “expressed their deep gratitude for this step”. Russia sees a potential economic partner in the Taliban authorities, who praised Moscow for scrapping the  “terrorism” label last week.
Taliban officials have visited Russia for high-profile events in recent years. Russia’s decision to suspend the ban on the group does not equal a formal recognition for the Taliban authorities, which are seeking international legitimacy.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that  “the new authorities in Kabul are a reality”. “We need to take this into account in order to carry out pragmatic, not ideologised policy,” the minister told journalists. The Afghan government is not officially recognised by any country or world body and the United Nations refers to the administration as the  “Taliban de facto authorities”.

• Appeals of five militants sentenced to death by military court in 2016 still pending before high court over jurisdiction issue
KARACHI: Ten years after the murder of prominent social activist Sabeen Mahmud, there seems to be little hope for justice as her family has shifted focus towards carrying forward her legacy instead of seeking accountability.
On April 24, 2015, Sabeen Mahmud was shot dead in a targeted attack as she left The Second Floor (T2F), a literary and cultural space she had founded, after hosting a seminar on the disappearance of political activists in Balochistan.
The Counter-Terrorism Department had arrested five militants after a couple of weeks to the murder and in 2016, a military court handed down death sentence to them. However, even after nine years, the military court’s verdict is yet to be implemented.
Mahenaz Mahmud, mother of the slain activist who accompanied her daughter on the fateful day and suffered bullet wounds, told Dawn when the attack took place, several rights activists and senior lawyers visited her and urged her to pursue the case.
“I asked them, will my efforts fix the justice system of this country? If the answer is yes, I am ready to dedicate 10 to 20 years of my life to it. I want justice for Pakistan, not just for Sabeen,” she said.
She recalled being told that pursuing the case would bring her closure, but she questioned, “Can any mother truly find closure in her lifetime?”
“I felt it was better to devote these years to serving people instead. I have been working on mental health, parenting, and have also worked with women prisoners, conducting sessions where many of them promised me they would show more love and understanding towards the emotions of their own and other prisoners’ children,” she added.
Remembering her bond with her daughter, 74-year-old Mahenaz said it was more like a friendship, adding that Sabeen was a bright young woman whose value system was rooted in honesty and justice.
 
 

She dedicated much of her 40 years to working on social issues, and during that time, she would often receive threats, her mother said.
Talking about that fateful day, she recalled: “I hadn’t been to T2F for some time, but that day I felt a strange unease, as if I must go.” Mahenaz, who was in the car when the attack took place, said as their vehicle stopped at a traffic signal near Defence Library, a man got off a motorbike and approached their vehicle driven by Sabeen.
“At first, I thought they intended to mug us,” she said. “But moments later, the shooter pulled out a weapon and fired five shots,” she added.
Sabeen suffered multiple bullet wounds and died on way to the hospital. Her mother also suffered a single bullet wound.
Five months later, Constable Ghulam Abbas, a key witness in the murder case, was gunned down in the Korangi area.
‘Killed for being a liberal voice’
CTD official Raja Umar Khattab, who arrested the killers and interrogated them, told Dawn that the militant group held extremist views, while Sabeen was a liberal voice.
He said that the held militants were involved in several terrorist activities, including Safoora bus carnage, attack on an American educationist as well as Bohra community, and they selected their targets to send a broader message to a specific community.
“Sabeen’s assassination aimed at sending a warning to all NGOs,” he said.
Quoting their statements, the CTD official said that the militants told him that they targeted Sabeen because she had organised a Valentine’s Day rally and had once delivered a speech in front of a poster belonging to a religio-political party.
Convicts’ pleas pending adjudication at SHC for years
Following 21st Amendment to the Constitution, the five militants were tried by a special military tribunal that handed down death sentence to them in 2016.
However, they filed appeals in the military court in Rawalpindi and then approached the Lahore High Court which declined to hear the matter due to lack of jurisdiction, according to their counsel Hashmat Habib.
He told Dawn when the Supreme Court was approached, it too refused to entertain the matter. Later, five identical constitutional petitions were moved before the Sindh High Court, which are still pending adjudication on the matter of jurisdiction, he added.
Speaking about an inordinate delay in deciding the petitions, the senior counsel said the petitions remained pending in the SHC as the Supreme Court was hearing an identical case. “The outcome of that case will determine the jurisdiction of appeal,” he explained.

Blood and water can’t flow together,“ declared a belligerent Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 26, 2016 in the wake of 19 Indian soldiers dying in a militant attack on Uri military base, just inside Indian-administered Kashmir. Holding Pakistan responsible for the violence, Modi promised to unshackle India’s policy of “restraint” — implying that India was now going to hurt Pakistan by choking its water supply.
For the people of Pakistan, a nation dependent upon agriculture for its survival, the Indus rivers are their lifeline. As it is, Pakistan is ranked second, after China, in the Water Shortage Index, highlighting the vulnerability of the Pakistani population to frequent water shortages. Modi’s proclamation generated lots of nationalistic hyperbole in the two nuclear-armed twins but also inflicted some damage: many on this side of the border are perturbed about Modi making good on his threat and stopping water supply to Pakistan.
Can Modi turn the taps off immediately?
 



Can Modi turn off the taps and choke Pakistan’s rivers?

Not quite.
The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, which governs water sharing arrangements between India and Pakistan, outlines a framework for how either country can exploit water potential and how they can’t. While the Indus Waters Treaty is upheld, India cannot turn the taps off — in fact, it does not have the capacity at the moment to do so either — but it can definitely delay the release of water flows.  And historically, India hasn’t been averse to using this tactic when relations with Pakistan turn sour. This time has been no different.

In a story printed in the October 12 edition of Dawn, irrigation department officials warned of a record reduction of water levels at Head Marala in the Chenab. The fear is that water shortage in the river and two of its canals, Marala-Ravi Link Canal and Upper Chenab Canal, can adversely affect the sowing of crops particularly in Sialkot, Gujrat, Gujranwala and Sheikhupura districts. The situation has worsened at the time of this report going into print.
The cultivation cycle in the subcontinent is divided into two seasons: khareef (monsoon) and rabi (winter). Khareef sowing starts in July or even June while the sowing of rabi crops begins in September and October, depending upon glacial melts and the amount of rains. The water flows in the Indus system varies exponentially in different months. Up to 90 per cent of flows can be accounted for during July to September.
For rabi crops such as wheat, pulses, onions, tomatoes and potatoes, timing is crucial. With October at an end, the record reduction of Chenab water flows can translate into delayed rabi sowing, which in turn will adversely impact produce for local consumption in the coming season and lead to price inflation.
In practical terms, consider this: tomatoes are being sold in the market at 25 rupees per kilo today; expect this price to rise manifold in the coming year. This is besides the food and income insecurity that thousands of growers in Punjab and Sindh will be pushed into.
A crisis is certainly brewing.
Beyond hyperbole and nationalistic fervour, the two South Asian giants need to be at the negotiating table. Normally a dispute like the one reported by Dawn on October 12 could have been resolved at a meeting of the Indus water commissioners, mandated by the Indus Waters Treaty to be held once a year. But the Indian assertion that these meetings will resume only once “an atmosphere free of terror is established” spells disaster for our farmers. The only safeguard that the Indus Waters Treaty offered Pakistan was through the Permanent Indus Commission whose meetings India has been routinely flouting under one pretext or the other. If the situation persists, Pakistan will have no option but to take the matter through the cumbersome route of World Bank and international arbitration. All through this period, India will enjoy undue exploitation of water resources at the expense of the people of Pakistan.

What can India not do?

Caught in nationalistic fervour, hawks in the Indian media have been blaming their previous governments for failing to exercise a water offensive like the one PM Modi is intent on implementing.
Indeed, India can hypothetically terminate the Indus Waters Treaty and restrict even the rivers flowing into Pakistan through the diversion of Indus rivers waters.  But when it comes to practice, this position remains untenable.
The waters of the Indus rivers flow through deep gorges of the Karakoram and Himalayan mountains. The only way to divert water from here is to tunnel through hundreds of kilometres of the world’s highest and toughest mountains.
Granted that all technical problems have technical solutions. However such an undertaking would be financially prohibitive, technically extremely challenging, and with minimal cost-benefit ratios. The longest tunnel dug in the world is the Gotthard Base Tunnel to facilitate rail travel. Although it is being drilled for the last 22 years through the Swiss Alps, it is merely 57 kilometres long and has already incurred an estimated cost of 12 billion US dollars. For India to divert waters of the western Indus basin rivers for meaningful use, it will have to dig up to 300 kilometres of tunnels.

As such, diverting the water going into western rivers which feed Pakistan is not a feasible option.
In addition, India has remained part of the Non-Aligned Movement and prides itself in having contributed towards drafting many international conventions including the UN Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses 1997, Helsinki Rules 1966 and their Berlin Revisions of 2004. Politically, an attempt to scrap the Indus Waters Treaty would bring massive international condemnation to India.

India’s planned infrastructure projects: How can they affect Pakistan?

While India may not have the capacity to turn off the taps immediately or divert the waters of the rivers flowing into Pakistan, it is undertaking a number of projects that could have an adverse impact on Pakistan’s water availability in the future.
The Indus Waters Treaty handed Pakistan the right to unrestricted use of the three western rivers — Indus, Chenab and Jhelum. The eastern rivers — Sutlej, Beas and Ravi — went to India. While the treaty allowed India to divert the waters of the eastern rivers, it could only tap into 3.6 MAF of water from the western rivers for irrigation, transport and power generation.
Experts at the Indus River System Authority (IRSA) complain that India has been constructing huge water storages on all six Indus basin rivers, not just on the three under its full control. For example, Baglihar and Salal on Chenab are already generating 450 MW/h and 690 MW/h respectively while the planned Bursar and Pakal hydroelectric projects also on the Chenab will produce 1020MW and 1000 MW/h respectively. The size of the energy outputs is an indication of the size of the projects. Pakistan’s Mangla, for comparison, generates 1000MW/h.
In all, India is in different phases of planning or construction of some 60 storages of varying capacity over the six Indus rivers, though analysis of satellite imagery obtained by Dawn suggests the number may be more [see map]. Technical experts in Pakistan worry that such storages will provide India ultimate strategic leverage of increasing or decreasing river flows during tensions between the two countries, even if it cannot legally divert the waters for its own use.
Sheraz Memon, additional commissioner of the Indus Water Commission, argues that India does not have sufficient capacity to withhold the water of the western rivers nor it can divert them. “But they may keep the implementation of the treaty at a snail’s pace, for example through delaying the meetings of the Permanent Indus Commission and not providing data or information about their new hydroelectric plants,” he warns.
There is also talk of expediting the construction of the Pakal Dul, Sawalkot, and Bursar dams, also in Jammu and Kashmir. Indian media reports claim that the Indian government might also resume work on the Tulbul Navigational Project — also known as Wullar Barrage — work on which began in 1985 but stopped soon after Pakistan lodged a formal complaint against its construction. Pakistan opposed the project at the time since it would have allowed India to store, control and divert River Jhelum, which was a clear violation of the Indus Waters Treaty. If completed, Tulbul will adversely affect the water storage potential of Mangla Dam.

Original sins

During 1956, Pakistani negotiators were warned by their irrigation officials and technical experts not to accede to Indian delegation chief ND Gulhati’s demand — also supported by the World Bank — to allow India to build small storages over the western rivers.
Until the signing of the treaty, the Indian predicament was that while Customary International Law and conventions gave them a legitimate right over 33 MAF or 21 percent of the six Indus rivers water — corresponding to 21 per cent of the Indus basin being in Indian territory — India had little room to utilise this water within the basin. The Indus Waters Treaty gave them an opportunity to divert water towards Rajasthan for irrigating over 700,000 acres of land which was previously bare sand dunes.
Explore: Historical follies – Where Pakistan went wrong in negotiating the Indus Waters Treaty
Before the Treaty, the waters of the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej were utilised for the cultivation of lands as far south as Bahawalpur State. Suddenly there was no water for thousands of farmers on this side of the border until Tarbela Dam was finally opened in 1976.
But Pakistani negotiators at the time acquiesced, on the pretext that this shared water would also benefit their Muslim brethren in Kashmir. Pakistani negotiators did not even bother to specify the size of the so-called small storages but agreed to India officially withdrawing up to 3.6 MAF of water for local use. In comparison, the current storage capacity of Mangla Dam, after expansion, is about 7.4 MAF.
Given the pliancy of Pakistani negotiators at the time, the Indus Waters Treaty emerged as a treatise that was skewed in favour of India. Perhaps it is for this reason that PM Modi announced that while India will not review or abrogate the Indus Waters Treaty, it will exploit water under its share to the fullest. It will, for example, build more run-of-the-river hydropower projects on the western rivers and irrigate over 400,000 acres in Jammu and Kashmir.
One thing seems certain: India will continue to build additional storages on the Indus rivers to store more than its allowed quota of up to 3.6 MAF of water. This will also provide hawks the option of delaying khareef crops in Pakistan from time to time. If the winters’ torment is harsh, delay in summers sowing would be a national crisis.

Looking within: What Pakistan needs to do

There is a real danger that current Indian antics will push Pakistan towards construction of very large dams at Diamer and Kalabagh, displacing more people and adversely impacting our environment which is already in a poor state.
 






“India is employing pressure tactics on Pakistan by announcing it will speed up dam construction,” argues Dr Pervaiz Amir, director of the Pakistan Water Partnership. “Pakistan must address its own internal water security and create sufficient storage. India has 200 projects in hand. Saving water is a planned response by India, and Pakistan should follow suit.”
But increasing storage capacity is not the same as storage capacity from large dams, which in any case is not the panacea that it is made out to be.
During the last 69 years, Pakistan has developed three major water storages at Tarbela, Mangla and Chashma with a cumulative storage capacity of 12.1 MAF against average water flows of 133 MAF annually through the three Indus rivers. There have been little or no independent studies to either assess or address the issues of resettlement, the massive loss to the environment and overall economic cost due to construction of large dams. In addition, issues of climate change —which have only recently come to the fore — raise questions about the risks posed to and by large dams. Freak weather conditions, such as unusually intense cloudbursts, are becoming more common and have already resulted in threats to people living downstream of large dams.
To add insult to injury, we have been ruthlessly pumping out underground water through tubewells. Such pumping is severely affecting the underground water levels in the country and often being replaced by saline water, adversely affecting agricultural output. The number of tubewells in Pakistan has risen from 2,400 to over 600,000 since 1960.
While we could continue to curse the World Bank bureaucracy, American interests in the region and Indian cunning for having deprived the country of its water share, we must also look at our own wasteful attitudes towards utilisation of available water resources as well as the politics around available water.
Pakistan loses almost half of its existing available water through seepage in the irrigation system [see table]. This is a prime cause of waterlogging and salinity which are turning large areas of fertile land barren. Surely lining of water canals and water courses should be the first priority in saving the water we have at our disposal, rather than the construction of large dams.
 


According to WAPDA’s published figures, average cereal production in Pakistan against a metre cube of water is mere 0.13 kg. In India, the same amount of water yields 0.39 kg, yield in China is estimated at 0.82 kg, in the US 1.56 kg and in Canada 8.2 kg [see table]. Clearly better management of water resources, efficient crop yields and serious efforts towards population control will be much more advantageous than building additional dams and storages that will ultimately result in catastrophic environmental issues and human resettlement crises as being faced in India and China.
The issue of water supply does not simply concern the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Tahir Rasheed, CEO of the South Punjab Forest Company (SPFC) and a senior environmentalist, warns that if the Indo-Pak water crisis spirals out of control, the friction can engulf other countries of the region as well, especially Afghanistan.

“Afghanistan is [currently] utilising 1.8 MAF of water [from the Kabul River which feeds into the Indus], which is estimated to rise to 3.6 MAF in the future,” says Rasheed. “Pakistan currently does not have any water sharing accord with its northwestern neighbor. But the projected increase of water use by Afghanistan can affect the lower riparian, Pakistan.”

In conclusion

The Indus Waters Commissioners of Pakistan and India have met every year since the Indus Waters Treaty came into force. The wars of 1965 and 1971, the Siachen and Kargil conflicts and the Mumbai attacks weren’t able to dent it. In standing the test of time, the treaty has shown that it generates the least conflict and more cooperation between the South Asian neighbours.
 


The chances of India scrapping the treaty altogether and diverting the western rivers are negligible to none.  But one must not put past India its flouting the spirit of the treaty and manipulating water flows to turn the screws on Pakistan.
Pakistan’s response, however, should not be as cavalier as when it negotiated the treaty, ignoring sound technical advice and short-changing itself in the bargain. It needs to put its own house in order on an urgent basis — by better utilising its existing water resources. Pakistan’s protestations against India’s perfidy will then carry far more weight.

Pakistan Kisan Ittehad president says the situation is no different in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as the provincial governments were also not procuring wheat from farmers during the ongoing harvesting season.—PPI

• Accuse provincial rulers of ruining agriculture, reject incentive package
• Ministers highlight initiatives to support farmers
LAHORE: The agricultural sector in Punjab has become a battle­ground for conflict­ing narratives, with farmers expressing deep distress while the pro­vincial government touts its efforts to support them.
Khalid Khokhar, President of the Pakistan Kisan Ittehad, held a press conference in Lahore, vehemently criticising the government’s handling of the agricultural crisis. “The throat of farmers and cultivators has been strangled,” he declared, emphasising the farmers’ love for their country and questioning their ability to meet basic needs like their children’s education.
He announced a protest measure, stating, “Next year we will cultivate less wheat in protest,” and rejecting the Punjab government’s aid package, asserted, “We do not want the package, you have ruined agriculture.”
 
 

Mr Khokhar also urged political parties to refrain from politicising the wheat issue, lamenting the lack of focus on national interests within the assemblies.
He regretted that while the PPP and PTI were criticising the PMLN government in Punjab, the situation was no different in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the PPP and PTI were in power, and the provincial governments, too, were not procuring wheat from the farmers during the ongoing harvesting season.
In a counter-response, Punjab Minister for Agriculture and Livestock Syed Ashiq Hussain Kirmani, alongside Information Minister Azma Bukhari, addressed a press conference. Mr Kirmani defended the government’s actions, stating, “Politics is being played in the name of wheat,” but insisted that the government is committed to supporting farmers.
He criticised the opposition, questioning their record in provinces where they hold power and highlighting Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s personal involve­ment in monitoring the wheat market in Punjab.
Mr Kirmani detailed the government’s initiatives, including a record budget allocation for farmers, substantial subsidies on fertilisers, seeds, and tractors, and the disbursement of Rs52 billion in interest-free agricultural loans through the “Kissan Card.”
He highlighted the increased urea usage and a record wheat sowing as evidence of the government’s success. He also criticised the previous government, referring to it as “Waseem Akram Plus,” for neglecting the farmers’ welfare.
A key focus of the government’s strategy is empowering the private sector, Mr Kirmani said, announcing Rs110bn in interest-free loans to the private sector and flour mills, mandating them to purchase 25pc of the wheat stock.
He also highlighted the implementation of Electronic Warehouse Receipts (EWR), enabling farmers to store wheat for up to four months and access immediate cash through bank loans using warehouse receipts.
The Punjab cabinet has further solidified its commitment by approving an amendment to the Food Grains Licensing Control Order 1957, mandating 25pc wheat procurement by flour mills, with the threat of license cancellation for non-compliance.
The cabinet also approved the implement­ation of EWR, with the government bearing storage costs, to provide farmers with greater flexibility and financial security.
Minister Kirmani concluded by stating that wheat procurement will commence from all locations to help stabilise prices and ensure farmers receive their due compensation.

ISLAMABAD / MUZAFFARABAD: As the Indian government severed diplomatic and other links with Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan’s mainstream political parties on Wednesday branded the attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir a “false flag operation” desig­ned to malign Islamabad internationally.
They also believed that India’s aggression and illegal occupation of Kashmir had resulted in the Pahalgam attack.
The armed attack on tourists in the Pahalgam town left 26 people dead. The incident occurred amid a high-level visit by US Vice President J.D. Vance to India.
Senator Irfan Siddiqui, parliamentary leader of the PML-N in the Senate, termed the incident a “well-planned conspiracy” aimed at defaming Pakistan.
Speaking to the media, he said India had a history of staging such incidents whenever a foreign dignitary visits the country. “The Pahalgam drama was orchestrated deliberately during the US Vice President’s visit to India to serve their propaganda objectives against Pakistan,” he added.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the Indian government should first thorou­ghly investigate the incident before levelling false allegations against Pakistan.
He noted India’s decades-long military presence in held Kashmir and its rights violations were fuelling unrest. He also alleged Indian involvement in terrorism inside Pakistan, including the recent Jaffar Express attack in Balochistan.
As it is feared that India could attack Pakistan against the backdrop of the Pahalgam incident, Mr Asif said: “Pak­istan is capable of responding to any In­­dian aggression in a befitting manner.”
Talking to a private TV channel, the minister said that India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty — that allows for sharing the waters of the Indus River system between the two countries — is a violation of international laws. “India cannot take unilateral decisions regarding the Indus Waters Treaty,” he said. “We will give a comprehensive re­­sponse to India after holding the Nat­ional Security Committee’s meeting, which is being called on Thursday (today).”
Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari also warned in a video statement that any “misadventure by India under the pretext of a false-flag operation will have dire consequences”.
Condemning the “shocking terror attack”, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said, “Unfortunately, the reflexive finger-pointing already at play against Pakistan has become the boilerplate response for a New Delhi that was unable to contain its own spectacular failures amidst a fundamentalist meltdown.”
Regarding India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, she said India could not suspend the treaty unilaterally.
“Stridency-on-steroids is not a foreign policy,” she said, adding that all indications of the Pahalgam attacks go towards a “false flag operation” of India.
 


JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman also strongly criticised attempts to link Pakistan with unrest in Indian-occupied Kashmir, calling such accusations “baseless” and asking India to introspect on its internal failures instead of blaming its neighbour. “It’s convenient for India to blame Pakistan, but that doesn’t change the ground realities,” he said.
PTI also denounced the attack, describing terrorism as a “shared enemy of the civilised world”. In its statement, the PTI warned that any adventurism against Pakistan would be met with a united national response, reaffirming support for the armed forces. “Founding Chairman Imran Khan and PTI firmly stand with the armed forces and the people in their inalienable resolve to blunt any such aggression by the Indian government against Pakistan,” it added.
 


Former minister Saad Rafique condemned Indian media’s atte­mpt to blame Pakistan for the attack “without any evidence”. Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen chief Alla­­ma Raja Nasir expressed condolences, called for dialogue for regional peace and warned that escalating tensions could endanger South Asia’s stability.
 


‘Sinister ploy’
In Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), political and resistance leaders unanimously condemned the Pahalgam attack, terming it a sinister ploy by Indian agencies to discredit the Kashmir freedom struggle and falsely implicate Pakistan.
Extending condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims, they called for international accountability to bring the real culprits to justice, while making it clear that no amount of violence could shake the Kashmiri people’s resolve for their right to self-determination.
In his statement, AJK President Bar­rister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry called the massacre “condemnable,” accusing the Narendra Modi-led regime of staging another false flag operation, especially timed with the visit of US Vice President J.D. Vance to India, and likened it to India’s habitual blaming of Pakistan, as seen after the 2019 Pulwama incident.
AJK Information Minister Pir Mazhar Saeed maintained the “Pahalgam false flag operation had flopped even before the script could unfold.”
The AJK chapter of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) echoed similar concerns. “We firmly believe Indian agencies are involved in this heinous act… to destabilise the region and malign the peaceful freedom movement,” said APHC convener Ghulam Muhammad Safi.

It was asked to write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.
The AI produced a technically correct piece of writing; writers and proponents of AI debated its literary merit and its usefulness to humanity for a week on social media. In my opinion, the piece was devoid of human emotion, merely a paean to the cleverness of machines and those who build them.
But the person who would have been able to give the most considered view because she was as great a humanist as she was a tech evangelist, was not available for comment. She had died 10 years ago, and all of us who loved her are still grieving her loss.
Sabeen Mahmud was killed on this day in 2015. She was the founder of Karachi’s cultural centre The Second Floor; she led a social and cultural renaissance in a country pulverised by political and ethnic violence and suffocated by religious intolerance. In a city where it was often difficult to breathe, the Second Floor was where breathing was not just encouraged, it was mandatory — along with thinking. Perhaps this kind of haven is hard to imagine today, when everyone has the world on a computer in their pocket.
 
 

But Sabeen lived in a moment when we were not encouraged to think for ourselves or express our individuality. This was the early 2000s, when dictatorship was benevolent and moderation was enlightened. Under the platitudes festered the same hard hatred and extremism that has shaped our country ever since its inception.
Although Sabeen’s murder was a great shock, it was no surprise that the person who robbed our friend of her life was an educated man, who adopted the guise of a man of faith with the soul of a killer. We Pakistanis live and die by our hypocrisies and contradictions. We take cover in the grey spaces that exist between the black and white of right and wrong. We think that by fulfilling the technicalities of morality, we can dupe God.
Killing someone is allowed if it is done in the name of the right ‘cause’. This was the bargain Sabeen’s killer made with the devil: it stole Sabeen, just like thousands of Pakistanis with hopes, dreams, aspirations, everything they could have achieved and contributed, experienced and enjoyed, unfulfilled, incomplete.

Sabeen was someone this country needed then and now.

Sabeen accomplished a great deal in the short 40 years she lived on this planet. Everyone who knew her has a different story to tell about her optimism, her courage, her encouragement, her empathy. It’s important that we pass on that knowledge to others who didn’t know her, and who may not have even heard of her. This especially applies to young people, who Sabeen loved to guide and support, who are looking for role models and real-life inspiration. They can’t find it in our society among those they interact with every day.
 
 

Instead, they find it on a phone screen, written by an influencer, or a machine. What Sabeen gave us all, far more valuable than any money or assets, was hope that we could change for the better in whatever we aspired to do and be. She was an activator of dreams, a catalyst for action, a living example of love and solidarity.
If it were up to me, I would rewrite the history books to include Sabeen’s name among those we revere. I would award her the Sitara-i-Imtiaz posthumously, so that her contribution to Pakistan would be properly recognised by each and every citizen of this nation. I would name roads and schools after her. I would write her name in the sky every year on her birthday. She would probably not have wanted any of those accolades; she would have found them cumbersome and strange. She would still deserve them. Sabeen was someone this country needed then, and now more than ever: a mentor and a friend, not necessarily in that order.
I may not be as eloquent as an AI machine, but I do think often about grief when it comes to remembering Sabeen. Losing her brought me face to face with how it feels to lose a loved one — heavy, hopeless, unmoored from everything I thought was certain in this world, anchored to the temporality of our physical bodies, unable to escape the finality of our mortal end.
 
 

I miss her terribly — her laugh, her smile, her irritations, her craziness. I would not want to resurrect her with AI, as is the fad these days in those strange ghostly clips which re-animate dead celebrities; I’ll leave resurrection up to the Divine.
What I will do, though, is use my human gifts — remembrance, emotion, longing, love — to evoke the memories of what Sabeen was like, as a revolutionary and as a friend. And I’ll use my abilities as a writer — a human one — to make sure you know all about her too, long after both of us are gone.
The writer is an author. Her latest novel is The Monsoon War.

• Warns slow growth will make it difficult to create jobs, reduce poverty
ISLAMABAD: The World Bank on Wednesday slightly lowered its growth forecast for Pakistan to 2.7 per cent for the current fiscal year, citing continued economic stabilisation but persistent constraints from tight monetary and fiscal policies.
The World Bank had earlier predicted Pakistan’s economy to grow by 2.8pc during the current fiscal year in its Pakistan Development Update (PDU) released in October last year.
In a statement issued on Wednesday, the World Bank said that growth would remain subject to many downside risks but forecast that the economic growth rate would improve to 3.1pc in the next fiscal year (FY26) and 3.4pc in FY27.
In a rare move, the bank did not officially release its usual biannual PDU that was officially scheduled for launch on April 8 and postponed it at the last moment without any explanation.
 
 

When approached for comment, a World Bank spokesperson said the bank’s management was at the spring meetings in Washington and hence the PDU was not released as usual, and instead a statement was issued.
According to the statement, real GDP growth is expected to be supported by recovering private consumption and investment driven by subdued inflation, lower interest rates and recovering business confidence.
It said Pakistan’s economy was stabilising with easing inflation and improving financial conditions, as well as current accounts and primary fiscal surpluses. Amid continued tight macroeconomic policy, economic growth has been weak during the first half of the fiscal year.
Agriculture saw limited growth, in part due to adverse weather and pest infestations. Industrial activity declined, impacted by higher input costs and taxes, and reduced government spending.
Similarly, the growth of the services sector was muted, given limited spillovers from weak agriculture and industrial activity. While expected to strengthen, economic growth will remain tepid, making job creation and poverty reduction amid high population growth challenging, the World Bank said.
“Pakistan’s key challenge is to transform recent gains from stabilisation into economic growth that is sustainable and adequate for poverty reduction,” said Najy Benhassine, World Bank’s Country Director for Pakistan.
“High-impact reforms to prioritise an efficient and progressive tax system, support a market-determined exchange rate, reduce import tariffs to boost exports, improve the business environment and streamline the public sector would signal strong reform commitment, build confidence, and attract investment,” he said.
The bank said the growth would likely remain constrained amid tight monetary and fiscal policies aimed at rebuilding buffers and containing risks of imbalances. In addition, significant downside risks persist. It said the economic outlook remained fragile and any implementation delays in structural reforms or shifts in economic stabilisation could dampen the nascent recovery and intensify external pressure.
“Risks remain high due to elevated debt levels, policy and global trade uncertainties, and exposure to climatic shocks,” said Anna Twum, lead author of the report.
The bank called for structural reforms to unlock opportunities for private capital mobilisation to improve Pakistan’s digital infrastructure and enable the environment for the digital economy.
“Connectivity quality varies widely across provinces, while high costs make fixed broadband less accessible,” the bank said, adding that Pakistan had opportunities to improve its capability to digitally deliver services to its citizens and businesses through the ongoing development of its Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI).
However, the dividends from the DPI depend on several regulatory and institutional enablers and require ownership by the leadership and a strong coordination framework among the federal, provincial and local governments.

During a meeting with the Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan on Wednesday, tractor manufacturers raised serious concerns about the high rate of general sales tax (GST), excessive regulatory duties, high markup rates, and a lack policy framework that were key challenges.
The local industry proposed that a dedicated tractor policy was essential for the agri sector and needed govt inter­vention.
They said the industry faced frequent GST regime changes, erratic tractor loaning and subsidy schemes and removal of commodity support prices due to non-existent tractor policy in Pakistan.
Haroon Akhtar Khan described the National Tractor Policy as a landmark initiative aligned with the prime minister’s vision of promoting and protecting local industry.
Meanwhile, the govt has sought proposals from manufacturers to reduce tractor prices and make them more accessible.

A source in the Prime Minister’s Office told Dawn that a notification has been issued regarding the formation of the committee.
The committee would implement a formula of “performance-based revi­­ew”, the source said, adding that the policy already introduced in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) would also be implemented in other state institutions and federal ministries.
The committee would devise short- and long-term performance plans for the state institutions and ministries and prepare its report for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif within 30 days, according to the source.
The committee to be headed by the finance minister would have other members including federal ministers for energy, climate change, chairman FBR and others.
PM returns from Turkiye
On Wednesday, PM Shehbaz returned to the country after completing his two-day official visit to Turkiye.
Soon after his return, the premier expressed deep concerns over the news of an earthquake in Turkiye. He said he was praying for the safety of Turkish brothers and sisters.
“Pakistan stands ready to offer all possible assistance to help in this natural calamity,” the PM said in a statement.
On the other hand, PM Shehbaz strongly condemned the terrorist attack on polio vaccination team in Mastung.
In a statement, the PM expressed deep sorrow over the martyrdom of Levies personnel deployed for the security of the polio vaccinators.
He said the terrorists who harm the lives and properties of innocent people were enemies of humanity and would be brought to justice. He said such incidents could not deter the government’s unwavering commitment to eradicating polio from the country.

He was speaking at a forum hosted by the Centre for Global Development (CGD) during the IMF-World Bank Spring Meetings.
In a separate engagement on the sidelines of the meetings, the finance minister met Sultan bin Abdulrahman Al-Murshid, the top official at the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD), and requested expedited disbursements under the Saudi oil facility.
The facility, agreed earlier this year, enables Pakistan to defer up to $1.2 billion in oil import payments, providing vital support for the country’s foreign reserves during its fragile economic recovery.
“The minister requested expedited disbursements under the Saudi oil facility and assured the provision of evidence of oil shipments,” the finance ministry said in a statement.
At the CGD forum, Mr Aurangzeb underscored his government’s commitment to structural reforms. “Reforms in taxation, privatisation, energy, governance and other sectors will continue with full commitment,” he said.
He stressed the importance of increasing exports and foreign investment: “To move our economy forward, we must increase exports and attract foreign investment into export-oriented sectors.”
Mr Aurangzeb also explained the rationale behind overhauling the country’s tax policy: “To broaden financial resources, our top priority is to reduce reliance on the manufacturing sector and salaried class and bring other sectors into the tax net.”
On international trade, Mr Aurangzeb said that a “high-level Pakistani delegation will visit the United States for constructive talks on tariff issues”.
He also welcomed the “strong participation of the US delegation in the minerals and mining conference held in Pakistan two weeks ago”, calling it “encouraging” and reflective of the direction of future economic and trade relations.
Mr Aurangzeb also participated in the 13th Ministerial meeting of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action (CFMCA), where he delivered a statement emphasising that “the country was developing a Climate Prosperity Plan (CPP) and Climate Finance Strategy”.
Separately, Mr Aurangzeb also met with Moody’s commercial team in Washington, DC, where he briefed them on Pakistan’s macroeconomic outlook.

The decision was taken on the directive of Power Minister Sardar Awais Leghari, who had recently expressed concern over project delays and the performance of these officials, according to a statement issued by the power division instead of NTDC.
Those removed from their positions included Deputy Managing Director Planning Qaiser Khan, Chief Financial Officer Waseem Saadar Sheikh, two general managers and three chief engineers and were made officers on special duty (OSD) – a term used for suspension of official duties till completion of enquiry. One of the sacked general managers included Nisar Akhtar.
Two chief engineers who were removed from their roles in the Planning and Human Resource departments — Sajjad Haider Syed and Sohail Mumtaz Bajwa — were given current charge of general managers. The names of others were not disclosed.
The additional charge for the post of general manager designated at Lahore and GM Planning Hyderabad was given to Shahid Shafi Sial and Mohammad Rafique was given charge of Hyderabad general manager in addition to their duties for an initial period of three months or till regular postings.

Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said the PSX closed sharply lower after the IMF slashed the GDP growth forecast to 2.6pc for FY25 amid the Trump tariff blow.
He added that Fitch Ratings forecast on the weakening rupee, political noise, and investor fears over the outfall of Indian-occupied Kashmir security unrest played a catalyst role in the bearish close at PSX.
Topline Securities Ltd observed that the bears made a forceful comeback, snapping the four-day winning streak. The index witnessed heightened volatility, losing 1,309 points intraday before settling at 117,226 — marking a sharp decline of 1,204 points or 1.02 per cent day-on-day.
The brokerage house attributed the reversal in sentiment to escalating regional geopolitical tensions, which prompted investors to adopt a cautious stance and lock in recent gains.
The downward trajectory of the index was significantly influenced by negative contributions from key stocks, including United Bank Ltd, Hub Power, Habib Metro­poli­tan Bank, Mari Energies, and Engro Holdings, which collectively dragged the index down by 526 points.
Ali Najib, Head of Sales at Insight Securities, said a negative PSX perfor­mance, contrary to the widespread expectations of a bullish spell after Mr Trump’s soft statement that China tariffs will drop ‘substantially – but it won’t be zero”, left investors surprised.
The day commenced on an optimistic note as the index hit an intraday high at 118,811, but the downward growth revision by the IMF from 3pc to 2.6pc for FY25 dampened investor sentiments.
In addition, Fitch’s forecast, highlighting concern that the rupee may slide to Rs285 against the US dollar by June and likely fall further to Rs295 by the next fiscal year’s end, also kept bulls at bay as investors opted to have a cautious approach.
Market participation slowed as trading volume tumbled 18.31pc to 605.17 million shares, while the traded value fell 9.05pc to Rs27.76 billion day-on-day.

The development follows a bilateral agreement signed in late February between China and Pakistan. CMSA said the selection process for the Pakistani astronauts has already begun.
“Consistent with the stringent criteria used for Chinese astronaut selection, a three-stage process (preliminary, secon­dary, and final) will govern candidate selection,” CMSA spokesperson Lin Xiqiang said at a press conference.
Lin added that a Pakistani astronaut will join the mission as a payload specialist and conduct scientific experiments for Pakistan, in addition to standard crew duties.

Space agency says selection process for payload specialist has begun

The announcement came alongside China’s confirmation of its latest crewed spaceflight. The Shenzhou-20 mission is scheduled to launch at 5:17pm on Thursday from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, Lin said.
Leading the mission will be Chen Dong, a 46-year-old veteran astronaut and former fighter pilot who, in 2022, became the first Chinese astronaut to spend more than 200 cumulative days in orbit.
“Every space journey is very unique, so I look forward to bringing in more experience and breakthroughs in the flight,” said Chen, who is embarking on his third spaceflight.
Joining Chen are first-time fliers Chen Zhongrui, 40, a former air force pilot, and Wang Jie, 35, a former space technology engineer.
The current crew aboard Tiangong is expected to return to Earth on April 29 after completing handover procedures with the Shenzhou-20 team, according to Mr Lin.
The Shenzhou-20 crew will carry out scientific experiments in physics and life sciences and install protective equipment against space debris.
China has been barred from particip­ating in the International Space Station since 2011, when the US prohibited NASA from collaborating with Chinese space agencies. Since then, Beijing has sought to build partnerships with other countries — including Pakistan — in its expanding space programme.

The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health confirmed the poliovirus case from Torghar district of KP. It was this year’s second case from the province and seventh case from across Pakistan.
An official of polio programme said, “The second nationwide polio campaign of the year is currently in progress in the country from April 21 to 27, aiming to vaccinate 45.4 million children under the age of five across the country. This will be followed by another nationwide campaign from May 26 to June 1.
“District Torghar is included in both these vaccination campaigns, along with all other districts of the country.”

Official says Torghar district will be covered in ongoing and next vaccination drive

The official appealed to parents to ensure their children aged five years and less must receive repeated doses of the polio vaccine to protect them from the crippling disease.
“The ongoing polio campaign is a critical opportunity to safeguard children against this viral disease,” he said.
Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by the virus that invades the nervous system, and can cause paralysis or even death.
While there is no cure for polio, vaccination is the most effective way to protect children from this crippling disease. Each time a child under the age of five is vaccinated, their protection against the virus is increased. Repeated immunisations have protected millions of children from polio, allowing almost all countries in the world to become polio free.
Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries which are reporting polio cases.

The expo comes at a time when mounting trade barriers, driven by steep tariff measures under Trump administration, risk dampening China’s global ambitions.
With nearly 1,000 exhibitors present, foreign carmakers are raring to show they can keep pace with the ultra-competitive Chinese firms that dominate the sector’s electric frontier. Beijing’s historic backing of EV and hybrid development has seen the domestic market flourish, with firms on Wednesday taking the opportunity to demonstrate cutting edge technology and sophisticated design.
“(Chinese brands) are really on the forefront of pushing the technology now, and have been for a few years,” said Stefan Rosen, the head of design for Lynk & Co, a joint venture between China’s Geely and Volvo.
“I know that (foreign firms) are trying to catch up... but I would say still the industry is led through China,” he said. Huge crowds gathered at domestic champion BYD’s booth as it unveiled five new Ocean series cars, as well as a luxury SUV under its sub-brand Yangwang, and a concept sports car under another, Denza.
BYD has enjoyed a giddy few months of surging sales after annual revenue surged in 2024, eclipsing its rival, US titan Tesla, which is not present at the show.
“It’s a very competitive field,” Xpeng’s co-president Brian Gu said at the startup’s booth, where as well as cars, a humanoid robot and a concept flying car were on display.

• UN watchdog asks Tehran to ‘clarify tunnels near N-site’
• Beijing backs Tehran-Washington talks
WASHINGTON: Iran is ringing two deeply buried tunnel complexes with a massive security perimeter linked to its main nuclear complex, a report said on Wednesday, amid US and Israeli threats of attack.
The Institute for Science and International Security released its report based on recent satellite imagery as the US and Iran prepare to hold a third round of talks this weekend on a possible deal to reimpose restraints on Tehran’s uranium enrichment programme.
US President Donald Trump, who pulled the US out of a 2015 pact designed to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons, has threatened to bomb Iran unless a deal is quickly reached that would ensure that same goal. Trump’s withdrawal prompted Iran to breach many of the pact’s restraints. Western powers suspect it is pursuing the capability to assemble a nuclear weapon through enrichment of uranium to high fissile purity, which Tehran denies.
David Albright, the institute president, said the new perimeter suggested that the tunnel complexes, under construction beneath Mount Kolang Gaz La for several years, could become operational relatively soon. 
Tehran has barred access to the tunnels to inspectors of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who are monitoring its nuclear programme. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog agency called on Wednesday on Iran to explain tunnels built around its Natanz nuclear site, while voicing hope over ongoing US-Iran talks. 
“I’ve been raising this issue repeatedly, and I will continue to do so,” Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told reporters on a visit to Washington. 
Grossi, who visited Tehran last week, said that all countries need to inform the IAEA of intentions for facilities around nuclear sites but that Iran has a stance “unique in the world” that it does not need to inform the agency ahead of time. “We’re asking them, what is this for? They are telling us, it’s none of your business,” Grossi said.
Grossi said it “cannot be excluded” that the tunnels would store undeclared material but said he did not want to speculate on intentions. “Iran does not have nuclear weapons. This is very clear. We cannot confuse people. Iran has conducted in the past certain activities that were relevant — could be relevant — in the process of developing nuclear weapons,” he said.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, the chief negotiator with the US, said in a post on X in apparent response to the new report that Israel and unnamed “Special Interest groups” were looking to “derail diplomacy.” Iran has said that advanced centrifuges would be assembled in one complex in place of a facility at the nearby Natanz plant, the centrepiece of its nuclear programme, destroyed by sabotage in 2020.
The complexes, Albright said, are being built at depths much greater than Iran’s deeply buried uranium enrichment facility at Fordow, near the holy city of Qom. Iran’s nuclear energy chief Mohammad Eslami, referring to concerns about the vulnerability of its nuclear programme, on Tuesday appeared to refer to projects such as the construction of the new security perimeter around the tunnel complexes.
Meeting with Chinese FM
China supports Iran holding talks on its nuclear program with the United States and opposes the use of force and “illegal” unilateral sanctions to try to resolve the issue, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Iran’s foreign minister on Wednesday.
Beijing is willing to deepen coordination and cooperation with Tehran on international and regional affairs, Wang told Iran’s Abbas Araqchi during talks in the Chinese capital, according to a ministry statement. “The Chinese side commends Iran’s promise not to develop nuclear weapons and respects Iran’s right to utilise nuclear energy peacefully,” Wang said.
The meeting came ahead of further US-Iran nuclear talks this Saturday and after Washington imposed sanctions on some Chinese refiners for buying Iranian oil in recent weeks. The Iranian foreign ministry said on Wednesday that Araqchi had informed his Chinese counterpart of the latest situation of the “indirect talks between Iran and the US” and thanked China for its productive stance on Iran’s nuclear programme and the lifting of sanctions.
China buys some 90 per cent of Iran’s oil exports, traders and analysts have said. The two countries have built a trading system that uses mostly Chinese yuan and a network of middlemen, avoiding the dollar and exposure to US regulators.
Wang and Araqchi also discussed US tariffs during Wednesday’s meeting. “The US’s abuse of tariffs has completely lost popularity and isolated itself from the international community,” Wang said.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, officials said, but the quake was followed by at least eight others, Turkiye’s AFAD disaster management agency said. The initial quake struck at 12:49pm at a depth of 6.92km under the sea, which lies to the south of the city, AFAD added.
“An earthquake of 6.2 magnitude occurred in Silivri, Sea of Marmara, Istanbul,” Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on X, adding that it was felt in the surrounding provinces.
It was followed by eight others with magnitudes of 3.5 to 5.9.
As buildings shook, people rushed onto the streets where crowds of worried-looking people stared at their mobile phones for information or made calls.
“I just felt earthquake, I’ve got to get out,” a shaken-looking decorator said while rushing out of a fourth-storey apartment where he was working near the city’s Galata Tower, who did not want to give his name.
Footage posted by the state news agency Anadolu showed the minaret of a mosque in the Beylikduzu district just west of the historic peninsula swaying during the initial quake. But there were no reports of any buildings collapsing in the sprawling city of 16 million people, Yerlikaya told TRT.
“Until now, nobody’s called the emergency line to report their house collapsing,” he said, though the Istanbul governor’s office warned people to avoid any structures that looked like they might have been damaged.
Footage on Turkiye’s NTV television showed one three-storey building collapsed in the Fatih district, also near the historic peninsula, with the broadcaster saying the building was empty and had been abandoned decade ago.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he was “following the developments closely”.
The tremors could be felt as far away as Bulgaria, according to AFP journalists in the capital Sofia.
Around 20,000 people were killed in two quakes that devastated Tur­kiye’s densely populated northwest in 1999 as the eastern strand of the fault line ruptured.

• Israeli attacks claim 18 more lives; European powers call for end to aid blockade
GAZA CITY: Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called upon Hamas on Wednesday to lay down arms and hand the running of Gaza to his Palestinian Authority (PA) in order to answer international doubts over the PA’s role at a key moment for the region.
Abbas also urged Hamas to free all Israeli prisoners in Gaza, saying their captivity provided Israel with excuses to attack the territory. Hamas gave “the criminal occupation excuses to commit its crimes in the Gaza Strip”, he said, adding that he was the one paying the price, not Israel.
“Hamas must hand over (its) Gaza responsibilities and hand over its arms to the responsibility of the Palestinian Authority and transform into a political party,” the PA chief said while addressing the central council of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) at Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority in Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Ties between Abbas’s Fatah party and Hamas have been tense. While he had previously called upon Hamas to put its forces under the PA’s control, he has not done so since the start of the Gaza conflict in October 2023.
 
 

The PA chief is expected this week to name a successor amid pressure from Western and Arab powers concerned about the PA’s ability to play a viable-long term role in peace efforts.
Hamas has often criticised Abbas for “collaborating with Israel”.
Diplomatic efforts to craft a plan for Gaza’s future have focused on pushing aside Hamas, but Israel said it would not accept any role for the PA, which exercises limited autonomy in the occupied West Bank.
Pressure to name a successor
Abbas, 89, took over the Palestinian leadership after the death of veteran PLO leader Yasser Arafat in 2004. He has for years resisted naming a deputy or successor, but the conflict in Gaza has intensified pressure for him to do so.
Last month, Arab states proposed a plan for Gaza to be temporarily run by a committee before being returned to the PA’s control.
The US, European Union and Gulf monarchies expected to play a role in financing any reconstruction of Gaza have repeatedly urged PA reform.
Talks aimed at reaching a new ceasefire have so far failed to produce any breakthroughs, though a Hamas delegation is currently in Cairo for renewed negotiations with Egyptian and Qatari mediators.
Attack on shelter for displaced
On Wednesday, Israel continued to pound Gaza, with rescuers saying 18 people had been killed since dawn, including 11 in a strike on a school-turned-shelter for displaced people.
“The school was housing displaced people. The bombing sparked a massive blaze, and several charred bodies have since been recovered,” an eyewitness said, describing the attack on Yaffa school, in Al Tuffa area of Gaza City.
Aid agencies estimate that the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.4 million residents have been displaced due to the bombardment and 51,305 killed by Israeli forces in less than two years.
UK, France and Germany’s appeal
Britain, France and Germany called on Israel on Wednesday to stop blocking humanitarian aid into Gaza, warning of “an acute risk of starvation, epidemic disease and death”.
“We urge Israel to immediately restart a rapid and unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza in order to meet the needs of all civilians,” their foreign ministers said in a joint statement. “The Israeli decision to block aid from entering Gaza is intolerable.”
They also criticised Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz for politicising humanitarian aid and described Israeli plans to remain in Gaza as unacceptable. Katz said earlier Israel would continue preventing aid from entering Gaza.
The UN also warned many community kitchens providing food for displaced people were also shutting due to depleting stocks.

“Punjab does not need any external dictation regarding the use of river floodwater. Punjab is fully sovereign in utilising its own resources and that Sindh has no right to object to Punjab’s development projects,” Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari told a presser here on Wednesday.
Flanked by Punjab Agriculture Minister Ashiq Hussain Kermani, Azma Bokhari said that the proposed canal project was still under consideration and only excess floodwater would be utilised for the purpose.
“This initiative aims to benefit farmers and promote agricultural development,” she claimed. Earlier this week, the Sindh chief minister also claimed that work on the six canals project had been halted since July 2024.
According to the minister, canals had not been constructed yet and serious efforts were underway to build consensus. “Differences cannot be resolved through threats — dialogue is the way forward,” she said.
 
 

Ms Bokhari further said the PPP had ruled Sindh for the past 16 years, and farmers there still faced fundamental issues. “If PPP resorts to misleading statements, we will not remain silent. Every allegation will receive a befitting response,” she warned.
On the other hand, PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui said the alliance between PML-N and PPP, particularly on key national issues of water resources, would remain unaffected.
“Differences on national matters are natural and can only be resolved through dialogue and mutual understanding. Negotiation and constructive conversation are the only ways forward,” he added.

• Industry stakeholders urge govt to resolve issue as soon as possible
LAHORE / KARACHI: The national fertiliser supply chain is facing severe disruptions as ongoing sit-ins and road blockades in Sindh have choked critical transport routes, stranding thousands of trucks and halting industrial operations.
The blockades have been holding up traffic for a week now, particularly in the Sukkur-Larkana division, leading to alarm among government officials and stakeholders in the business community.
The disruption comes at a critical moment in the agricultural calendar. The Kharif season, which includes crops like cotton, sugarcane, and rice, depends heavily on timely access to urea.
Delays in distribution may cause lower yields, higher food prices, and added financial pressure on farmers, whose economics have already deteriorated over the past year.
The Ministry of National Food Security and Research (MNFSR) has also raised the issue with the Sindh government, saying that with Kharif season in full swing across the country, the non-availability of urea and DAP at this juncture may affect production and impact national food security.
 
 

The MNFSR letter to Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, seen by Dawn, notes that fertiliser makers apprehend that the persistence of this situation may lead to forced shutdown of fertiliser plants, compromising its availability for Kharif crops.
Both inbound and outbound logistics for the fertiliser industry have slowed dramatically.
Among the hardest hit are the country’s two major fertiliser producers — Fauji Fertiliser in Mirpur Mathelo and Engro Fertilisers in Daharki — whose operations are now under significant strain.
According to retired Brig Sher Shah Malik, executive director of the Fertiliser Manufacturers of Pakistan Advisory Council (FMPAC), over 600 fertiliser-laden trucks are currently stranded at plant sites, including Daharki, Mirpur Mathelo, and Port Qasim.
Around 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes of compost is produced daily at these units, but the blockades have stranded around half a million tonnes at the factories, or on various roads.
Since these factories have limited warehousing capacity, they cannot store any more fertiliser, an official from a compost plant told Dawn.
He said that it would take three days to bring production to a halt, and just as many days to restart production, as these factories work round the clock.
“This isn’t just a Sindh issue — it’s becoming a problem with national-level effects,” the official said.
The FMPAC, too, has requested the Sindh government’s support in mobilising the relevant administrative and law enforcement authorities to ensure the safe and unimpeded movement of fertiliser across Sindh.
Goods unable to reach destinations
Beyond fertiliser, the bro­ader economic fallout is also mounting. Over 3,500 trucks — many loaded with export consignments, perishable goods, and critical industrial materials — remain stranded across northern Sindh, especially near Sukkur. With containers piling up and goods unable to reach their destinations, the supply chain is rapidly becoming gridlocked.
Raw materials are also being held up at Karachi Port, resulting in many manufacturers facing the possibility of production delays. Exporters are missing delivery deadlines, potentially weakening confidence among international partners and affecting future trade prospects.
According to M. Abdul Aleem, secretary general of the Overseas Investors Chambers of Commerce Industry (OICCI), the nearly week-long blockade of the National Highway in Sindh has brought local trade and industrial activity to a grinding halt, paralysing supply chains and sending shockwaves through the national economy.
“Over 3,500 vehicles remain stranded near Sukkur, many carrying export consignments, perishable items, and critical industrial inputs. The complete halt in goods movement is already affecting market supplies, with shortages looming,” he said.
Meanwhile, Khalid Tawab, regional chairman of the United Business Group (UBG), has also appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to take immediate action to resolve the ongoing protests and end the road blockades in Sindh, which have brought economic activities to a grinding halt.
He claimed that approximately 800 tank lorries were currently stranded en route, severely hampering the industry’s ability to ensure uninterrupted fuel supplies.
