                <h2>Israel and Iran strike at each other in new wave of attacks</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Israel and Iran launched fresh attacks on each other overnight into Sunday, stoking fears of a wider conflict after Israel expanded its surprise <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/israel-launches-strikes-on-iran">campaign</a> against its main rival with a strike on the world‚Äôs biggest gas field.</p>
<p>Tehran called off <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912795">nuclear talks</a> that Washington had said were the only way to halt Israel‚Äôs bombing, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks were nothing compared with what Iran would see in the coming days.</p>
<p>The latest wave of Iranian attacks began shortly after 11:00pm on Saturday (1am PKT Sunday), when air raid sirens blared in Jerusalem and Haifa, sending around a million people into bomb shelters.</p>
<p>Around 2:30am local time (4:30am PKT), the Israeli military warned of another incoming missile barrage and urged residents to seek shelter. Explosions echoed through Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as missiles streaked across the skies as interceptor rockets were launched in response. The military lifted its shelter-in-place advisory nearly an hour after issuing the warning.</p>
<p>The ambulance service said at least seven people were killed overnight, including a 10-year-old boy and a woman in her 20s, and more than 140 injured in multiple attacks.</p>
<p>Search and rescue workers combed through the rubble of residential buildings destroyed in multiple strikes, using flashlights and dogs to look for survivors.</p>
<p>Israeli media said at least 35 people were missing after a strike hit Bat Yam, a city south of Tel Aviv. A spokesperson for the emergency services said a missile hit an 8-storey building there and while many people were rescued, there were fatalities.</p>
<p>It was unclear how many buildings were hit overnight.</p>
<p>So far, at least nine people in Israel have been killed and over 300 others injured since Iran launched its retaliatory attacks on Friday.</p>
<p>Iran has said 78 people were killed there on the first day of Israel‚Äôs campaign, and scores more on the second, including 60 when a missile brought down a 14-storey apartment block in Tehran, where 29 of the dead were children.</p>
<p>The Shahran oil depot in Tehran was targeted in an Israeli attack, Iran said, but added the situation was under control. A fire had erupted after an Israeli attack on an oil refinery near the capital while Israeli strikes also targeted Iran‚Äôs defence ministry building, causing minor damage, the semi-official <em>Tasnim</em> news agency said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs Revolutionary Guards said Iranian missiles and drones targeted Israel‚Äôs energy infrastructure and facilities for fighter jet fuel production. The elite force warned Tehran‚Äôs attacks will be ‚Äúheavier and more extensive‚Äù if Israel continues its hostilities.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump had warned Iran of worse to come, but said it was not too late to halt the Israeli campaign if Tehran accepted a sharp downgrading of its nuclear programme.</p>
<p>A round of US-Iran nuclear talks that was due to be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">held</a> in Oman on Sunday was cancelled, with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi saying the discussions could not take place while Iran was being subjected to Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúbarbarous‚Äù attacks.</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#gas-field-attack" id="gas-field-attack" title="Permalink"></a>Gas field attack</h2>
<p>In the first apparent attack to hit Iran‚Äôs energy infrastructure, the semi-official <em>Tasnim</em> news agency said Iran partially suspended production at the world‚Äôs biggest gas field after an Israeli strike caused a fire there on Saturday.</p>
<p>The South Pars field, offshore in Iran‚Äôs southern Bushehr province, is the source of most of the gas produced in Iran.</p>
<p>Fears about potential disruption to the region‚Äôs oil exports had already driven up oil prices 9 per cent on Friday, even though Israel spared Iran‚Äôs oil and gas on the first day of its attacks.</p>
<p>An Iranian general, Esmail Kosari, said on Saturday that Tehran was reviewing whether to close the Strait of Hormuz, controlling access to the Gulf for tankers.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>With Israel saying its operation could last weeks, and Netanyahu urging Iran‚Äôs people to rise up against their rulers, fears have grown of a regional conflagration dragging in outside powers.</p>
<p>B‚ÄôTselem, a leading Israeli human rights organisation, said on Saturday that instead of exhausting all possibilities for a diplomatic resolution, Israel‚Äôs government had chosen to start a war that puts the entire region in danger.</p>
<p>Tehran has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916637/iran-threatens-to-target-us-bases-if-conflict-breaks-out">warned</a> Israel‚Äôs allies that their military bases in the region would come under fire too if they helped shoot down Iranian missiles.</p>
<p>Israel sees Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme as a threat to its existence, and said the bombardment was designed to avert the last steps to production of a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>Tehran insists the programme is entirely civilian and that it does not seek an atomic bomb. However, the UN nuclear watchdog <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916895">reported</a> it this week as violating obligations under the global non-proliferation treaty.</p></p>

                <h2>Trump flexes military might at parade as protests sweep US</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump hosted the largest US military parade in decades on his 79th birthday on Saturday, as protesters rallied across the country to accuse him of acting like a dictator.</p>
<p>Trump hailed the United States as the ‚Äúhottest country in the world‚Äù after watching tanks, aircraft, and troops file past him in Washington to honour the 250th anniversary of the US army.</p>
<p>But it formed a stark split screen with turmoil at home and abroad, as police used teargas to disperse <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1916746">protesters</a> in Los Angeles and US ally Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/israel-launches-strikes-on-iran">traded</a> missile fire with Iran in a rapidly escalating conflict in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs parade on an overcast night in Washington came after tens of thousands of ‚ÄúNo Kings‚Äù demonstrators <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917123/tens-of-thousands-of-americans-join-protest-rallies-ahead-of-trumps-military-parade">thronged</a> the streets in cities including New York, Philadelphia, Houston and Atlanta.</p>
<p>Trump largely avoided his usual domestic political diatribes in an unusually brief speech, and instead focused on praising the US army, saying that they ‚Äúfight, fight, fight, and they win, win, win‚Äù.</p>
<p>The display of military might comes as Trump asserts his power domestically and on the international stage.</p>
<p>In his address to the parade, Trump sent a warning to Washington‚Äôs adversaries of ‚Äútotal and complete‚Äù defeat, with the United States increasingly at risk of getting tangled up in Israel‚Äôs conflict with Iran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTime and again, America‚Äôs enemies have learned that if you threaten the American people, our soldiers are coming for you,‚Äù Trump said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#happy-birthday" id="happy-birthday" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòHappy Birthday‚Äô</h2>
<p>Trump had openly dreamed since his first term as president of having a grand military parade, of the type more often seen in Moscow or Pyongyang than Washington.</p>
<p>The last such parade in the United States was at the end of the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>When it came, Trump stood and saluted on a stage outside the White House as tanks rumbled past, aircraft roared overhead, and nearly 7,000 troops marched past.</p>
<p>Troops and military hardware from different eras of US history passed by, with an announcer reeling off victories in battles with Japanese, German, Chinese and Vietnamese forces in past wars.</p>
<p>The army said it cost up to $45 million.</p>
<p>But while the crowd sang ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù and there were occasional chants of ‚ÄúUSA! USA!‚Äù, the atmosphere was less intense than one of the barnstorming rallies that swept Trump to power.</p>
<p>The White House said that ‚Äúover 250,000 patriots showed up‚Äù for the event, without providing evidence. Communications Director Steven Cheung described the ‚ÄúNo Kings‚Äù protests as a ‚Äúcomplete and utter failure‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo Kings‚Äù organisers said protesters gathered in hundreds of cities, with <em>AFP</em> journalists seeing large crowds in several cities.</p>
<p>Organisers said they were protesting against Trump‚Äôs dictatorial overreach, and in particular what they described as the strongman symbolism of the parade.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think people are mad as hell,‚Äù Lindsay Ross, a 28-year-old musician, told <em>AFP</em> in New York, where tens of thousands of people rallied.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#display-of-authoritarianism" id="display-of-authoritarianism" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòDisplay of authoritarianism‚Äô</h2>
<p>Thousands turned out in Los Angeles to protest Trump‚Äôs deployment of troops in the country‚Äôs second-largest city following <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916279">clashes</a> sparked by immigration raids.</p>
<p>Police in Los Angeles used tear gas and mounted officers to clear protesters who had gathered in front of the federal building in downtown, the focus of demonstrations for the last week.</p>
<p><em>AFP</em> reporters at the scene said there was no disorder, but it appeared local officers were moving people away from an area where National Guard troops and Marines are stationed.</p>
<p>Some protesters targeted Trump‚Äôs Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida ‚Äî while a small group even gathered in Paris.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs disgusting,‚Äù protester Sarah Hargrave, 42, said in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, describing Trump‚Äôs parade as a ‚Äúdisplay of authoritarianism‚Äù.</p>
<p>The killing of a Democratic lawmaker and her husband Saturday in the northern state of Minnesota ‚Äî in what the governor called a targeted attack ‚Äî also cast a pall over the parade.</p>
<p>Trump was quick to condemn the attacks outside Minneapolis in which former state speaker Melissa Hortman was killed along with her husband, while another state lawmaker and his wife were hospitalised with gunshot wounds.</p></p>
