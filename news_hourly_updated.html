                <h2>President, PM reaffirm commitment for workers‚Äô welfare on Labour Day</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday reaffirmed the government‚Äôs commitment to the welfare and uplift of workers, state-media <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/01-05-2025/intl-labour-day-being-observed-today" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>As the world commemorated International Labour Day, the president and the premier issued separate messages to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>According to the <a class="link--external" href="https://normlex.ilo.org/dyn/nrmlx_en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:11210:0::NO::P11210_COUNTRY_ID:103166" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Labourers Organisation (ILO)</a>, Pakistan has yet to ratify 55 conventions and protocols. While labour laws <a class="link--external" href="https://www.riaabarkergillette.com/usa/wp-content/uploads/Labour-law-in-Pakistan.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exist</a> but enforcement is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881963">weak</a>, and despite government promises to create millions of jobs, issues like low pay, lack of social protection, and poor representation remain unresolved.</p>
<p>President Zardari paid tribute to the men and women labourers in the country and highlighted their struggles around the world, according to state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1917782980673823022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pakistan Television</a> (PTV)</em>.</p>

<p>In his statement, he said: ‚ÄúWe reiterate our commitment to workers‚Äô autonomy, fair wages, a safe environment and social security. Workers and the working class are the driving force of our economy and national development.‚Äù</p>
<p>He highlighted the role of workers ‚Äúin building our infrastructure, developing industries, agriculture, and the economy‚Äù.</p>
<p>He added: ‚ÄúOur workers are our pride. Our national development is due to the hard work and character of workers. In a rapidly changing world, we must focus on skilling our youth and workers for a bright future. We need to equip our workers and youth with modern skills.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOur hardworking workforce is the driving force behind our nation‚Äôs progress and our resilience,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe protection of fundamental rights of workers is enshrined in the Constitution of Pakistan and is fully consistent with the core conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), to which Pakistan is a committed signatory,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>The premier highlighted that the country has undertaken legislative and administrative reforms to strengthen labour and workforce protection, including key international labour conventions, such as the Forced Labour Convention and the 2014 Protocol to the Maritime Labour Convention.</p>
<p>He stated, ‚ÄúFor the first time, every worker in Pakistan is benefiting from a national occupational safety and health profile, ensuring safe and healthy workplaces across the country.‚Äù</p>

            <p><p>Three Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) police personnel were martyred and two injured late Wednesday night in an exchange of fire with terrorists in Bannu, officials said.</p>
<p>According to a statement issued from the office of Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan today, the gun battle took place in the Spin Tangi area of Chashmi, Bannu.</p>
<p>Bannu CTD personnel Assistant Sub-Inspector Benyamin Khan, Constable Inam Khan and Constable Musawar were martyred. Two constables, Wafid Khan and Imran, were wounded.</p>
<p>He said two <em>khawarij</em> ‚Äî a term the state uses to refer to terrorists ‚Äî were killed and another two injured in police firing, and their accomplices took bodies and injured with them.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWeapons, ammunition, IEDs (improvised explosive device) and hand grenades were recovered from the terrorists, which were seized by the police,‚Äù the spokesman said.</p>
<p>As soon as the incident was reported, RPO Khan, Bannu District Police Officer Saleem Abbas Kalachi, and CTD Superintendent of Police reached the CTD hospital where they visited the injured personnel and inquired after their well-being.</p>
<p>They also issued instructions to the hospital staff for the best treatment of those injured.</p>
<p>RPO Khan said that all available resources will be utilised for the best treatment of the injured personnel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will soon avenge our martyred brothers and engage the terrorists with an iron hand till the very end,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>A large contingent of Bannu police and CTD police have cordoned off the area and are engaged in search operations. Raids are being conducted on the hideouts of the terrorists, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi condemned the attack and expressed his condolences to the families of the martyred.</p>
<p>According to a statement issued by his office, KP Governor House, Kundi paid tribute to the personnel for bravely confronting the terrorists.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe sacrifices of the police and security forces against the terrorists will not go in vain,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>In March, two officials of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs CTD were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1883989">martyred</a> at Tanda Dam in Kohat district in a gun attack carried out by unidentified assailants.</p>
