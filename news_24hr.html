            <p><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Sunday discussed counterterrorism efforts in a meeting with his Afghan counterpart Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul.</p>
<p>The visit comes after a series of steps between both nations to improve ties, such as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904628">revival</a> of the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914300">upgrading</a> of each country’s diplomats from the rank of chargé d’affaires to ambassador. Both countries also held the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922614/pakistan-afghanistan-recognise-terrorism-as-serious-threat-in-1st-round-of-additional-secretary-talks">inaugural</a> round of the Additional Secretary-Level Mechanism talks earlier in the month.</p>
<p>“Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi holds an important meeting with his Afghan counterpart Sirajuddin Haqqani,” the Interior Ministry said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Naqvi was warmly welcomed by interim Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani upon arrival at the Afghan Ministry of Interior, the post said.</p>
<p>“Discussion on bilateral relations, particularly counter-terrorism, infiltration, and the banned Tehrik-i-Taliban [Pakistan],” took place, according to the interior ministry.</p>
<p>Effective management of the Pak-Afghan border, prevention of narcotics, and mechanisms for regulating cross-border movement were also discussed, the post said.</p>
<p>“Terrorist organisations are causing chaos and instability; We must stop them together,” Naqvi was quoted as having said to his counterpart.</p>
<p>“Pakistan has selflessly hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades; the doors are open for the legal entry of Afghan citizens,” the interior minister said.</p>
<p>The process of repatriation of Afghan citizens illegally residing in Pakistan was also a subject of the conversation between Naqvi and Haqqani.</p>
<p>Afghanistan’s Senior Deputy Interior Minister Ibrahim Sardar, Pakistan’s Special Representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq, Federal Interior Secretary Khurram Agha and other senior diplomatic officials were there as part of the country’s delegation. Officials from the Afghan Ministry of Interior were also present on the occasion.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Naqvi arrived in Kabul on a day-long visit to Afghanistan, state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/20-07-2025/mohsin-naqvi-in-kabul-on-a-day-long-visit-to-afghanistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> reported.</p>

<p>Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925209">witnessed</a> an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed TTP ended its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ceasefire</a> with the government in November 2022.</p>

            <p><p>Zahir Zakir Jaffer, who was convicted of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636267">gruesome murder</a> of Noor Mukadam and sentenced to death, is preparing for a presidential mercy petition, according to a series of letters seen by <em>Dawn.com</em> as jail authorities have requested the formation of a medical board to evaluate his condition.</p>
<p>Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636764">tortured</a> before being beheaded. Zahir’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810">death sentence</a> by the trial court had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1741974">upheld</a> by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in 2023.</p>
<p>In May, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912155">upheld</a> the death sentence handed by two courts previously over the murder charges under Section 302B (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). After the ruling by the apex court, a presidential pardon under <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part3.ch1.html#:~:text=President%27s%20power%20to%20grant%20pardon%2C%20etc." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Article 45</a> of the Constitution could possibly provide Zahir pardon, or reprieve, or remit, suspend or commute his sentence.</p>
<p>According to the letters, which are addressed to the hospital director at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) from the superintendent at Adiala Jail, Zahir requires an opinion from a medical or psychiatric board before submitting a presidential mercy petition.</p>
<p>“The appeal of above mentioned Confirmed Condemned Prisoner (Zahir) was pending at [the] Supreme Court of Pakistan and the same has been dismissed,” the letter, dated July 8, read.</p>
<p>“Now the mercy petition of [the] subject cited Confirmed Condemned Prisoner has to be submitted before the Honourable President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. For that, the medical board and psychiatric board opinion is mandatory.”</p>
<p>The letter requested that a time and date be chosen for the medical and psychiatric boards to come to Adiala and examine Zahir.</p>
<p>The superintendent made the same request in another letter dated July 14.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In response to the first letter, Pims stated in a document seen by <em>Dawn.com</em> that Dr Shafqat Nawaz from the psychiatry department and Dr Amir Naveed from the neurology department will comprise the medical board.</p>
<p>Zahir was not only convicted of the murder, but was also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810#:~:text=sentenced%20to%2025%20years%20of%20rigorous%20imprisonment%20along%20with%20a%20fine%20of%20Rs200%2C000%20under%20Section%20376%20(punishment%20for%20rape)%20of%20the%20PPC">sentenced</a> to 25 years of rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs200,000 under Section 376 (punishment for rape) of the PPC.</p>
<p>In October last year, Noor’s father had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867225">urged</a> the apex court to take up the murder case pending for more than one and a half years.</p></p>

            <p><p>Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Sunday said that a case had been registered and a suspect had been arrested after a video showing the murder of a couple went viral on social media.</p>
<p>The video shows a group of men leading a couple out of vehicles and into a desert apparently in Balochistan, before gunning them down with pistols and shooting the bodies. Political figures and activists have termed the incident an ‘honour’ killing.</p>
<p>In a post on X, Bugti addressed the incident, stating that it occurred a few days before Eidul Azha this year and that the victims had been identified.</p>
<p>“Taking immediate notice of the viral video of the murder of a woman and a man on all social media, orders were issued to Balochistan Police for action,” the CM wrote. “A terrorism case has been registered on behalf of the state, and one suspected killer has been arrested; the law will take its course in this heinous matter!”</p>

<p>Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind spoke at the Karachi Press Club today and said that action was underway to trace and apprehend the suspects.</p>
<p>“The two affected families had not filed any report of the incident; however, the state has registered a case,” he said.</p>
<p>“The tribes and individuals seen in the video have been identified; however, their names are not being disclosed at this stage as part of a strategic approach,” he added. “The data of the people seen in the video has been obtained and those whose faces can be identified are being traced through Nadra [National Database and Registration Authority].</p>
<p>“So far, one person has been arrested, while raids are being conducted to arrest others,” he added.</p>
<p>Rind stated that the area shown in the video had been identified, but he did not disclose where it was. He mentioned that the incident took place on Eidul Azha.</p>
<p>“Whether it is the killers or those who possibly held a jirga, strict legal action will be taken against all of them,” he warned. “An FIR (first information report) has already been registered based on the facts revealed in the video, and now the investigation will be taken to its logical conclusion.”</p>
<p>Rind continued: “Chief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti has said that such brutal acts are not only intolerable but are also a serious insult to social values and human dignity. He [CM Bugti] has made it clear that those who challenge the rule of law will be dealt with strictly and no one can be allowed to take the law into their own hands.”</p>
<p>In Pakistan, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849480">‘honour’ killings</a> continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881836">Data</a> from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p>
<p>The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#viral-video-sparks-condemnation" id="viral-video-sparks-condemnation" title="Permalink"></a>Viral video sparks condemnation</h2>
<p>Various political figures and activists condemned the incident as the video was circulated across social media.</p>
<p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari strongly condemned the video in a statement, calling the suspects “beasts” and saying that they deserve no concessions.</p>
<p>“I have faith that the criminals involved in this murder will be brought to justice soon,” he said. “This murder should be a test case for the Balochistan government, as it is gender terrorism.”</p>
<p>The PPP chief added that Islam allows women to marry men of their choice and that the Constitution guarantees the protection of this right.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif shared the video in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KhawajaMAsif/status/1946923637686284672" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, with a message for the people of Balochistan. Referring to the growing militancy in the province, he said: “Those who have taken up arms against the state — start by raising your voice against the unjust system that surrounds you.”</p>
<p>He continued that the ones responsible for this “oppression are your own brothers, not the travellers and labourers from other provinces”, pointing out the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924597">bus attack</a> in Balochistan’s Kalat district, which left three people dead and other similar incidents in the recent past.</p>
<p>PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman condemned the incident in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/sherryrehman/status/1946955545946337781" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, labelling it an “unforgivable crime”.</p>
<p>“Crushing the right to marry is a violation of fundamental human rights. Killing in the name of tribal decisions is a despicable act. The cycle of brutality in the name of honour must be stopped,” she wrote.</p>
<p>“By mercilessly killing the married couple, not only have law and justice been insulted, but the authority of the provincial government has also been challenged,” Rehman added. “The chapter of oppression and barbarism under the guise of jirgas must be closed.”</p>
<p>The senator emphasised that the perpetrators must be brought to justice and that legislation to end “outdated customs” was indispensable.</p>
<p>Baloch activist Sammi Deen Baloch decried the incident as an ‘honour’ killing, appealing to Baloch elders to “respect women’s decisions”.</p>
<p>“As a woman, this chilling incident is deeply painful and heart-wrenching for me,” she <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/SammiBaluch/status/1946912084714721567" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X. “Killing any woman in the name of honour is not only a heinous crime but also the worst humiliation of humanity.</p>
<p>“I appeal to Baloch and Pashtun tribal elders, influential sections of society, and intellectuals to respect women’s decisions. Today’s woman is the same woman who is educated, aware, and fully capable of making decisions about her future.”</p>
<p>She demanded that the incident be investigated in a transparent and comprehensive manner so that the suspects were brought to justice and “no one dares to repeat such a barbaric act in the future”.</p></p>
