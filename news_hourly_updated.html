                <h2>Nepra slashes uniform tariff by Rs1.89 for Aug-Oct</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Thursday notified a decrease of Rs1.89 in the uniform tariff for the next three months.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/Ex-WAPDA%20DISCOS/2025/TRF-100%20XWDISCOS%20PERIODIC%20ADJUSTMENT%20FY%202024-25%2007-08-2025%2012380-83.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a> dated August 7 and available with <em>Dawn.com</em> said that the authority ‚Äúdecided to allow the application of instant quarterly adjustments on the consumers of K-Electric as well, with the same applicability period.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAccordingly, the instant quarterly adjustment of negative Rs1.8881/kWh (per kilowatt hour) shall also be charged from the consumers of K-Electric except life line and prepaid consumers, to be recovered in a period of three months [from] August 2025 to October 2025.‚Äù</p>
<p>Nepra stated that this discount will be applied to bills for the applicable period issued before the notification, adding that distribution companies (Discos) will comply with court orders.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nepra also notified a negative fuel cost adjustment (FCA) of Rs0.78 per unit for consumers of all ex-Wapda distribution companies (XWDiscos) except for K-Electric (KE) in their bills for August.</p>
<p>According to a separate Nepra <a class="link--external" href="https://nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/Ex-WAPDA%20DISCOS/2025/TRF-100%20XWDISCOS%20FCA%20JUN%202025%2007-08-2025%2012350-66.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a> ‚Äî also dated August 7 and available with <em>Dawn.com</em> ‚Äî the authority decided on an FCA of Rs0.78 for the month of June 2025 based on variations in fuel charges in the approved tariffs of XWDiscos.</p>
<p>Nepra decided that the FCA ‚Äúshall be applicable to all consumer categories except lifeline consumers, protected consumers, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and pre-paid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for pre-paid tariff‚Äù, the notification read.</p>
<p>The notification stated that XWDiscos would reflect the June FCA in the billing month of August 2025, which would be shown separately on consumers‚Äô bills based on the units billed to them in June.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn case any bills of August 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in [the] subsequent month,‚Äù Nepra added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile effecting the Fuel Charges Adjustment, the concerned XWDiscos shall keep in view and strictly comply with the orders of the courts, notwithstanding this order.‚Äù</p>
<p>In another notification from today, Nepra replied to a request from the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA-G) seeking a monthly FCA for June, finding that based on the information provided, the actual pool fuel cost was Rs.7.68 per kilowatt hour (kWh) against the reference fuel cost component of Rs.8.3341 per kWh</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe actual fuel charges, as claimed by CP–†–ê, for the June 2025 decreased by Rs.0.65 per kWh as compared to the reference fuel charges,‚Äù the notification read.</p>
<p>Today‚Äôs notifications come in the wake of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928756">Nepra hearing</a> discussing complaints of overbilling and requests for a negative FCA.</p>
<p>The regulator had called the public hearing on the request of XWDiscos seeking a negative quarterly adjustment of Rs1.80 per unit to refund about Rs53.4 billion to consumers from August to October. The refund stems from savings in capacity payments during the fourth quarter (April-June) of FY2025.</p></p>

                <h2>PM Shehbaz calls for national policy to address rapid population growth</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called for an immediate national policy to address Pakistan‚Äôs rapid population growth rate on Thursday.</p>
<p>Pakistan is home to a vast population of over 251 million, according to World Bank <a class="link--external" href="https://data.worldbank.org/country/pakistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">figures</a>. In 2023, the population growth rate was reported to have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1829245">reached</a> around 2.55 per cent. However, almost forty-five per cent of Pakistan‚Äôs population lives <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915759">below</a> the poverty line, according to a World Bank report.</p>
<p>The prime minister termed the high population growth rate an ‚Äúalarming trend‚Äù and said that immediate and coordinated policy action was required at a national level to address the issue. The World Bank <a class="link--external" href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.GROW?locations=PK" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> Pakistan‚Äôs annual growth rate for 2024 as 1.5pc.</p>
<p>The statement came during a high-level meeting chaired by the premier at his office to review the challenges posed by Pakistan‚Äôs rising population and deliberate on effective strategies to manage it, according to a statement from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office.</p>
<p>The meeting was also attended by Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal, Federal Minister for Education Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousaf and Federal Minister for Law Azam Nazeer Tarar, along with senior officials from institutions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe need comprehensive planning to ensure our growing population, especially the youth, becomes a productive part of the economy,‚Äù PM Shehbaz stressed.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúA large segment of our population comprises young people, who are the most valuable asset for our country.‚Äù</p>
<p>He emphasised that the government was taking several initiatives to empower the youth and integrate them into the country‚Äôs economic mainstream.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOpportunities are being created to enable our youth to play a central role in national development,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>Speaking on gender inclusion, Shehbaz underlined the critical importance of women‚Äôs participation in the workforce.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWomen constitute a significant portion of our human capital. We must ensure greater employment opportunities for them,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The premier instructed the formation of a committee to develop a comprehensive and effective national policy, in close collaboration with provincial governments.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA unified and strategic response is the need of the hour,‚Äù he said, calling for a coordinated federal-provincial framework to tackle population-related issues.</p>
<p>He also stressed the importance of launching a nationwide awareness campaign to educate citizens about the implications of unchecked population growth, especially in the context of sustainable economic development.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the premier was briefed on various proposals and recommendations to manage population growth. Officials stressed that any long-term solution would require active provincial collaboration and public engagement at the grassroots level.</p>
<p>Last month, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923451/population-growth-rate-in-pakistan-alarming-health-minister">said</a> that population growth in Pakistan has reached an alarming level. He highlighted the wide-ranging consequences of the demographic challenge, including over 25m children currently being out of school and overcrowding at government hospitals.</p>
<p>In June, parliamentarians unanimously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919941">approved</a> a resolution on population stabilisation and vowed to table it in the National Assembly.</p></p>
