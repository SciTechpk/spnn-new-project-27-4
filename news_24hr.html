            <p><p>At least 22 people, including women and children, were rescued on Monday after part of a building collapsed in Karachi’s Kharadar, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>According to information from Edhi and Rescue 1122, no casualties or injuries have been reported at the building, which is located near M Suleman Mithaiwala.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassan Ul Haseeb Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the bridge connecting two buildings at the sixth floor had collapsed, leaving residents on higher floors stranded.</p>
<p>He noted that the bridge was an old and dilapidated part of the building whose structure may have been weakened in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920412">recent rains</a>.</p>
<p>“The building has been vacated and declared unlivable because it might collapse any time,” Khan said.</p>
<p>“There were difficulties during the rescue operation as it was an old area of the city where it is difficult to commission snorkels due to the congested locality.</p>
<p>“Besides people living in adjoining residential buildings refused to vacate, claiming their building was safe and questioning why the need to leave,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that a huge crowd had gathered at the site of the incident and it was difficult to move machinery.</p>
<p>As soon as Rescue 1122 Central Command and Control received information of the incident, the Urban Search and Rescue Team, along with one ambulance and one disaster response vehicle reached the scene, Khan said.</p></p>

            <p><p>Federal Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb departed from Islamabad on Monday for Seville, Spain to participate in the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development (FFD4) being held from July 1 to 3, 2025, according to a statement issued by his ministry .</p>

On July 1, he will co-chair the multi-stakeholder roundtable on “Leveraging Private Business and Finance”, and deliver a keynote address at the International Business Forum (IBF) Policy Dialogue on “Accelerating EMDEs (Emerging Market and Developing Economies) Investment: The Role of Credit Ratings”.</p>
<p>He is also scheduled to address the general debate of the conference and participate in the roundtable discussion on “Revitalising International Development Cooperation”.</p>
<p>As part of a side event hosted by Unicef, the minister will speak on “Driving Capital Towards Children and Young People: A Dialogue on Innovative and Sustainable Financing for Children”.</p>

<p>During the conference, Aurangzeb will also attend and speak as chief guest at a special session titled “Swapping Out Debt for Development: The DCS (Distributed Control System) Financing Approach”, where he will outline Pakistan’s perspectives on debt transformation and the potential of deposit protection mechanisms to support development finance.</p>
<p>He will also be a panelist at the IBF’s side event on “Scaling Up SME Finance”, focusing on enhanced financial inclusion for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p>In addition to his conference engagements, the finance minister will hold bilateral meetings with key international figures, including International Chamber of Commerce Secretary-General John WH Denton AO and Vice Minister for Development of the Kingdom of the Netherlands Steven Collet.</p>
<p>“The finance minister’s participation at FFD4 underscores Pakistan’s commitment to promoting innovative financing solutions, strengthening international cooperation, and enhancing the country’s voice in global development discourse,” the statement concluded.</p></p>

            <p><p>More than 230,000 Afghans left Iran in June, most of them deported, as returns surge ahead of a Tehran-set deadline, the United Nations migration agency said on Monday.</p>
<p>From June 1-28, 233,941 people returned from Iran to Afghanistan, International Organisation for Migration spokesman Avand Azeez Agha told <em>AFP</em>, with 131,912 returns recorded in the week of June 21-28 alone.</p>
<p>“In total, from 1 January to 28 June 2025, 691,049 people have returned, 70 percent of whom were forcibly sent back,” he said.</p>

<p>The number of returnees surged in recent weeks, as Afghans reported increased deportations and pressure to leave ahead of a July 6 deadline announced by Iran in May for Afghans without documents to leave the country.</p>
<p>For several days last week, the number reached 30,000 per day, the IOM said.</p>
<p>Figures have remained around 6-7,000 in recent days, Taliban border authorities and the UN said, with the numbers expected to increase ahead of the deadline.</p></p>
