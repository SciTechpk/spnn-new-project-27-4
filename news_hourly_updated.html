<p>Meanwhile, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued a landslide alert amid floods triggered by heavy rains.</p>
<p>A day ago, at least four tourists were killed, two others injured, and 15 went missing due to the floods in GB‚Äôs Babusar area in Diamer district. The devastating impacts of climate cha¬≠nge have become more visible in GB as cloudburst-induced floods wreaked havoc across the region.</p>
<p>The provincial government spokesperson, Faizullah Faraq, said in a statement,  ‚ÄúMore than 200 rescued tourists have been shifted to Chilas and provided shelter in hotels and guest houses.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that the tourists were now able to contact their families after being stranded for hours.</p>
<p>Faraq detailed that rescue operations were still underway to look for missing tourists, while the deceased ones have been identified.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe military is participating in the rescue operation, and helicopters will be brought in for rescue, if necessary,‚Äù he said in the statement.</p>
<p>On Monday, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abdul Hameed told <em>Dawn</em> that 20 to 30 tourists from different parts of the country might be missing.</p>
<p>According to rescue authorities in Skardu‚Äôs WhatsApp channel, three people were injured due to the flood in Sadpara, while the deluge has also hit the Kharmang district.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe rescue operation was launched again at 6am today,‚Äù <em>AFP</em> reported the spokesperson as saying.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, spokesperson for the Baltistan Division Police Department Ghulam Muhammad said in a statement that ‚ÄúIn Deosai, 413 tourist vehicles were stranded on the road connecting Sapara and Deosai, after it was closed at ten different points due to the floods.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to his statement, the stranded people have been rescued by the police and shifted to Skardu.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe flood water entered homes and caused severe damage to public infrastructure and crops,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Outlining the damage, the GB govt spokesperson said that ‚Äúmore than 50 houses have been damaged in the flood since yesterday.‚Äù</p>
<p>In Babusar, a wheat depot, a girls‚Äô school, a police checkpoint, a tourism police shelter, and four bridges have been washed away, while two mosques and a windmill have also been damaged.‚Äú</p>
<p>A local social worker, Muhammad Ali, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that, ‚ÄúThirty vehicles were swept away by the floods, and most people have been rescued by the locals.‚Äù</p>
<p>Faraq shared that construction has begun on the restoration of highways and connecting roads, after the floods damaged a portion of the Karakoram Highway (KKH), leaving thousands of tourists and passengers stranded on both sides.</p>

                <h2>Pakistan signs UN pact to conserve marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan on Monday signed a United Nations (UN) agreement aimed at conserving marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, the Foreign Office (FO) said.</p>
<p>In 2015, Pakistan‚Äôs seabed territory <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1170986">grew</a> by about 50,000 square kilometres after a UN body accepted Islamabad‚Äôs claim for extension of sea limits.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar signed the ‚ÄúAgreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction‚Äù (<a class="link--external" href="https://www.un.org/bbnjagreement/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BBNJ Agreement</a>) at the UN Headquarters in New York.</p>
<p>The BBNJ pact is the third implementing agreement under the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/legal/pages/unitednationsconventiononthelawofthesea.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UN Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> (Unclos), which was adopted in 1982 and entered into force in 1994.</p>

<p>Pakistan signing the BBNJ agreement ‚Äúreflects on its commitment to multilateral cooperation and protection and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction‚Äù, the FO noted in a <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/pakistan-signs-agreement-under-unclos-on-the-conservation-and-sustainable-use-of-marine-biological-diversity-of-areas-beyond-national-jurisdiction-bbnj-agreement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>The BBNJ agreement was adopted on 19 June 2023 by an intergovernmental conference.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan played a leading role in the negotiations to finalise the treaty,‚Äù the FO highlighted in a post on X.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs chair of the Group of 77 and China during the two main sessions, Pakistan, representing developing countries, endeavoured to promote equity, in line with the principle of the common heritage of humankind.‚Äù</p>

<p>The FO statement recalled that Pakistan ‚Äúconsistently advocated for fair benefit-sharing, capacity-building, and technology transfer‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to the UN, the BBNJ agreement addresses four main issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Marine genetic resources, including the fair and equitable sharing of benefits</li>
<li>Measures such as area-based management tools, including marine protected areas</li>
<li>Environmental impact assessments</li>
<li>Capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Unclos, under which the BBNJ pact falls, <a class="link--external" href="https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/legal/pages/unitednationsconventiononthelawofthesea.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lays down</a> a ‚Äúcomprehensive regime of law and order for the world‚Äôs oceans, establishing rules for the allocation of states‚Äô rights and jurisdiction in maritime spaces, the peaceful use of the oceans and the management of their resources‚Äù.</p>

<p>Within Pakistan‚Äôs territory, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1861305">Churna Island</a> was last year <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856910">designated</a> as the country‚Äôs second-ever marine protected area in a bid to preserve its unique but eroding biodiversity.</p>
<p>In 2020, experts found ‚Äúamazing wildlife‚Äù, well-diversified bird fauna, rich marine habitat and dozens of species of corals at <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1596694">Astola Island</a> in Balochistan.</p></p>
