                <h2>Escalating tensions with India to impact Pakistan‚Äôs economic growth: Moody‚Äôs</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Global rating agency Moody‚Äôs on Monday said that escalating tensions between India and Pakistan would weigh on Pakistan‚Äôs economic growth.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> on April 22 in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe.</a></p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India‚Äôs premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/india-gives-army-operational-freedom-to-respond-to-pahalgam-attack">granting</a> ‚Äúoperational freedom‚Äù to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the military warning of a ‚Äúswift‚Äù response to any misadventure by New Delhi, diplomatic channels have remained <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907930/us-hopes-that-indias-response-to-pahalgam-attack-doesnt-lead-to-broader-regional-conflict-vance">engaged</a> to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.moodys.com/researchandratings/region/asia-pacific/pakistan/042004" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">note</a>, the rating agency stated: ‚ÄúSustained escalation in tensions with India would likely weigh on Pakistan‚Äôs growth and hamper the government‚Äôs ongoing fiscal consolidation, setting back Pakistan‚Äôs progress in achieving macroeconomic stability.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>On Pakistan‚Äôs economic trajectory, it said that its macroeconomic indicators had been improving, with growth gradually rising, inflationary pressure easing and foreign exchange reserves increasing amid ‚Äúcontinued progress‚Äù in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.</p>
<p>However, the agency noted that ‚Äúa persistent increase in tensions could also impair Pakistan‚Äôs access to external financing and pressure its foreign exchange reserves, which remain well below what is required to meet its external debt payment needs for the next few years‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia and Pakistan‚Äôs diplomatic relations have deteriorated,‚Äù the agency said, recalling Information Minister Attaullah Tarar‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">statement</a> that Pakistan expected a military action by India.</p>
<p>Notably, the agency warned that India‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">suspension</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">1960 Indus Waters Treaty</a> could ‚Äúseverely reduce Pakistan‚Äôs water supply‚Äù.</p>
<p>In comparison, Moody‚Äôs said that the macroeconomic conditions in India would remain stable, propelled by ‚Äúmoderating but still high levels of growth amid strong public investment and healthy private consumption‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn a scenario of sustained escalation in localised tensions, we do not expect major disruptions to India‚Äôs economic activity because it has minimal economic relations with Pakistan,‚Äù it said, adding that the country accounted for less than 0.5 per cent of India‚Äôs total exports in 2024.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>However, it did stress that higher <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1888023">defence spending</a> could impact on India‚Äôs ‚Äúfiscal strength and slow its fiscal consolidation‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur geopolitical risk assessment for Pakistan and India accounts for persistent tensions, which have, at times, led to limited military responses,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>It predicted that flare-ups ‚Äúwill occur periodically‚Äù as they have throughout the neighbouring countries‚Äô post-independence history. However, they will not lead to an ‚Äúoutright, broad-based military conflict‚Äù, it added.</p></p>

                <h2>Pahalgam attack attempt to divert attention from India‚Äôs cross-border terrorism: Dar</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday said that a recent attack in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam was an attempt to ‚Äúdivert attention‚Äù from India‚Äôs internal challenges and its cross-border terrorism.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India, without investigation or evidence, implied ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack%20were%20brought%20out">cross-border linkages</a>‚Äù of the att¬≠a¬≠¬≠¬≠c¬≠kers. Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">firmly</a> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315/pahalgam-attack-fm-dar-throws-down-gauntlet-to-india-asks-for-evidence-of-allegations-against-pakistan">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> as it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an incursion and India‚Äôs premier granting ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>‚Äù to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war">military</a> warning of a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907785/any-military-misadventure-by-india-will-be-met-with-swift-resolute-notch-up-response-coas">swift</a>‚Äù response to any misadventure by New Delhi, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907930/us-hopes-that-indias-response-to-pahalgam-attack-doesnt-lead-to-broader-regional-conflict-vance">diplomatic channels</a> have remained engaged to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>Addressing the Regional Dialogue 2025 in Islamabad today, organised by the Institute of Regional Studies, Dar said Pakistan believed the Pahalgam attack was part of an effort to ‚Äúdivert attention‚Äù from India‚Äôs internal challenges, adding that it could be ‚Äúself-choreographed‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe believe that what has happened is to divert attention ‚Äî I am talking of Pahalgam ‚Äî from India‚Äôs internal challenges, state-sponsored terrorism, the ongoing human rights violations in the Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir, and to gain narrow domestic political objectives,‚Äù Dar said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget that there are some by-elections coming in the next few months in India,‚Äù he added, referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907658">upcoming polls in Bihar</a> in October.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis brinkmanship carries consequences that extend far beyond India‚Äôs borders,‚Äù the deputy PM warned, calling India‚Äôs actions ‚Äúunilateral, politically-motivated and highly provocative‚Äù.</p>
<p>He noted: ‚ÄúThere appears to be a calculated and premeditated attempt to escalate regional tensions, following a familiar pattern ‚Äî level allegations against Pakistan without evidence, use inflammatory rhetoric, incite war hysteria and use this as a pretext for aggression and unilateral actions.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a reference to the Indian government, Dar stressed that regional and international peace and security could not be ‚Äúsacrificed at the altar of narrow electoral gains‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is a dangerous political game and gamble, putting at stake the lives of millions in the region,‚Äù the foreign minister highlighted. However, he also reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to regional peace: ‚ÄúWe will support all efforts towards de-escalation.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnalysts say this could be another ploy. It might have been self-choreographed,‚Äù echoing Pakistani leaders‚Äô previous statements of the Pahalgam attack being a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906207">false flag operation</a>‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow can an FIR (first information report) be registered in 10 minutes at a police station where you need at least 45 minutes to reach? [‚Ä¶] Come on. Nobody‚Äôs a fool,‚Äù Dar quipped.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInternational dignitaries are talking [to] both sides. Few of them ‚Äî great friends ‚Äî suggested to me, ‚ÄòCan you try and help the perpetrators be caught?‚Äô I said ‚Äòcome on, do you know the distance where it happened and where‚Äôs the Line of Control? 230 kilometres.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI cannot find the word abeyance in any international treaties‚Äô dictionary. The word suspension is there.‚Äù</p>

<p>The two discussed matters of bilateral importance, with a particular focus on the ongoing situation between Pakistan and India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>The Chinese ambassador reaffirmed the ‚Äúenduring and time-tested friendship between China and Pakistan‚Äù, describing the relationship as one of ‚Äúironclad brothers‚Äù who have always supported each other in challenging times.</p>
<p>He thanked Zardari for sharing Pakistan‚Äôs perspective, and emphasised that China would always support its ally to achieve the common desire of both countries to secure peace and stability in South Asia.</p>

<p>Zaradari conveyed his deep appreciation and gratitude to the Chinese government for its ‚Äúconsistent support, always standing by Pakistan in difficult times‚Äù.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907760">thanked China‚Äôs envoy</a> for endorsing his offer to conduct a neutral probe into the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>Last week, China had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907094/china-urges-india-pakistan-to-exercise-restraint-after-pahalgam-attack">urged</a> both India and Pakistan to ‚Äúexercise restraint‚Äù as the two countries reportedly exchanged fire at the Line of Control (LoC).</p>
<p>As Pakistan continues diplomatic engagement with various countries to brief them on the ongoing situation, PM Shehbaz yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908460#:~:text=Prime%20Minister%20Shehbaz%20Sharif%20talked%20to%20his%20Malaysian%20counterpart%2C%20while%20Foreign%20Minister%20Ishaq%20Dar%20spoke%20to%20the%20Malaysian%20as%20well%20as%20Russian%20foreign%20ministers">spoke</a> to his Malaysian counterpart, while Dar spoke to the foreign ministers of Malaysia and Russia.</p>

<p>A day ago, Islamabad decided to seek an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908460">immediate session</a> of the United Nations Security Council to apprise world powers about the recent tensions with India.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Foreign Office said FM Dar has issued directions to Pakistan‚Äôs permanent representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar, to take immediate steps for the UNSC session.</p>
<p>The instructions came two days after Ambassador Iftikhar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908062">said</a> Pakistan was closely following the situation stemming from India‚Äôs aggressive moves in the wake of the Pahalgam attack and would seek a UNSC meeting at an appropriate time.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis important diplomatic move is part of Pakistan‚Äôs efforts to present true facts before the international community,‚Äù the statement said, adding that Pakistan decided to formally brief the UNSC on the latest situation in the region, as well as India‚Äôs aggressive steps and provocative statements.</p>
<p>It said Pakistan would specifically highlight the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty by India.</p></p>
