                <h2>Pakistan envoy to US calls on world to resolve Kashmir dispute, terms it ‚Äòcore issue‚Äô of enmity with India</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan‚Äôs envoy to the United States has called on the global community to resolve the Kashmir dispute, terming it the ‚Äúcore issue‚Äù of the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284/trade-ties-and-flights-off-limits-as-pakistan-retaliates-to-indias-moves">complete breakdown</a> of ties with India in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> as it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an incursion and India‚Äôs premier granting ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>‚Äù to his military. As temperatures remain high, with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war">military</a> warning of a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907785/any-military-misadventure-by-india-will-be-met-with-swift-resolute-notch-up-response-coas"> resolute</a>‚Äù response to any misadventure by New Delhi, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907930/us-hopes-that-indias-response-to-pahalgam-attack-doesnt-lead-to-broader-regional-conflict-vance">diplomatic channels</a> have been engaged to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt could be an important part of President [Donald] Trump‚Äôs legacy to attend to this situation ‚Äî not with a Band-Aid solution, but by addressing the core issue: the Kashmir dispute,‚Äù Pakistan‚Äôs Ambassador to the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855847">Rizwan Saeed Sheikh</a> said in an interview with <em>Fox News Digital</em> published earlier today.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is one nuclear flashpoint,‚Äù the envoy said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Sheikh‚Äôs statement echoes his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907760/pm-shehbaz-thanks-china-for-endorsing-pakistans-proposal-of-neutral-probe-into-pahalgam-attack#:~:text=Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20envoy%20calls%20on%20Trump%20to%20ease%20tensions%20with%20India%3A%20report">recent call to Trump</a> to step in and help ease soaring tensions with India. He had highlighted that as a president ‚Äústanding for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration‚Äù, there was no ‚Äúhigher or flashier flashpoint‚Äù than the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>Trump, in his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=Overseas%20wars%20and%20plans%20for%20peace">inaugural speech</a> as the US president, had said: ‚ÄúMy proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.‚Äù</p>
<p>A ceasefire ‚Äî which has since been broken ‚Äî was secured between <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886289">Israel and Hamas</a> following Trump‚Äôs election, and he has also been engaging with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906950">Ukraine and Russia</a> to halt their war.</p>
<p>During his interview with <em>Fox News</em>, Sheikh also called on nations around the globe to help with a lasting settlement to the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>He said: ‚ÄúPreviously, when the situation has been at this level or the tensions have escalated, the international community has attended to the situation, but taken their eyes [and] attention away, even before the situation could fully diffuse.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis time, perhaps it would be [‚Ä¶] timely in terms of the situation elsewhere on the globe, with similar instances, [‚Ä¶] to perhaps not afford a Band-Aid solution, but to address the broader problem.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúAny misadventure or miscalculation can lead to a nuclear interface,‚Äù the ambassador was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúThat is certainly not desirable in such a densely populated region.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe want a peaceful neighbourhood,‚Äù Sheikh emphasised, adding that Pakistan did not want any instability in the region.</p>
<p>However, he stressed, Pakistan‚Äôs desire for peace ‚Äúshould not in any way be misconstrued as a sign of weakness‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe want peace with dignity.‚Äù</p>
<p>Sheikh described India‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">response</a> to the Pahalgam attack as dangerously premature and inflammatory, according to the report.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The envoy reiterated Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif‚Äôs offer to hold a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral and transparent</a>‚Äù probe into the Pahalgam attack. He pointed out that both the investigation offer and Pakistan‚Äôs request for evidence linking it to the attack had gone ‚Äúunanswered‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWithin minutes of the attack, India began levelling accusations against Pakistan,‚Äù he said, noting that a post-investigation report was filed just 10 minutes after the incident occurred, despite the remote and rugged terrain near the scene.</p>
<p>The ambassador warned that the region was once again being held ‚Äúhostage to the war of hysteria‚Äù by India‚Äôs government and media, who immediately ‚Äúbegan beating war drums‚Äù.</p>
<p>On the allegations implied by India, which has not yet named Pakistan or any entity directly, Sheikh said the suspects were reportedly Indian nationals whose homes have already been raided.</p>
<p>He questioned why India is looking outside its borders rather than addressing ‚Äúadministrative inadequacies‚Äù in occupied Kashmir. He slammed India‚Äôs broader policies in held Kashmir, including the alleged settlement of non-residents into the region.</p>

<p>Speaking about India‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unilateral suspension</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>, Ambassador Sheikh said: ‚ÄúThat is as grossly illegal as it can get. This is one treaty that has withstood wars between India and Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>Law Minister Azam Naz¬≠eer Tarar said yesterday that Pakistan‚Äôs final response to India‚Äôs letters on the IWT <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908128/multiple-ministries-to-craft-pakistans-response-on-iwt">would be crafted</a> in consultation with all relevant ministries, including foreign affairs, water resources and law.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik has also said Islamabad would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907454">approach international forums</a>, including the World Bank that brokered it, regarding the treaty‚Äôs suspension.</p></p>

                <h2>India bans imports from Pakistan in yet another post-Pahalgam attack move</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>India said it has banned the import of goods originating from or transiting via Pakistan as diplomatic tensions between the two nuclear-armed nations flared in the wake of a deadly attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">killed 26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000.

<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing</a> its forces and India‚Äôs premier granting ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>‚Äù to the military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of April 30, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an Indian incursion within 24‚Äì36 hours, diplomatic channels have been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension">engaged</a> to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.dgft.gov.in/CP/?opt=notification" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a> said the ban will take effect immediately.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis restriction is imposed in the interest of national security and public policy,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>In response to India‚Äôs slew of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">aggressive measures</a> against the country in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan announced <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284">retaliatory measures</a> that have included halting all border trade, closing its airspace to Indian carriers and expelling Indian diplomats.</p>
<p>However, Pakistan on May 1 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907774/govt-allows-150-stranded-afghan-trucks-to-cross-wagah-border-for-goods-delivery">allowed</a> 150 stranded Afghan trucks carrying goods for India to cross the Wagah Border, easing a weeks-long bottleneck, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.</p>
<p>Trade between the two nations has dwindled over the last few years.</p>
<p>In August 2019, Pakistan had already <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1499076">formally downgraded</a> its trade relations with India to the level of Israel, with which Islamabad has no trade ties at all ‚Äî in reaction to New Delhi‚Äôs decision to revoke Article 370 of its constitution that granted occupied Kashmir a special status.</p></p>
