<p>‚ÄúAs iron-clad brothers and all-weather strategic cooperative partners, we remain committed to deepening Pak-China enduring friendship and advancing shared regional goals,‚Äù he posted on X.</p>

            </a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) continued its upward trajectory on Tuesday to cross the 137,000 barrier in intra-day trading, amid continued investor optimism and improved economic outlook.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,237.03 points, or 0.91 per cent, to stand at 137,739.56 points at 11:39am, from the previous close of 136,502.53 points.</p>
<p>The market opened on a positive note, rising by 1,205.1 points, or 0.88pc, from yesterday‚Äôs close to reach 137,707.63 points at 9:45am. It then dropped to 136,498.16 points at 10:15am before regaining its bullish momentum. The total volume of shares is 152m valued at Rs11.87bn.</p>
<p>The PSX has continued its upward trend from last week, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924253/psx-settles-above-136500-points-a-new-record">crossing</a> the 136,500 level on Monday due to value-hunting by investors and optimism over strong corporate earnings.</p>
<p>The rally was supported by active participation from local mutual funds and institutional investors.</p>

<p>Workers‚Äô remittances rose to a historic $3.4bn in June, up 8pc year-on-year, taking full-year FY25 inflows to a record $38.3bn ‚Äî a 27pc increase over the previous year. The State Bank of Pakistan‚Äôs foreign exchange reserves surged by $1.8bn to $14.5bn for the week ending July 4, marking a 39-month high.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923868/equities-surge-past-134000-points-in-record-breaking-week">previous week</a> saw the stock market continue its record-breaking <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920553">bullish run</a>, crossing the 134,000-point threshold amid strong macroeconomic fundamentals and persistent buying by local mutual funds.</p>
