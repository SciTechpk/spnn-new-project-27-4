            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924143/pti-protests-aim-to-destabilise-country-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>PTI protests aim to destabilise country: Sanaullah</strong></a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Monday criticised the PTI for seeking dialogue with the establishment instead of talking with politicians, suggesting the party only wanted to “destabilise the country with protests”.</p>
<p>His statement came as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, a day prior, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923918">called</a> on state institutions to engage in dialogue with the PTI but demanded that they hold themselves accountable. Gandapur and the PTI’s top leadership were on a visit to Lahore to formally launch a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923856/pti-brass-gathers-in-lahore-to-kick-start-aug-5-movement">movement</a> to seek the release of party founder Imran Khan and devise a strategy for its nationwide protest, which will reach its crescendo on August 5 — marking two years since the ex-premier was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a>.</p>
<p>Since Imran’s incarceration in several cases, which he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1890696#:~:text=He%20claimed%20that%20four%20convictions%20against%20him%20were%20politically%20motivated">claims</a> are politically motivated, his party’s relationship with the government and the establishment has turned <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832432">sour</a>. The PTI has held several <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875003/day-of-clashes-in-islamabad-ends-in-pti-protesters-retreat">protests</a> over the last year, most of which escalated into <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1857709">violence</a> after facing state repression.</p>
<p>Sanaullah said that Gandapur’s words made it clear that the PTI wanted to “destabilise the country, right after Marka-i-Haq” (referring to the recent Pakistan-India escalation) and the government’s “success in economic revival, which lent Pakistan an opportunity for stability”.</p>
<p>“Besides this, it is unknown what other agenda they have,” he added.</p>
<p>Referring to the planned 90-day and August 5 protests, Sanaullah said, “If they remain peaceful, then it’s fine (…) it is their democratic right. But if they take the law into their own hands and attempt to destabilise the country (…) then the law will take its due course.”</p>
<p>He added that this destabilisation “has been their (PTI’s) agenda from the beginning”, referring to the party demonstrating outside the International Monetary Fund (IMF) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1821812">offices</a> against their granting of an emergency <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845536">loan</a> to Pakistan.</p>
<p>He dismissed the notion that the government, despite being relatively stable now, would consider being more generous in negotiations for Imran’s release, saying that “it had nothing to do with generosity and that the case was proceeding according to the rules of the court.”</p>
<p>He pointed out how it was the PTI’s own stance in previous negotiations that Imran’s release would not be discussed, as the PTI founder himself expressed the desire to be acquitted on his own merit.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>According to Sanaullah, the government was ready to hold talks with the PTI on other issues, but he said that according to the party’s recent calls for negotiations, it “does not want dialogue with the government, but with the establishment”.</p>
<p>“They are not willing to sit down with either political parties or politicians to solve issues,” he said. “They are still stuck on their own agenda, seeking the establishment’s help to put them back into power. They are not ready for political dialogue.”</p>
<p>Asked what counter-demands the government might hold in negotiations, he said, “We have only one wish, one effort, one fight: the revival of Pakistan’s economy and its success, such that every citizen’s wellbeing is ensured and it is included on the map of the world as a welfare state.”</p>
<p>Sanaullah added that the government was ready to sit with the PTI and other parties for talks to ensure the stability required for this effort if they were willing to cooperate.</p>
<p>“It is in everybody’s mutual interest, the opposition and government’s, and everybody should agree on a ‘charter of economy’ on certain basic matters,” he said. “We are ready for any understanding or agreement in this regard.”</p>
<p>The previous day, on <em>Geo News’</em> programme “Naya Pakistan”, Sanaullah had questioned the PTI’s intention of holding negotiations alongside heavy protesting, saying, “If they want to talk, then what is the need for the 90 days, the August 5 [protests] and the march towards Lahore?”</p>
<p>However, he stated that the PTI would be granted legal permission to protest by the local administration if they remained peaceful.</p>
<p>“If they move towards violence, the law will take its course,” he added.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924157/gb-environment-agency-recommends-5-year-ban-on-hotel-construction-near-hunza-lakes' target='_blank'><strong>GB environment agency recommends 5-year ban on hotel construction near Hunza lakes</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency has recommended a five-year ban on the construction and expansion of hotels on three famous lakes in Hunza, it emerged on Monday.</p>
<p>Last month, the GB administration <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917714">imposed</a> a fine of Rs1.5 million on a hotel for allegedly dumping sewage waste into Attabad Lake.</p>
<p>The development came a day after a foreign tourist and vlogger named George Buckley posted a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DK89E5soiTM/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> on his Instagram page, claiming that sewage water was being pumped out by the hotel into the Attabad Lake.</p>
<p>In a letter addressed to the Hunza deputy commissioner dated July 1, available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, the agency recommended an “Immediate halt to new hotel constructions in central Hunza lacking proper wastewater systems and a five-year moratorium on all hotel-related construction and expansion in central Hunza, Duikar, Attabad, and Borit Lake[s]”.</p>
<p>The letter also called for a complete ban on construction along the banks of Borit Lake, with strict regulation of boating and its notification as an eco-tourism destination to protect its ecological function.</p>
<p>The recommendations state that environmental problems are becoming critical due to hotels built on the culturally important lakes of Attabad, Duiker, and Borit in central Hunza.</p>
<p>According to the letter, a recent investigation into improper disposal of sewage by hotels had revealed facts of unorganised and shoddy construction and also identified shortcomings such as inadequate wastewater discharge systems and construction defects.</p>
<p>The report said that this unregulated and unsupervised development is compromising public health, freshwater resources, and sustainable development of the tourism sector, and is causing destruction to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>It further stated that the sewage disposal system of hotels is outdated, ineffective and low capacity, resulting in water channels and the Hunza River being directly polluted.</p>
<p>The report has diclosed that when the drinking water was tested in this poor situation, sewage contamination was confirmed, posing the risks of typhoid, dysentery and hepatitis.</p>
<p>According to the report, the widespread use of diesel-powered generators by hotels is also causing air pollution, which is posing a respiratory hazard to tourists. It added that this practice is contrary to the concept of a clean, environmentally friendly place.</p>
<p>The report also shed light on the situation of Duiker Lake. Due to the uncontrolled construction of hotels, the environment at this lake is rapidly deteriorating.</p>
<p>The agency expressed fear that inadequate sewage and poor human waste disposal arrangements are damaging the fragile mountain environment of the area.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The report recommends a five-year ban on all new construction and hotel expansion around Attabad Lake to help protect water quality, maintain ecological balance, and protect it from natural disasters, especially floods and landslides, as well as ensure the constant availability of clean drinking water.</p>
<p>The agency recommends that boating and tourist activities in the lake should be restricted for this purpose. The report says that the lake is a protected area under Section 172 of the Forest Act 2019. It is an important habitat for migratory and endangered bird species.</p>
<p>“However, boating activities here are creating a disturbing situation for nesting and movement of birds in this place, which is seriously damaging the international importance and ecological functions of the lake,” the letter said.</p>
<p>The GB-EPA called for a transition to eco-friendly, community-based tourism is urgently needed. This model ensures:</p>
<p>“With responsible tourism policies, Hunza can become a global benchmark for sustainable mountain tourism,” the letter said.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924158/us-president-trump-teases-major-statement-on-russia-ahead-of-nato-talks' target='_blank'><strong>US President Trump teases ‘major statement’ on Russia ahead of Nato talks</strong></a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump is hosting the Nato chief in Washington on Monday after teasing a “major statement” on Russia’s war in Ukraine, with senior Republicans preparing an arsenal of sanctions against Moscow.</p>
<p>Trump, seeking to negotiate an end to the three-year war, has expressed growing impatience with the Kremlin leader and over the weekend announced a fresh weapons <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923386/trump-to-use-presidential-authority-to-send-arms-to-ukraine">cache</a> for Ukraine.</p>
<p>“We will send them Patriots, which they desperately need,” Trump said on Sunday, referring to the air defence system. He did not specify how many weapons he would send, but added that he would make a “major statement … on Russia” on Monday, when Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte will be in Washington.</p>
<p>The White House has U-turned from an announcement earlier this month that it would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921665/ukraine-left-scrambling-after-us-says-halting-some-arms-shipments">pause</a> some arms deliveries to Kyiv, instead announcing a new deal which would involve Nato <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922174/berlin-offers-to-buy-us-air-defence-system-for-kyiv">purchasing</a> some US weapons to send to Ukraine.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_237029.htm?selectedLocale=en&amp;mode=pressrelease" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, Nato said Rutte will be in Washington on Monday and Tuesday and will also meet with Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p>
<p>Rutte’s 10am (7pm PKT) Oval Office meeting on Monday will be closed to the media.</p>
<p>“We basically are going to send them various pieces of very sophisticated military and they’re going to pay us 100 per cent for them,” Trump said. “It’ll be business for us.”</p>
<p>Trump also repeated that he was “disappointed” in Putin, as he grows increasingly exasperated with the Russian leader.</p>
<p>“Putin really surprised a lot of people. He talks nice and then he bombs everybody in the evening,” Trump said on Sunday, as he returned from watching the FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Last week, Trump accused Putin of throwing “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922956">bullshit</a>” at Washington on Ukraine, openly frustrated with the impasse on peace efforts.</p>
<p>As he began his second stint in office in January, Trump insisted he could work with the Russian leader to end the war in Ukraine swiftly, and held off on hiking sanctions, unlike Kyiv’s European allies.</p>
<p>But Russia has for months refused a ceasefire proposed by the United States and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Trump has hinted he might be ready to slap sanctions on Moscow as momentum grows for a deterrent package in Congress. When asked about whether he would announce any levies against Russia, Trump responded: “We’re going to see what we will see tomorrow, OK?” and repeated plans to meet with Rutte.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#sledgehammer" id="sledgehammer" title="Permalink"></a>‘Sledgehammer’</h2>
<p>Republican senators, meanwhile, are touting a bipartisan bill that would arm Trump with a “sledgehammer” to use against Russia.</p>
<p>The sanctions bill would allow Trump “to go after Putin’s economy, and all those countries who prop up the Putin war machine,” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told broadcaster <em>CBS News</em>.</p>
<p>It “would give President Trump the ability to impose 500pc tariffs on any country that helps Russia,” said Graham, adding that those could include economies that purchase Russian goods like China, India or Brazil.</p>
<p>“This is truly a sledgehammer available to President Trump to end this war,” said Graham.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Graham and Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal were also due to meet Nato’s Rutte on Monday.</p>
<p>Blumenthal told <em>CBS News</em> they would also discuss the legally thorny issue of unlocking frozen Russian assets in Europe and the United States for access by Ukraine.</p>
<p>“The $5 billion that the United States has also could be accessed, and I think it’s time to do it,” said Blumenthal.</p>
<p>Zelensky said the proposed bill “is exactly the kind of leverage that can bring peace closer and make sure diplomacy is not empty”.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has previously said that sending arms to Ukraine would only prolong the conflict.</p>
<p>Putin launched the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676939">full-scale invasion</a> of Ukraine in 2022 and has shown little appetite for ending the conflict despite pressure from Trump.</p>
<p>Over the summer, Russia has escalated its offensive and advanced the front line, launching some of the largest missile and drone attacks of the war.</p></p>
