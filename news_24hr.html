            <p><p>Rescue teams pulled more bodies from the rubble of a five-storey <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922231">building collapse</a> in Karachi overnight, taking the toll on Saturday to 15 as the recovery operation continued for a second day,</p>
<p>The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, which was further weakened by recent rains, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922231#:~:text=DIG%20South%20Syed%20Asad%20Raza%20told%20Dawn">said</a> Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza.</p>
<p>Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed confirmed to <em>Dawn.com</em> that the toll had risen to 15.</p>
<p>“Rescue operation is still underway in Baghdadi, Lyari where the building had collapsed on Friday,” DIG Raza told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>

<p>Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.</p>
<p>Karachi, home to more than 20 million, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.</p>
<p>The deceased included nine men, six women and a child, according to a statement by Rescue 1122. Their bodies had been taken to the Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK). Five others were injured, the rescue service said.</p>
<p>However, a list of casualties provided by Dr Syed stated that the deceased included six men, as many women, a girl and a boy.</p>
<p>Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, leading the Rescue 1122 efforts at the scene, told <em>AFP</em> the operation continued through the night “without interruption”. “It may take eight to 12 hours more to complete,” he said.</p>
<p>Up to 100 people had been living in the building, senior police officer Arif Aziz told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>The incident came days after a portion of a building <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921188/no-casualties-reported-as-22-rescued-from-partially-collapsed-building-in-karachis-kharadar">collapsed</a> in the city’s Kharadar area. However, no casualties or injuries were reported.</p>
<p>The Public Account Committee of the Sindh Assembly had directed the provincial government in December to take urgent steps to evacuate over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879565">570 buildings</a> declared “dangerous” by authorities across Karachi.</p>

<p>Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922231#:~:text=Rescue%201122%20spokesperson%20Hassaanul%20Haseeb%20Khan%20told%20Dawn">said</a> the incident had reportedly occurred between 9am and 9:30am. However, they said they received the information late due to the suspension of communication networks, he added.</p>
<p>Mobile services are usually <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920725/army-to-be-deployed-across-country-for-security-during-muharram#:~:text=It%20was%20also%20agreed%20that%20any%20decision%20to%20suspend%20internet%20or%20mobile%20phone%20services%20will%20be%20made%20in%20consultation%20with%20provinces">suspended</a> in certain areas due to security concerns during Muharram.</p>
<p>Sindh Rescue 1122 Director General (DG) Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, in a statement, said yesterday there were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=Rescue%20DG%20lists%20%E2%80%98hinderances%E2%80%99%20in%20operations">hindrances</a> during the rescue operation due to the “unruly crowd, various road blockades and mobile network [issues]”.</p>
<p>Heavy machinery faced difficulty in reaching the site amid the narrow alleys of Lyari, a low-income neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Police even had to baton-charge a crowd that had gathered around the site to make way for machinery, officials added.</p>
<p>The Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=SBCA%20says%20issued%20multiple%20prior%20notices%20to%20vacate%20building">said</a> it had declared the plot as dangerous through its Technical Committee for Dangerous Buildings after a thorough inspection conducted in October 2022.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The authority said it had issued three ejectment notices to the residents since then, as well as asked K-Electric, Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) to disconnect utility services.</p>
<p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah sought a report on the collapse and details of dilapidated buildings from the SBCA.</p>
<p>Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani said a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=Saeed%20Ghani%20stresses%20timely%20evacuation%20of%20unsafe%20buildings">high-level committee</a> has been formed that will submit a report on the incident by Monday. He lamented that residents did not evacuate the building despite being served notices previously.</p>
<p>The minister also ordered the suspension of the related officials at the SBCA.</p>

            <p><p>KARACHI: <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1658993">Microsoft</a> has decided to close its office in Pakistan and laid off five employees, <em>Dawn</em> has learnt.</p>
<p>Earlier, media reports suggested that the global tech giant had moved its operations out of the country.</p>
<p>These were based on a LinkedIn post by Jawad Rehman, the former head of Microsoft in Pakistan. Citing sources, he claimed the company “is officially closing its operations in Pakistan”.</p>
<p>Microsoft had an on-ground presence in Pakistan until recently, albeit with a significantly reduced local workforce. Most of its operations were handled from foreign offices and by partners in Pakistan, people familiar with the matter told <em>Dawn</em>.</p>
<p>In response to <em>Dawn</em>’s query, a Microsoft spokesperson said, “We will serve our customers through both our strong and extensive partner organisation, and other closely located Microsoft offices. We follow this model successfully in a number of other countries around the world.”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Spokesperson says company to provide services through local partners, offices abroad</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision to move out of Pakistan was part of the company’s ongoing series of layoffs worldwide as it looks to pivot towards artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Microsoft announced it would lay off nearly four per cent of its around 228,000 employees, <em>Reuters</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/microsoft-lay-off-many-9000-employees-seattle-times-reports-2025-07-02/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rep­orted</a>. In May, the company announ­ced layoffs affecting around 6,000 workers.</p>
<p>The company said on Wednesday it planned to manage its operations with fewer managers and streamline its products, procedures and roles.</p>
<p><strong>Evolving business models</strong></p>
<p>In a statement on Wednesday, the IT and Telecommunications ministry said global tech companies are moving from on-premises software deployment to the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. Microsoft’s decision is also reflective of this shift.</p>
<p>According to technology expert Habibullah Khan, large software enterprises have two business models: on-premise and Saas.</p>
<p>Under the former model, the company installs and runs software on the customer’s servers or infrastructure, with hardware and data centres managed internally by customers. The company gets a one-time payment through the sale of licences.</p>
<p>On-premise software deployment is a capital-intensive model and results in high upfront costs with recurring needs for maintenance and upgradation.</p>
<p>In comparison, SaaS allows a company to serve a particular location without any on-ground presence as the software is hosted in the cloud. In the model, the company makes money through subscription costs.</p>
<p>With the evolution of technology, more companies have transitioned to SaaS models, as it reduces upfront costs, Mr Khan explained.</p>
<p><strong>Not an ‘exit’</strong></p>
<p>The IT ministry also said Microsoft’s move couldn’t be construed as an exit from Pakistan, but rather a shift to a “partner-led, cloud-based delivery model”.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, several multinational companies in various sectors have either shut down their operations in Pakistan or sold them to local enterprises. Last month, ride-hailing service Careem announced it would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917884/careem-announces-end-of-ride-hailing-service-in-pakistan-from-next-month">end operations</a> in Pakistan from July 18.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>However, Mr Khan believes Microsoft’s move is different from other exits, as the company now earns almost all of its revenue through cloud-based subscriptions.</p>
<p>He added the company is on a global cost-cutting drive and its decision to close the office in Pakistan was reflective of the move towards SaaS-and-AI operating model, “and is not in any way a reflection on Pakistan’s tech ecosystem or its economy”.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922165/despite-tensions-trade-with-india-continues' target='_blank'><strong>Despite tensions, trade with India continues</strong></a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: Despite a brief military conflict and the continued <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284">closure</a> of borders, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908417">trade</a> between Pakistan and India persisted in May, with official data showing that imports from India reached a three-year high during July-May FY25.</p>
<p>According to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), imports from India totalled $211.5 million in the first 11 months of FY25 — surpassing $207m in FY24 and $190m in FY23. In May alone — when the four-day conflict broke out in the first week—imports stood at $15m, slightly down from $17m in the same month last year.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>However, Pakistan’s exports to India remained negligible. In May, they were recorded at just $1,000, while total exports during July-May FY25 were only $0.5m. In FY24 and FY23, exports stood at $3.44m and $0.33m, respectively—highlighting the highly one-sided nature of bilateral trade.</p>
<p>Traders were reluctant to discuss the continuation of imports during the tense period. One trader suggested the goods might have arrived through third countries, with payments made prior to the hostilities.</p>
<p>“It may have come from a third country and the payment for the May imports would have been made before the war,” he said.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Pakistan’s imports from New Delhi hit 3-year high</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although official data reflects limited trade, Indian research institutions claim actual trade is far higher. The India-based Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) reported last month that India’s unofficial exports to Pakistan are estimated at $10bn annually, routed primarily through Dubai, Colombo, and Singapore.</p>
<p>Analysts say the unofficial trade remains robust due to Pakistan’s high cost of production and industrial dependence on foreign inputs.</p>
<p>“We should not ignore smuggling from India since the cost of production in Pakistan is the highest in the region, which creates space for goods from India, China, and Bangladesh,” said an exporter.</p>
<p>Formal trade relations between Pakistan and India have remained frozen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1499076">since 2019</a>, but the data and ground realities suggest economic interdependence persists, albeit through unofficial channels.</p>
