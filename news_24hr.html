            <p><p>The National Elec­t­ric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Wednesday <a class="link--external" href="https://www.nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/K-Electric/2025/TRF-362%20K-ELECTRIC%20PROVISION%20MONTHLY%20FCA%20APRIL%202025%2009-07-2025%2010505-09.PDF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notified</a> a negative fuel cost adjustment (FCA) of Rs4.03 per unit for K-Electric (KE) consumers in July’s bills for power consumed in April.</p>
<p>According to a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/K-Electric/2025/TRF-362%20K-ELECTRIC%20PROVISION%20MONTHLY%20FCA%20APRIL%202025%2009-07-2025%2010505-09.PDF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a> issued by Nepra today, the authority “decided to allow a negative FCA of 4.0349/kWh for April 2025, to be passed on to the consumers in the billing month of July 2025”.</p>
<p>Nepra said the negative FCA would apply to “all the consumer categories except lifeline consumers, domestic protected consumers, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and prepaid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for pre-paid tariff”.</p>
<p>The adjustment would be shown separately in the consumers’ bills on the basis of units billed to the consumers in the respective month to which the adjustment pertains, it said.</p>
<p>“In case any bills of July 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in the subsequent month,” the notification said.</p>
<p>It also said that KE shall reflect the fuel charges adjustment in respect of April in the billing month of July.</p>
<p>The notification said that the negative FCA of Rs.4.0349/kWh was being allowed on a “provisional basis subject to adjustment” once Nepra determined KE’s Multi-Year Tariff for FY2024-30. “The difference in cost, if any, based on the MYT FY 2024-30 would be allowed in future adjustments once the same is notified,” it added.</p>
<p>Separately, Nepra also <a class="link--external" href="https://www.nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/Ex-WAPDA%20DISCOS/2025/TRF-100%20MFPA%20FCA%20MONTH%20OF%20MAY%202025%20FOR%20EX-WAPDA%20DISCOs%2009-07-2025%2010512-27.PDF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notified</a> a Rs0.49 per unit negative FCA following an adjustment on account of variation in fuel charges for May in the approved tariff of ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos).</p>
<p>According to a separate <a class="link--external" href="https://www.nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/Ex-WAPDA%20DISCOS/2025/TRF-100%20MFPA%20FCA%20MONTH%20OF%20MAY%202025%20FOR%20EX-WAPDA%20DISCOs%2009-07-2025%2010512-27.PDF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a> issued today, the authority “has reviewed and assessed a National Average Uniform decrease of Rs.0.4952/kWh in the applicable tariff for Discos on account of variations in the fuel charges for May”.</p>
<p>The notification said that the FCA should apply to all the consumer categories except lifeline consumers, protected consumers, EVCS and pre-paid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for prepaid tariffs.</p>
<p>“Discos shall reflect the fuel charges adjustment in respect of May 2025 in the billing month of July 2025,” the notification said, adding that it would be shown separately in the consumers’ bills based on units utilised in May.</p>
<p>“In case any bills of July 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in the subsequent month,” it added.</p></p>

<p>A statement issued by the Karachi Press Club hailed her as a “true icon and veteran of Pakistani journalism” who left behind a legacy “that will continue to inspire generations of journalists”.</p>
<p>“Zubeida Mustafa was not just a journalist; she was an institution. Her unwavering commitment to truth, her incisive analysis, and her relentless pursuit of social justice set a benchmark for ethical reporting. She was a pioneer, breaking barriers and paving the way for women in a field often dominated by men.</p>
<p>“Her work on social issues, education, and health was particularly impactful, demonstrating her deep empathy and dedication to improving the lives of ordinary citizens. The Karachi Press Club extends its heartfelt condolences to her family, friends and colleagues during this difficult time. Her absence will be deeply felt, but her contributions to journalism and society will never be forgotten. May her soul rest in eternal peace,” the press club said.</p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his satisfaction on Wednesday as data showed that workers’ remittances increased by 26.6 per cent to hit a record $38.3 billion during the fiscal year 2025 as compared to the corresponding period of last year.</p>
<p>The State Bank of Pakistan said remittances reached $38.3bn during July-June 2024-25, as compared to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844949">$30.3bn</a> in remittances received during the same period for FY2023-24.</p>
<p>Similarly, on a year-by-year basis, the workers’ remittances went up by 7.9pc to $3.406bn in June 2025, compared to $3.158bn during the same month last year.</p>

<p>Data showed that Saudi Arabia ($823.2m) and the United Arab Emirates ($717.2m) were the biggest sources of remittance inflows during June 2025, followed by the United Kingdom ($537.6m) and the United States ($281.2m).</p>
<p>A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said the premier was pleased at the development, saying that the government was committed to economic prosperity after bringing economic stability, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>“The record surge in remittances reflects expatriate Pakistanis’ valuable contributions and their confidence in the national economy,” he added.</p>
<p>He expressed the opinion that the recent positive economic indicators were a “manifestation of the government’s policies in the right direction”.</p>
<p>Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad termed the record remittances “massive” in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/kschehzad/status/1942869065359364192" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X and added that the feat “reflects growing trust of overseas Pakistanis in the economy and policy measures”.</p>
