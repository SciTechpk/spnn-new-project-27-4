            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921342/fuel-prices-go-up-in-aftermath-of-israeli-attacks-on-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Fuel prices go up in aftermath of Israeli attacks on Iran</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday increased the prices of petrol and diesel by Rs8.36 and Rs10.39 per litre, respectively, for the next fortnight ending July 15, owing to higher international prices following Israeli <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">attacks</a> on Iran.</p>
<p>In a late-night announcement, the Ministry of Finance said the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) had reviewed and adjusted prices for petroleum products in view of fluctuations in the international market.</p>
<p>The ex-depot price of high-speed diesel (HSD) was increased by Rs10.39 per litre (four per cent) to Rs272.98 per litre <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917324">from</a> Rs262.59. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD and its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables. Transport fares seldom come down despite lower diesel rate.</p>
<p>The ex-depot price of petrol was set at Rs266.79 per litre against Rs258.43, up by Rs8.36 or 3.3pc. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of middle- and lower-middle class.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>At present, the government is charging about Rs100 per litre tax on both petrol and HSD, with fresh imposition of Rs2.5 per litre climate support levy with effect from July 1. Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all petroleum products, yet the government is charging Rs78 per litre petroleum development levy (PDL) on petrol, diesel and high-octane products that normally impact the masses.</p>
<p>The government is also charging about Rs19 per litre customs duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.</p>
<p><strong>LPG price cut</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, Ogra notified a decrease in the price of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) by Rs7.51 per kg or 3.1pc for the month of July. Ogra notified the new price for 11.8kg cylinder at Rs2,750.60 for July against Rs2,838.31 for June. It said the LPG producer price was linked with Saudi Aramco-CP and US dollar exchange rate.</p>
<p>As compared to previous month, Saudi Aramco-CP price has decreased by 4.29pc, while the average dollar exchange rate slightly increased by 0.47pc, resulting in a decline in the LPG consumer price by Rs88.71 per 11.8kg cylinder (3.1pc).</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921312/government-sees-exports-rising-inflation-at-5-7pc-in-fy26' target='_blank'><strong>Government sees exports rising, inflation at  5-7pc in FY26</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday projected a positive export outlook and a moderate rise in inflation to a range of 5-7 per cent for 2025-26, citing improved global economic conditions and domestic recovery trends.</p>
<p>In its Monthly Economic Update and Outlook for June, the Ministry of Finance said Composite Leading Indicators (CLIs) of Pakistan’s major trading part-ners — including the UK, US, Eurozone and China — were all operating above their long-term average of 100, suggesting a likely increase in demand for Pakistani exports.</p>
<p>For June, inflation is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921197/countrys-june-inflation-likely-to-remain-between-3-4pc-finance-ministry">expected</a> to remain between 3–4pc. The ministry also forecast a positive outlook for Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) in the coming months, driven by robust trends in cement despatches and automobile sales. “The uptick in private sector credit reflects growing production activity and improved investor confidence,” the report said.</p>
<p>On the external front, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897182">rising</a> remittances and exports are expected to keep the current account in surplus during FY25.</p>
<p>From July to May FY25, the current account posted a surplus of $1.8bn, in stark contrast to a deficit of $1.6bn during the same period last year.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Remittances, export growth and fiscal discipline drive economic optimism</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goods exports rose 4pc to $29.7bn, while imports increased 11.5pc to $54.1bn, widening the trade deficit to $24.4bn from $20bn a year earlier. Key export gains were seen in knitwear (14.5pc), garments (16.4pc), and bedwear (10.6pc). Major import increases were recorded in palm oil (26.3pc) and electrical machinery (13.6pc), while crude oil imports declined 1.7pc.</p>
<p>Service exports grew 8.5pc to $7.6bn, with imports rising 6.6pc to $10.3bn, resulting in a $2.7bn services trade deficit. IT exports surged by 18.7pc to $3.5bn.</p>
<p>Worker remittances saw a sharp increase of 28.8pc, reaching $34.9bn from $27.1bn in the same period last year, led by higher inflows from Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</p>
<p>Net foreign direct investment (FDI) stood at $2bn, slightly down from $2.1bn a year ago.</p>
<p>China remained the top investor with $790.4m, followed by the UK with $229m and Hong Kong with $215.2m. The financial services sector attracted the most FDI at $628.9m, followed by power ($562.8m) and oil &amp; gas exploration ($265.6m).</p>
<p>However, foreign portfolio investment recorded net outflows, with $312.5m from the private sector and $311.9m from the public sector. As of June 13, the country’s foreign exchange reserves stood at $17bn, including $11.7bn held by the State Bank of Pakistan.</p>
<p>On the fiscal side, the report noted that revenue growth outpaced expenditure growth during July-April FY25, reflecting the success of the government’s fiscal consolidation drive.</p>
<p>The fiscal deficit declined to 3.2pc of GDP, down from 4.5pc in the same period last year, while the primary surplus improved to 3.2pc of GDP from 1.5pc a year earlier.</p>

            <p><p>Iran-linked hackers have threatened to disclose more emails stolen from US President Donald Trump’s circle, after distributing a prior batch to the media ahead of the 2024 US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870600">election</a>.</p>
<p>In online chats with <em>Reuters</em> on Sunday and Monday, the hackers, who go by the pseudonym Robert, said they had roughly 100 gigabytes of emails from the accounts of White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Trump lawyer Lindsey Halligan, Trump adviser Roger Stone and porn star-turned-Trump antagonist Stormy Daniels.</p>
<p>Robert raised the possibility of selling the material but otherwise did not provide details of their plans. The hackers did not describe the content of the emails.</p>
<p>US Attorney General Pam Bondi described the intrusion as “an unconscionable cyber-attack”.</p>
<p>The White House and the FBI responded with a statement from FBI Director Kash Patel, who said: “Anyone associated with any kind of breach of national security will be fully investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”</p>
<p>“This so-called cyber ‘attack’ is nothing more than digital propaganda, and the targets are no coincidence. This is a calculated smear campaign meant to damage President Trump and discredit honorable public servants who serve our country with distinction,” cyberdefense agency CISA said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Halligan, Stone and a representative for Daniels did not respond to requests for comment. Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not return a message seeking comment. Tehran has in the past denied committing cyberespionage.</p>
<p>Robert materialised in the final months of the 2024 presidential campaign, when they claimed to have breached the email accounts of several Trump allies, including Wiles.</p>
<p>The hackers then distributed emails to journalists.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> previously authenticated some of the leaked material, including an email that appeared to document a financial arrangement between Trump and lawyers representing former presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr — now Trump’s health secretary.</p>
<p>Other material included Trump campaign communication about Republican office-seekers and discussion of settlement negotiations with Daniels.</p>
<p>Although the leaked documents did garner some coverage last year, they did not fundamentally alter the presidential race, which Trump won.</p>
<p>The US Justice Department in a September 2024 indictment alleged that Iran’s Revolutionary Guards ran the Robert hacking operation. In conversations with Reuters, the hackers declined to address the allegation.</p>
<p>After Trump’s election, Robert told <em>Reuters</em> that no more leaks were planned. As recently as May, the hackers told <em>Reuters</em>, “I am retired, man.” But the group resumed communication after this month’s 12-day air war between Israel and Iran, which was capped by U.S. bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites.</p>
<p>In messages this week, Robert said they were organising a sale of stolen emails and wanted <em>Reuters</em> to “broadcast this matter”.</p>
<p>American Enterprise Institute scholar Frederick Kagan, who has written about Iranian cyberespionage, said Tehran suffered serious damage in the conflict and its spies were likely trying to retaliate in ways that did not draw more US or Israeli action.</p>
<p>“A default explanation is that everyone’s been ordered to use all the asymmetric stuff that they can that’s not likely to trigger a resumption of major Israeli/US military activity,” he said. “Leaking a bunch more emails is not likely to do that.”</p>
<p>Despite worries that Tehran could unleash digital havoc, Iran’s hackers took a low profile during the conflict. US cyber officials warned on Monday that American companies and critical infrastructure operators might still be in Tehran’s crosshairs.</p></p>
