            <p><p>A bus carrying students was targeted in a blast in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district on Wednesday morning, leaving three children among five dead, while several others were injured, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).</p>
<p>“In yet another cowardly and ghastly attack planned and orchestrated by terrorist state of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">India</a> and executed by its proxies in Balochistan, innocent school-going children’s bus was targeted today in Khuzdar,” a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7297" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by the ISPR reads.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif subsequently reached Quetta later in the day for security briefings and the law and order situation in the province after the talk.</p>
<p>The ISPR said that as per the initial reports, “three innocent children and two adults have embraced martyrdom and multiple children have sustained injuries.”</p>
<p>It further said that “after having miserably failed in the battlefield, through these most heinous and cowardly such like acts, Indian proxies have been unleashed to spread terror and unrest in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.”</p>

<p>The statement said that “Indian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians.”</p>
<p>It noted that India had “failed” in Pakistan’s Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent conflict, and its [proxies] were “being hunted [down] by military and law enforcement agencies”.</p>
<p>“Use of terrorism as a state policy by [the] Indian political government is abhorrent and reflective of their low morality and disregard of <em>[sic]</em> basic human norms,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p>“Planners, abettors and executors of this cowardly Indian sponsored attack will be hunted down and brought to justice and [the] heinous face of India will be exposed in front of the entire world,” the military vowed.</p>
<p>Pakistan Armed Forces, with the support of the brave Pakistani nation, stand “united to uproot Indian sponsored terrorism from Pakistan in all its manifestations”, the ISPR said.</p>
<p><em>APP</em> added that PM Shehbaz arrived in Quetta to review the law and order situation in the wake of the incident, accompanied by the defence, interior and information ministers.</p>
<p>The premier will preside over different meetings and briefings during his stay in the city, with a high-level security meeting focusing on the law and order situation in Balochistan also expected.</p>

<p>It earlier reported that he and Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir would undertake an emergency visit to Quetta and be given a briefing on the attack “carried out by terrorists under the patronage of India”.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s Office said the two would also enquire after the health of those injured in the attack.</p>
<p>“The ceremony scheduled to be held this evening at Aiwan-i-Sadr in honour of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir has been postponed at his own request due to the tragic attack in Khuzdar,” it added.</p>

<p>Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">accused India</a> of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan.</p>
<p>He had detailed the arrest of a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India as “irr­e­futable evidence” of state-sponsored terrorism directed by Ind­ian military personnel.</p>
<p>On Monday, the ISPR said <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005/3-terrorists-of-indian-proxy-blf-killed-in-balochistan-engagements-ispr">12 terrorists</a> of “Indian proxy” outfits were killed by security forces in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Deputy Commissioner Yasir Iqbal Dashti had told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the blast occurred when the school bus was near the <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/o5j2xJxqzLLkz6mbA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Khuzdar Zero Point</a>.</p>
<p>The bodies and the injured were taken to the Khuzdar CMH, from where the seriously injured would be referred to medical facilities in Quetta and Karachi, the DC said.</p>
<p>Police, the Frontier Corps (FC) and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel have reached the site of the incident to collect evidence for an investigation.</p>
<p>While a probe was underway, the DC said preliminary findings indicated that the attack was a suicide blast.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack on the Khuzdar school bus, describing it as a cowardly act.</p>
<p>“The attack on innocent children in a school bus by terrorists working under Indian patronage is a clear proof of their hostility towards education in Balochistan,” he said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvnews/urdunewsdetail/6772" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>Expressing deep sorrow over the death of the children, PM Shehbaz said that the terrorists have “crossed all limits of barbarity”, vowing to bring them to their end.</p>
<p>“The sympathies of the entire nation, including mine, are with the families of these innocent children, who were victims of the brutality of terrorists.”</p>
<p>He directed the security forces to bring the perpetrators to justice, and showed support for the armed forces’ resolve to eradicate terrorism from the country.</p>

<p>President Asif Ali Zardari termed the attack a “heinous and inhumane crime.” He vowed to expose this “Indian-backed terrorism” at an international level.</p>
<p>“These terrorists do not want to see Balochistan developed,” he said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvnews/urdunewsdetail/6775" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>

<p>Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind denounced the attack as the “hideous face of Indian state-sponsored terrorism”, as well as a “cowardly and inhumane act”.</p>
<p>In a statement, Rind echoed the ISPR’s stance, saying that India was “creating instability in Balochistan to hide its failures”. He called India’s “state-sponsored terrorism a threat to world peace.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi strongly condemned the “explosion inside the bus near Khuzdar Zero Point”.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MOIofficialGoP/status/1925053540763902171" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, he expressed deep sorrow and grief over the death of four children, and extended his condolences to their families.</p>
<p>“The beasts who target innocent children do not deserve any leniency. The enemy demonstrated barbarity by attacking innocent children,” Naqvi asserted.</p>
<p>“The attack on the school bus is a heinous conspiracy of the enemy to create instability in the country. With the unity of the nation, we will foil every conspiracy,” the interior minister vowed.</p>
<p>Naqvi also prayed for the speedy recovery of the wounded.</p>

<p>Later, while talking to the media, Bugti said they had solid information that Ajit Doval, the Indian national security adviser, was planning something in Balochistan but did not expect him to target children.</p>
<p>He said four children were slain while there were 42 injured in the attack.</p>
<p>“We had intelligence regarding this but to target innocent children, this is [India’s] cowardice.”</p>

<p>It said the “continued failure of the federal and provincial governments to prevent such attacks highlights serious and persistent lapses in providing security to common citizens”.</p>
<p>It added that the state had an “obligation to uphold law and order by strengthening civilian institutions and the rule of law — not through indiscriminate kinetic responses.”</p>
<p>The HRCP called for the “immediate identification and prosecution of the perpetrators and their enablers through lawful means”.</p>
<p>It also stressed the “urgent need for a meaningful political dialogue to address the deep-rooted problems of representation, governance and resource distribution in Balochistan”.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912393/security-forces-falsely-implicated-in-north-waziristan-incident-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces ‘falsely implicated’ in North Waziristan incident: ISPR</strong></a>
            <p><p>The military’s media wing on Wednesday said that security forces were “falsely implicated” in an incident that took place in Mir Ali tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district, killing four children.</p>
<p>“Initial findings have established that this heinous act has been orchestrated and executed by Indian-sponsored <em>Fitna Al Khwarij</em>,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna">using</a> the term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>The statement comes after locals staged a protest in Mir Ali’s Hurmuz village on Monday against the killing of four children and a woman, allegedly by a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912113/four-kids-killed-in-north-waziristan-strike">drone strike</a>. A day earlier, police said talks with local elders on the matter were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912175">underway</a>.</p>
<p>“Following a tragic incident on May 19, 2025, in the general area of Mir Ali, North Waziristan district, which regrettably resulted in civilian casualties, unfounded and misleading allegations have been circulated by certain quarters, falsely implicating Pakistan’s security forces,” the ISPR statement said.</p>
<p>“These claims are entirely baseless and are part of a coordinated disinformation campaign aimed at discrediting the security forces’ steadfast efforts in the ongoing counterterrorism operations.”</p>
<p>It said that a “comprehensive investigation was promptly initiated” in response to the accusations.</p>
<p>“It is evident that these elements — acting at the behest of their Indian masters —  continue to exploit civilian areas and vulnerable populations as shields to conduct their reprehensible acts of terrorism. Such tactics aim to unsuccessfully sow discord between the local population and the security forces, who together remain resolute to uproot the menace of terrorism.”</p>
<p>It further said that security forces reaffirmed “their commitment to ensuring that the perpetrators of this inhuman act are brought to justice.”</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>On Monday, the ISPR said <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005">12 terrorists</a> of “Indian proxy” outfits were killed by security forces while two personnel were martyred in separate engagements in KP and Balochistan.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908833">seven soldiers</a> were martyred in a blast from an improvised explosive device planted by the “Indian proxy” terrorist group Balochistan Liberation Army in Kacchi district.</p>
<p>Armed operations and air strikes have become routine in the North Waziristan district amid claims of residents that civilians are targeted in the attacks.</p>
<p>About several such incidents, the local population and human rights organisations have argued that these operations lack transparency and are outside the bounds of due legal process.</p>
<p>In March, at least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901160">11 people</a> were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, but officials said was an operation carried out against militants. According to locals, the deceased were civilians, including women and children, working as shepherds.</p>
<p>An alleged drone attack in the Konrai Raghzai area of Upper South Waziristan district <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860946">killed</a> one person and injured three others in September last year. While the local sources confirmed the drone attack, there was no official confirmation of the drone strike.</p></p>

            <p><p>India’s top court granted bail on Wednesday to a professor arrested for commentating online about the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military conflict</a> with Pakistan but did not stop the investigation against him.</p>
<p>Ali Khan Mahmudabad, a political science professor at the private, liberal-arts Ashoka University, was arrested on Sunday over a Facebook post criticising those “mindlessly advocating” for war.</p>
<p>He also wrote that the “<a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193612/the-weaponisation-of-feminism-in-operation-sindoor">optics</a>” of two women army officers who had held press briefings “must translate to reality on the ground otherwise it’s just hypocrisy”.</p>
<p>Mahmudabad since said his comments had been “misunderstood” and that he had exercised his “fundamental right to freedom of thought and speech”.</p>
<p>He is charged under multiple sections of India’s criminal code, including endangering the country’s sovereignty and using words or gestures with the intention of insulting the modesty of a woman.</p>
<p>While granting Mahmudabad bail, India’s Supreme Court said he should have avoided the “use of complicated words” which could “hurt individuals” and instead used “simpler words to convey his sentiments”.</p>
<p>The court also directed the formation of a special police team to probe his comments.</p>
<p>Mahmudabad was restricted from commenting on the India-Pakistan conflict or on the social media post that led to his arrest.</p>
<p>India and Pakistan agreed to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> last week after four days of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intense exchanges</a> of artillery, drones, and missiles.</p>
<p>The latest escalation between the nuclear-armed rivals came after 26 people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">killed</a> on April 22 in Indian-Occupied Kashmir. India, without investigation, blamed Pakistan for “backing the terrorists”, an allegation that Islamabad vehemently denied.</p>
<p>Amnesty International called his arrest “shameful” and accused authorities of “consistently misusing the law to target anyone who has a critical view”.</p>
<p>Mahmudabad’s post on May 8 referred to two women soldiers — including Muslim officer Sofiya Qureshi — who conducted army press briefings before the ceasefire and were praised for presenting the image of a united and progressive India.</p>
<p>He said he was “happy” that Hindu nationalist commentators were supporting the women, but that they could “equally loudly demand” the protection of “victims of the BJP’s hate-mongering” — referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p>
<p>Soon after, the government women’s rights commission in Haryana state summoned Mahmudabad over his comments.</p></p>
