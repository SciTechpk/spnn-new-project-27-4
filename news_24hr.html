            <p><p>Pakistan on Monday rebuked the recent remarks made by Indian leadership saying that they reflected a deeply troubling mindset that prioritised hostility over peace.</p>
<p>The Foreign Office issued a statement today after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896150#:~:text=The%20statement%20comes%20a%20day%20after%20India%E2%80%99s%20External%20Affairs%20Minister%20Subrahmanyam%20Jaishankar%2C%20referring%20to%20AJK%2C%20said%20the%20Kashmir%20dispute%20would%20be%20solved%20after%20the%20%E2%80%9Creturn%20of%20the%20stolen%20part%20of%20Kashmir%20which%20is%20under%20illegal%20Pakistani%20occupation%E2%80%9D.">flurry</a> of antagonistic statements made by Indian leaders, including one made by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson on May 29 where he stated that talks on the Kashmir dispute will only be held “when Pakistan hands over [Azad Jammu and Kashmir] to us”.</p>

<p>Responding to the antagonistic remarks, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said, “Any attempt to portray Pakistan as the source of regional instability is divorced from reality.</p>
<p>“The international community is well aware of India’s record of aggressive behavior, including documented support for terrorist activities within Pakistan,” he stated, adding that those facts could not be “obscured by hollow narratives or diversionary tactics”.</p>

<p>He reiterated that the Kashmir dispute remained a “core issue threatening peace and stability in the region” and the country will continue to advocate for a “just and lasting resolution to the Kashmir dispute in line with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people”.</p>
<p>He noted that the remarks made on the Indian side “underscored the utter futility of jingoism and coercion”, and that India will not be able to achieve its objectives through threats.</p>
<p>“Pakistan remains committed to peace and constructive engagement, but it is equally resolved to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity against any aggression,” he stated.</p>
<p>The spokesperson emphasised that peace in the region demanded “maturity, restraint, and a willingness to address the root causes of conflict”.</p></p>

            <p><p>Another low-intensity earthquake was felt by Karachi residents on Monday, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).</p>
<p>The tremor was the third within 24 hours.</p>
<p>The most recent quake <a class="link--external" href="https://seismic.pmd.gov.pk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">measured 3.2</a> on the Richter scale with the city’s densely populated Quaidabad area as its epicentre. The area’s residents had also experienced a similar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914834/karachi-experiences-36-magnitude-quake-with-quaidabad-as-epicentre">3.6-magnitude tremor</a> at 5:33pm yesterday.</p>
<p>Both earthquakes originated at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres beneath the surface.</p>

<p>A separate tremor originating near the city’s Gadap Town was recorded at 1:05am earlier today. It measured 3.2 on the Richter scale and had a depth of 12km.</p>
<p>Ameer Hyder, the chief meteorologist at the Met Office in Karachi, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the tremors were caused by an active fault line in Landhi.</p>
<p>He noted that the quakes’ intensity was not high and was “gradually declining”. While stating that no formal prediction could be made yet, Hyder expected the tremors to end within a week.</p>

<p>Experts have previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say">pointed out</a> that such minor seismic activities “preempt” high-intensity earthquakes by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates.</p>
<p>The country had witnessed around <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say">20 low-intensity earthquakes</a> in the first half of February — an average of more than one tremor each day.</p>
<p>In April, jolts were felt in parts of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905258">Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab</a> — including Peshawar, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903840">twice</a> that month.</p>

            <p><p>Two high-level multiparty delegations —  a part of the country’s broad-based campaign to present its perspective to the international community on the recent spike in tensions with India —  will engage in a series of meetings, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Monday.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">high-level Pakistani delegation</a> — consisting of two former foreign ministers, two former foreign sec­­retaries, two former ambassadors to the US, and a serving federal minister — arrived in New York yesterday for consultations at the United Nations. It will also visit Washington DC, London and Brussels, the FO said.</p>
<p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar, Senator Sherry Rehman, Jalil Abbas Jilani, Teh­mina Janjua, Mussadik Malik, Khurram Dastgir, Bushra Anjum Butt and Faisal Sabzwari are members of the first delegation.</p>
<p>The group is scheduled to meet UN Secretary-General António Gute­rres, the president of the UN General Assembly, ambassadors of all five permanent members of the Security Council, and will address a joint session of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation envoys.</p>
<p>The delegation will kick off its engagements on June 3, with planned meetings with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, senior administration officials, lawmakers, think-tank analysts, and leading media organisations.</p>
<p>According to the FO, another delegation, led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi, will visit Moscow today.</p>
<p>“The visits of these delegations are aimed at projecting Pakistan’s perspective on the recent Indian aggression,” the statement read. “The delegations will highlight Pakistan’s responsible and restrained conduct — seeking peace with responsibility — in the face of India’s reckless and belligerent actions in violation of international law.”</p>
<p>The delegations will also highlight that “dialogue and diplomacy should take precedence over conflict and confrontation”.</p>
<p>The statement read that the delegations will underscore the importance of international community to play its due role in promoting a lasting peace in the region, including the immediate resumption of the normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty.</p>
<p>“The delegations will engage in a series of meetings with the leadership of international bodies, public office holders, senior officials, parliamentarians, think tanks, media and diaspora,” the FO said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#strategic-importance-and-not-mere-photo-opportunities" id="strategic-importance-and-not-mere-photo-opportunities" title="Permalink"></a>‘Strategic importance and not mere photo opportunities’</h2>
<p>Separately, Senator Sherry Rehman said that the delegation led by the PPP chairman has already begun its US visit with a “packed schedule of high-level multilateral meetings in New York”.</p>
<p>Rehman emphasised that the meetings will have strategic importance, and not be “mere photo opportunities”.</p>
<p>She added that country’s status as “a responsible and stable middle power” is being highlighted during the engagements, and that the country had a clear interest in “regional peace and security”.</p>
<p>“Adherence to international laws is part of Pakistan’s foreign policy,” Rehman said, adding that the “fabricated” Indian narrative against the country “will not be allowed to take the form of truth this time”.</p>
<p>“India has started using false terrorism allegations as justification for war. This trend cannot be allowed to become the norm,” she said, adding that the country would not be part of any Indian “film script”.</p>
<p>The PPP leader said, “Chairman Bilawal Bhutto has successfully presented Pakistan’s solid position on water, Kashmir and violations of international laws of war and peace.</p>
<p>“Pakistan, as a responsible nuclear state, believes in a broad and fair dialogue based on peace,” she added.</p></p>
