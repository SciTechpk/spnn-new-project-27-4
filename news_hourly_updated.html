                <h2>Search continues as death toll from Lyari building collapse rises to 15</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Rescue teams pulled more bodies from the rubble of a five-storey <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050">building collapse</a> in Karachi overnight, taking the toll on Saturday to 15 as the recovery operation continued for a second day,</p>
<p>The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, which was further weakened by recent rains, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922231#:~:text=DIG%20South%20Syed%20Asad%20Raza%20told%20Dawn">said</a> Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza.</p>
<p>Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed confirmed to <em>Dawn.com</em> that the toll had risen to 15. She further said no injured person was reported after 3pm on Friday, indicating that the number of wounded remained nine.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRescue operation is still underway in Baghdadi, Lyari where the building had collapsed on Friday,‚Äù DIG Raza told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>

<p>Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.</p>
<p>Karachi, home to more than 20 million, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.</p>
<p>There were conflicting reports of the death toll, with Rescue 1122 stating it as 16 and DIG Raza saying that a 17th body was recovered from the rubble.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn one side, debris has been removed up to the ground floor, while on the other side, the rescue team has removed debris up to the third floor,‚Äù the police officer added.</p>
<p>The deceased included nine men, six women and a child, according to a statement by Rescue 1122. Their bodies had been taken to the Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK).</p>
<p>Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, leading the Rescue 1122 efforts at the scene, told <em>AFP</em> the operation continued through the night ‚Äúwithout interruption‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt may take eight to 12 hours more to complete,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Up to 100 people had been living in the building, senior police officer Arif Aziz told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>The incident came days after a portion of a building <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921188/no-casualties-reported-as-22-rescued-from-partially-collapsed-building-in-karachis-kharadar">collapsed</a> in the city‚Äôs Kharadar area. However, no casualties or injuries were reported.</p>
<p>The Public Account Committee of the Sindh Assembly had directed the provincial government in December to take urgent steps to evacuate over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879565">570 buildings</a> declared ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù by authorities across Karachi.</p>

However, they said they received the information late due to the suspension of communication networks, he added.</p>
<p>Mobile services are usually <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920725/army-to-be-deployed-across-country-for-security-during-muharram#:~:text=It%20was%20also%20agreed%20that%20any%20decision%20to%20suspend%20internet%20or%20mobile%20phone%20services%20will%20be%20made%20in%20consultation%20with%20provinces">suspended</a> in certain areas due to security concerns during Muharram.</p>
<p>Sindh Rescue 1122 Director General (DG) Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, in a statement, said yesterday there were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=Rescue%20DG%20lists%20%E2%80%98hinderances%E2%80%99%20in%20operations">hindrances</a> during the rescue operation due to the ‚Äúunruly crowd, various road blockades and mobile network [issues]‚Äù.</p>
<p>Heavy machinery faced difficulty in reaching the site amid the narrow alleys of Lyari, a low-income neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Police even had to baton-charge a crowd that had gathered around the site to make way for machinery, officials added.</p>
<p>The Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=SBCA%20says%20issued%20multiple%20prior%20notices%20to%20vacate%20building">said</a> it had declared the plot as dangerous through its Technical Committee for Dangerous Buildings after a thorough inspection conducted in October 2022.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The authority said it had issued three ejectment notices to the residents since then, as well as asked K-Electric, Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) to disconnect utility services.</p>
<p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah sought a report on the collapse and details of dilapidated buildings from the SBCA.</p>
<p>Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani said a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=Saeed%20Ghani%20stresses%20timely%20evacuation%20of%20unsafe%20buildings">high-level committee</a> has been formed that will submit a report on the incident by Monday. He lamented that residents did not evacuate the building despite being served notices previously.</p>
<p>The minister also ordered the suspension of the related officials at the SBCA.</p>

                <h2>3 ‚Äòterrorists‚Äô killed during CTD operation in KP‚Äôs Lakki Marwat: police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Three suspected terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban‚Äôs (TTP) Tipu Gul group were killed in a joint operation by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and the police in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Lakki Marwat district last night, police said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Aamir Khan, the spokesperson for Lakki Marwat police, said in a statement today that the CTD, in collaboration with the local police, carried out an intelligence-based operation in the Bathani Neh area near Harama Tala village and killed three wanted militants.</p>
<p>The police statement said that the terrorists belonged to the TTP‚Äôs Tipu Gul group and were involved in the targeted killing of Waheedullah of the CTD, Traffic Constable Anwar Sher and Constable Idrees.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The statement added that the encounter lasted for about 25 minutes.</p>
<p>The police identified the suspected militants as Waseemullah alias Umar Khattab, Qudratullah alias Abu Bakr, and Hijratullah alias Hijrat.</p>
<p>They were residents of Gundi Khan Khel, Hijratullah, and Serai Gambila Town‚Äôs Harama Tala area of Lakki Marwat.</p>
<p>The police statement also mentioned that the terrorists were wanted by the Bannu CTD for blasts using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and attacks on police, among other serious crimes.</p>
<p>Lakki Marwat has long been a hotspot for terrorism and violence, with unrest dating back to the early 2000s. Militant attacks have become more <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914847">frequent</a> in recent months, despite ongoing efforts by local peace committees to maintain order and resist terrorist influence.</p>
<p>Last week, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921018">leader</a> of a peace committee and two of his companions were shot dead by terrorists in Lakki Marwat district.</p>
<p>Earlier in June, three terrorists were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916076/3-terrorists-killed-one-cop-martyred-in-gun-battle-with-lakki-marwat-police-local-peace-committee">killed</a> in the district‚Äôs Kot Kashmir area during a gun battle with the police and local peace committee, in which a cop was also martyred.</p></p>
