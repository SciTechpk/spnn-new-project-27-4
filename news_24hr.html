            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908705/chenab-parched-after-india-reduces-flows-manifold' target='_blank'><strong>Chenab parched after India reduces flows manifold</strong></a>
            <p><p><strong>• Pakistan’s waters being used to fill up three Indian reservoirs with total capacity of 1.2MAF; official says sudden discharge could create a ‘flood-like’ situation<br />
• Decreased inflows at Marala will result in more water shortage for crops, Irsa warns<br />
• Reuters report claims New Delhi plans to boost reservoir holding capacity at two hydroelectric projects</strong></p>
<p>NEARLY a week after its unilateral <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274">suspension</a> of the Indus Waters Treaty, India on Monday virtually stopped water discharges from the Chenab River into Pakistan without prior notice, reducing flows in the river manifold.</p>
<p>Water flows in the Chenab, recorded at the Marala headworks, decreased from up to 35,000 cusecs on Sunday to about 3,100 cusecs on Monday morning.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“They have almost blocked the River Chenab flows to downstream (Pakistan) after they (Ind­ian authorities) took the dec­ision on Sunday,” a senior official of the Punjab irrigation department confirmed on Monday.</p>
<p>“Currently, they are using our water to fill up their dams/hydropower projects in the Chenab basin. They cannot do this since it is a grave violation of the Indus Water Treaty…,” the official deplored.</p>
<p>According to a document seen by <em>Dawn</em>, India has three major hydropower projects in the Chenab Basin. The first is the 1,000MW Pakal Dul Dam, having an 88,000 acre-feet reservoir storage capacity and a 10km head race tunnel to divert water south.</p>
<p>The second is the Baglihar Dam (88km from Pakal Dul upstream). This is a 900MW power generation plant, having a 321,002 acre-feet reservoir storage along with a spillway capacity of 582,692 cusecs.</p>
<p>The third one is Salal Dam, located 78km from Baglihar, having an installed power generation capacity of 690MW along with 228,000 acre-feet reservoir storage and spillway capacity of 792,012 cusecs.</p>
<p>“From Salal Dam, Marala Barrage (in Pakistan) is situated 76km away. The reason behind the massive reduction in the flows is the filling of these dams, which have a total storage capacity of over 1.2 million acre-feet. And if they keep filling their dams and avert discharging, they (India) may leave us without water for four to five days more,” the official warned.</p>
<p>To a question, he said that if India suddenly started discharging water downstream, there could be a flood-like situation in Chenab, putting the local population at risk.</p>
<p>To another question, he said Marala’s capacity was 1.1 million cusecs, whereas the total storage capacity of India’s dams in the Chenab basin was over 1.3 million acre-feet. “However, they don’t have control over the water inflows to Pakistan in the river from the Jammu-Tavi and Munawar-Tavi distributaries,” the official added.</p>
<p>According to the official, Chenab is very important for Pakistan’s irrigation system, as its canals, including the UCC and BRB canals, irrigate a vast tract of agricultural land in Punjab.</p>
<p>According to the daily water report issued by the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the water inflows in Chenab at Marala were recorded at 5,300 cusecs, whereas there were zero outflows on Monday.</p>
<p>The inflows and outflows in the river at Marala on Sunday were 34,600 and 25,400 cusecs, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Shortage for Kharif crops</strong></p>
<p>Separately, a meeting of the advisory committee of the Indus River System Authority also expressed concerns over the unilateral Indian decision that would cause additional shortages to Kharif crops, already facing an estimated 21pc shortfall.</p>
<p>“…sudden decrease in river Chenab inflows at Marala due to short supply by India would result in more shortages in early Kharif season,” said a statement issued by Irsa. The water regulator declared an overall shortage of 21pc for the remaining early Kharif season in case supplies in River Chenab remained normal. However, the situation would be monitored on a daily basis and if the decrease continues, the shortages would be revisited accordingly, Irsa said, adding the late Kharif shortages were expected to be 7pc.</p>
<p>An official told <em>Dawn</em> that Chenab flowed at 35,600 cusecs on Sunday at Marala headwork, but dropped to 3,177 cusecs on Monday morning, showing a reduction of almost 11 times. He said three storages — Baglihar, Dulhasti and Salal — on Chenab in Kashmir had the capacity to stop river flows.</p>
<p><strong>Sindh’s concerns</strong></p>
<p>Sindh representatives recorded their objections over the operationalisation of Chashma-Jhelum Link Canal by Punjab, but was explained that Punjab was using its own share. Sindh, nevertheless, insisted that the opening of the emergency link canal affected Sindh’s allocated share downstream.</p>
<p>Sindh was also told that its share of 76,000 cusecs was being released, which would reach its canal command areas in five to six days. Punjab’s discharges were reduced from 84,000 cusecs to 65,000 cusecs at its request.</p>
<p>The Irsa meeting worked out Punjab’s water availability estimate at 31.35 million acre feet (MAF) for the entire Kharif season, followed by Sindh’s 28.85MAF. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan would get 0.82MAF and 2.86MAF, respectively, during the season.</p>
<p><strong>Work on Indian dams</strong></p>
<p>Separately, the Reuters news agency reported that India has begun work to boost reservoir holding capacity at two hydroelectric projects.</p>
<p>A “reservoir flushing” process to remove sediment began on Thursday, carried out by India’s biggest hydropower company and authorities in the occupied Kashmir, it reported.</p>
<p>The process initially results in sediment-laden waters being released downstream from the reservoirs, potentially causing sudden inundation, followed by a reduced flow of water as the reservoirs are refilled, one of the unnamed sources cited by Reuters said.</p>
<p>The report said the work may not immediately threaten supply to Pakistan, which depends on rivers flowing through India for much of its irrigation and hydropower, but it could eventually be affected if other dams launch similar efforts. There are more than half a dozen such projects in the region.</p>
<p>“India did not inform Pakistan about the work at the Salal and Baglihar projects, which is being done for the first time since they were built in 1987 and 2008/09, respectively, as the treaty had blocked such work,” Reuters said, quoting sources.</p>
<p>The report said the Indian authorities had also asked officials concerned to open the adjustable gates for cleaning, which they did from May 1. The effort was aimed at freeing dam operations from any restrictions, it added.</p>

            <p><p>NEW DELHI: Air France and Germany’s Lufthansa were among global carriers avoiding Pakistani airspace, airlines and flight trackers showed, as tensions between India and Pakistan remained high.</p>
<p>India took measures such as closing its airspace to Pakistan airlines, while Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906648">barred</a> those owned or operated by its neighbour, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908417">suspended trade</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284#:~:text=As%20done%20by%20India%2C%20Pakistan%20also%20suspended%20all%20visas%20under%20the%20Saarc%20Visa%20Exemption%20Scheme%20(SVES)%20issued%20to%20Indian%20nationals%20and%20deemed%20them%20cancelled%20with%20immediate%20effect%2C%20except%20for%20Sikh%20religious%20pilgrims.">halted special visas</a> for Indians, although it let international airlines use its airspace.</p>
<p>Lufthansa Group’s airlines are  “avoiding Pakis­tani airspace until further notice”, it said in a statement to <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Civil Avi­a­tion Authority declined a <em>Reuters</em> request for comment.</p>
<p>However, flight tracking data showed some flights of British Airways, Swiss International Air Lines and Emirates turning north towards Delhi in order to avoid Pakistani airspace, after travelling over the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>British Airways and Emirates did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>“The airline has decided to suspend overflight of Pakistan until further notice,” Air France said in a statement, citing the  “recent evolution of tensions” between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>The carrier said it was altering its flight schedule and flight plans with destinations such as Delhi, Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh, entailing longer flight times.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908736/tax-officers-to-be-stationed-at-business-premises' target='_blank'><strong>Tax officers to be stationed at business premises</strong></a>
            <p><p><strong>• PM says ongoing reforms aimed at reducing burden on the common man<br />
• Chambers, traders’ bodies slam govt for not taking them on board</strong></p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: In what appears to be a major step to broaden the country’s narrow tax base, the government has authorised the stationing of tax officers at business premises to monitor production, stocks, supply of goods and rendering of services in the largely undocumented service sector.</p>
<p>On Monday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was briefed about three major amendments which address urgent legal, administrative and enforcement gaps in the tax system. These amendments were implemented through the Tax Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2025.</p>
<p>The amendment pertains to the posting of FBR officers at business premises under Section 175C and is intended to help monitor the revenue collection of high-end services and sectors operating outside the scope of the existing sales tax regime.</p>
<p>This section will not cover traders who are already regulated under section 40B of the Sales Tax Act 1990.</p>
<p>This step simply brings services into parity and ensures fair and comprehensive oversight across sectors, tackling an underground economy that is estimated to be more than 30pc of the GDP.</p>
<p>The measure is a response to the growing tax fatigue among the salaried class and documented manufacturers. Through enhanced documentation of the high-potential service sector, the FBR aims to create a fiscal space that could allow potential downward revisions in personal income tax rates on salaried individuals.</p>
<p>The service sector, which represents nearly 60pc of GDP, remains largely undocumented as over 70pc of enterprises are reportedly unregistered.</p>
<p>The scope of this section specifically targets high-earning yet under-documented businesses. Prominent among these are restaurants, hotels, guest houses, marriage halls, clubs, courier and cargo services, beauty parlours, clinics, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories, gyms, foreign exchange dealers and photographers.</p>
<p>Some private hospitals are reportedly charging Rs100,000 to 200,000 per day for inpatient room occupancy — rates that exceed even those of five-star hotels. Many of these entities are underreporting revenues and do not comply with tax laws, undermining public trust and depriving the state of critical revenue needed for social services and infrastructure building.</p>
<p>This amendment introduces a monitoring mechanism, subject to inter-agency oversight, ensuring that FBR officers cannot act without accountability or beyond the authorised scope. All operations under this provision will be conducted transparently, under strictly defined SOPs, and in coordination with other regulatory authorities to prevent overreach or harassment.</p>
<p><strong>PM’s observations</strong></p>
<p>PM Shehbaz says ongoing tax reforms are aimed at reducing the burden on the common man. He said the amendments in various provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance and the Federal Excise Act will remove obstacles in tax collection.</p>
<p>According to a statement by the Prime Minister’s Secretariat, the amendments will make the tax payment system more convenient and will not affect the rights of individuals and companies who regularly pay taxes.</p>
<p>The premier directed the authorities to expedite measures against tax evasion, under-invoicing and other irregularities in different sectors on priority basis.</p>
<p>He also directed strict legal action against buying and selling of illicit cigarettes and other items.</p>
<p>The meeting was briefed about steps taken against tax evasion in tobacco, cement, poultry, sugar, beverages and other industries. The prime minister was informed that work was underway on digital monitoring and the track and trace system.</p>
<p>The FBR has been successful in identifying irregularities in many industries through video monitoring. The meeting was told that powers to seize illicit products have also been transferred to provinces.</p>
<p><strong>Tax amendments</strong></p>
<p>The first amendment relates to Sections 138(3A) and 140(6A), concerning the immediate payment of tax demand even if a stay is granted or an appeal is pending. Following the recent constitutional amendment, special benches have been established in the superior judiciary to fast-track such cases under the oversight of the Chief Justice of Pakistan. Although the courts are now resolving cases promptly, a lacuna in the law previously allowed taxpayers a 30-day delay in making payments on confirmed demands — even when the matter had been conclusively decided by a court.</p>
<p>As a result, billions in confirmed revenue remained unrealised despite clear court verdicts. The amendment through Sections 138(3A) and 140(6A) seeks to curtail this delay and allow for swift implementation of final judgements issued by the Supreme Court and High Courts.</p>
<p>It is categorically clarified that this provision does not apply to orders passed by lower appellate forums such as commissioners, commissioner of appeals, or Inland Revenue Appellate Tribunals.</p>
<p>It is strictly limited to cases where the highest courts have already adjudicated on the matter and no stay is available. This provision does not overrule any stay granted by the Supreme Court or a high court. On the contrary, it reinforces the tax recovery order adjudicated by the Supreme Court or a high court.</p>
<p>The second amendment addresses the visits of FBR officers to private sector industries not currently accountable to FBR. The visits of FBR officers and officials to business premises engaged in taxable activities — whether earning taxable income or supplying taxable goods and services — are strictly regulated through a series of rules and STGOs. All such visits must be authorised through a bar-coded letter and officials are required to record proceedings on a mobile device for transparency.</p>
<p>Officers are provided with standardized pro forma documents, which are completed during the visit and submitted both electronically via a mobile application and in hard copy to a chief commissioner or to the FBR headquarters.</p>
<p>The conduct of these officers is closely monitored by civil intelligence agencies, and any instance of misconduct — whether reported by intelligence or private businesses — is promptly investigated and addressed.</p>
<p><strong>KCCI, LCCI criticise move</strong></p>
<p>The chief of the Karachi Chambers of Commerce and Industry opposed the insertion of Sections 138(3A) and 140(6A) in the Income Tax Ordinance because these provisions “override judgments of superior courts”.</p>
<p>Mohammad Jawed Bilwani said the business community was worried because the new law would make disputed tax liabilities immediately recoverable even where relief was granted by judicial forums.</p>
<p>Mian Abuzar Shad, who heads the Lahore Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said in a statement that the business community “rejects the controversial amendments” as no stakeholders were consulted.</p>
<p>“These amendments are dangerous and anti-business. Therefore, we unanimously demand their immediate withdrawal or parliamentary review through proper consultation,” Mr Shad said.</p>
