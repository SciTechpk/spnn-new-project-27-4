            <p><p>• ISPR DG says 26 Indian sites struck, response textbook demonstration of integrated tri-services<br />
• Indian military dodges question about loss of fighter jets</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s armed forces on Sunday said they struck 26 Indian targets in ‘<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a>’ to re-establish deterrence after India violated Pakistan’s airspace earlier this week and separately targeted air bases in early-morning strikes.</p>
<p>In a press conference alongside Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Director General Public Relations Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed and Naval Staff (Operations) Deputy Chief Vice Admiral Raja Rab Nawaz, Pakistan Army’s chief spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared details about the operation.</p>
<p>He said the dastardly attacks began on the night of May 6 and 7, resulting in the loss of innocent civilian lives, including women, children and the elderly. He said one Pakistani aircraft was slightly damaged during the Indian missile attack.</p>
<p>“Twenty-six military targets, along with facilities in India used to target Pakistani citizens and entities involved in fomenting terrorism in Pakistan, were engaged in both Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and mainland India,” he said in the presser.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>Gen Chaudhry said Pakistan’s response was a “textbook demonstration” of integrated tri-services, enabled by real-time situational awareness, network-centric warfare capabilities and seamless multidomain operations.</p>
<p>“The targets included air force and aviation bases at Suratgarh, Sirsa, Adampur, Bhooj, Nalia, Bathinda, Barnala, Halwara, Avantipura, Srinagar, Jammu, Mamoon, Ambala, Udampur and Pathankot — all of which sustained major damages,” he added.</p>
<p>The DG said Brahmos facilities, which had fired missiles in Pakistan and killed innocent civilians, were also destroyed.</p>

<p>India launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">series of strikes</a> under ‘Operation Sindoor’ soon after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam tragedy</a> in the early hours of May 7 across Pakistan, in which 31 people were martyred. Pakistan’s military responded swiftly, downing five Indian jets, destroying Indian brigade headquarters, and check posts in the occupied Kashmir along the Line of Control.</p>
<p>The ISPR chief paid tribute to those who were martyred in the Indian aggression and their families, while praying for the speedy recovery of the wounded.</p>
<p>“We extend our heartfelt gratitude to every officer, soldier, airman and sailor of the Armed Forces of Pakistan who made this success on the battlefield possible through their courage, professionalism and sacrifice.”</p>
<p>The military spokesperson particularly thanked the youth of Pakistan — “who became the frontline soldiers as information and cyber warriors of the country” — and the media that stood as a “steel wall” against the Indian media. He also appreciated politicians for their support to the army during these times and lauded the premier for taking “destiny-changing decisions” during this testing time</p>
<p><strong>War not an option</strong></p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to a question about who first requested for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>, the DG ISPR said: “Put it on record that Pakistan never requested for a ceasefire.”</p>
<p>He warned that there was no space for a war between two nuclear-armed nations. “if anyone wants to carve out this space for war, he is actually carving out the space for mutual annihilation,” he added.</p>
<p>He said: “This is why you saw how in this conflict Pakistan acted in a very mature manner and through conventional forces, we maintained escalation control, through conventional forces we gave them a two notch up response while also ensuring that the Pakistan forces employed on the counterterrorism operations … no pull is also exerted on them.”</p>
<p><strong>IAF airfields hit</strong></p>
<p>Air Vice Marshal Ahmed, while describing Pakistan’s response to the Indian Air Force, said the PAF’s response was based “on the time and place of own choosing”, displaying “bold, aggressive and unwavering resolve of the brave military leadership”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“I must appreciate the leadership … they were resolute and clear in giving instructions to all of us and that is perhaps the reason why we were so sure about what we had to do,” he said.</p>
<p>“With unprecedented reach, precision and lethality, while avoiding collateral, the PAF hit maximum number of IAF airfields in a single operational package since 1971 because they crossed the international border,” the officer said.</p>
<p>“While reestablishing deterrence, Pakistan negated the setting of a new normal under the hegemonistic design of a supremacist regime through swift and effective response.”</p>
<p><strong>Sea frontiers</strong></p>
<p>Vice Admiral Rab Nawaz said the Pakistan Navy was able to defend the country’s sea frontiers from a “numerically superior enemy”.</p>
<p>He gave details of the navy’s readiness to thwart any attack from the sea. He said there was a hype that INS Vikrant (Indian fleet) was approaching Karachi. “We were keeping a very close eye on the activities at sea […] we were monitoring it from day one,” he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“On the night of May 6 and 7, it was close to Bombay and on May 9, it was essentially 400 nautical miles from the Pakistani coast and it retreated close to Bombay,” he said.</p>
<p>“If a carrier gets within 400 nautical miles, it simplifies our problem. The navy maritime air arm was proper ready to generate a response at all times. If there was any aggression from the sea we were ready to respond effectively,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Indian military dodges question</strong></p>
<p>Indian military officers, meanwhile, said that the objectives of ‘Operation Sindoor’ were achieved, with ‘high-value terrorists’ being eliminated, but dodged a question whether they had lost a bunch of warplanes in the operation.</p>
<p>The officers, speaking at a press conference, provided key details on Operation Sindoor, its impact and results, saying that the “objective has been achieved”.</p>
<p>Air Marshal AK Bharti, DGMO Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai, Maj Gen SS Sharma and Vice Admiral AN Pramod addressed the press. Responding to reports that Rafale fighter jets were downed, Air Marshal AK Bharti did not confirm or deny the claims, stating instead that “losses are a part of any combat scenario”.</p>
<p>The Indian military said, “We are in a combat scenario and losses are a part of it. Question is that ‘have we achieved our objective’? Answer is a thumping yes. As for details, at this time I would not like to comment on that, as we are still in combat, and give advantage to (our) adversary. All our pilots are back home.”</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910378/ajk-villagers-torn-between-fear-and-hope' target='_blank'><strong>AJK villagers torn between fear and hope</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Emergency declared in LoC districts<br />
• Educational institutions across AJK to remain closed until further notice as civil defence seeks thorough safety sweeps<br />
• Thousands evacuated from LoC need humanitarian assistance<br />
• Affectees lack adequate privacy and safety</p>
<p>MUZAFFARABAD: A day after Pakistan and India agreed to de-escalate tensions, internally displaced persons (IDPs) from vulnerable areas along the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909871/locals-describe-night-of-heaviest-shelling-along-line-of-control">Line of Control</a> (LoC) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) found themselves caught in a dilemma — torn between the longing to return home and lingering doubts about the durability of the ceasefire.</p>
<p>According to Sardar Waheed Khan, Director General of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), calm had largely prevailed along the LoC following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire agreement</a> — except in Barnala sector of Bhimber district, where Indian shelling continued until 10:30 pm on Saturday before finally subsiding.</p>
<p>He said intense shelling had officially displaced around 1,186 families across AJK. However, he acknowledged that several other families had quietly fled their homes without notifying the authorities, meaning the actual number of displaced persons could be higher.</p>
<p>On Sunday, some displaced families began pre­paring to return, but many remained hesitant.</p>
<p>“We are not ready to take the risk just yet,” said Zahida Parveen, a housewife from Bugna Ban Chattar village in Neelum Valley, cradling her infant in a high school building in Lower Plate neighbourhood of Muzaffarabad.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“It’s our children we’re most worried about. We fled in panic and don’t want to go back unless we’re sure it’s safe.”</p>
<p>Parveen said she and her two sisters-in-law had rushed to Muzaffar­abad with their infants after a brief pause in Indian shelling on Friday.</p>
<p>“We stayed with some relatives for two nights, but they had limited space. So, we’ve moved to this school building and will wait to see what happens on Monday.”</p>
<p>Their fear was compounded by a recent tragedy: a teenage boy in their village was killed by shell fragments just a day earlier.</p>
<p>“We’ll reassess tomorrow after­noon,” said Mahreen Gillani, one of the sisters-in-law, seated beside her.</p>
<p>Outside in the school veranda, Syed Mureed Hussain, 56, from Sandok village, expressed a similar view: “My heart wants to go back, but the children are terrified. The sound of artillery still echoes in their minds.”</p>
<p>He said he planned to stay with relatives on the outskirts of Muzaffarabad for another day or two.</p>
<p>Nazarat Ali Kazmi, 39, another villager, said his trust in the ceasefire was low.</p>
<p>“There was a time when the Indian army raised white flags — a truce signal — and still resumed firing,” he alleged.</p>
<p>However, in Kotli’s Khuiratta Tehsil, many displaced people were more optimistic.</p>
<p>“I’m hopeful this agreement holds. We want to go back to our land,” said Chaudhry Azam, a 55-year-old farmer from Jamairi Kas village, just 200 metres from the LoC.</p>
<p>His home was damaged and livestock killed in Friday’s shelling, forcing him to seek shelter at a friend’s house in Manjwar, four kilometres away.</p>
<p>“People here have been kind, but there’s no place like home — even if it’s damaged,” he said.</p>
<p>“We’ve been told by local officials to wait until Monday noon. One more day won’t hurt.”</p>
<p>Neelum Deputy Commissioner Nadeem Ahmed Janjua confirmed that return was being encouraged, but with caution.</p>
<p>“These people left voluntarily and are returning voluntarily. All we have advised them is to remain alert until the situation stabilises,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that despite the shelling, life had not come to a complete halt. “Even in the worst days, passenger vans and grocery-laden vehicles continued to operate on the main Neelum road, and we made sure to facilitate them.”</p>
<p><strong>Schools to stay shut</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, SDMA Director General Sardar Waheed Khan announced on Sunday that all educational institutions across AJK would remain closed until further notice, pending a decision by a cabinet committee.</p>
<p>“The decision regarding the reopening of schools and colleges will be announced through the SDMA platform,” he said in a post on his social media accounts.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Separately, in light of recent Indian aggression and unprovoked shelling, Civil Defence Department Director General Abrar Azam urged immediate precautionary measures ahead of any plans to resume academic activities.</p>
<p>In a letter addressed to the divisional commissioners of Muzaffarabad, Mirpur, and Poonch, Mr Azam cited credible reports of suspicious objects, including unexploded ordnance (UXOs), allegedly dropped by Indian forces in civilian areas near the LoC.</p>
<p>“Given the danger posed by unexploded bombs and toy-like explosive devices, it is essential to carry out thorough search-and-sweep operations in all educational institutions before classes resume,” he stressed, urging timely safety measures on part of district administration concerned to ensure the protection of students and staff.</p>
<p><strong>Humanitarian assistance</strong></p>
<p>Thousands of people relocated from villages and their local communities near the Line of Control (LoC) due to drone strikes, indiscriminate cross-border firing, shelling and artillery exchanges, are facing the most severe impacts, needing humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>Based on the findings of the Rapid Needs Assessment carried out by Islamic Relief Pakistan (IRF), immediate and comprehensive intervention is required to address the multifaceted needs of the affected people.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>A significant limitation was the security risk posed by ongoing cross-border shelling and firing. Access to certain high-risk villages was restricted due to safety concerns, and some visits had to be delayed or rerouted. This limited access to the most affected areas, potentially leading to gaps in data from frontline communities, IRF report says.</p>
<p>The IRF teams collected data across three districts: Muzaffarabad, Bagh and Haveli. The 58pc people residing near the border are also facing protection concerns due to damaged shelters, as many are currently living in public schools and even with relatives, lacking adequate privacy and safety.</p>
<p>The SDMA said a state of emergency has been declared in districts of LOC: Muzaffarabad, Neelum, Haveli, Jhelum Valley, and Kotli. There are mobility restrictions, road closures, and civilians are advised to evacuate from high-risk zones.</p>
<p>Displaced families are relocating to safer areas with relatives. Schools and essential services remain suspended, exacerbating vulnerabilities, particularly for women and children.</p>
<p>Assessment results show 58pc of the population lacks access to clean water, hygiene and dignity kits, primarily due to damaged infrastructure and widespread displacement across AJ&amp;K. Many water sources at community level have been destroyed by heavy mortar fire and shelling, further compounding the crisis. Sanitation conditions have also deteriorated considerably, particularly in displacement settings.</p>
<p>As lack of adequate shelter and displacement led to psychological distress, immediate and comprehensive intervention is needed to provide temporary shelters, non-food items, and protection services to address the urgent needs of displaced families.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of proper shelter, many children have been unable to sleep properly, and are increasingly exposed to insect and mosquito bites, significantly raising health and protection risks.</p>
<p>Temporary camp conditions, lack of privacy, and inadequate facilities increase the risk of gender-based violence and sexual exploitation.</p>

            <p><p>• Trump offers to work with Pakistan, India to find solution to Kashmir dispute<br />
• Pakistan welcomes US offer, says settlement must be under UNSC resolutions<br />
• FO says committed to regional peace, security, interested in boosting trade ties with US</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: As hostilities between Pakistan and India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">come to an end</a> with the help of the US, Pakistan on Sunday welcomed a proposal by President Donald Trump expressing willingness to play an active role for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute by working with both South Asian countries with an aim to put an end to this perennial conflict.</p>
<p>Diplomacy and pressure from the United States helped secure the ceasefire deal on Saturday evening, but within hours of its coming into force, both sides started blaming each other for violations. The reported <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910167/kashmiris-brave-another-night-of-shelling-across-loc">shelling</a> died down by Sunday dawn.</p>
<p>President Trump, in a <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114487190752990599" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> posted on his Truth Social platform on Sunday, praised the leadership in New Delhi and Islamabad for agreeing to a ceasefire and credited the US efforts for facilitating this “historic and heroic decision”. “I will work with both of you to see if, after a ‘thousand years’, a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir,” the US president said in his message.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch    media--uneven  media--stretch">

    </figure></p>
<p>In a swift response to the remarks made by President Trump, Pakistan’s Foreign Office acknowledged with “appreciation the constructive role played by the United States, alongside other friendly states, in supporting the recent ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India”.</p>
<p>The FO in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1921490485215924672" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> said that Islamabad appreciated President Trump’s expressed “willingness to support efforts aimed at the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute — a longstanding issue that has serious implications for peace and security in South Asia and beyond”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan reaffirms that any just and lasting settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute must be in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and must ensure the realisation of the fundamental rights of the Kashmiri people, including their inalienable right to self-determination,” said the statement, adding that Pakistan was committed to engaging with the US and the international community to promote peace, security, and prosperity in the region.</p>
<p>“We also look forward to deepening our multifaceted partnership with the United States, particularly in the areas of trade, investment, and economic cooperation,” it added.</p>
<p>Mr Trump’s Kashmir statement came a day after India and Pakistan agreed to a “full and immediate” ceasefire along the Line of Control and International Border, following what the US president described as a “long night” of negotiations facilitated by Washington.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>, which came into effect on Saturday, was endorsed by Indian and Pakistani officials shortly after the initial declaration by Mr Trump. Tensions had spiked after Indian forces struck targets in nuclear-armed Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir last week. The flare-up raised fears of a wider regional conflict.</p>
<p>Referring to the role his administration played in defusing the crisis, Mr Trump said, “I am very proud of the strong and unwavering leadership of India and Pakistan for having the strength, wisdom, and fortitude to understand that it was time to stop the aggression that could have led to the death and destruction of so many.”</p>
<p>He warned that “millions of good and innocent people could have died” if both sides had failed to seize the moment. “Your legacy is greatly enhanced by your brave actions. I am proud that the USA was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision,” he added.</p>
<p>While the Kashmir issue was not explicitly mentioned in the ceasefire announcement, Mr Trump emphasised his intention to stay engaged on the broader dispute. “I will work with you both to see if, after a thousand years, a solution can be found regarding Kashmir,” he wrote, adding that he also intended to “increase trade substantially with both of these great nations”.</p>
<p>He also previously referred to Kashmir as a “thousand-year” dispute, a term initially seen as a mistake but later “interpreted” as a way of stressing the deep-rooted and complex nature of the conflict.</p>
<p>“I am very close to India and I’m very close to Pakistan, as you know. And they’ve had that fight for a thousand years in Kashmir. Kashmir has been going on for a thousand years, probably longer than that…” he told reporters last month.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Several senior US officials and Republican lawmakers celebrated the ceasefire and credited President Trump for what they described as a landmark moment in regional diplomacy.</p>
<p>“I am incredibly proud to serve alongside Vice President Vance and Secretary Rubio. This historic administration is working every day to achieve peace. The golden age is coming, and it starts with peace throughout the world,” said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.</p>
<p>Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who is expected to be nominated as US ambassador to the UN, said this was “progress toward stability in a historically volatile region. It won’t be easy, there will be violations, and much work remains to be done, but it is another step in President Trump’s commitment to peace.”</p>
