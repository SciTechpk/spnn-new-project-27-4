            <p><p>Justice Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and the three acting chief justices of the high courts took their oaths on Tuesday as the regular top judges.</p>
<p>The oath-taking ceremonies were held a day after President Asif Ali Zardari <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922612">appointed</a> them, based on the nominations by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).</p>
<p>President Zardari administered the oath of office to Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar, who has been serving in an acting capacity since February, during a ceremony held at Aiwan-i-Sadr in Islamabad.</p>
<p>The ceremony was attended by IHC judges, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, ministers, parliamentarians and the legal fraternity, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/justice-dogar-sworn-in-as-cj-ihc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>

<p>The development comes less than a month after the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench, by a majority of 3-2, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918332">upheld</a> the constitutionality of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889123">transferring three judges</a> from other provincial high courts to the IHC and referred the matter of seniority determination to the president.</p>
<p>The matter of Justice Dogar and two other judges’ transfer to the IHC in February had sparked a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889623">controversy</a> as he was made the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889639">senior puisne judge</a>, paving the way for his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891705">appointment</a> as the acting IHC chief justice after Justice Aamer Farooq’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891044">elevation</a> to the SC.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the high courts in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan also saw their chief justices taking oaths as regular top judges.</p>
<p>In separate ceremonies, Justice Syed Muhammad Attique Shah took oath as the Peshawar High Court (PHC) chief justice, Justice Rozi Khan Barrech was sworn in as Balochistan High Court’s (BHC) top judge, and Justice Junaid Ghaffar took the helm of the Sindh High Court (SHC).</p>
<p>Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori administered the oath to Justice Ghaffar at a ceremony held at the Governor House in Karachi.</p>
<p>Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, fellow SHC judges and members of the Karachi Bar Association and SHC Bar Association were present on the occasion as well.</p>

<p>After taking oath, Justice Ghaffar visited the Mazar-i-Quaid, where he laid a floral wreath. Responding to a reporter’s query there, he said the confusion of cases being heard by the regular bench or the constitutional bench would “settle down with time”.</p>
<p>Noting that it was the first time that cases had been categorised in such a manner after the 26th Amendment, Justice Ghaffar said whenever there was a confusion of jurisdiction, a larger bench was formed to decide it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891964">Justice Shah</a> assumed the responsibilities as the PHC chief justice in a permanent capacity as KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi administered the oath to him.</p>
<p>He was serving as the PHC acting chief justice since February 14, following the elevation of Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim to the SC.</p>
<p>KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, Minister for States and Frontier Regions Amir Muqam, and KP Assembly’s opposition leader Ibadullah Khan attended the ceremony.</p>
<p>KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed, Peshawar Commissioner Riaz Masood and other top officials were also present.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/fkkundi/status/1942535517435727949" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Kundi said he held a meeting with Justice Shah after the oath-taking to discuss the “vital role of the judiciary in ensuring justice, peace and stability”.</p>
<p>“I reiterated my full support for stronger collaboration between institutions to uphold the Constitution and address public grievances effectively,” the governor asserted.</p>

            <p><p>At least 29 schoolchildren and their driver were injured after a van plunged off a treacherous hilly road in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Tuesday, police said.</p>
<p>Fatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain and poor infrastructure.</p>
<p>The van, carrying boys and girls from the private Islamia Public School in Chikar, was returning students to their homes when it met with the accident near a spot known as Tambrial Mor, Jhelum Superintendent of Police (SP) Mirza Zahid Hussain told <em>Dawn.com.</em></p>
<p>Chikar, a town and hill station in AJK’s Jhelum Valley district, is situated at an altitude of 5,272 feet above sea level and lies about 46 kilometres from Muzaffarabad, the state capital.</p>
<p>As a winter resort, Chikar’s educational institutions do not observe extended summer vacations, unlike other areas.</p>
<p>“It is assumed that after negotiating a bend, the vehicle went out of the driver’s control and fell down the road, causing injuries to almost everyone on board,” the SP said.</p>
<p>He said 16 people that were rushed to Chikar Tehsil Headquarters Hospital were later allowed to go home after treatment while of the 13 students hospitalised in Haitian Bala District Headquarters Hospital, two were kept there, and four others, including the driver, were referred to the Muzaffarabad Combined Military Hospital owing to their serious wounds.</p>
<p>“The rest of the school children were sent home,” he said.</p>
<p>A video clip shared by the SP showed the overturned van resting on a steep, forested slope, surrounded by local residents rushing to help.</p>
<p>“Had it not been for the tall trees that broke the fall, the van could have rolled further down the slope, resulting in heavier losses,” Hussain said.</p>
<p>Last week, six members of a family were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922093/6-dead-as-car-plunges-into-ajks-neelum-valley-officials">killed</a> in AJK’s Neelum valley when their car veered off the road and plummeted hundreds of feet, crashing onto the right bank of the river, officials had said.</p>
<p>In May, an assistant director, three inspectors and a constable of the AJK police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913950">lost</a> their lives when their vehicle plunged into a deep ravine in the Poonch division.</p></p>

            <p><p>An Islamabad court ordered the blocking of 27 YouTube channels for allegedly airing anti-state content and spreading “false, misleading and fake” information, it emerged on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The federal government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1887118">established</a> the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) to probe illegal activities on social med­ia. The NCCIA, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902145">operating</a> under the Interior Divi­sion, has a key role in combatting cybercrime in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Sub-Inspector (SI) Waseem Khan of the NCCIA’s Cyber Crime Circle informed the Islamabad judicial magistrate on June 24 that under Section 37 (unlawful online content) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, the department was conducting an inquiry regarding 27 “Youtube channels who are involved in disseminating and propagating fake and misleading information against the state Institutions which is likely to cause fear, panic, disorder or unrest in the general public or society along with defamatory and fake remarks/information, which violates the privacy and harms the dignity of the officials of state institutions”.</p>
<p>Among the 27 channels are those of the PTI, journalists Matiuallah Jan, Wajahat Khan, Ahmad Noorani and Asad Ali Toor; former anchors Imran Riaz, Orya Maqbool, Sabir Shakir, and Moeed Pirzada .</p>
<p>He further said that the YouTube channels were “found involved in sharing highly intimidating, provocative and derogatory contents against state institutions and officials of state of Pakistan” and were a “source of publicly disseminating/propagating false, misleading and fake information against the state institutions/officials”.</p>
<p>He said that through their channels, the suspects had “attempted to provoke the general public and armed forces personnel by trying to create a feeling of ill-will among pillars of the state”.</p>
<p>SI Khan had requested the court to issue a warrant/subpoena to Google to remove/block the 27 YouTube channels.</p>
<p>Judicial Magistrate Muhammad Abbas Shah’s June 24 order, available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, said he had heard the inquiry officer (IO) and examined the record on file.</p>
<p>“In the light of facts explained and evidence presented by the IO, this court is convinced that the subject matter constitutes offences punishable under the Peca and penal laws of Pakistan.”</p>
<p>He ordered the “head officer in charge of the security department/custodian of records” to Google block/remove the 27 YouTube channels.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Toor said he had received a notice from YouTube, informing him about the legal request received to remove his channel. “You may choose to act on the said content in terms of the aforesaid court order. If you fail to do so, as per our local law obligations, we may comply with the request without further notice to you,” the notice said.</p>
