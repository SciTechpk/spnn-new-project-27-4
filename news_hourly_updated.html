                <h2>Pakistan successfully conducts launch of Fatah missile: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan on Monday conducted a successful training launch of a Fatah Series surface-to-surface missile with a range of 120 kilometres as part of ongoing exercise, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.</p>
<p>The guidance system makes this rocket a precision weapon enhancing its lethality and efficacy, while the trajectory mode and terminal guidance technology enables it to evade the enemy‚Äôs anti-ballistic missile systems.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile‚Äôs advanced navigation system and enhanced accuracy.</p>
<p>The training launch was witnessed by senior officers of the army , as well as officers, scientists and engineers from Pakistan‚Äôs strategic organisations, the military‚Äôs media wing said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúChairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, and the Chief of Army Staff extended their congratulations to the participating troops, scientists, and engineers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey expressed complete confidence in the operational preparedness and technical proficiency of Pakistan Army to thwart any aggression against the territorial integrity of Pakistan,‚Äù ISPR said.</p>
<p>In May last year, the army <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1833760">conducted a test-launch</a> of Fatah-II guided rocket system which had a range of 400 kilometres.</p>
<p>Fatah-II is being inducted in the artillery divisions of the army for stand-off and precision engagement of deep target strikes and it would be used in conventional warfare by the army.</p>

            </a>
            <p><p>China on Monday reaffirmed its support for Pakistan amid escalation with India as President Asif Ali Zardari met with Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> on April 22 in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> as it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an incursion and India‚Äôs premier granting ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>‚Äù to his military.

<p>During today‚Äôs meeting with Ambassador Jiang, who called on him at Aiwan-i-Sadr, Zardari expressed concern over the recent ‚Äúirresponsible and  aggressive rhetoric by the Indian government‚Äù, saying that such actions threaten regional peace and stability.</p>

<p>The two discussed matters of bilateral importance, with a particular focus on the ongoing situation between Pakistan and India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>The Chinese ambassador reaffirmed the ‚Äúenduring and time-tested friendship between China and Pakistan‚Äù, describing the relationship as one of ‚Äúironclad brothers‚Äù who have always supported each other in challenging times.</p>
<p>He thanked Zardari for sharing Pakistan‚Äôs perspective, and emphasised that China would always support its ally to achieve the common desire of both countries to secure peace and stability in South Asia.</p>

<p>Zaradari conveyed his deep appreciation and gratitude to the Chinese government for its ‚Äúconsistent support, always standing by Pakistan in difficult times‚Äù.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907760">thanked China‚Äôs envoy</a> for endorsing his offer to conduct a neutral probe into the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>Last week, China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907094/china-urges-india-pakistan-to-exercise-restraint-after-pahalgam-attack">urged</a> both India and Pakistan to ‚Äúexercise restraint‚Äù as the two countries reportedly exchanged fire at the Line of Control (LoC).</p>

<p>A day ago, Islamabad decided to seek an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908460">immediate session</a> of the United Nations Security Council to apprise world powers about the recent tensions with India.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908460#:~:text=On%20Sunday%2C%20Prime%20Minister%20Shehbaz%20Sharif%20talked%20to%20his%20Malaysian%20counterpart%2C%20while%20Foreign%20Minister%20Ishaq%20Dar%20spoke%20to%20the%20Malaysian%20as%20well%20as%20Russian%20foreign%20ministers%2C%20a%20day%20ahead%20of%20Iran%E2%80%99s%20foreign%20minister%E2%80%99s%20arrival%20in%20Islamabad%20to%20discuss%20the%20same%20matter.">talked</a> to his Malaysian counterpart, while Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke to the Malaysian as well as Russian foreign ministers on the matter.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Foreign Office said FM Dar has issued directions to Pakistan‚Äôs permanent representative to United Nations Ambassador Asim Iftikhar to take immediate steps for the UNSC session.</p>
<p>The instructions came two days after Ambassador Iftikhar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908062">said</a> Pakistan was closely following the situation stemming from India‚Äôs aggressive moves in the wake of the Pahalgam attack and would seek a UNSC meeting at an appropriate time.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis important diplomatic move is part of Pakistan‚Äôs efforts to present true facts before the international community,‚Äù the statement said, adding that Pakistan decided to formally brief the UNSC on the latest situation in the region as well as India‚Äôs aggressive steps and provocative statements.</p>
<p>It said Pakistan would specifically highlight the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty by India.</p></p>
