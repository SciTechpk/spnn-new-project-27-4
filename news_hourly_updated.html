                <h2>Khuzdar attack driven by Indian provocation, had nothing to do with Baloch identity: DG ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has reiterated that ‚ÄúIndian state-sponsored terrorism against Pakistan‚Äù ‚Äî which has been ongoing since the inception of the country ‚Äî was also responsible for the recent attack in Balochistan‚Äôs Khuzdar.</p>
<p>On May 21, at least six people, including three students, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912572/bla-and-ttp-are-indian-proxies-govt-will-prove-indias-involvement-in-khuzdar-bus-attack-asif">slain</a> while over 40 others ‚Äî mostly students ‚Äî were injured after a bomb targeted a school bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the army‚Äôs top brass, during the 270th Corps Commander Conference (CCC), had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912622/armys-top-brass-vows-to-stop-externally-sponsored-terrorists-from-destroying-national-peace-ispr">pointed out</a> India‚Äôs involvement in the incident, vowing that the armed forces will prevent the country‚Äôs peace from being compromised by ‚Äúexternally-sponsored terrorism.‚Äù</p>
<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry was addressing a press conference in Islamabad today alongside the Interior Secretary, Captain (retd) Khurram Muhammad Agha.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia was planning and instructing terrorist activities taking place in Pakistan, the funding for which is also provided by India,‚Äù Lt Gen Chaudhry said. ‚ÄúThe attack in Balochistan had nothing to do with the Baloch identity, rather it was just India‚Äôs provocation.‚Äù</p>
<p>The DG ISPR highlighted that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870033">attack</a> on the Chinese envoy in Karachi in Oct 2024 also had Indian backing. ‚ÄúThe Indian social media accounts affiliated with the Indian intelligence agency RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) posted about the attack beforehand.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that the same thing happened during the hijacking of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419/jaffar-express-hijacking-state-media-reports-190-rescued-2nd-day-of-operation-underway-in-balochistan">Jaffar Express</a> train in March when more than 400 passengers were taken hostage by the banned Balochistan Liberation Army terrorists.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBefore the Jaffer Express incident occurred, they [the social media accounts] were asking followers to ‚Äòkeep an eye on Pakistan today and tomorrow‚Äô.‚Äù</p>
<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry pointed out that the Indian media was ‚Äúcelebrating‚Äù the attack in Khuzdar. ‚ÄúThese are all Indian accounts, affiliated with RAW [and] posting for BLA and <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em>. What kind of a country celebrates acts of terrorism?‚Äù</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#indian-involvement-in-terrorism-since-inception-of-pakistan" id="indian-involvement-in-terrorism-since-inception-of-pakistan" title="Permalink"></a>Indian involvement in terrorism ‚Äòsince inception of Pakistan‚Äô</h2>
<p>The DG ISPR also maintained that New Delhi had been involved in perpetrating terrorism across the country ‚Äúsince the inception of Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn 2009, the Pakistani government handed a dossier containing irrefutable evidence [of India‚Äôs involvement in terror attacks across Pakistan] to the Indian prime minister,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúThe publicly disclosed documents released in 2010 are part of history. In 2016, the world saw another ugly face of India-sponsored terrorism in Balochistan in the form of [Indian spy] Kulbushan Jadhav, a serving Indian naval officer,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Jadhav was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1326535#:~:text=Jadhav%20was%20arrested%20on%20March%203%2C%202016%2C%20in%20a%20counter%2Dintelligence%20operation%20in%20Balochistan%27s%20Mashkel%20area%20for%20his%20involvement%20in%20espionage%20and%20sabotage%20activities%20against%20Pakistan.">arrested</a> on March 3, 2016, in a counter-intelligence operation in Balochistan‚Äôs Mashkel area for his involvement in espionage and sabotage activities against Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen in [2020], a dossier full of evidence was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1590333">presented</a> to the United Nations.
Very recently, the international media has seen confessions and acknowledgement of multiple surrendered terrorists of this <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em>,‚Äù he said, referring to the government-designated term for all terror outfits in Balochistan.</p>
<p>Interior Secretary Agha also said that India was behind the terrorist incident in Khuzdar on May 21.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the aftermath of the despicable terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar in the early morning of May 21, this cowardly attack targeted innocent children, our future, resulting in the tragic loss of six children and injuries to 31 others.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet me be unequivocal that this was not an attack on a bus alone, it was an attack on our values, our education, and the very fabric of our society,‚Äù Capt (retd) Agha said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn behalf of the government of Pakistan, I extend my deepest condolences to the families of the victims, we share their grief and we stand by them in this hour of immense suffering. The Ministry of Interior, in close cooperation with the provincial authorities and the law enforcement agencies, is looking into all [aspects] of this dastardly attack.‚Äù</p>
<p>Capt. (retd) Agha said initial findings confirmed that this attack was a continuity of a broader pattern of violence sponsored by India through <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em>, operating under the tutelage and intelligence of the Indian intelligence agency, RAW [Research and Analysis Wing].</p>
<p>‚ÄúHaving miserably failed in the so-called Operation Sindoor, the terror proxies of Hindustan have been tasked to accentuate their heinous attacks of terrorism in Balochistan and elsewhere. Let me be absolutely clear here, the people of Pakistan will not let them succeed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan and its people, particularly in Balochistan, reject this nefarious design. The state has the capacity and the will to dismantle these networks and bring the perpetrators and their handlers to justice. Such actions will have consequences.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said in the past couple of years, having suffered immense casualties in their attempts against hard targets, <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em> has resorted to hitting soft targets wayfarers, labourers working on development projects, infrastructure and machinery to paint a picture of loosening control of the State.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMuch against the tradition and culture of the Baloch, these terrorists have stooped so low that innocent school children have now been targeted. I assure you that the State, in collaboration with the provincial governments and the state apparatus, will defeat them.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese Indian-sponsored terrorists have no place in Pakistan and our national discourse. We have ‚Ä¶ commitment to bring an end to this violence. Our resolve is firm and our response will be decisive. They will not succeed.‚Äù</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#will-we-be-deterred-absolutely-not" id="will-we-be-deterred-absolutely-not" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòWill we be deterred? Absolutely not‚Äô</h2>
<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry then spoke about the Indian attacks on Pakistan on May 6 and 7, which were carried out by New Delhi after blaming Islamabad for April‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> in occupied Kashmir and led to civilian deaths.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNever in modern history have you seen any nation, any media celebrating the killing of children and women the way [India] is celebrating.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is the low moral fibre and level that the current Indian political elite has brought the society to.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that one of the proxies of the <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em> on May 11 issued a press release displaying a post from BLA.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey say, ‚ÄòIf we receive political, diplomatic and defence support from India‚Äô; They say ‚ÄòWe assure India to attack the western border [‚Ä¶] BLA and the entire nation is ready to attack from the western border. We will become its [India‚Äôs] practical and military arm‚Äô.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that RAW made BLA issue this press release ‚Äúbecause they are unable to deter the state of Pakistan ‚Ä¶ They attack but the resolve of Pakistani people has not diminished.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWill we be deterred by the <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em> with such press releases and cowardly actions? Absolutely not. Never,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis nexus [and] <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em> have no relation to the Baloch identity and Pakistan. They are related to them (India). They are their masters and perpetrators. This the evil face of <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em>.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWho is carrying out state-sponsored terror in this region?‚Äù he said, adding that the world could now see that but they [India] still blamed Pakistan. ‚ÄúThey [India] do this to hide from their own terrorism.‚Äù</p>
<p>He further said, ‚ÄúInstead of refraining from their oppression of minorities or finding a solution, they are doing terrorism in Pakistan and the region.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey are externalising internal issues and when anyone asks for evidence, they do not have evidence. Who is the state sponsor of terrorism and the epicentre of destabilisation in this region?‚Äù he questioned.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Indian state-controlled media. Their media is not free, but controlled by the state,‚Äù he said, adding that those who were questioning media freedom in Pakistan were now aware of how free it was, compared to the ‚Äúconditions of media in a so-called democracy [India].‚Äù</p>
<p>Speaking about terrorists who had surrendered, the DG ISPR said: ‚ÄúThere are some brave ones who stand up and surrender because they realise that they were not there to fight India‚Äôs war. They [surrendered terrorists] come and tell how India was involved.‚Äù</p>
<p>He highlighted the case of Adeela Baloch, who surrendered. She was ‚Äúexploited and blackmailed by the <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em> to be used as a suicide bomber‚Äù, he said, adding that India was exploiting young women from Balochistan.</p>
<p>To a question about a policy to counter <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em>, the DG ISPR replied: I would say that one-liner policy is that the nation, this iron wall, we fought in a gallant and exemplary manner against the Indian military aggression on the night of [May] 6 and 7 and you saw it again on May 10.</p>
<p>This steel wall needs to be in unison turned against the forces of terrorism.‚Äú</p>
<p>The DGR ISPR further said: ‚ÄúWe need to understand certain facts. Why did the Indians feel the need to do this military escalation? One of the very important reasons was that all elements of national power over the last two years have gelled together.‚Äù</p>
<p>In answer to a question, the DG ISPR also vehemently criticised the Baloch Yakjehti Committee and its leader Dr Mahrang Baloch, saying that the media needed to ‚Äúunmask‚Äù the group and its membership.</p>

                <h2>Pakistan rubbishes Indian PM Modi‚Äôs bid to link Islamabad with terrorism</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office on Friday categorically rejected the ‚Äúbaseless, provocative, and irresponsible allegations‚Äù made by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who in a heated speech accused Pakistan of carrying out terrorist attacks in his country.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between New Delhi and Islamabad came as tensions over last month‚Äôs Pahalgam attack continued to build up, as India ‚Äîwithout evidence ‚Äî blamed Pakistan for the attack. On the night of May 6-7, India launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting</a> drones sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat</a> strikes on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns and declare a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">ceasefire</a>. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">offered talks</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Indian premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912761/no-water-for-pakistan-from-indian-rivers-modi">said</a> that Pakistan would not get water from rivers over which India has rights.</p>
<p>According to a statement <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1925764355250950294/photo/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued</a> by the FO on X today, ‚ÄúPakistan categorically rejects the baseless, provocative, and irresponsible allegations made by the Indian prime minister during a recent public address in Rajasthan.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúThe remarks, replete with distortions, misrepresentations, and inflammatory rhetoric, are clearly aimed at stoking regional tensions for narrow political gains,‚Äù the FO said, adding that such statements not only reflect a deliberate attempt to mislead the public but also violate the norms responsible statecraft.</p>
<p>‚ÄúResorting to threats and boasting about military action against a sovereign nation is a grave breach of the United Nations Charter and established principles of international law,‚Äù the FO said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis dangerous approach undermines regional peace and stability,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The foreign ministry said that Pakistan remained a ‚Äúconsistent and proactive partner in the global fight against terrorism‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAny insinuation seeking to associate Pakistan with acts of terrorism is factually incorrect and patently misleading,‚Äù it continued.</p>
<p>It noted that the Indian premier‚Äôs tactic was ‚Äúoften employed to divert attention from India‚Äôs own internal challenges‚Äù, adding that the Indian attempts to mask its ‚Äúserious human rights violations‚Äù in occupied Kashmir by scapegoating Pakistan were well-documented and increasingly recognised by the international community.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe plight of the Kashmiri people and their just struggle for self-determination cannot be obscured by aggressive rhetoric and political deflection.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pakistan urged the Indian leadership to ‚Äúexercise responsibility and restraint‚Äù, the FO said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEscalatory statements and belligerent posturing serve no purpose other than exacerbating tensions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRather than resorting to fictitious narratives and warmongering for electoral mileage, India should demonstrate maturity by resolving outstanding disputes through peaceful dialogue and diplomacy,‚Äù the FO noted.</p>
<p>It added that Pakistan remained firmly committed to ‚Äúpeaceful coexistence, regional stability, and constructive engagement‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, our desire for peace should not be misconstrued as weakness,‚Äù it said, adding that the people and the armed forced were ‚Äúfully prepared and capable of defending the country‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAny misadventure or aggression will be met with a resolute and proportionate response,‚Äù the FO added.</p>
<p>It said that Pakistan has demonstrated its resolve in the past and will do so again, if required.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe international community must take serious note of India‚Äôs aggressive posture and hate-driven narratives that threaten regional peace,‚Äù it said, adding that it was ‚Äúimperative to discourage such rhetoric and actions to preserve stability in South Asia‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGlorification of conflict benefits no one, and the path to lasting peace lies in dialogue, mutual respect, and adherence to international law,‚Äù it concluded.</p></p>
