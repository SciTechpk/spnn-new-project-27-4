            <p><p>US President Donald Trump and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir discussed joint counterterrorism efforts and expanding bilateral trade during their “cordial” meeting in Washington, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Gen Munir met with Trump at the White House yesterday, becoming the first serving chief of army staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. The occasion also marked the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">first time</a> a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law.</p>
<p>The high-level engagement was scheduled at the Cabinet Room over luncheon, followed by a visit to the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Senator Marco Rubio and Special Representative for Middle Eastern Affairs Steve Witkoff were present during the meeting from the US side, while National Security Advisor <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907660/in-a-first-isi-chief-made-national-security-adviser">Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik</a> — also the intelligence chief — accompanied the COAS.</p>
<p>“Although initially scheduled for one hour, the meeting extended for over two hours, underscoring the depth and cordiality of the dialogue,” the ISPR said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7323" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Trump “lauded Pakistan’s ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counterterrorism cooperation between the two states”, the statement said.</p>
<p>It noted that both sides reaffirmed their commitment to continued collaboration in the field of counterterrorism.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Discussions also encompassed avenues for expanding bilateral cooperation in multiple domains, including trade, economic development, mines and minerals, artificial intelligence, energy, cryptocurrency, and emerging technologies,” the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>“President Trump expressed keen interest in forging a mutually beneficial trade partnership with Pakistan based on long-term strategic convergence and shared interests,” it highlighted.</p>
<p>The US president also commended Field Marshal Munir’s “leadership and decisiveness during a period of complex regional dynamics”.</p>
<p>The army chief extended an invitation to Trump, on behalf of the government, to undertake an official visit to Pakistan at a mutually convenient date, the ISPR said, calling it a “gesture reflecting the warmth of bilateral ties”.</p>
<p>On his part, COAS Munir conveyed the deep appreciation of the government and people of Pakistan for Trump’s “constructive and result-oriented role in facilitating a ceasefire between Pakistan and India in the recent regional crisis”.</p>
<p>He “acknowledged President Trump’s statesmanship and his ability to comprehend and address the multifaceted challenges faced by the global community”, the ISPR press release said.</p>
<p>“A detailed exchange of views also took place on the prevailing tensions between Iran and Israel, with both leaders emphasising the importance of resolution of the conflict,” it added, referring to the ongoing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918048/iran-israel-trade-fresh-air-attacks-as-trump-weighs-us-involvement">missile exchange</a> between the two regional arch foes that marks a week today.</p>
<p>The military noted that the engagement “marks a significant moment in the ongoing efforts to reinforce the longstanding partnership between Pakistan and the United States, built upon shared objectives of peace, stability, and prosperity”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif termed the meeting a “milestone in Pak-US ties” and a “success of the current hybrid model of governance”.</p>
<p>“This is the most important turning point in the 78-year history of relations. The way international and regional issues were discussed in this meeting highlighted the importance of the beloved homeland,” Asif <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KhawajaMAsif/status/1935616004857499862" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on X</a>.</p>
<p>He added that Pakistan’s abilities to help resolve issues were acknowledged, along with the Pak-India conflict being shed light on again.</p>
<p>“The revival of the economy, the defeat of India, the glorious and highly successful improvement in relations with the US — all these revolutionary changes were possible with the cooperation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir and the excellent relations between Islamabad and Rawalpindi.”</p>

<p>When questioned about the meeting in an interaction with the media, Trump said, “I was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917868/trump-says-honoured-to-meet-field-marshal-munir-iran-discussed-in-talks">honoured</a> to meet him (Field Marshal Munir) today.</p>
<p>“He (Field Marshal Munir) agreed with me. The reason I had him here was that I wanted to thank him for not going into the war [with India]. And I want to thank PM [Narendra] Modi as well, who just left a few days ago,” he added.</p>
<p>“We’re working on a trade deal with India and Pakistan. These two very smart people decided not to keep going with a war that could have been a nuclear war. Pakistan and India are two big nuclear powers.”</p>

<p>Asked whether the talks included the current Iran-Israel conflict, Trump said: “They (Pakistan) know Iran very well, better than most, and they’re not happy about anything. It’s not that they’re bad with Israel. They know them both, actually, but they know Iran better.”</p>
<p>Questioned by reporters about the meeting prior to it, Trump remarked, “This man (Gen Munir) was extremely influential in stopping it (India-Pakistan fighting) from the Pakistan side.”</p>
<p>White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Trump was hosting Field Marshal Munir after he called for the president to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625/trump-says-us-stopped-pak-india-nuclear-war">preventing a nuclear war</a> between India and Pakistan, <em>Reuters</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/india-will-not-accept-third-party-mediation-relations-with-pakistan-modi-tells-2025-06-18/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>But insiders <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044#:~:text=But%20insiders%20suggested%20that%20the%20meeting%20was%20not%20arranged%20through%20routine%20diplomatic%20channels">suggested</a> that the meeting was not arranged through routine diplomatic channels, but rather was the outcome of “unorthodox efforts” by a group of advisers, businessmen, and other influential figures.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources in Washington said this initiative had been cooking for months and kept under wraps until the White House released Trump’s official schedule on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sources said that deepened counter-terrorism cooperation, engagement with crypto-linked influence networks, and targeted lobbying via Republican-aligned firms in Washington helped Pakistan secure the meeting.</p>
<p>Previous military rulers — such as Field Marshal Ayub Khan, Gen Ziaul Haq, and Gen Pervez Musharraf — met US presidents only after they had assumed the role of head of state.</p>
<p>Former president Barack Obama did briefly “walk in” on a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/734318/mistrust-has-made-us-pakistan-ties-neurotic-wp">White House meeting</a> with then-COAS Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, but that too was not a formal engagement.</p></p>

            <p><p>India will send the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917018">black box</a> recovered from the recent fatally crashed Air India plane to the US for analysis, local newspaper <em>Economic Times</em> reported on Thursday, citing people aware of the development.</p>
<p>“The recorder sustained heavy external damage from post-crash fire making it impossible to extract data in India,” the <em>ET</em> report said, citing people aware of the development.</p>
<p>India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) did not immediately respond to <em>Reuters</em>’ request for comment. Air India declined to comment.</p>
<p>Indian authorities are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917107">investigating</a> the crash of an Air India Boeing Dreamliner, which last week <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916728">killed</a> 241 people on board and at least 30 on ground, marking the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.</p>
<p>The black box consists of two components — the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR). It provides crucial insights for crash investigators, including altitude and airspeed data and pilot conversation records that help determine probable causes of crashes.</p>
<p>Data from the flight data recorder will be extracted at the Washington-based laboratory of the National Transportation Safety Board and shared with AAIB, the <em>ET</em> report added, citing sources.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918124/homeland-insecurity-expelled-afghans-seek-swift-return-to-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Homeland insecurity: expelled Afghans seek swift return to Pakistan</strong></a>
            <p><p>Pakistan says it has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905906">expelled</a> more than a million Afghans in the past two years, yet many have quickly attempted to return — preferring to take their chances dodging the law than struggle for existence in a homeland some had never even seen before.</p>
<p>“Going back there would be sentencing my family to death,” said Hayatullah, a 46-year-old Afghan deported via the Torkham border crossing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in early 2024.</p>
<p>Since April and a renewed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915407">deportation</a> drive, some 200,000 Afghans have spilled over the two main border crossings from Pakistan, entering on trucks loaded with hastily packed belongings.</p>
<p>But they carry little hope of starting over in the impoverished country, where girls are banned from school after the primary level.</p>
<p>Hayatullah, a pseudonym, returned to Pakistan a month after being deported, travelling around 800 kilometres (500 miles) south to the Chaman border crossing in Balochistan, because for him, life in Afghanistan “had come to a standstill”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He paid a bribe to cross the Chaman frontier, “like all the day labourers who regularly travel across the border to work on the other side”.</p>
<p>His wife and three children — including daughters, aged 16 and 18, who would be denied education in Afghanistan — had managed to avoid arrest and deportation.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#relative-security" id="relative-security" title="Permalink"></a>Relative security</h2>
<p>Hayatullah moved the family to Peshawar. “Compared to Islamabad, the police here don’t harass us as much,” he said.</p>
<p>Samad Khan, a 38-year-old Afghan who also spoke using a pseudonym, also chose to relocate his family to Peshawar.</p>
<p>Born in Lahore, he set foot in Afghanistan for the first time on April 22 — the day he was deported.</p>
<p>“We have no relatives in Afghanistan, and there’s no sign of life. There’s no work, no income, and the Taliban are extremely strict,” he said.</p>
<p>At first, he tried to find work in a country where 85 per cent of the population lives on less than one dollar a day, but after a few weeks, he instead found a way back to Pakistan.</p>
<p>“I paid Rs50,000 to an Afghan truck driver,” he said, using one of his Pakistani employees’ ID cards to cross the border.</p>
<p>He rushed back to Lahore to bundle his belongings and wife and two children — who had been left behind — into a vehicle, and moved to Peshawar.</p>
<p>“I started a second-hand shoe business with the support of a friend. The police here don’t harass us like they do in Lahore, and the overall environment is much better,” he told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#challenging-reintegration" id="challenging-reintegration" title="Permalink"></a>‘Challenging’ reintegration</h2>
<p>It’s hard to say how many Afghans have returned, as data is scarce.</p>
<p>Government sources claim that hundreds of thousands of Afghans are already back and settled in KP — figures that cannot be independently verified.</p>
<p>Migrant rights defenders in Pakistan say they’ve heard of such returns, but insist the numbers are limited.</p>
<p>The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) told <em>AFP</em> that “some Afghans who were returned have subsequently chosen to remigrate to Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“When individuals return to areas with limited access to basic services and livelihood opportunities, reintegration can be challenging,” said Avand Azeez Agha, communications officer for the UN agency in Kabul.</p>
<p>They might move on again, he said, “as people seek sustainable opportunities”.</p></p>
