                <h2>For talks with India, PM Shehbaz sees Saudi Arabia as neutral venue</h2>

            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Observes things are calming down following contacts between DGMOs; NSA to lead Pakistan side during dialogue<br />
‚Ä¢ Says Nawaz was consulted before army chief‚Äôs elevation to field marshal</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said Saudi Arabia could be the ‚Äúneutral‚Äù venue for much-needed talks between Pakistan and India on critical issues.</p>
<p>The premier also said that he had consulted PML-N President Nawaz Sharif on his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912186/cabinet-approves-coas-gen-asim-munirs-promotion-to-field-marshal">decision</a> to elevate Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir to field marshal.</p>
<p>Talking to a group of TV anchors at the PM House, he said that Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism will be the key points during the dialogue with India.</p>
<p>In response to a question if there was a possibility of a third venue for talks in light of the mediation offered by US President Donald Trump, the premier ruled out the possibility of China as a neutral venue, saying India would never agree to that.</p>
<p>However, a participant told <em>Dawn</em>, the PM expressed the hope that Saudi Arabia could be the third country where both sides could agree to hold the negotiations.</p>
<p>When it was pointed out that India intends to hold dialogue on terrorism while Pakistan wants to focus on Kashmir, the PM reiterated: ‚ÄúKashmir, water, trade and terrorism will be the key points during Pakistan-India talks.‚Äù</p>
<p>Regarding the appointment of COAS Gen Munir as field marshal, PM Shehbaz said: ‚ÄúIt was my own decision to make the army chief a field marshal.‚Äù</p>
<p>Responding to a question that Nawaz Sharif had always remained opposed to giving extension to the army chief‚Äôs term in office, PM Shehbaz said he took his elder brother into confidence before taking any decision and likewise the COAS was made field marshal after consultation with the ruling party president.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI always consult Nawaz Sharif before taking any key decision and that also happened in case of [elevation of] Gen Asim Munir,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>In reply to a question that the PTI-led KP government needs to be supported in its efforts for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005">eradicating</a> terrorism, the prime minister said Centre was already helping the province in this regard as over Rs600 billion had been released to the KP government under the Public Sector Development Programme.</p>
<p>He said that situation between Pakistan and India was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910567">de-escalating</a> after the DGMOs of the two sides made contacts with each other.</p>
<p>He said if talks were held between the two arch rivals, the National Secur¬≠ity Adviser will lead Paki¬≠stan‚Äôs side in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting on housing</strong></p>
<p>Presiding over a meeting on the low-cost housing, the prime minister said that affordable projects would not only make residential units accessible to the common man but would also boost national economy and create jobs.</p>
<p>He said the relevant task force, in collaboration with the ministry of fina¬≠n¬≠ce and banks, should soon submit recommendations for financing low-cost hou¬≠s¬≠ing projects, which should be included in the upcoming budget proposals.</p>
<p>He observed that sustainable growth of economy was closely linked with the development of the construction sector.</p>
<p>Ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Riaz Hussain Pirzada, Ahad Khan Cheema, Muh¬≠a¬≠mmad Aurangzeb, and Ali Pervaiz Malik, the FBR chairman and other senior officials attended the mee¬≠t¬≠ing, the PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.</p>
<p>The meeting was infor¬≠med that the Condominium Act 2025 and amendments to the Foreclosure Law were in their final stages and after their approval it would become easier to obtain loans for the construction and ownership of homes under the low-cost housing schemes.</p>
<p>The task force briefed the meeting on the progress in initiating construction projects, particularly low-cost housing schemes.</p>

                <h2>IMF yet to decide on budget relief request</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Seeking effective and practical steps for the realisation of agriculture income tax and improvements in retail sector taxation, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has yet to take a position on Pakistan‚Äôs request for relief measures in the upcoming <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909569">budget</a>, due on June 2.</p>
<p>The authorities, however, have committed to meeting any revenue shortfall through reduced expenditure in the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) during the current year. An increase in the petroleum levy and the introduction of a carbon levy on petroleum and other energy products are expected to be part of the forthcoming budget, sources said.</p>
<p>Informed sources told <em>Dawn</em> that, on the directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, officials at the Ministry of Finance and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) have discussed possible relief measures with the IMF mission, which has been engaged in budget <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912130">discussions</a> since May 14. Among the proposed concessions is an average 2.5 per cent reduction in income tax rates across all salaried income slabs.</p>
<p>However, this proposal hinges on IMF staff being satisfied with the government‚Äôs revenue plan that supports the programme‚Äôs target of a 1.6pc primary budget surplus ‚Äî approximately Rs2.1 trillion. An official told <em>Dawn</em> that discussions on budget targets are still ongoing and that no measures have been finalised.</p>

<p>Authorities pledge PSDP cuts to cover revenue gap</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Datasheets and projections, in line with the proposed budgetary framework reviewed in the first biannual review a few weeks ago, have been shared with the IMF. Responses to the Fund‚Äôs queries are currently being compiled. The official said that the IMF‚Äôs position on the proposed revenue and expenditure strategy will become clearer once its staff analyses the data through its software-based framework.</p>
<p>He added that the IMF has neither accepted nor rejected the proposed relief measures for the budget, contrary to reports in certain quarters. Formal discussions regarding budgetary proposals for the real estate sector have yet to take place.</p>
<p>The government‚Äôs ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1835356">Tajir Dost</a>‚Äù scheme for retailers, meanwhile, has failed to yield the desired results and is likely to be replaced by a more effective revenue collection strategy.</p>
<p>The IMF has also emphasised the need to reduce provincial expenditures and increase provincial revenue contributions to maintain fiscal discipline and progress towards implementing a national fiscal pact. A key priority at the provincial level, according to the Fund, should be the effective enforcement of agriculture income tax beginning September 2025.</p>
<p>The government has pledged to withhold PSDP disbursements to offset revenue shortfalls and expects additional tax revenues through the resolution of litigation cases. The Fund has already acknowledged the authorities‚Äô commitment to pursuing resolution of outstanding legal cases ‚Äî worth Rs367 billion out of a total Rs770bn under dispute. These include cases before the Supreme Court (Rs43bn), high courts in Islamabad, Sindh and Lahore (Rs217bn), and the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (Rs104bn).</p>
<p>A favorable SC ruling could effectively resolve cases involving an estimated Rs120bn, according to the IMF.</p>
