                <h2>Defence minister rubbishes Indian air chief‚Äôs ‚Äòcomical‚Äô claims of downing 6 Pakistani aircraft in May conflict</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday rubbished what he said were ‚Äúimplausible‚Äù and ‚Äúcomical‚Äù claims by the Indian Air Force chief that the country had shot down five Pakistani fighter jets and one other military aircraft during clashes in May.</p>
<p>The comments are the first such statement by the Indian side three months after its worst military conflict in decades with its neighbour. During the conflict, Pakistan said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downed</a> five Indian planes in air-to-air combat on May 7, later stating that figure <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">as six</a>. India‚Äôs highest-ranking general has also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914500/indian-military-confirms-fighter-jets-shot-down-by-pakistan">acknowledged</a> that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft.</p>
<p>Speaking at an event in the southern city of Bengaluru, Indian Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh claimed: ‚ÄúWe have at least five fighters confirmed killed, and one large aircraft,‚Äù adding that the large aircraft, which could be a surveillance plane, was shot down at a distance of 300 kilometres.</p>
<p>He alleged that most of the Pakistani aircraft were downed by India‚Äôs Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile system. He cited electronic tracking data as confirmation of the strikes.</p>

<p>Singh did not mention the type of fighter jets that were downed, but claimed that airstrikes also hit an additional surveillance plane and ‚Äúa few F16‚Äù fighters that were parked in hangars at two air bases in <a class="link--external" href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/operation-sindoor-iaf-pakistan-5-fighter-jets-1-large-aircraft-air-marshal-10179475/lite/#:~:text=The%20IAF%20chief%20also%20showed%20that%20the-,Shahbaz%20Jacobabad%20airfield,-was%20one%20of%20the%20major%20airfields%20that%20were%20attacked.%20%E2%80%9CHere" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sindh and Punjab</a>. ‚ÄúThis is actually the largest ever recorded surface-to-air kill,‚Äù he insisted.</p>
<p>Responding to the claims in a post on X, the defence minister said: ‚ÄúThe belated assertions made by the Indian Air Force chief regarding alleged destruction of Pakistani aircraft during Operation Sindoor are as implausible as they are ill-timed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is also ironic how senior Indian military officers are being used as the faces of monumental failure caused by strategic shortsightedness of Indian politicians. For three months, no such claims were voiced ‚Äî while Pakistan, in the immediate aftermath, presented detailed technical briefings to the international media, and independent observers recorded widespread acknowledgment of the loss of multiple Indian aircraft, including Rafales, by sources ranging from world leaders, senior Indian politicians to foreign intelligence assessments.‚Äù</p>
<p>Asif said that ‚Äúnot a single Pakistani aircraft was hit or destroyed‚Äù by India, adding that Pakistan took out six Indian jets, S400 air defence batteries and unmanned aircraft of India while ‚Äúswiftly putting several Indian airbases out of action‚Äù.</p>

<p>He added that the losses on the Line of Control for Indian armed forces were ‚Äúdisproportionately heavier‚Äù as well.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf the truth is in question, let both sides open their aircraft inventories to independent verification ‚Äî though we suspect this would lay bare the reality India seeks to obscure. Wars are not won by falsehoods but by moral authority, national resolve and professional competence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSuch comical narratives, crafted for domestic political expediency, increase the grave risks of strategic miscalculation in a nuclearised environment,‚Äù he warned.</p>
<p>The defence minister iterated that every violation of Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity would invite ‚Äúswift, surefire and proportionate response, and responsibility for any ensuing escalation will rest entirely with strategically blind leaders who gamble with South Asia‚Äôs peace for fleeting political gains‚Äù.</p>
<p>Former envoy Dr Maleeha Lodhi said the Indian air chief‚Äôs claim was ‚Äúlaughable‚Äù, noting that it took him ‚Äúseveral months to count the planes to make this ridiculous assertion!‚Äù</p>

<p>Pakistan, with the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) primarily operating Chinese-made jets and US F-16s, has previously denied that India downed any aircraft during the May 7-10 fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours.</p>
<p>New Delhi had previously claimed it had downed ‚Äú<a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/india-shot-down-high-tech-jets-of-pakistan-confirms-air-marshal-bharti-938212" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a few planes</a>‚Äù. United States President <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925193">Donald Trump</a> has echoed the figure of ‚Äúfive jets‚Äù shot down during the military confrontation, albeit without specifying which side‚Äôs craft he was referring to.</p>

<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs government has faced <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927416">scathing criticism</a> from opposition parties for its lack of ‚Äúpolitical will to fight‚Äù during the May clashes and ‚Äúfailures‚Äù to prevent the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>The May conflict was sparked by New Delhi‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">allegations</a> against Islamabad, which were without evidence and strongly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">refuted</a> by Pakistan, about a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam. After the May 7 combat and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>France‚Äôs air chief, General Jerome Bellanger, has previously said that he has seen evidence of the loss of three Indian fighters, including a Rafale. The Indian Air Force has not commented on those claims.</p>
<p>Days after the air combat, <em>The Washington Post</em>, based on visual evidence analysed by experts, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910110">reported</a> that at least two French-made Indian fighter aircraft were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force.</p>
<p>According to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://thewire.in/security/iaf-lost-fighter-jets-to-pak-because-of-political-leaderships-constraints-indian-defence-attache" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Wire</a></em>, India‚Äôs defence attache to Indonesia, Indian Navy Captain Shiv Kumar, while speaking at a seminar in June, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921034/indian-defence-attache-claims-paf-downed-indian-fighter-jets-because-of-political-leaderships-constraints">acknowledged</a> that the PAF downed the Indian fighters.</p>
<p>During his presentation at the event, Kumar had acknowledged the loss of Indian planes. According to Kumar, Indian fighter jets were ‚Äúoperating under strict political orders from the Modi government not to target Pakistani military installations or air defence systems‚Äù, <em>The Wire</em> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis self-imposed limitation by the government was intended to prevent escalation of conflict in a nuclear environment,‚Äù the outlet added, quoting the Indian officer.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs intelligence failure was central to the hour-long air battle between Pakistan and India, which led to the downing of Rafale aircraft by the Pakistan Air Force‚Äôs J-10 fighters using PL-15s missiles, according to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928400">report</a>.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> interviews with two Indian officials and three of their Pakistani counterparts found that the performance of the Rafale wasn‚Äôt the key problem: central to its downing was an Indian intelligence failure concerning the range of the China-made PL-15 missile fired by the J-10 fighter. China and Pakistan are the only countries to operate both J-10s, known as Vigorous Dragons, and PL-15s.</p>
<p>The faulty intelligence gave the Rafale pilots a false sense of confidence that they were out of Pakistani firing distance, which they believed was only around 150km, the Indian officials said, referring to the widely cited range of PL-15‚Äôs export variant.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe ambushed them,‚Äù the PAF official said, adding that Islamabad conducted an electronic warfare assault on Delhi‚Äôs systems in an attempt to confuse Indian pilots. Indian officials dispute the effectiveness of those efforts.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Indians were not expecting to be shot at,‚Äù said Justin Bronk, air warfare expert at London‚Äôs Royal United Services Institute think-tank. ‚ÄúAnd the PL-15 is clearly very capable at long range.‚Äù The PL-15 that hit the Rafale was fired from around 200km away, according to Pakistani officials, and even farther according to Indian officials. That would make it among the longest-range air-to-air strikes recorded.</p></p>

            <p><p>Security forces have killed 14 more terrorists attempting to infiltrate across the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Balochistan‚Äôs Zhob district, the military‚Äôs media wing said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The development adds to 33 terrorists, belonging to the ‚ÄúIndian proxy <em>Fitna al Khawarij</em>‚Äù, who were eliminated on the night of August 7 and 8.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn [the] night 8/9 August 2025, a deliberate sanitisation operation was conducted in surrounding areas of Sambaza along Pakistan-Afghanistan border,‚Äù the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7384" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>

<p>This followed the ‚Äúsuccessful engagements by the security forces in general area Sambaza, Zhob District on 7-8 August 2025, during which 33 <em>khwarij</em> were sent to hell‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe security forces remain committed to secure the nation‚Äôs frontiers and thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Pakistan,‚Äù the statement asserted.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to the security forces and praised their professionalism.</p>
