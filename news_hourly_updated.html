                <h2>Govt takes commanding lead after being handed reserved seats</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>• PML-N-led alliance gains two-thirds majority in NA after ECP notifies 74 lawmakers<br />
• Ruling coalition’s strength in NA jumps to 235, opposition shrinks to 98<br />
• Four independents also added to govt tally</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: The ruling coalition formally gained a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly on Wednesday after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) distributed the disputed reserved seats among the PML-N, PPP and JUI-F, in light of last week’s Supreme Court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920721/ptis-hopes-dashed-as-rivals-set-to-receive-reserved-seats">verdict.</a></p>
<p>The ECP issued victory notifications for 74 of 77 lawmakers, including 19 members of the National Assembly, 27 of the Punjab Assembly, 25 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly and three of the Sindh Assembly.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>These reserved seats for women and non-Muslims were originally designated for the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — the electoral front of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).</p>
<p>The ECP’s decision follows a landmark 7-3 majority decision by a 10-member constitutional bench of the Supreme Court, which last week overturned a previous 8-5 verdict delivered by a 13-member bench on July 12, 2024. The earlier judgement had ruled in favour of PTI’s eligibility for reserved seats.</p>
<p>The PML-N secured the most, bagging 43 out of the 74 seats across the national and provincial legislatures.</p>
<p>The PPP has benefited by the addition of 14 seats, while the JUI-F saw its tally rise by 13. One seat each has gone to the PML-Q, MQM-Pakistan, Awami National Party, PTI-Parliamentarians and the Iste­h­kam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP).</p>
<p>Among the 19 restored National Assembly seats, 13 were awarded to PML-N, four to PPP, and two to JUI-F.</p>
<p>Three National Assembly notifications were withheld — JUI-F’s Sadaf Khan, due to a Supreme Court order dated April 22, 2024; and PML-N’s Sobia Shahid and Shehla Bano, who have already taken oath as members of the KP Assembly.</p>
<p>Although the Supreme Court bench did not clarify how the reserved seats would be redistributed, the ECP had already allocated them among various parties following the Peshawar High Court’s decision.</p>
<p>However, a week after the apex court suspended the PHC verdict last year, the ECP had halted notifications for 77 lawmakers elected on these reserved seats across the National and provincial assemblies.</p>
<p><strong>Updated party position</strong></p>
<p>The National Assembly has now updated the party position. According to an official document issued by the NA Secretariat, the PML-N now leads with 123 members, the PPP has increased its strength to 74, the MQM-P holds 22 seats, PML-Q five, and IPP four. The Balochistan Awami Party, National Party, and PML-Z each retain one seat.</p>
<p>The total now stands at 231, but the document cites the ruling coalition’s strength as 235, also counting four independent lawmakers.</p>
<p>Sources told <em>Dawn</em> these include Chaudhry Usman Ali (NA-142 Sahiwal), Mubarak Zeb (NA-8 Bajaur), Aurangzeb Kitchi (NA-159 Vehari) and Zahoor Hussain Qureshi (NA-146 Khanewal) — all of whom were PTI-backed independents who have since switched allegiances.</p>
<p>According to the document, the opposition’s strength in the 333-member house has shrunk to 98, comprising 80 SIC members, 10 from JUI-F, five PTI-backed independents, and one each from Balochistan National Party, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen and the Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party.</p>
<p>In the Punjab Assembly, PML-N’s tally has risen to 229 from 206 with the addition of 23 seats (21 for women and two for non-Muslims). PPP now holds 16 seats compared to 14 previously, as it gained one seat each reserved for women and minorities. PML-Q and IPP have 11 and seven seats, respectively, after gaining one reserved seat each for women.</p>
<p>In the Sindh Assembly, PPP’s numbers rose to 120, with one additional seat each for women and non-Muslims. Its rival MQM-P now holds 38 seats after securing one more reserved seat for women.</p>
<p>In KP, JUI-F saw the biggest gain, adding 10 seats (eight for women, two for non-Muslims) to reach a total of 29.</p>
<p>PML-N added seven (six for women, one for minorities), reaching 26. PPP’s representation doubled to 12 with the addition of five reserved seats for women and one for non-Muslims. PTI-Parliamentarians and ANP each added one seat, bringing their totals to five each.</p>

                <h2>Premier gets differing views on what to do with KP govt</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>• Meets Governor Kundi, ANP chief to discuss possibility of unseating PTI-led provincial govt<br />
• Tasks Kundi with engaging opposition MPAs to explore options for forming a new govt<br />
• Aimal Wali warns against dissolving KP govt, advises PM to ‘let it collapse on its own’</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Amid reports of possible efforts afoot to bring a ‘regime change’ in Khyber Pakht­un­khwa (KP), Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday met two key leaders from the province, ostensibly to get a handle on the political situation.</p>
<p>The PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre believes that the PTI government in KP has failed to deliver for over a decade, and recent events had further cemented their conviction that the provincial government is failing to safeguard the lives of the people.</p>
<p>KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi and Awami National Party (ANP) President Aimal Wali Khan called on the PM, where they discussed the prevailing political scenario.</p>
<p>Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Ameer Maqam,  Minister for Public Affairs Unit Rana Mubashar Iqbal, Prime Minister’s  Adviser Rana Sanaullah, Minister of State for Power Abdul Rehman Kanju  and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Talha Barki were also  present on the occasion.</p>
<p>A source close to Governor Kundi told <em>Dawn</em> that the issue of possible change of KP government was thoroughly discussed.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Yes, we discussed the matter,” the source quoted Mr Kundi as saying. A press release issued by the governor’s spokesperson said the PM  tasked Mr Kundi to start a campaign for forming a new government in KP and hold consultation with opposition members of the provincial assembly.</p>
<p>Mr Kundi and federal minister Ameer Muqam have also been tasked to meet JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman for further consultation.</p>
<p>But others offered different counsel. When contacted, ANP chief Aimal Wali Khan told <em>Dawn</em> that the issue was discussed during his meeting with the PM. However, he said he had advised the premier against dissolving the KP government through  ‘external means’.</p>
<p>“I told the PM that let the KP government die its own death. If you (PM) remove the provincial government, you will give an easy escape to the PTI-led regime, which has completely failed to deliver,” Mr Aimal said.</p>
<p>He said KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has no other way but to leave the government and if the Centre made any attempt to topple the PTI-led regime in KP, it would be a welcome move for the CM. “I told PM that Ali Amin Gandapur has taken maximum benefits after becoming CM and it will be a blessing for him if he is removed and sent home,” he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He further said the prime minister was ultimately convinced that forcefully removing the provincial government would be a mistake. “We are already suffering due to the trend of toppling governments and now how can we do it by ourselves,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Saudi peace efforts</strong></p>
<p>PM Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday appreciated the efforts by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919798/ceasefire-brokered-with-iran-after-washington-request-for-liaison-qatars-pm-says">peace</a> in the Middle East as well as its significant role in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911867">ceasefire</a> understanding between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>The prime minister said this in a meeting with the ambassador of Saudi Arabia in Islamabad Nawaf bin Said Al-Malki, while fondly recalling his warm and cordial telephone conversation with the Saudi Crown Prince on June 24.</p>
<p>The PM told the ambassador that as Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921308/pakistan-assumes-un-security-council-presidency">assumed</a> the rotating Presidency of the UN Security Council for the month of July, and it would count on Saudi Arabia’s support to ensure that its tenure was conducted smoothly and successfully.</p>
<p><strong>PM to visit Baku</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Foreign Office <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921657">announced</a> the PM would attend the 17th summit of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) in Baku, Azerbaijan, starting on July 3.</p>
<p>In a statement, it said the PM will “share Pakistan’s perspective on key regional and global challenges, reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to the ECO Vision 2025, and advocate for enhanced intra-regional trade, transport connectivity, energy cooperation, and sustainable development”.</p>
<p>He will also hold bilateral meetings with other ECO leaders on the sidelines of the summit to discuss matters of mutual interest, the statement added.</p>
