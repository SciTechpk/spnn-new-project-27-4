                <h2>Trump, COAS Munir talk counterterrorism and trade in ‚Äòcordial‚Äô meeting: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir discussed joint counterterrorism efforts and expanding bilateral trade during their ‚Äúcordial‚Äù meeting in Washington, the military‚Äôs media wing said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Gen Munir met with Trump at the White House yesterday, becoming the first serving chief of army staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. The occasion also marked the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">first time</a> a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law.</p>
<p>The high-level engagement was scheduled at the Cabinet Room over luncheon followed by a visit to the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Senator Marco Rubio and Special Representative for Middle Eastern Affairs Steve Witkoff were present during the meeting from the US side, while National Security Advisor <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907660/in-a-first-isi-chief-made-national-security-adviser">Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik</a> ‚Äî also the intelligence chief ‚Äî accompanied the COAS.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlthough initially scheduled for one hour, the meeting extended for over two hours, underscoring the depth and cordiality of the dialogue,‚Äù the ISPR said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7323" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Trump ‚Äúlauded Pakistan‚Äôs ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counterterrorism cooperation between the two states‚Äù, the statement said.</p>
<p>It noted that both sides reaffirmed their commitment to continued collaboration in the field of counterterrorism.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúDiscussions also encompassed avenues for expanding bilateral cooperation in multiple domains including trade, economic development, mines and minerals, artificial intelligence, energy, cryptocurrency, and emerging technologies,‚Äù the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPresident Trump expressed keen interest in forging a mutually beneficial trade partnership with Pakistan based on long-term strategic convergence and shared interests,‚Äù it highlighted.</p>
<p>The US president also commended Field Marshal Munir‚Äôs ‚Äúleadership and decisiveness during a period of complex regional dynamics‚Äù.</p>
<p>The army chief extended an invitation to Trump, on behalf of the government, to undertake an official visit to Pakistan at a mutually convenient date, the ISPR said, calling it a ‚Äúgesture reflecting the warmth of bilateral ties‚Äù.</p>
<p>On his part, COAS Munir conveyed the deep appreciation of the government and people of Pakistan for Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúconstructive and result-oriented role in facilitating a ceasefire between Pakistan and India in the recent regional crisis‚Äù.</p>
<p>He ‚Äúacknowledged President Trump‚Äôs statesmanship and his ability to comprehend and address the multifaceted challenges faced by the global community‚Äù, the ISPR press release said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA detailed exchange of views also took place on the prevailing tensions between Iran and Israel, with both leaders emphasising the importance of resolution of the conflict,‚Äù it added, referring to the ongoing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918048/iran-israel-trade-fresh-air-attacks-as-trump-weighs-us-involvement">missile exchange</a> between the two regional arch foes that marks a week today.</p>
<p>The military notes that the engagement ‚Äúmarks a significant moment in the ongoing efforts to reinforce the longstanding partnership between Pakistan and the United States, built upon shared objectives of peace, stability, and prosperity‚Äù.</p>

<p>When questioned about the meeting in an interaction with the media later, Trump said, ‚ÄúI was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917868/trump-says-honoured-to-meet-field-marshal-munir-iran-discussed-in-talks">honoured</a> to meet him (Field Marshal Munir) today.‚Äù</p>
<p>Asked whether the talks included the current Iran-Israel conflict, Trump said: ‚ÄúThey (Pakistan) know Iran very well, better than most, and they‚Äôre not happy about anything. It‚Äôs not that they‚Äôre bad with Israel. They know them both, actually, but they know Iran better.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe (Field Marshal Munir) agreed with me. The reason I had him here was that I wanted to thank him for not going into the war [with India]. And I want to thank PM Modi as well, who just left a few days ago. We‚Äôre working on a trade deal with India and Pakistan. These two very smart people decided not to keep going with a war that could have been a nuclear war. Pakistan and India are two big nuclear powers.‚Äù</p>

<p>Questioned by reporters about the meeting prior to it, Trump remarked, ‚ÄúThis man (Gen Munir) was extremely influential in stopping it (India-Pakistan fighting) from the Pakistan side.‚Äù</p>
<p>White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Trump was hosting Field Marshal Munir after he called for the president to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625/trump-says-us-stopped-pak-india-nuclear-war">preventing a nuclear war</a> between India and Pakistan, <em>Reuters</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/india-will-not-accept-third-party-mediation-relations-with-pakistan-modi-tells-2025-06-18/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>But insiders <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044#:~:text=But%20insiders%20suggested%20that%20the%20meeting%20was%20not%20arranged%20through%20routine%20diplomatic%20channels">suggested</a> that the meeting was not arranged through routine diplomatic channels, but rather was the outcome of ‚Äúunorthodox efforts‚Äù by a group of advisers, businessmen, and other influential figures.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources in Washington said this initiative had been cooking for months and kept under wraps until the White House released Trump‚Äôs official schedule on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sources said that deepened counter-terrorism cooperation, engagement with crypto-linked influence networks, and targeted lobbying via Republican-aligned firms in Washington helped Pakistan secure the meeting.</p>
<p>Previous military rulers ‚Äî such as Field Marshal Ayub Khan, Gen Ziaul Haq, and Gen Pervez Musharraf ‚Äî met US presidents only after they had assumed the role of head of state.</p>

                <h2>Pakistanis among 60 migrants feared dead after two shipwrecks: IOM</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>TRIPOLI/BERLIN: At least 60 migrants are feared dead after a pair of shipwrecks off the coast of Libya over the past week, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).</p>
<p>The first ship went down on June 12 near a Libyan port in Tripoli, with 21 people, including women and children, reported missing and only five survivors found, the IOM said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Those lost at sea included Eritrean, Pakistani, Egyptian and Sudanese nationals. The second wreck took place about 35 kilometres off the port city of Tobruk, with the sole survivor reporting 39 people lost at sea, according to the UN body.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúWith dozens feared dead and entire families left in anguish, IOM is once again urging the international community to scale up search and rescue operations and guarantee safe, predictable disembarkation for survivors,‚Äù said Othman Belbeisi, the IOM‚Äôs regional director for the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>According to the statement, at least 743 people have died so far this year trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. The deadly route, it said, is  ‚Äúmarked by increasingly dangerous smuggling practices, limited rescue capacity and growing restrictions on humanitarian operations‚Äù.</p>
<p>As of June 15, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, migrant landings on the Italian coast were up 15 per cent year on year, with most originating in Libya.</p>
<p><strong>Mediterranean rescue</strong></p>
<p>Maritime rescue organisations said on Wednesday they had pulled more than 175,000  people from the Mediterranean over the past 10 years, as waves of  migrants sought to use the dangerous sea route to reach Europe. The group of 21 NGOS active in the region estimated that at least 28,932  people had died while trying to cross the sea since 2015.</p>
<p>The majority had died in the central Mediterranean ‚Äî waters between Libya, Tunisia, Italy and Malta ‚Äî Mirka Schaefer of German NGO SOS  Humanity told a Berlin press conference. In that area, the equivalent of five adults and one child lost their lives every day over the past decade, she said. The number of unrecorded cases was likely to be ‚Äúsignificantly higher‚Äù, she added.</p>
<p>Of the 21 organisations currently engaged in maritime rescue in the region, 10 of them are based in Germany. Between them, the groups operate 15 boats, four sail ships and four planes. The organisations have frequently clashed with authorities over their rescue operations, which were launched as Europe‚Äôs migration crisis broke out in 2015, when hundreds of thousands headed to the continent, mostly from the Middle  East.</p>
<p>In Italy, the current government has vowed to end crossings and attacked NGOs for creating a  ‚Äúpull factor‚Äù that encourages departures, something migration observers say is unproven. Giorgia  Meloni‚Äôs hard-right government has passed laws requiring rescue ships to return to a designated port, a measure NGOs say is contrary to maritime law.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe pressure on us is growing,‚Äù Schaefer said, criticising a lack of support from the German government.</p>
