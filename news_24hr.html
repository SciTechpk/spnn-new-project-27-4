            <p><p><strong>• Gandapur leads KP lawmakers to Punjab’s capital<br />
• Gohar says leadership will also take up suspension of 26 MPAs</strong></p>
<p>LAHORE: The PTI top leadership arrived in Lahore on Saturday to devise a strategy for its nationwide protest, which will reach its crescendo on Aug 5 to seek the release of party founder Imran Khan, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur describing the Lahore visit as the formal launch of the movement.</p>
<p>Before their departure, the party leaders held a meeting in Islamabad to discuss several issues, including the potential disqualification of the party’s Punjab Assembly lawmakers who had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920792">suspended</a> by the speaker.</p>
<p>In the evening, a caravan of KP lawmakers led by CM Gandapur, as well as Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar reached Lahore via G.T. Road. During a layover in Jhelum, the KP CM said that the protest had been launched, and the parliamentary meeting in Lahore would mull the final protest strategy to step up the campaign ahead of the two-year anniversary of Imran Khan’s imprisonment on Aug 5.</p>

<p>PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the party’s parliamentarians were going to Lahore for a meeting and added they would discuss the issue of 26 MPAs, suspended by the Punjab Assembly speaker. “The Punjab government has been unleashing fascism for the past two years, and now it is time that common sense should prevail,” he stressed.</p>
<p>Though there were reports that the Punjab police could block PTI parliamentarians’ entry into Lahore, the leaders had said they would stage a sit-in at the blocked point. However, the parliamentarians, led by CM Gandapur, made a smooth entry and camped at a farmhouse in Raiwind, Lahore.</p>
<p>The police, however, did raid party leaders and workers’ homes throughout the day and even went to the Shahdra Morr – Lahore’s entry point on G.T. Road – and took into custody five leaders, including Yasir Gillani from among those gathered to welcome the PTI caravan.</p>
<p>At a late-night party meeting in Raiwand, CM Gandapur told parliamentarians that they had reached the ‘political hub of the country’ to launch their protest campaign. “Any campaign launched from Lahore earns success and this too will be successful across the country,” he asserted.</p>
<p>Asserting that party leader Imran Khan is in jail for no valid reason, CM Gandapur advised party leaders to move forward through consultations and plans in respective jurisdictions to step up the protest campaign. “All the provinces should prepare their protest plans and implement them in line with their local issues and take the protest campaign to its peak by Aug 5,” he asserted.</p>
<p>He said the establishment had been ruling the country for decades and imposed multiple martial laws as part of different experiments, destroying the country. “The establishment this time has imposed a new kind of martial law, which is not official, but wielding every kind of power and pressure,” he observed and added that it destroyed the country but the perpetrators were not even showing any remorse.</p>
<p>At the meeting, Mr Bhachar said Punjab could not warmly welcome CM Gandapur because a “fascist government” was ruling Punjab that even lacked parliamentary as well as social norms. Mr Bhachar said the party’s 11 MPAs were suspended after Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz came to the assembly and her second visit led to the suspension of 26 members. “This clearly shows the level of fear the Punjab government is facing from PTI’s 107 tigers in the Punjab Assembly,” he asserted.</p>
<p>“Though the PTI leaders and workers are facing thousands of FIRs, the party is all set to launch a massive protest campaign aimed at the release of Imran Khan, his wife and all political leaders,” he added.</p>
<p>While the PTI parliamentarians have camped in Lahore, the party’s Punjab chapter, led by Aliya Hamza Malik, had already mobilised party workers across the province and assigned duties to step up the protest campaign and take to its pinnacle on August 5.</p>
<p>Before leaving for Lahore, the party’s interim chairman Barrister Gohar Khan, while talking to media persons, said that the party had already sent a letter to the provincial government stating that it would hold a meeting in Lahore. However, he made it clear that the party was not planning to hold any rally or public meeting in the provincial capital.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923916/farm-worker-dies-after-us-immigration-raid-on-cannabis-farm-in-california' target='_blank'><strong>Farm worker dies after US immigration raid on cannabis farm in California</strong></a>
            <p><p>A farm worker has died after being <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923700/worker-in-critical-condition-after-us-immigration-raid-on-california-farm">injured</a> during a raid by US immigration agents on a legal cannabis farm in California, his family said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Raids on agricultural sites on Thursday resulted in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886071">arrests</a> of 200 undocumented migrants, as part of US President Donald Trump’s wide-ranging anti-immigration <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918869">crackdown</a>, and clashes between law enforcement officials and protesters.</p>
<p>The farm worker’s family had started a page on the fundraising platform GoFundMe to help support his relatives in Mexico.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the page posted an update to say he had “passed away.”</p>
<p>Trump campaigned for the presidency on a harsh anti-immigration platform, likening undocumented migrants to “animals” and “monsters,” and since taking office he has delivered on promises to conduct a massive deportation drive.</p>
<p>On Friday, he called demonstrators involved in attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents “slimeballs” and said they should be arrested.</p>
<p>The chaotic raid on the cannabis plantation in Ventura County, about 90 kilometres from Los Angeles, saw the worker who later died being chased by ICE agents, his family said.</p>
<p>“My uncle Jaime was just a hard-working, innocent farmer,” said a post on the GoFundMe page. “He was chased by ICE agents, and we were told he fell 30ft (9 meters).”</p>
<p>The page described his injuries as “catastrophic.”</p>
<p>Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman, said he was never in custody.</p>
<p>“Although he was not being pursued by law enforcement, this individual climbed up to the roof of a green house and fell 30 feet,” McLaughlin said.</p>
<p>“(Customs and Border Patrol) immediately called a medevac to the scene to get him care as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>DHS said 200 undocumented migrants were arrested during raids on marijuana growing sites in Carpinteria and Camarillo on Thursday and 10 children were rescued “from potential exploitation, forced labor, and human trafficking.”</p>
<p>Glass House Brands, which owns the farms, said in a statement that it has “never knowingly violated applicable hiring practices and does not and has never employed minors.”</p>
<p>DHS said more than 500 “rioters” had attempted to disrupt the operation and four US citizens are facing charges for assaulting or resisting officers.</p>
<p>Tear gas was used against the protesters, some of whom were seen in television footage throwing projectiles at law enforcement vehicles.</p>
<p>The department said immigration agency vehicles were damaged and a $50,000 reward was being offered for the arrest of an individual who allegedly fired a gun at law enforcement officers.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#american-dream-no-longer" id="american-dream-no-longer" title="Permalink"></a>American dream ‘no longer’</h2>
<p>In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he had watched footage of “thugs” throwing rocks and bricks at ICE vehicles, causing “tremendous damage.”</p>
<p>Trump said he was authorizing law enforcement officers who are “on the receiving end of thrown rocks, bricks, or any other form of assault, to stop their car, and arrest these SLIMEBALLS, using whatever means is necessary to do so.”</p>
<p>“I am giving Total Authorization for ICE to protect itself, just like they protect the Public,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump has been involved in a showdown over immigration enforcement with Democratic-ruled California for weeks.</p>
<p>The Republican president sent thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles last month to quell protests against round-ups of undocumented migrants by federal agents.</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has said the troops were not necessary to address the mostly peaceful protests, but his legal efforts to have them removed have failed so far.</p>
<p>The cannabis farm in Camarillo was calm during a visit by an <em>AFP</em> reporter on Friday, as workers waited in line to collect their belongings and paychecks.</p>
<p>“We’ve been here since six this morning asking questions but they’re not giving us any information,” said Saul Munoz, a 43-year-old Colombian whose son was detained on Thursday.</p>
<p>“I just want to know how he’s doing,” Munoz said. “Bring him back to me and if it’s time for us to leave, we’ll leave.</p>
<p>“The truth is the American dream is no longer really the American dream.”</p></p>

            <p><p><strong>• 13 houses, waterways, crops destroyed in Ghizer, Gilgit<br />
• Orders issued for immediate restoration of irrigation channels amid drought threat</strong></p>
<p>GILGIT: Extremely high <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922954/extreme-heat-rain-trigger-flooding-in-punjab-gb">summer temperatures</a> and erratic weather patterns continue to cause destruction in Gilgit-Baltistan, as a cloudburst-induced flood damaged 13 homes, agricultural land, crops, and other properties in Gilgit and Ghizer on Saturday.</p>
<p>The flood also blocked Naltar Highway, Gilgit-Ghizar road and other link roads.</p>
<p>Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) Deputy Director Raja Zahooruddin Babar described the cloudburst as “unprecedented,” as such an event had never been recorded in these areas before.</p>
<p>He said cloudbursts have happened in GB before; however, the scale of the disaster this time was unprecedented.</p>
<p>The cloudburst resulted in a heavy downpour in several areas of Gilgit and Ghizer districts, resulting in flash floods. At least 13 homes were damaged by the deluge along with farmlands, crops, water and irrigation channels and other properties in Shiroot and Shakyot areas of Gilgit.</p>
<p>A flash flood and landslides at Bargo Pari area in Gilgit damaged a car, two motorcycles and a tractor. Falling rocks blocked the Gilgit-Ghizer Road, which disrupted traffic for many hours.</p>
<p>Mr Babar of GBDMA stated that the road was later cleared and reopened for traffic. The authority is assessing damages in the area. No loss of human life or injury was recorded, he said. He added the cloudburst-induced flood also damaged farmlands and infrastructure in Biarchi and Gulapur areas of Ghizer. He said the authority was working to restore link roads in the area.</p>
<p>The Naltar expressway has been blocked at 10 locations from Nomaal to Naltar Valley.</p>
<p>GBDMA DG Zakir Hussain, along with Nagar Deputy Commissioner Asghar Khan and other officials, visited the affected sites in Nagar district, including Hamari Tokorkot and Supultar nullahs.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, floods damaged 20 homes and crops in Babusar area of Chilas.</p>
<p>On Friday, light rainfall across GB brought down the temperature.</p>
<p><strong>Recovery efforts</strong></p>
<p>This year, record-high summer temperatures in Gilgit-Baltistan have accelerated the melting of glaciers, leading to heavy flooding in districts across the region.</p>
<p>Last week, the maximum temperature in Chilas was 48.5°C, the highest since July 17, 1997, when it was recorded at 47.7°C. In Bunji, the temperature jumped to 46.1°C, the highest since July 1971.</p>
<p>The GBDMA DG has issued directives to expedite the restoration of irrigation channels damaged by recent floods.</p>
<p>The extensive damage to farmlands and crops and the unavailability of water posed a risk of drought in the region.</p>
<p>Mr Hussain told Dawn that GBDMA is prepared to protect vulnerable communities and dozens of households have been relocated to safer places.</p>
<p>The affected families in Nagar, Gilgit, Ghizer and Diamer have been provided with food and other items.</p>
