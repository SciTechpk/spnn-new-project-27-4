            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924285/flooding-will-be-new-normal-for-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Flooding will be ‘new normal for Pakistan’</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Authors of Nature study say flood risks can be mitigated by restoring natural floodplains, improving drainage, moving population away from riverbanks<br />
• Extreme rainfall will become ‘more common and stronger’ by end of the century</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Calling the 2022 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1724134">floods</a> “a forewarning of elevated future flood risks”, a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/393468298_Anthropogenic_and_climatic_drivers_of_the_2022_mega-flood_in_Pakistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in a leading scientific journal warns that Pakistan is likely to experience more frequent and severe floods due to extreme rainfall events and human-induced development encro­aching on floodplains.</p>
<p>Published in <em>Nature</em>, the article comprehensively evaluates the complex interplay of pluvial (direct rainfall) and fluvial (riverine) conditions, upstream snow cover dynamics, and anthropogenic changes in the natural landscape that contributed to the unprecedented 2022 flooding.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>The study says the Indus Plain in Pakistan experienced 19 flood disasters between 1950 and 2012, affecting an area of 599,459km², causing 11,239 deaths, and resulting in economic damages exceeding $39 billion.</p>
<p>“A significant proportion of these flood events were predominantly attributed to monsoon rainfall, with around 10 out of 20 occurrences taking place after the 2000s,” it added.</p>
<p>According to the paper, after a multi-year drought, the pre-monsoon rainfall in 2022 was 111 per cent higher than the long-term average of 1951–2021, increasing soil moisture by 30pc in the Indus Basin floodplains.</p>
<p>“Monsoon rains were 547pc above average, with record-breaking cumulative weekly rainfall in July (200mm) on already saturated soils. Upstream drainage catchments (e.g., Chenab, Jhelum, and Ravi) received 33pc and 41pc more rain in pre-monsoon and monsoon periods, respectively,” it said, adding that August 2022’s streamflow at Sukkur Barrage, just upstream of the floodplains in Sindh, was 170pc larger than the historical average, due to the compounding effects of rain-on-snow and warmer temperatures accelerating snowmelt.</p>
<p>It said the 2022 flood was triggered by pre-monsoon rainfall followed by an intensified monsoon system, adding that during the monsoon season (July-Sep), rainfall in Sindh and Balochistan surged to “between 600 and 1800mm, far exceeding historical average”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p><strong>Anthropogenic changes</strong></p>
<p>According to the study, riverine flooding was amplified by anthropogenic changes, extreme streamflow, and antecedent soil moisture conditions.</p>
<p>“The river water level during the 2022 flood surpassed the levels recorded during the historical catastrophic floods of 2010 and 2015 by 2.4m and 2.79m in Aug. For example, Jun 2022 flows at Sukkur Barrage were 32pc lower than the long-term average (1994–2021), while subsequent months saw increases of 26pc, 105pc, and 170pc, respectively.”</p>
<p>The study revealed human activities were land use adjacent to riverine ecosystems, characterised by intensive agricultural practices and high population density along riverbanks.</p>
<p>For instance, Larkana has consistently expanded toward the riverbanks, with cropland extended from about 37,000km² to 47,500km² between 2001 and 2022.</p>
<p>Another factor that contributed to these floods was the accelerated upstream snowmelt and rain-on-snow events.</p>
<p><strong>‘Adding fuel to fire’</strong></p>
<p>According to the authors of the study, Dr Ali Mirchi and Dr Arfan Arshad, flooding risks in Pakistan could “increase dramatically” under a high-emission scenario, with intense rainfall events, especially 5-day extreme rainfall events in southern Pakistan projected to become “more common and stronger by the end of the century up to 58pc”.</p>
<p>“For example, the frequency of rainfall totals of more than 400mm over five days in this region would increase. At the same time, single-day rainfall extremes (RX1day) could rise by 44pc, pushing already vulnerable regions beyond their coping capacity,” they told <em>Dawn</em> via email.</p>
<p>They said Pakistan could focus on adaptation to mitigate these risks, such as restoring natural floodplains, improving drainage, and shifting development away from riverbanks.</p>
<p>“Pakistan cannot solve global warming alone, but local emission reductions combined with smarter land planning can reduce damage and save lives,” they said.</p>
<p>“To reduce the rainfall-induced direct flooding from urban runoff, we have to fix and upgrade drainage systems in both cities and rural areas to reduce flooding. These are practical, actions that can be done quickly and can go a long way in preventing the kind of widespread damage we saw during the 2022 floods,” the authors said, while stressing the need to improve early warning systems.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924258/fuel-prices-set-for-fresh-hike-amid-global-trends' target='_blank'><strong>Fuel prices set for fresh hike amid global trends</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Prices of petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) are expected to increase by Rs5.25 and Rs6.50 per litre, respectively, for the upcoming fortnight starting July 16, owing to a rise in global oil prices and import premiums.</p>
<p>According to informed sources, the ex-depot price of petrol is projected to rise by about 2pc to Rs272.04 per litre, while HSD is likely to see a 2.5pc increase to approximately Rs279.48 per litre. The final prices will be announced after government approval.</p>
<p>Currently, petrol is priced at Rs266.79 per litre following a Rs8.36 per litre <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917324">hike</a> on June 30. Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws, and private vehicles, petrol has a direct impact on the budgets of middle- and lower-income households.</p>
<p>Diesel, which fuels heavy transport, agricultural machinery, and trains, stands at Rs272.98 per litre after a Rs10.39 hike earlier this month. Its price is considered highly inflationary, influencing the cost of food and other essential goods. Transporters have already begun adjusting fares in anticipation of the expected increase.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Petrol and diesel rates may rise by Rs5.25 and Rs6.50 per litre</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast, the prices of kerosene and light diesel oil are projected to decline by Rs3.80 and Rs2.25 per litre, respectively.</p>
<p>Despite zero general sales tax (GST) on petroleum products, the government is currently collecting close to Rs98 per litre in total levies on both petrol and diesel. This includes a petroleum development levy (PDL) of Rs78.02 on petrol and Rs77.01 on diesel and HOBC, along with a Rs2.25 per litre climate support levy (CSL). Additionally, a customs duty of Rs20-21 per litre is levied on both fuels, whether imported or locally refined.</p>
<p>Oil marketing companies and dealers are earning around Rs17 per litre as combined distribution and retail margins.</p>
<p>Petrol and diesel remain the primary drivers of fuel consumption, with monthly sales between 700,000 and 800,000 tonnes, compared to just 10,000 tonnes of kerosene.</p>
<p>In FY24, the government collected Rs1.161tr through the petroleum levy and aims to increase this by 27pc to Rs1.470tr in FY25. Despite zero GST, petroleum products continue to serve as a significant source of revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Oil falls 1pc</strong></p>
<p>According to a <em>Reuters</em> report, oil prices edged lower on Monday, as investors weighed new threats from US President Donald Trump for sanctions on buyers of Russian oil that may affect global supplies, while still worried about Trump’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901770">tariffs.</a></p>
<p>Brent crude futures fell 79 cents, or 1.12pc, to $69.57 a barrel by 1:04 pm EDT (1704 GMT). US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down $1.07, also 1.56pc, to $67.38.</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924158">announced</a> new weapons for Ukraine and threatened to hit buyers of Russian exports with sanctions unless Russia agrees to a peace deal in 50 days.</p>
<p>Oil prices rallied early, on expectations that Washington would impose steeper sanctions. But prices retreated as traders weighed the 50-day deadline.</p>
<p>“The market took it as a negative because there seemed to be a lot of time to negotiate,” said Phil Flynn, senior analyst with Price Futures Group.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924287/automated-tax-filing-system-rolled-out-for-salaried-class' target='_blank'><strong>Automated tax filing system rolled out for salaried class</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Urdu version to be available by July-end, Sindhi and Pashto versions will follow suit<br />
• New system will automatically pull data linked to filer’s CNIC, at-source deductions, bank details<br />
• PM seeks early release of income tax refunds for salaried individuals; wants Raast chairman, board to be appointed by September</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: In a move to simplify tax filing procedures for the salaried class, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has introduced a new interactive return form, which will incorporate an auto-fill system that seamlessly integrates data about purchases, asset details and tax deductions at source etc. — ultimately generating a single-form return upon completion.</p>
<p>The new return form is currently available in English, while the Urdu version is set to come out by the end of this month.</p>
<p>During the first rollout phase, the form will also be available in two regional languages, Sindhi and Pashto. More versions in regional languages — Punjabi and Balochi — are expected to be rolled out subsequently.</p>
<p>Under the Income Tax Ordinance, individual taxpayers are required to file their returns by September 30.</p>
<p>The new return form consists of eight digital windows, each containing one input column. The process is designed to be step-by-step, with each screen containing a single question prompt to guide users through the filing process.</p>
<p>In the first window, entering one’s employer’s name will automatically populate the fields of tax deduction at source.</p>
<p>All deductions of withholding taxes based on the Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) numbers will also appear on the form.</p>
<p>Similarly, providing bank account details will prompt the form to display closing balances.</p>
<p>Registered purchases linked to the filer’s CNIC will also appear automatically, streamlining data entry and minimising manual input.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>According to an official annou­ncement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the FBR to launch a digital invoicing in Urdu. He said tax reforms should focus on facilitating citizens.</p>
<p>He asked the FBR to expedite the release of income tax refunds for salaried individuals of those amounting to less than Rs50,000. These refunds are to be issued within one month of return submission. The total disbursement under this directive is estimated at Rs10 billion.</p>
<p>While chairing a meeting to review progress on FBR reforms on Monday, the PM instructed the FBR to establish a helpline aimed at assisting the filing process. The meeting was informed that simplified digital tax returns for salaried individuals would be available from Tuesday, with access for other taxpayers beginning by July 30.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said tax returns had been made digital, concise, and linked with a central database for public convenience. He believed the salaried class would benefit the most from the new simplified tax returns system. He noted that implementation of AI-based tax assessment system was a major success, calling for raising awareness to encourage taxpayers to use the new system.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He also emphasized a third-party validation to ensure transparency in all FBR reforms. The premier directed the officials concerned to provide special facilities to small and medium-sized businesses to join the digital invoicing system.</p>
<p>The meeting was briefed on progress regarding digital invoicing, e-Bilty, simplified tax returns, the AI-based assessment system, the central command and control centre, and the cargo-tracking system. It was shared that FBR’s Command and Control Unit would become operational by September, enabling centralized data access and facilitating efficient decision-making.</p>
<p>Regarding the digital invoicing system, it was noted that all small and large businesses would issue receipts through FBR’s online platform at the point of sale and purchase. Approximately 20,000 businesses are expected to be integrated into the system in the coming months.</p>
<p><strong>Customs automation</strong></p>
<p>The meeting was briefed on the AI-driven assessment <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922656">system</a> that would allow traders to submit advance goods declarations prior to the arrival of ships, with full exemption from upfront duties and taxes. This measure is expected to increase advance declarations from three per cent to over 95pc, allowing containers to be transported directly from ships to factories.</p>
<p>The meeting was informed that within just one month, 8,000 invoices worth Rs11.6bn were issued. The system includes a taxpayer portal and a monitoring dashboard. Integration with PRAL is free of cost, and traders’ training is being actively facilitated. Once fully implemented, traders will no longer need to file separate sales tax returns, as transactions would be automatically recorded in the system.</p>
<p><strong>Digital economy</strong></p>
<p>The PM said the digitisation of the economy was the government’s top priority as it would bring transparency to the system. He said that digitalising payment systems between the public and the government would enhance transparency and ease of use for citizens.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He directed that progress towards a digital economy be accelerated and instructed that the processes of digitisation and the shift towards a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918066">cashless economy</a> be simplified for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). He also emphasised that all state-owned enterprises should be integrated into the digital framework.</p>
<p>The PM advised the relevant officials to complete the process for the appointments of the board of governors and chairman of Raast by September. He noted that RAAST’s Board of Directors must comprise business experts.</p>
<p>The meeting was informed that the number of users of mobile apps and digital banking services was expected to increase from 95 million to 120m, with the volume of digital payments projected to rise from Rs7.5bn to Rs15bn. A nationwide public awareness campaign on Raast and digital payments would be launched next month.</p>
<p>To align Pakistan’s economy with those of developed nations, a Digital Payments Index will be introduced within one month. Additionally, the Capital Development Authority Board has approved the right of way for digital public infrastructure in Islamabad.</p>
<p>It was also noted that the remittance system was being digitised, ensuring that all funds sent from abroad would be received through the formal banking system. Coordination is ongoing with the governments of all four provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir to promote digital payments.</p>
