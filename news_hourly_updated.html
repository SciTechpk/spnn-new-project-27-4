                <h2>Cabinet approves COAS Gen Asim Munir‚Äôs promotion to field marshal</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The federal cabinet on Tuesday approved the promotion of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir to field marshal for his leadership in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and the period of conflict against India known as Marka-i-Haq.</p>
<p>He was formally promoted to the position with immediate effect in a notification from the Ministry of Defence under Rule 199-A of the Pakistan Army Regulations (Rules), 1998.</p>
<p>The rank of field marshal is the highest rank of armies built on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1355171/special-report-the-changing-of-the-guard-1958-1969">pattern</a> of the British Army. It has only been awarded to one other ‚Äî General Mohammad Ayub Khan ‚Äî  by the presidential cabinet in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1355171#:~:text=MILITARY%20RULER%20GETS%20HIMSELF%20ELEVATED">1959</a>.</p>
<p>The statement from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office (PMO) issued today also said that the government unanimously decided to continue the services of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu after his term ends.</p>
<p>Gen Munir, commissioned via the Officers Training School Mangla into the Frontier Force Regiment, was promoted to three-star rank in September 2018 and assumed charge two months later, with his four-year term ending on November 27. Munir served as Military Intelligence chief in 2017 and briefly as Inter-Services Intelligence chief in 2018, before being replaced within eight months on then-premier Imran Khan‚Äôs insistence. He later commanded the Gujranwala Corps for two years before becoming the quartermaster general at the General Headquarters.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe government of Pakistan has approved the promotion of General Syed Asim Munir (<em>Nishan-i-Imtiaz</em> Military) to the rank of field marshal for ensuring the security of the country and defeating the enemy based on the high strategy and courageous leadership during Marka-i-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos,‚Äù the PMO said after a federal cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.</p>
<p>Retelling the events of the military conflict with India, the statement further said that COAS Munir led the army ‚Äúwith exemplary courage and determination and coordinated the war strategy and efforts of the armed forces in a comprehensive manner‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>It added: ‚ÄúThanks to the unparalleled leadership of the army chief, Pakistan achieved a historic victory in Marka-i-Haq.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn recognition of his outstanding military leadership, courage, and bravery, ensuring Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity, and courageous defence against the enemy, the cabinet approved the prime minister‚Äôs proposal to promote General Syed Asim Munir to the rank of field marshal.‚Äù</p>
<p>It was also decided that officers and soldiers of the Pakistan Army, war veterans, martyrs and citizens belonging to various sectors would be awarded high government awards in recognition of their valuable services during the operation, the statement said.</p>

<p>Accepting the honour, COAS Munir said he was grateful to God for receiving the position, dedicating it to the ‚Äúentire nation, the armed forces of Pakistan, especially the civil and military martyrs and veterans‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am grateful to the president of Pakistan, the prime minister and the cabinet for their trust,‚Äù he said in a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), adding that the honour was the trust of the nation, for which ‚Äúmillions of Asims have sacrificed themselves‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGeneral Syed Asim Munir has achieved this position through hard work, talent and professional skills,‚Äù the interior minister said, according to a post on the ministry‚Äôs X account.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as tensions over last month‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> continued to build up. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties.

<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting drones</a> sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, for both sides to finally drop their guns as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> was reached.

Officials from both countries confirmed that the ceasefire does not have an expiry date, putting to rest the speculations that the truce would lapse this weekend unless renewed.</p>

                <h2>SC upholds Zahir Jaffer‚Äôs death sentence in Noor Mukadam murder case</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636267">gruesome murder</a> of Noor Mukadam nearly four years ago that had shaken the nation.</p>
<p>After the ruling by the top court, a presidential pardon under <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part3.ch1.html#:~:text=President%27s%20power%20to%20grant%20pardon%2C%20etc." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Article 45</a> of the Constitution could possibly provide Zahir pardon, or reprieve, or remit, suspend or commute his sentence.</p>
<p>Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir‚Äôs Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636764">tortured</a> before being beheaded. Zahir‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810">death sentence</a> by the trial court had already been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1741974">upheld</a> by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).</p>

<p>A three-member bench, led by Justice Hashim Kakar and including Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Ali Baqar Najafi, presided today over the third hearing of Zahir‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1747988/noor-mukadam-murder-zahir-jaffar-approaches-sc-against-ihc-verdict-upholding-death-sentence">appeal</a> against his death sentence.</p>
<p>The bench upheld Zahir‚Äôs death sentence handed by two courts previously over the murder charges under Section 302(b) (premeditated murder) of the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.fmu.gov.pk/docs/laws/Pakistan%20Penal%20Code.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pakistan Penal Code</a> (PPC).</p>
<p>However, it converted the IHC‚Äôs decision of a second death penalty over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810#:~:text=sentenced%20to%2025%20years%20of%20rigorous%20imprisonment%20along%20with%20a%20fine%20of%20Rs200%2C000%20under%20Section%20376%20(punishment%20for%20rape)%20of%20the%20PPC">rape charges</a> into a life sentence . The high court had turned Zahir‚Äôs 25 years of rigorous imprisonment under Section 376 of the PPC into a death sentence.</p>
<p>The 10-year jail term for kidnapping in order to murder under Section 364 of the PPC was reduced to one year. The trial court had also imposed a fine of Rs100,000 in February 2022.</p>
<p>The apex court maintained the earlier orders to Zahir to pay Rs0.5 million to Noor‚Äôs legal heir.</p>
<p>The appeals of two co-accused ‚Äî watchman Mohammad Iftikhar and gardener Jan Mohammad ‚Äî against their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810#:~:text=Iftikhar%20and%20Mohammad%20Jan%2C%20meanwhile%2C%20were%20each%20sentenced%20to%2010%20years%20of%20rigorous%20imprisonment%20and%20a%20fine%20of%20Rs100%2C000">10-year sentences</a> were also taken up by the SC.</p>
<p>The watchman and gardener‚Äôs sentences were reduced, with the bench deciding their detention so far was sufficient.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTherefore, by virtue of that, both will be released,‚Äù said Advocate Shah Khawar, the lawyer for Noor‚Äôs father, retired diplomat Shaukat Mukadam.</p>

<p>Zahir‚Äôs counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, concluded his arguments today, while Khawar also presented his.</p>
<p>A short order on today‚Äôs hearing is yet to be issued. It is expected to detail the court‚Äôs decision on an appeal by Shaukat against the acquittal of Zahir‚Äôs father, Zakir Jaffer.</p>
<p>During the course of the trial, judges made demeaning comments about Noor for spending time alone with Jaffer, with Justice Kakar on Tuesday adding that it was ‚Äúagainst our values‚Äù, according to <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Farzana Bari, a women‚Äôs rights activist who attended the hearing, said the comments imply ‚Äúthat the man has some legitimate right to detain her, which is a harmful and regressive notion‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSuch judicial attitudes contribute to a long and exhausting struggle for justice, often leading victims to lose hope and give up along the way,‚Äù she told the outlet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shafaq Zaidi, a childhood friend of Noor, told <em>AFP</em> outside the court: ‚ÄúThis is a victory for all the women of Pakistan. It shows that our justice system can deliver justice and should give women more confidence in the legal process</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis was our last resort, and it‚Äôs hard to put into words what this outcome means to us.‚Äù</p>
<p>Human rights defender, Tahira Abdullah, in a statement, said: ‚ÄúIt is a milestone achievement in Pakistani women‚Äôs ongoing struggle for justice ‚Äî and also against entrenched patriarchy, sexism and misogyny, openly expressed in court by the defence legal team today as well.‚Äù</p>
<p>During the previous hearing, the accused‚Äôs lawyer contended that no medical board was formed to assess his client‚Äôs mental state. Justice Kakar had observed, ‚ÄúA daughter was mercilessly murdered.‚Äù</p>
<p>In October last year, Noor‚Äôs father had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867225">urged the SC</a> to take up the murder case pending for more than one and a half years in the top court.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#the-hearing" id="the-hearing" title="Permalink"></a>The hearing</h2>
<p>At the outset of the hearing, Zahir‚Äôs counsel contended that any evidence against his client ‚Äúmust be beyond doubt‚Äù, arguing that the court could not ‚Äúgo beyond the footage presented in the court‚Äù.</p>
<p>He said the prosecution presented the footage on a USB at the IHC, but it could not be played.</p>
<p>At this point, a lawyer for the two co-accused presented his arguments briefly. He detailed their sentences, recalling that the watchman and gardener were accused of ‚Äústopping the victim from fleeing‚Äù.</p>
<p>Justice Najafi observed, ‚ÄúIf the suspects had not stopped the victim, then the situation would have been different.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The lawyer asserted that the two co-accused had ‚Äúno crime other than being present in the house‚Äù at the time of the murder.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat was the need to work more than [what] the salary [is paid for]?‚Äù Justice Kakar remarked.</p>
<p>When the hearing resumed in the afternoon after a break, the counsel of Noor‚Äôs father presented his stance.</p>
<p>In his arguments, Khawar asserted that all evidence against the accused was part of the case record. ‚ÄúNoor Mukadam was kept in abduction for 40 hours.‚Äù</p>
<p>To this, Justice Kakar inquired, ‚ÄúHow can you prove it was an abduction? It could be termed unjust confinement.‚Äù</p>
<p>Upon Justice Ibrahim asking the counsel to detail the DNA reports, Khawar said the assessments proved the charges. ‚ÄúBlood samples were taken, and the report of the dagger also came positive,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Shaukat‚Äôs lawyer then opposed Zahir‚Äôs appeal and concluded his arguments.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Here, the state lawyer came to the rostrum and said, ‚ÄúThere should be no forgiveness for this heinous crime. This case should be made exemplary.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe state views this crime very seriously. This is a very sad tragedy and the state wants such criminals to be punished as per law.‚Äù</p>
<p>Subsequently, the bench annoucned it decision, dismissing Zahir‚Äôs appeal and reducing the sentences of his two household staff to what they have served so far.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#case-history" id="case-history" title="Permalink"></a>Case history</h2>
<p>Noor was found <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636267">murdered</a> at a residence in Islamabad‚Äôs upscale Sector F-7/4 on July 20, 2021. An FIR was registered later the same day against Zahir Jaffer, who was arrested at the site of the murder.</p>
<p>In February 2022, a district and sessions judge <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810">sentenced Jaffer to death</a> for the murder and handed him 25 years of rigorous imprisonment, finding him guilty of rape. His household staff, Mohammad Iftikhar and Jan Mohammad ‚Äî co-accused in the case ‚Äî were each sentenced to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>Zahir‚Äôs parents, leading businessman Zakir Jaffer and Asmat Adamji, had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1651981">indicted</a> by an Islamabad district and sessions court in October 2021 but were later <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810">acquitted</a> by the court.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1640810/noor-mukadam-murder-therapyworks-owner-5-employees-remanded-in-day-long-physical-custody">Six officials</a> of Therapy Works, whose employees had visited the site of the murder before police, were also among those indicted by the lower court but were later freed of the charges along with the parents. According to the challan, the parents and the therapy workers tried to conceal the crime and attempted to destroy the evidence.</p>

<p>In March 2023, the IHC, dismissing Zahir‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2348054/zahir-jaffer-moves-ihc-challenging-death-sentence-in-noor-case" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appeal</a>, not only <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1741974">upheld the death sentence</a> but also converted his 25-year jail term into another death penalty. The IHC had also rejected the pleas of the main suspect‚Äôs staff challenging their conviction.</p>
<p>The next month, Zahir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1747988/noor-mukadam-murder-zahir-jaffar-approaches-sc-against-ihc-verdict-upholding-death-sentence">approached the SC</a> against the IHC verdict, insisting that his conviction resulted from ‚Äúerroneous appreciation‚Äù of the case evidence and that the high court and trial court could not identify the ‚Äúfundamental flaws‚Äù in the FIR.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#brutal-murder" id="brutal-murder" title="Permalink"></a>Brutal murder</h2>
<p>After an FIR was registered in the case and Zahir was arrested, his parents and household staff were also taken into custody by police on July 24, 2021, over allegations of ‚Äúhiding evidence and being complicit in the crime‚Äù. They were made a part of the investigation based on the statement of Noor‚Äôs father but were later acquitted.</p>
<p>In his complaint, Shaukat had stated that he had gone to Rawalpindi on July 19 to buy a goat for Eidul Azha, while his wife had gone out to pick up clothes from her tailor. When he had returned home in the evening, the couple found their daughter Noor absent from their house in Islamabad.</p>
<p>They had found her cellphone number switched off and started a search for her. Sometime later, Noor had called her parents to inform them that she was travelling to Lahore with some friends and would return in a day or two, according to the FIR.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The complainant said he had later received a call from Zahir, whose family were their acquaintances. Zahir had informed Shaukat that Noor was not with him, the FIR said.</p>
<p>At around 10pm on July 20, the victim‚Äôs father had received a call from Kohsar police station, informing him that Noor had been murdered.</p>
<p>Police had subsequently taken the complainant to Zahir‚Äôs house in Sector F-7/4 where he discovered that his ‚Äúdaughter has been brutally murdered with a sharp-edged weapon and beheaded‚Äù, according to the FIR.</p>
<p>Shaukat, who identified his daughter‚Äôs body, had sought the maximum punishment under the law against Zahir for allegedly murdering his daughter.</p>
<p>Police later said that Zahir had confessed to killing Noor, while his DNA test and fingerprints also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1640762">showed his involvement</a> in the murder.</p>
