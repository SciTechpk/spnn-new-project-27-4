            <p><p>Pakistan has expressed concerns over the “worst forms of torture” the people of Palestine and Indian-occupied Kashmir are being subjected to by foreign occupation powers, the Foreign Office said in a statement on Thursday.</p>
<p>There have been widespread reports of systematic <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1567979">torture</a> and human rights violations by Indian occupation forces in held Jammu and Kashmir since the region was unilaterally annexed in 2019. Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911465/pakistan-focuses-on-held-kashmirs-missing-persons">continues</a> to provide political, moral, and diplomatic support to Kashmiris until they realise their inherent right to self-determination as per the UNSC resolutions.</p>
<p>In Gaza, Israeli forces have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920058/gazas-death-toll-rises-to-56156-health-ministry">killed</a> 56,156 people and injured 132,239 in the enclave since launching a military onslaught in October 2023. A human rights monitor <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896201">published</a> a report detailing the “shocking” treatment of Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons.</p>
<p>“Pakistan remains gravely concerned at the widespread and systematic use of torture as an instrument of oppression in situations of foreign occupation” the FO statement said on the occasion of the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture.</p>
<p>“The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849295">people</a> of the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) continue to be subjected to the worst forms of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1502591">torture</a> and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the occupying powers to suppress their right to self-determination.”</p>
<p>Pakistan stands in solidarity with the victims of torture worldwide and reaffirms its continued commitment to eradicating torture and upholding human dignity, it added.</p>
<p>“Islam upholds the sanctity and dignity of every human being. Any act of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment is incompatible with the values of justice, mercy, and compassion that are at the core of Islamic teachings.</p>
<p>“Guided by these values and its international obligations Pakistan remains committed to eradicating torture and strengthening protections for all individuals,” the statement said.</p>
<p>It added that “legal reforms, institutional safeguards, and oversight mechanisms continue to be strengthened by Pakistan to ensure accountability and uphold the rule of law,” adding that “measures are also being taken to provide victims with medical, legal, and psycho-social support.”</p>
<p>Pakistan reiterates its call on the international community to condemn the crimes of these occupying powers and to hold them accountable, in addition to helping end the plight of the victims of their torture and oppression, the FO concluded.</p>
<p>The UN General Assembly <a class="link--external" href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/torture-victims-day" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proclaimed</a> 26 June as the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture.

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920275/us-to-offer-new-defense-of-strikes-on-iran-nuclear-sites' target='_blank'><strong>US to offer new defense of strikes on Iran nuclear sites</strong></a>
            <p><p>US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth is set to hold a news conference on Thursday to offer a fresh assessment of strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, following a stinging row over how much American bombardment set back Tehran’s nuclear programme.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">waves</a> of Israeli attacks on nuclear and military sites and retaliatory missile fire from Iran since June 13, the United States <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842#:~:text=The%20US%20strikes%20included%2014%20bunker%2Dbuster%20bombs%2C%20more%20than%20two%20dozen%20submarine%2Dlaunched%20Tomahawk%20missiles%20and%20over%20125%20military%20aircraft%2C%20the%20top%20general%20added.">bombed</a> three key Iranian atomic facilities at the weekend.</p>
<p>The extent of the damage in Iran, where Israel said it had acted to stop an imminent nuclear threat, has become the subject of profound disagreement in the United States.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920005">initial classified assessment</a>, first reported by <em><a class="link--external" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/24/politics/intel-assessment-us-strikes-iran-nuclear-sites" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CNN</a></em>, was said to have concluded that the strike did not destroy key components and that Iran’s nuclear programme was set back only months at most.</p>
<p>Another key question raised by experts is whether Iran, preparing for the strike, moved out some 400 kilogramme of enriched uranium — which could now be hidden elsewhere in the vast country.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The US administration has hit back furiously, with Trump repeatedly saying the attack “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear facilities, including the key site of Fordo buried inside a mountain.</p>
<p>“I can tell you, the United States had no indication that that enriched uranium was moved prior to the strikes, as I also saw falsely reported,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told <em>Fox News</em>.</p>
<p>“As for what’s on the ground right now, it’s buried under miles and miles of rubble because of the success of these strikes on Saturday evening,” she said.</p>

<p>Trump said that Hegseth, whom he dubbed “war” secretary, would hold a news conference at 8am (5pm PKT) on Thursday to “fight for the dignity of our great American pilots”.</p>
<p>CIA chief John Ratcliffe said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/CIADirector/status/1937964888967823652" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on Wednesday that “several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years”.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it had delivered a “significant” blow to Iran’s nuclear sites but that it was “still early” to fully assess the damage.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that “we have thwarted Iran’s nuclear project”.</p>
<p>“And if anyone in Iran tries to rebuild it, we will act with the same determination, with the same intensity, to foil any attempt,” he said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#nuclear-talks" id="nuclear-talks" title="Permalink"></a>Nuclear talks?</h2>
<p>Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei told <em>Al Jazeera</em> that “nuclear installations have been badly damaged, that’s for sure”.</p>
<p>After the war derailed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914989">nuclear talks</a> between Iran and the United States, Trump said Washington would hold discussions with Tehran next week, with his special envoy Steve Witkoff expressing hope “for a comprehensive peace agreement”.</p>
<p>Trump told reporters that Israel and Iran were “both tired, exhausted”, before going on to say that talks were planned with Iran next week.</p>
<p>“We may sign an agreement. I don’t know,” he added.</p>
<p>Iran has systematically denied seeking a nuclear weapon while defending its “legitimate rights” to the peaceful use of atomic energy.</p>
<p>It has also said it was willing to return to nuclear negotiations with Washington.</p>
<p>In both Iran and Israel, authorities have gradually lifted wartime restrictions.
Iran on Wednesday reopened the airspace over the country’s east, yet without allowing flights to and from the capital Tehran.</p>
<p>In the Israeli coastal hub of Tel Aviv, 45-year-old engineer Yossi Bin welcomed the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919798">ceasefire</a>: “Finally, we can sleep peacefully. We feel better, less worried… and I hope it stays that way.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#state-funeral" id="state-funeral" title="Permalink"></a>State funeral</h2>
<p>While Iran and Israel have been locked in a shadow war for decades, their 12-day conflict was by far the most destructive confrontation between them.</p>
<p>The Israeli strikes on Iran killed at least 627 civilians, Tehran’s health ministry said.</p>
<p>Iran’s attacks on Israel killed 28 people, according to official figures.</p>
<p>According to <em>Mehr</em> news agency, the funeral of Revolutionary Guard commander Hossein Salami, who was killed in an Israeli strike, will no longer be held in his hometown on Thursday.</p>
<p>Instead, a state funeral will be held on Saturday in Tehran for top commanders, including Salami and nuclear scientists, killed in the war.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Ministry of Interior on Thursday announced that it planned to take strict action against elements spreading religious hate on social media as part of a security plan ahead of the month of Muharram.</p>
<p>The government has ramped up security efforts in the past few weeks as the first month of the Islamic calendar inches closer. KP and the Punjab government have planned to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919627/section-144-to-be-imposed-in-all-sensitive-districts-in-kp-for-muharram">impose</a> Section 144 across the province from Muharram 1 to 10, barring public gatherings, protests, or other actions that might disrupt peace.</p>
<p>The central Ruet-e-Hilal committee is set to meet today for the sighting of the moon for Muharram.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the ministry today, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi chaired a meeting aimed at reviewing the security plan for the month.</p>
<p>“It was decided that action will be taken against elements inciting religious hatred on social media in light of Muharram,” it said.</p>
<p>“In this regard, PEMRA (Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority) has been instructed to monitor hateful content on electronic and social media.”</p>
<p>The meeting reviewed the security plan for Muharram in all provinces, including Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Islamabad, in detail, planning to take necessary administrative measures to ensure a peaceful Muharram across the country.</p>
<p>Naqvi promised to cooperate on all possible fronts to ensure peace, particularly in AJK, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad.</p>
<p>On the matter of internet and mobile phone service being suspended during processions, the meeting detailed that the decision will be taken in consultation with each province, keeping in view the security situation of each respective province.</p>
<p>“All the necessary steps and decisions will be taken with the mutual consultation,” the minister said, warning that no one would be allowed to incite religious hatred or provocation.</p>
<p>Detailing further security measures, he shared that Muharram processions will be monitored via modern technology.</p>
<p>Inspector general (IG) of police and Secretaries from all provinces, including Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Balochistan, Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, as well as the capital, gave a briefing on the security plan at the meeting.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, federal secretary interior, acting chairman CDA, commandant Frontier Constabulary, deputy commissioner Islamabad, deputy inspector general of police Islamabad, ministry of interior and senior officials of law enforcement agencies were also present at the meeting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other senior officials of law enforcement agencies attended the meeting via video link.</p>
<p>Muharram is a month of mourning, observed in particular by Shia Muslims worldwide.</p>
<p>It commemorates the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD, where, amongst many, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), Imam Husain, was martyred, and other family members were martyred or subjected to humiliation.</p>
<p>Keeping in view the need for extra security due to the spike in religious activity during the first 10 days of Muharram, authorities make arrangements accordingly.</p>
<p>Last week, the Punjab home department took additional security <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917053">measures,</a> including the deployment of armed forces where required, to ensure peace in the province during Muharram.</p></p>
