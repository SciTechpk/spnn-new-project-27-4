                <h2>Pakistan seeks global ‚Äòintervention‚Äô in issues with India as diplomatic team lands in London</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan has called for ‚Äúintervention‚Äù from global powers in resolving key issues with India amid ongoing tensions, members of a high-level delegation presenting Islamabad‚Äôs stance said on Sunday after landing in London.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Pakis¬≠tan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">launched</a> a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent conflict with India, and counter New Delhi‚Äôs growing lobbying presence there. As part of its global outreach, the team has arrived in London and will also visit Brussels.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow">delegation</a> comprises former foreign ministers Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Subzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh¬≠mina Janjua.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe resistance we faced is that the Americans think that since [US] President [Donald] Trump has mediated the ceasefire, there is no need for further intervention. This was exactly our mission: to make them understand that intervention is needed,‚Äù Dastgir told <em>Geo News</em> after arriving in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe diplomatic delegation fulfilled its objectives,‚Äù he asserted.</p>
<p>The former MNA added: ‚ÄúOur ministers also put forward this stance that if India does not come to the table for talks again, then due to [the water issue] and India‚Äôs irresponsible behaviour ‚Äî saying that it does not need evidence for a war ‚Äî a war in the subcontinent is certain.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Similarly, Subzwari told <em>Geo News</em>: ‚ÄúWe want global powers to tell India that two neighbouring nuclear states cannot move forward in such a dangerous environment. It is not just damaging for the region but for the world‚Äôs peace.‚Äù</p>
<p>Noting that the delegation began its engagements with a multilateral forum, the United Nations, the senator stressed, ‚ÄúDespite showing our military prowess, we have come with an invitation to peace.‚Äù</p>
<p>Rehman, a former ambassador to the US, called the meetings ‚Äúvery positive‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey understood our points and the risks. They all also agreed that the weaponisation of water is extremely wrong,‚Äù she said, terming India-occupied Kashmir as the ‚Äúlargest open-air prison after Gaza‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhatever the Indians do, good luck to them,‚Äù the PPP leader quipped, referring to the delegations sent by New Delhi to various countries on the matter.</p>
<p>Rehman highlighted: ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs delegation does not know what its mission is, except for maligning Pakistan. [However,] we did not go [to US] to malign India, but to tell Pakistan‚Äôs story.‚Äù</p>
<p>Senator Butt termed the response in both New York and Washington to Pakistan‚Äôs concerns on held Kashmir and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a> (IWT), which India unilaterally held <a href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home">in abeyance</a> after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909746">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir, as ‚Äúfantastic‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf the Indus Waters Treaty is overlooked today, then no treaty in the future will stand any ground,‚Äù she asserted.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Summarising the delegation‚Äôs stance, former caretaker foreign minister Jilani stated: ‚ÄúOur message was that India committed aggression and that Pakistan is a peaceful country.‚Äù</p>
<p>He reiterated Islamabad‚Äôs desire for a peaceful resolution to the long-standing issues between the two nations.</p>
<p>Pakistan has appeared to be aiming to draw the US into a more proactive diplomatic role in South Asia.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called Trump a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915520/pakistan-wants-trump-to-arrange-talks-with-india">man of peace</a>‚Äù, while Bilawal said it was ‚Äúreasonable to expect that an American role in arranging a comprehensive dialogue would also be beneficial for us‚Äù.</p>

                <h2>India‚Äôs restive Manipur orders curfew, shuts off internet after fresh violence</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>An Indian state riven by ethnic tensions imposed an internet shutdown and curfew after protesters clashed with security forces over the arrest of some members of a radical group, police said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Manipur in India‚Äôs northeast has been rocked by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1750880">periodic clashes</a> for more than two years between the predominantly Hindu Meitei majority and the mainly Christian Kuki community that have killed more than 250 people.</p>
<p>The latest violence was triggered on Saturday after reports of the arrest of five members, including a commander, of Arambai Tenggol, a radical Meitei group.</p>
<p>Incensed mobs demanding their release stormed a police post, set fire to a bus and blocked roads in parts of the state capital Imphal.</p>
<p>Manipur police announced a curfew in five districts, including Imphal West and Bishnupur, due to the ‚Äúdeveloping law and order situation‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúProhibitory orders have been issued by District Magistrates. Citizens are requested to cooperate with the orders,‚Äù the police said in a statement.</p>
<p>Arambai Tenggol, which is alleged to have orchestrated the violence against the Kuki community, has also announced a 10-day shutdown in the valley districts.</p>
<p>The state‚Äôs home ministry has ordered all internet and mobile data services in volatile districts to be shut off for five days in order to bring the latest unrest under control.</p>

<p>Internet services were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1778143/india-resumes-internet-ban-in-restive-manipur-after-protests">shut down for months</a> in Manipur during the initial outbreak of violence in 2023, which displaced around 60,000 people from their homes, according to government figures.</p>
<p>Thousands of the state‚Äôs residents are still unable to return home owing to ongoing tensions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875340">Long-standing tensions</a> between the Meitei and Kuki communities revolve around competition for land and public jobs.</p>
<p>Rights activists have accused local leaders of exacerbating ethnic divisions for political gain.</p></p>
