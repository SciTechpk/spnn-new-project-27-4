            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927725/us-makes-deal-to-tap-pakistans-oil-reserves' target='_blank'><strong>US makes deal to tap Pakistan’s oil reserves</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Details remain sketchy despite Trump announcement; no word on tariff rate as Aurangzeb meets key officials<br />
• India slapped with 25pc tariff, punished for buying Russian arms, oil through ‘secondary tariffs’<br />
• Six Indian companies face State Dept sanctions for being part of Iran oil, petrochemical trade</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that the US has concluded a deal with Pakistan that will allow the two allies to work together on developing Pakistan’s vast oil reserves.</p>
<p>The announcement, <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114943927434273211" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on his Truth Social account, did not specify whether the two countries have also reached an agreement on tariffs.</p>
<p>“We have just concluded a Deal with the Country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive Oil Reserves,” Trump wrote.</p>
<p>“We are in the process of choosing the Oil Company that will lead this Partnership. Who knows, maybe they’ll be selling Oil to India some day!”</p>
<p>Although Pakistan has long claimed to have large oil deposits along its coast, this marks the first high-level move towards tapping them.</p>
<p>The reference to India was also particularly poignant, as the US president earlier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927587/trump-says-india-to-pay-25pc-tariff-from-aug-1-with-additional-penalty-for-russian-energy-purchases">slapped</a> the country with a 25 per cent tariff on imports, mainly as a punishment for acquiring oil and military equipment from Russia.</p>
<p>“Likewise, other Countries are making offers for a Tariff reduction. All of this will help reduce our Trade Deficit in a very major way,” he wrote, adding: “A full report will be released at the appropriate time.”</p>
<p>In a separate part of his post, Trump mentioned South Korea to illustrate the ongoing tariff discussions, in a way that could also be seen as inviting further offers from countries like Pakistan.</p>
<p>“South Korea is right now at a 25% Tariff, but they have an offer to buy down those Tariffs. I will be interested in hearing what that offer is.”</p>
<p>Pakistani officials have previously offered to reduce the country’s $3 billion trade deficit with the United States by increasing imports of US goods, including oil, rather than accepting higher tariffs.</p>
<p><strong>Aurangzeb holds talks</strong></p>
<p>Finance Minister Mohammad Aurangzeb, who is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927252/aurangzeb-to-arrive-in-us-for-final-round-of-tariff-talks">currently</a> in Washington for what officials describe as final-stage <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922229/pakistan-us-reach-accord-on-trade-and-tariffs">negotiations</a> on a tariff deal, also began meetings with senior US officials on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Pakistani delegation is keeping the details of the talks under wraps, but one official said, “We hope to sign a deal before the (Aug 1) deadline expires.”</p>
<p>“We hope to conclude a mutually beneficial trade agreement… hopefully in days, not in weeks,” said Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar during a recent event at the Atlantic Council in Washington.</p>
<p>Mr Dar, who was recently in New York to address the United Nations, said a committee had been formed to finalise the terms of the proposed deal.</p>
<p>“As long as we are better than or equal to our peers, we should be fine,” Mr Dar said.</p>
<p>While the exact tariff rate being negotiated for Pakistan has not been publicly disclosed, Pakistani officials have said they’re seeking terms on a par with other recent US trade agreements — particularly those with Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, where tariffs are reportedly set between 15pc and 20pc.</p>
<p><strong>Trump ‘punishes’ India</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the 25pc tariffs, Trump also slapped an unspecified additional penalty on India for acquiring military equipment and oil from Russia, starting Aug 1.</p>
<p>However, he later said the US was currently negotiating a deal with India. “They have one of the highest tariffs in the world now, they’re willing to cut it very substantially. But we’ll see what happens,” Mr Trump told reporters.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>In a strongly worded <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114942106248731470" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on the social media platform Truth Social, Mr Trump accused India of imposing excessively high tariffs and maintaining some of the world’s most “strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary trade barriers”. He also criticised New Delhi’s continued reliance on Russian arms and energy purchases.</p>
<p>“India will therefore be paying a tariff of 25pc, plus a penalty for the above, starting on August 1,” Mr Trump wrote. “While India is our friend, we have done relatively little business with them because of their trade practices.”</p>
<p>The US president made it clear that no further extensions would be given to countries that failed to reach a deal by the end-of-week deadline.</p>
<p>The imposition of a penalty tariff on India for its purchases of Russian oil, if enacted, would be the first use of what Mr Trump has taken to calling “secondary tariffs”, a kind of penalty that would be imposed instead of the financial sanctions typically used against countries that do business with embargoed nations, according to <em>The New York Times.</em></p>
<p>In response, the Indian government said in a statement that it was studying the implications of Mr Trump’s announcements and remained dedicated to securing a fair trade deal with the US.</p>
<p>“India and the US have been engaged in negotiations on concluding a fair, balanced and mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement over the last few months. We remain committed to that objective,” it said, according to <em>Reuters.</em></p>
<p>The news pushed the Indian rupee down 0.4pc to around 87.80 against the US dollar in the non-deliverable forwards market, from its close at 87.42 during market hours. Gift Nifty futures were trading at 24,692 points, down 0.6pc.</p>
<p><strong>Sanctions on six Indian firms</strong></p>
<p>Separately, the State Department announced sanctions against six Indian firms for “engaging in Iranian petroleum, petroleum products, or petrochemical trade”.</p>
<p><strong>The sanctioned entities include:</strong></p>
<p>Kanchan Polymers, which “imported and purchased over $1.3M worth of Iranian-origin petrochemical products”.</p>
<p>Alchemical Solutions, which imported and purchased Iranian-origin petrochemical products valued at over $84m.</p>
<p>Ramniklal, a petrochemical company that imported and purchased Iranian-origin products valued at over $22m.</p>
<p>Jupiter Dye Chem, which imported and purchased Iranian-origin petrochemical products valued at over $49m.</p>
<p>Global Industrial, which imported and purchased products, including methanol, valued at over $51m.</p>
<p>Persistent Petrochem Private Limited, which imported approximately $14m worth of shipments.</p>
<p>In addition, it also placed sanctions on a number of China and UAE-based companies and several oil tankers.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927741/fury-erupts-as-rs741-per-unit-relief-reversed' target='_blank'><strong>Fury erupts as Rs7.41 per unit relief reversed</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The business community has voiced serious concerns over the abrupt withdrawal of a promised Rs7.41 per unit electricity relief and the prolonged outage of the 969-megawatt Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project (NJHP), warning of accelerating de-industrialisation.</p>
<p>These grievances surfaced during a public hearing held by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), on the Central Power Purchasing Agency’s (CPPA) request for a Rs8.7bn refund — equal to 65 paise per unit — to consumers due to lower-than-expected fuel costs in June. Nepra members Amina Ahmed and Anwar Maqsood Khan presided over the session.</p>
<p>Several industrialists, referencing a recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925965">meeting</a> with Field Marshal Asim Munir, lamented that the prime minister’s announcement in March of Rs7.41 per unit tariff relief was not time-bound, yet its impact had dwindled. The actual reduction now stands at just Rs1.15 per unit in base tariff terms. As a result, applicable power rates have surged from around Rs30 per unit to Rs34-35 from July onwards.</p>
<p>Amir Shaikh, a Lahore-based businessman, said a promised Rs1.71 per unit reduction — based on an additional Rs10 per litre petroleum levy — should have remained intact since the levy is still being collected. “Even the gas levy on captive power plants was meant to lower power tariffs, but this hasn’t been implemented,” he said.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Leaders warn of industrial shutdowns as power tariffs rise to Rs35 per unit despite earlier relief promises</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He told the hearing that during discussions with the field marshal, the business community had pointed out that power rates fell to Rs29-30 per unit following the prime minister’s announcement, but have since climbed to Rs35. This contradicts the Special Investment Facilitation Council’s (SIFC) commitment to reduce industrial power tariffs to 9 cents (around Rs25 per unit) in the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>“Instead of a reduction from Rs29 to Rs25, rates have risen back to Rs34-35, or 11-12 cents per unit,” said Mr Shaikh. He urged the government to acknowledge this reversal and adopt corrective measures.</p>
<p>He also highlighted that the inclusion of fertiliser subsidies in RLNG pricing was making electricity generation more expensive. “The industrial sector is already on the brink, and these hikes could push it into over-closure,” he warned. He further questioned whether the Power Division’s promise to abolish the 1.5pc electricity duty from July 1 had been officially implemented, though no government representative responded.</p>
<p>A representative from the FPCCI and a Karachi-based industrialist said that falling demand from the national grid — driven by the rapid adoption of solar energy — had improved the financial outlook of distribution companies. As solar generation replaces expensive fossil fuel-based power, it also helps cut transmission losses, especially in high-loss areas.</p>
<p>“The real efficiency gains in Discos are coming from solarisation,” he said, noting that this transition is reducing both fuel costs and technical losses.</p>
<p>Karachi-based businessman Arif Bilwani criticised the government’s failure to follow through on its promises regarding renegotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs). “There was a lot of hype about cheaper electricity from revised IPP contracts, but none of it has materialised,” he said, adding that it appears as though the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum and the 747MW Guddu power plants have been effectively written off.</p>
<p>Responding to the concerns, CPPA CEO Rehan Akhtar said the energy mix in June was broadly in line with expectations and that overall fuel costs were slightly lower than reference projections. He said this minor saving resulted in negative fuel cost adjustments, partly due to the retirement of older, inefficient government-owned plants.</p>
<p>Regarding Neelum-Jhelum, Mr Akhtar confirmed that the plant would remain non-operational for about two years due to technical issues identified in a recent study.</p>
<p>He said the negative fuel cost adjustment reaching consumers would amount to 15 paisa per unit, factoring in the 65 paisa negative adjustment in August, replacing June’s 50 paisa adjustment.</p>
<p>Mr Akhtar added that power consumption in June was 2pc higher than the same month last year and 7.6pc more than in May 2025. Total electricity delivered to distribution companies stood at 13,310 gigawatt hours (GWh), up from 12,367 GWh in May and 13,071 GWh in June 2024.</p>
<p>He said average fuel cost for June 2025 was Rs7.68 per unit, down from Rs9.25 in June last year, against a reference cost of Rs8.33 per unit.</p>

            <p><p>GILGIT: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on Wednesday formed a seven-member committee to make recommendations for resolving the ongoing tax dispute, as traders in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) continued their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927464/protesting-traders-block-karakoram-highway-for-second-consecutive-day">sit-in</a> for a tenth consecutive day.</p>
<p>Traders, affiliated with Pakistan-China trade through Khunjerab Pass, have been protesting at the Sost Dry Port and blocking the Karakoram Highway, the land route between Pakistan and China, demanding an end to what they call federal taxes on goods imported from China.</p>
<p>The protests, which have paralysed trade and travel through the Khunjerab Pass, began over what traders describe as discriminatory FBR policies and the non-clearance of consignments imported from China.</p>
<p>Protesters are demanding exemption for GB residents from paying sales tax, income tax, and other federal taxes on goods imported from China.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Pakistan-China trade and travel suspended; thousands of travellers stranded, including Chinese nationals</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In response, a notification issued by the FBR announced the committee’s formation to addr­ess the “tax grievances of people of Gilgit Baltistan”.</p>
<p>According to the notification, the committee will “evaluate the grievances of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) on the issue of charging of sales tax, income tax and federal excise duty on import of goods from China through Khunjerab Pass for consumption in Gilgit-Baltistan.”</p>
<p>The seven-member committee comprises the member customs (operations), member-IR (policy), director general (R&amp;A), the GB secretary of finance, the chief collector (north) and the chief IR (policy).</p>
<p>The committee’s mandate is to examine the levy of taxes on goods meant for consumption within GB’s territorial jurisdiction.</p>
<p>It is also tasked with devising a “transparent implementation mechanism” for any available exemptions and suggesting “robust checks against misuse of any exemption”.</p>
<p>Additionally, the committee will identify the HS codes and quantify the annual quantities needed for local consumption within GB, keeping in view per capita import of such goods for the rest of the country.</p>
<p>It will also consider mechanisms for clearance of baggage at Sost and enforcement measures at Khunjerab Pass to ensure consumption of exempted goods in GB only.</p>
<p>The committee will consult with local stakeholders to weigh different options, including the collection of duties and taxes on behalf of the GB government, and is expected to submit its report within seven days.</p>
<p>Due to protests, thousands of passengers scheduled to travel to China through Khunjerab Pass remain stranded as transportation via the pass has been suspended for a third day.</p>
<p>Many Chinese nationals who planned to travel to Xinjiang province through Khunjerab Pass have also staged a protest sit-in in Sost town, demanding to be allowed to travel.</p>
