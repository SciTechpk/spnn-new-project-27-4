            <p><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Monday acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi in two more cases related to the May 9 riots, while sentencing Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudry, Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mehmoodur Rashid to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, following which thousands were arrested.</p>

<p>The ATC had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929899/verdict-in-two-may-9-riots-cases-reserved">reserved its verdict</a> in the two cases on Saturday related to the May 9 riots — the Shadman police station attack and burning of police vehicles near Jinnah House — after completing proceedings at Kot Lakhpat jail. The judge concluded the hearings inside the jail in two sessions during the whole day.</p>
<p>ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced the judgments today and convicted Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema and Rashid in both cases.</p>
<p>PTI leaders Aliya Hamza and Sanam Javed were also sentenced to five years in prison in the Shadman case.</p>
<p>Advocate Rana Mudassar confirmed today’s sentencing to <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>In the Shadman police station case, the court indicted 25 accused out of 41 nominated in the challan and recorded statements of 45 prosecution witnesses. At least 15 accused have been declared proclaimed offenders in this case.</p>
<p>In the police vehicles torching case, the court indicted 17 accused, declared seven proclaimed offenders and recorded statements of 65 prosecution witnesses.</p>
<p>Last month, the Lahore ATC had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925887/lahore-atc-acquits-qureshi-sentences-yasmin-rashid-ejaz-chaudhry-and-others-to-10-years-in-may-9-riots-case">acquitted</a> Qureshi while sentencing Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema, Rashid and others to 10 years in prison over a May 9 riots case related to violence on Sherpao Bridge.</p>
<p>Sarwar Road police had registered a case against PTI leaders and workers on charges of ransacking and burning public property at Sherpao Bridge in the Cantonment area during the violent protests.</p>
<p>Chaudhry had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929752/ptis-zartaj-gul-ejaz-chaudhry-appeal-to-lhc-against-atc-convictions-in-may-9-riots-cases">filed two petitions</a> in the Lahore High Court on Saturday, pleading with the court to suspend his sentence and conviction, along with ordering his release on bail. He further requested the court in the second petition to set aside his conviction and acquit him in the case in the “interest of justice”.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930198/pakistan-gets-offers-in-100000-tonnes-white-sugar-tender-traders-say' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan gets offers in 100,000 tonnes white sugar tender, traders say</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) on Monday received offers in its international tender to buy 100,000 tonnes of white sugar, European traders said in initial assessments.</p>
<p>On July 8, the government had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923204/trading-corporation-of-pakistan-to-import-035m-tonnes-of-sugar">approved plans</a> to import 500,000 tonnes of sugar to help maintain price stability. Market analysts said that retail sugar prices in the country have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923873">risen sharply</a> since January.</p>
<p>TCP had last week <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928691">issued</a> a fresh international tender to purchase 100,000 tonnes of white refined sugar, after a previous one for 50,000 tonnes of sugar in July reportedly received <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925968">no offers</a>.</p>
<p>The lowest price offered in the tender was believed to be $539.00 a tonne, cost and freight (c&amp;f) included, according to traders. They said offers were still being considered and no purchase had been reported yet.</p>
<p>The lowest offer was said to have been submitted by trading house ED&amp;F Man for 50,000 tonnes of fine-grade sugar sourced from any origin.</p>
<p>There were reportedly three other participants in the tender.</p>
<p>Dreyfus was said to have offered $580.75 a tonne c&amp;f for 25,000 tonnes of fine-grade sugar from any origin, while Al Khaleej Sugar offered $586.00 a tonne c&amp;f for 30,000 tonnes of medium-grade sugar sourced from the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Trading house Bare offered $555.00 c&amp;f for medium-grade and $550.00 c&amp;f for fine-grade sugar, both from Brazil.</p>
<p>Reports reflect the assessments so far from traders, and further estimates of prices and volumes are still possible later.</p>
<p>No purchase was reported in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926639/tcp-doubles-tender-size-amid-sugar-price-surge">previous tender</a> for 100,000 tonnes on July 31, with the lowest price offer also $539.00 a tonne c&amp;f.</p>
<p>The new tender seeks small/fine- and medium-grade sugar from worldwide origins, excluding India and Israel.</p>
<p>The sugar shipments should be organised to achieve the arrival of all the sugar in Pakistan by October 20, traders said.</p>
<p>Shipment of breakbulk supplies is sought from September 1 to September 15 for 50,000 tonnes, while the rest can be shipped from September 10 to September 25. Sugar in ocean shipping containers can also be shipped between September 1 to 20.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, traders remain puzzled by the government’s sugar trade policy.</p>
<p>During FY25, Pakistan exported 765,734 tonnes of sugar, generating $411 million in foreign exchange, with an average per tonne price of $537. By contrast, only 33,101 tonnes were exported in FY24, earning just $21m.</p>
<p>With the government vowing strict monitoring of sugar stocks, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928823">cartelisation case</a> involving 79 sugar mills and the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) is also being heard by the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP).</p></p>

            <p><p>New Delhi police briefly detained Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and other opposition members on Monday as they protested a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923264/electoral-roll-revision-in-indias-bihar-sparks-fear-and-fury">controversial</a> revised electoral roll in Bihar and alleged “vote theft” by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p>
<p>The credibility of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1827980">elections</a> has rarely been questioned in recent decades in the world’s most populous democracy. Some analysts say the opposition accusations could damage Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he navigates one of the toughest periods of his 11 years in office.</p>
<p>The opposition members were taken into custody midway while marching from the parliament to the Election Commission of India (ECI) headquarters in New Delhi as they protested the roll revision, the <em>Press Trust of India</em> (<em>PTI</em>) <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ptinews.com/stories-detail/national/protesting-opposition-mps-stopped-from-marching-to-ec-office-against-sir/2811244/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Nearly two hours later, Congress lawmaker Kishori Lal Sharma said Gandhi and other opposition leaders had been released.</p>
<p>“The police detained us but now we have been released,” he told the media, adding that the police had not allowed them to go to the ECI as promised, and instead took them to the police station.</p>
<p>“We are now heading to the parliament,” he added.</p>

<p>As the police attempted to thwart the protest by around 300 opposition members, some MPs climbed up to the barricade — set up by the police ahead of the march — and chanted slogans against the ECI and Modi’s government. The protestors carried placards alleging “vote theft”, <em>PTI</em> said.</p>
<p>A statement posted on Gandhi’s X account shortly after he was detained said: “The truth of vote theft is now before the country.</p>
<p>“This fight is not political — it is a fight to protect democracy, the constitution, and the right to ‘one person, one vote’,” he added.</p>
<p>“The united opposition and every voter in the country demands a clean and transparent voter list,” the Congress leader added.</p>

<p>Gandhi and Congress have alleged that voters’ lists in states where the party lost are corrupted, with voters’ names deleted or included more than once to rig elections in favour of Modi’s BJP.</p>
<p>Opposition parties have also criticised the ECI’s decision to revise the voters’ list in the key northern state of Bihar just before state elections due later this year, saying it aims to disenfranchise large numbers of poor voters.</p>
<p>The BJP and the ECI have rejected the accusations.</p>
<p>In June, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923264/electoral-roll-revision-in-indias-bihar-sparks-fear-and-fury">Special Intensive Revision</a> (SIR) of the voter rolls was announced ahead of the upcoming polls in the eastern state of Bihar. The move, which required that all potential voters provide proof of citizenship by July 25, sparked nationwide fears of disenfranchisement among India’s minorities, including Muslims and Dalit communities.</p>

<p>According to <em>PTI</em>, other protesting lawmakers detained included Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi, Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav, T. R. Baalu of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Sanjay Raut of the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and Derek O’Brien of the Trinamool Congress.</p>
<p>Parliamentarians from other opposition parties, such as the Rashtriya Janata Dal, were also taken into custody, the report added.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#state-of-anarchy" id="state-of-anarchy" title="Permalink"></a>‘State of anarchy’</h2>
<p>The ECI has said that changes in voters’ lists are shared with political parties and all complaints are investigated thoroughly.</p>
<p>It has also said that voters’ lists need to be revised to remove dead voters or those who have relocated to other parts of the country, among others. Many voters in Bihar have <a class="link--external" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3wnx7689l5o" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the <em>BBC</em></a> that the draft rolls have wrong photos and include dead people.</p>
<p>“The new draft rolls have 72.4 million names — 6.5 million fewer than before,” the <em>BBC</em> report published today said.</p>
<p>Congress and its allies have fared poorly in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1890744">two</a> state <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1874358">polls</a> that they had expected to win after an impressive show in last year’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1837902">general elections</a>, which saw BJP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1837945">losing</a> its outright majority and remaining in power only with the help of regional parties.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Congress has also complained about electronic voting machines and said the counting process is not fair, charges rejected by the election panel.</p>
<p>The BJP said opposition parties were trying to create a “state of anarchy” by sowing seeds of doubt about the electoral process.</p>
<p>“They are in a state of bankruptcy because of their continuous losses,” Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan of the BJP told reporters on Monday.</p>

<p>As per the <em>PTI</em> report, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had written to the ECI earlier and asked them to hold discussions over the electoral rolls’ SIR, among other issues.</p>
<p>“Thereafter, the MPs wish to collectively meet with the commission on a host of issues, including but not limited to Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls being undertaken in Bihar and proposed to be undertaken in other states as well,” the <em>PTI</em> quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>“We look forward to meeting with the commission, which will be in keeping with the highest tradition of our parliamentary democracy,” he said, according to <em>PTI</em>.</p></p>
