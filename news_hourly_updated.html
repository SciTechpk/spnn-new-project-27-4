                <h2>Aurangzeb, traders begin  talks to ease tensions</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: In a bid to preempt countrywide unrest, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday constituted a high-level committee to hold consultations with traders on budgetary measures aimed at documenting the economy.</p>
<p>The multi-stakeholder committee will conduct a 30-day consultation process to develop a consensual and actionable proposal, which will be submitted to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the federal cabinet.</p>
<p>According to sources present at the meeting, officials from various ministries clarified that the new tax amendments are primarily intended to curb large-scale sales tax fraud. The committee will only consider trader concerns that are deemed genuine and substantiated, the officials added.</p>
<p>Traders were firmly told that the government remains committed to documenting the economy and discouraging cash-based transactions. Several trade associations have already called for strike actions in protest against the new measures.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Committee tasked with addressing concerns over tax reforms and documentation efforts within 30 days</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An official statement announced that the decision was made during a high-level meeting chaired by Finance Minister Aurangzeb, which brought together representatives from Pakistan’s business community, chambers of commerce, and trade organisations. The session primarily addressed trader concerns over Section 37A and other provisions introduced in the Finance Act 2025.</p>
<p>The committee will be led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan, and will include Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani, the Prime Minister’s Trade Coordinator Rana Ehsan Afzal Khan, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial, and nominated members from the business community.</p>
<p>Business leaders expressed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921941">concern</a>s about the impact of the new legislation on routine commercial transactions. In response, Mr Aurangzeb assured full transparency and cooperation from the government, reiterating that the reforms aim to combat widespread tax evasion, not to harass legitimate businesses.</p>
<p>The traders also shared their reservations and proposals, prompting the government to promise a considerate and inclusive approach. It was mutually agreed that efforts would be made to avoid placing undue hardship on the business community during the implementation of the reforms, the official announcement added.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920303">Finance Act 2025</a>, a new Section 37A has been inserted into the Sales Tax Act 1990, empowering the FBR to constitute a three-member committee that can authorise the Commissioner to issue an arrest warrant against individuals involved in tax fraud, provided the tax loss exceeds Rs50 million.</p>

                <h2>Karachi police, delivery apps move to curb drug trafficking by fake riders</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Law enforcement and representatives from online delivery services have agreed to intensify efforts to curb the growing use of online delivery networks for illegal drug distribution, a top Karachi police official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South, Syed Asad Raza, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that he held a meeting with the representatives of popular food delivery and ride-hailing services to address the misuse of rider services for drug delivery.</p>
<p>“Delivery companies informed the police that certain individuals had been caught using counterfeit uniforms, helmets, and branded delivery bags to pose as legitimate riders while carrying out unlawful activities, such as delivering illicit drugs,” the DIG said.</p>
<p>To counter this, he said, the stakeholders agreed to tighten security protocols, including rider screening, background verification, and stricter registration procedures.</p>
<p>“Briefings for riders will also be conducted more regularly to ensure compliance with legal and safety standards,” DIG Raza said.</p>
<p>The management of the companies assured law enforcement of support in identifying and cancelling the accounts of unverified or unregistered riders.</p>
<p>“In addition, they said patterns of repeated suspicious orders from specific locations will be monitored to detect and disrupt illegal operations,” he said, adding that the authorities have also agreed to identify individuals using fake identities or posing as company employees for illicit deliveries.</p>
<p>In March, police and heads of educational institutes <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896491">agreed</a> on a joint strategy against the growing menace of narcotics in Karachi.</p>
<p>In May, the Islamabad High Court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910603">imposed</a> a ban on all direct courier and food deliveries to students in the federal educational institutions amid concerns that drugs were being smuggled into campuses through food orders and courier packages.</p></p>
