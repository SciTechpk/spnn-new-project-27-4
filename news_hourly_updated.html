            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his satisfaction on Wednesday as data showed that workers‚Äô remittances increased by 26.6 per cent to hit a record $38.3 billion during the fiscal year 2025 as compared to the corresponding period of last year.</p>
<p>The State Bank of Pakistan said remittances reached $38.3bn during July-June 2024-25, as compared to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844949">$30.3bn</a> in remittances received during the same period for FY2023-24.</p>

<p>Data showed that Saudi Arabia ($823.2m) and the United Arab Emirates ($717.2m) were the biggest sources of remittance inflows during June 2025, followed by the United Kingdom ($537.6m) and the United States ($281.2m).</p>
<p>A statement from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office said the premier was pleased at the development, saying that the government was committed to economic prosperity after bringing economic stability, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe record surge in remittances reflects expatriate Pakistanis‚Äô valuable contributions and their confidence in the national economy,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>He expressed the opinion that the recent positive economic indicators were a ‚Äúmanifestation of the government‚Äôs policies in the right direction‚Äù.</p>
<p>Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad termed the record remittances ‚Äúmassive‚Äù in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/kschehzad/status/1942869065359364192" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X and added that the feat ‚Äúreflects growing trust of overseas Pakistanis in the economy and policy measures‚Äù.</p>
