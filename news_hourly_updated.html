                <h2>Two teams to present Pakistan‚Äôs perspective to world on recent Indian aggression: FO</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Two government delegations are set to hold a series of meetings with major world capitals to present Pakistan‚Äôs perspective to the global community on the recent spike in tensions with India, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Monday.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">high-level team</a> ‚Äî consisting of three former foreign ministers, two former foreign sec¬≠¬≠retaries, two former ambassadors to the US, and a serving federal minister ‚Äî arrived in New York yesterday for consultations at the United Nations, the FO said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/visits-of-high-level-delegations-to-important-capitals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> today.</p>
<p>The delegation will also visit Washington DC, London and Brussels, the FO said.</p>
<p>Ex-FMs PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; and Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh¬≠mina Janjua are members of the first delegation.</p>
<p>The group is scheduled to meet UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Gute¬≠rres, the president of the UN General Assembly, and ambassadors of all five permanent members of the Security Council. It will also address a joint session of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation envoys.</p>
<p>The delegation will kick off its engagements on June 3, with planned meetings with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, senior administration officials, lawmakers, think-tank analysts, and leading media organisations.</p>
<p>Another delegation, led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi, will visit Moscow from June 2 to June 4, <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/statement-by-the-spokesperson-regarding-media-queries-related-to-visits-of-high-level-delegations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to the FO.</p>
<p>During the visit, Fatemi is scheduled to hold meetings with senior Russian officials and also engage with the media and think tanks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe visits of these delegations are aimed at projecting Pakistan‚Äôs perspective on the recent Indian aggression,‚Äù the FO statement read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe delegations will highlight Pakistan‚Äôs responsible and restrained conduct ‚Äî seeking peace with responsibility ‚Äî in the face of India‚Äôs reckless and belligerent actions in violation of international law.‚Äù</p>
<p>The delegations will also highlight that ‚Äúdialogue and diplomacy should take precedence over conflict and confrontation‚Äù.</p>
<p>The statement read that the delegations will underscore the importance of the international community to play its due role in promoting a lasting peace in the region, including the immediate resumption of the normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe delegations will engage in a series of meetings with the leadership of international bodies, public office holders, senior officials, parliamentarians, think tanks, media and diaspora,‚Äù the FO said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#strategic-importance-and-not-mere-photo-opportunities" id="strategic-importance-and-not-mere-photo-opportunities" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòStrategic importance and not mere photo opportunities‚Äô</h2>
<p>Separately, Senator Sherry Rehman said that the delegation led by the PPP chairman has already begun its US visit with a ‚Äúpacked schedule of high-level multilateral meetings in New York‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://ppp.org.pk/pr/33976/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, Rehman emphasised that the meetings will have strategic importance and not be ‚Äúmere photo opportunities‚Äù.</p>
<p>She added that the country‚Äôs status as ‚Äúa responsible and stable middle power‚Äù is being highlighted during the engagements, and that the country had a clear interest in ‚Äúregional peace and security‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAdherence to international laws is part of Pakistan‚Äôs foreign policy,‚Äù Rehman said, adding that the ‚Äúfabricated‚Äù Indian narrative against the country ‚Äúwill not be allowed to take the form of truth this time‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia has started using false terrorism allegations as justification for war. This trend cannot be allowed to become the norm,‚Äù she said, adding that the country would not be part of any Indian ‚Äúfilm script‚Äù.</p>
<p>The PPP leader said, ‚ÄúChairman Bilawal Bhutto has successfully presented Pakistan‚Äôs solid position on water, Kashmir and violations of international laws of war and peace.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan, as a responsible nuclear state, believes in a broad and fair dialogue based on peace,‚Äù she added.</p></p>

                <h2>PML-N‚Äôs Hina Arshad secures Punjab Assembly seat in Sialkot polls marred by rigging claims</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>PML-N‚Äôs Hina Arshad Warraich secured a Punjab Assembly seat (PP-52) in Sialkot by a wide margin amid rigging <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914876/pml-n-bags-sialkot-by-election-marred-by-rigging-allegations">allegations</a> by the PTI, according to preliminary results issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday.</p>
<p>The by-election for PP-52 (Sambrial) took place yesterday, two months after the seat had fallen vacant following the demise of PML-N MPA <a class="link--external" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BnFxIhXyKj_8luXGa7w7-4zsh2PXR_MV/view" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Arshad Javed Warraich</a> ‚Äî father of the winning candidate.</p>
<p>Analysts had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914143/pti-gets-relatively-better-playfield-in-pp-52">expected</a> a tough one-on-one contest between the ruling PML-N and the PTI-backed aspirants, whereas the PPP had also been running an aggressive campaign in Sambrial to perform better in the race.</p>
<p>According to <a class="link--external" href="https://ecp.gov.pk/storage/files/3/pp-52.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Form-47</a> issued by the ECP today and signed by Returning Officer Muhammad Iqbal, Warraich clinched the seat by winning 78,702 votes.</p>
<p>Warraich‚Äôs main opponent, Fakhir Nashat Ghumman, who was an independent candidate backed by the PTI, was the runner-up with 39,018 votes.</p>
<p>PPP‚Äôs Raheel Kamran Cheema ranked third with 6,832 ballots cast in his favour, followed by Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan‚Äôs Muhammad Shafaqat with 4,851 votes.</p>
<p>The balloting had remained peaceful throughout yesterday, except for verbal arguments between PTI supporters and the police at some polling stations out of a total of 185.</p>
<p>PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914876/pml-n-bags-sialkot-by-election-marred-by-rigging-allegations#:~:text=PTI%20accused%20the%20Punjab%20government%20and%20police%20of%20interfering%20in%20the%20by%2Dpoll">accused</a> the Punjab government and the police of interfering in the by-election, alleging that its polling agents were expelled from the polling stations. The former ruling party also claimed to have ‚Äúvideo evidence of the rigging‚Äù.</p>

<p>However, Provincial Election Commissioner Sharifullah, in a statement, denied these allegations. He said the voting process continued in all 185 polling stations without any interruption till 5pm. He said that the election commission would review any complaint regarding irregularities if it was provided in a proper way.</p>
<p>The local administration, apparently for security reasons, had placed containers in front of the RO office ‚Äî a move lambasted by the PTI as well as the PPP, which also staged a sit-in in front of the office in Sambrial.</p>
<p>PPP leader and ex-premier Raja Pervaiz Ashraf also added to the PTI‚Äôs rigging allegations.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media in Sambrial yesterday, flanked by PPP Punjab Secretary General Hassan Murtaza, Ashraf claimed polling stations had been closed in several areas by the administration.</p>
<p>The ex-premier said if results were changed, that would be unfortunate, adding that it would not be a good omen for the government. He said it was not tolerable that rigging took place during the by-election.</p>

<p>The ECP had set up 185 polling stations, categorising 11 as highly sensitive, 38 as sensitive, and 136 as normal. A total of 1,696 officers and staff had been deployed to perform election duties across these stations.</p>
<p>The total number of registered voters in PP-52 was 297,185, including 157,725 male voters and 139,460 female voters.</p>
<p>The voter turnout was recorded as 44.79 per cent, with a total of 133,096 ballots cast, out of which 130,837 were counted as submitted in the right manner.</p>
