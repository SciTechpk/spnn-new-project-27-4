            <p><p>Lt General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, director general of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), has lauded Iran‚Äôs peace efforts in the recent Pakistan-India conflict and warned of ‚Äúforces‚Äù seeking to create a rift among brotherly countries.</p>
<p>Just two days after India, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">without</a> any evidence, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack">blamed</a> Pakistan over last month‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam, Iran had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">offered to mediate</a> between the two as tensions escalated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan is fully grateful to the international community, and we are especially grateful to brotherly countries, including the Islamic Republic of Iran,‚Äù Gen Chaudhry told <em>IRNA</em> in an <a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85835207/Exclusive-Pakistani-military-spokesperson-Islamabad-appreciates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> published today ‚Äî the first by any Pakistani armed forces‚Äô spokesperson to an Iranian outlet.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe should be aware that there are forces in the region that, with the help of external factors, are seeking to create misunderstanding and confusion among brotherly countries in the region and want to create a rift between friends and brothers,‚Äù the DG ISPR added.</p>

<p>According to <em>IRNA</em>, Lt Gen Chaudhry spoke about the latest developments in South Asia as well as the ‚Äúimportance of regional and international diplomacy to help de-escalate tensions‚Äù. He also ‚Äúfocused‚Äù on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">recent visit</a> of Iran‚Äôs Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to Islamabad, the report added.</p>
<p>During his visit to Islamabad, Araghchi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">met with</a> Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir. He later also made a trip <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909355/irans-foreign-minister-repeats-call-for-restraint-in-india-pakistan-standoff">to New Delhi</a>, reiterating his call for restraint.</p>

<p>The DG ISPR appreciated Tehran‚Äôs efforts and support to help de-escalate tensions in the region.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are pleased with all the efforts of the international community and brotherly countries, especially Iran, which played a role in reducing tensions,‚Äù he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as tensions over the Pahalgam attack continued to build up. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>

<p>The Pakistani army spokesman emphasised that Iran and Pakistan ‚Äúhave very historical and brotherly relations and have always stood by each other in all challenges and trials‚Äù.</p>

<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry highlighted that the two nations were ‚Äúneighbouring and friendly countries that are in contact with each other on many issues and fields‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan is eager and pursues that the borders of the two countries are the borders of peace and friendship, and we look forward to it,‚Äù the DG ISPR told <em>IRNA</em>.</p>
<p>The military‚Äôs spokesperson stressed that Tehran and Islamabad were ‚Äúcooperating together for lasting peace and stability in the region‚Äù.</p>

<p>Separately, the ISPR said President Asif Ali Zardari visited Gujranwala Cantonment today where he lauded the ‚Äúexemplary conduct and professional excellence‚Äù of the military in the successful execution of Marqa-i-Haq, acknowledging their ‚Äúresolute determination and unshakable courage in the face of unprovoked aggression‚Äù.</p>

                <h2>Iran‚Äôs Khamenei says Trump is lying when he speaks of peace</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused Donald Trump on Saturday of lying when the US president said during his Gulf tour this week that he wanted peace in the region.</p>
<p>On the contrary, said Khamenei, the United States uses its power to give ‚Äú10-ton bombs to the Zionist (Israeli) regime to drop on the heads of Gaza‚Äôs children‚Äù.</p>
<p>Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One after departing the United Arab Emirates on Friday that Iran had to move quickly on a US proposal for its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911291/trump-claims-n-deal-with-iran-likely-hopes-to-avoid-military-action">nuclear programme</a> or ‚Äúsomething bad‚Äôs going to happen‚Äù.</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Trump speaks about peace while simultaneously making threats.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhich should we believe?‚Äù Pezeshkian said at a naval event in Tehran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn the one hand, he speaks of peace and on the other, he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901324">threatens</a> with the most advanced tools of mass killing.‚Äù</p>
<p>Tehran would continue Iran-US nuclear talks but is not afraid of threats.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are not seeking war,‚Äù Pezeshkian said.</p>
<p>His remarks, said Khamenei, ‚Äúaren‚Äôt even worth responding to.‚Äù</p>
<p>They are an ‚Äúembarrassment to the speaker and the American people,‚Äù Khamenei added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUndoubtedly, the source of corruption, war, and conflict in this region is the Zionist regime ‚Äî a dangerous, deadly cancerous tumour that must be uprooted; it will be uprooted,‚Äù he said at an event at a religious centre in Tehran, according to state media.</p>
<p>While Trump said on Friday that Iran had a US proposal about its nuclear programme, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi in a post on X said Tehran had not received any such proposal.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThere is no scenario in which Iran abandons its hard-earned right to (uranium) enrichment for peaceful purposes‚Ä¶‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Araqchi warned on Saturday that Washington‚Äôs constant change of stance prolongs nuclear talks, state TV reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is absolutely unacceptable that America repeatedly defines a new framework for negotiations that prolongs the process,‚Äù the broadcast quoted Araqchi as saying.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian said Iran would not ‚Äúback down from our legitimate rights‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBecause we refuse to bow to bullying, they say we are source of instability in the region,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>A fourth <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1910194'">round</a> of Iran-US talks ended in Oman last Sunday.</p>
<p>A new round has not been scheduled yet.</p></p>
