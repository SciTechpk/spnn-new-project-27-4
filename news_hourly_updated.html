                <h2>Trump imposes additional 25pc tariff on Indian goods, relations hit new low</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued an executive order imposing an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, citing New Delhi‚Äôs continued imports of Russian oil, sharply escalating tensions between the two countries after trade talks collapsed.</p>
<p>The new measure raises tariffs on some Indian goods to as high as 50pc, among the steepest faced by any US trading partner.</p>
<p>The move is expected to hit key Indian export sectors, including textiles, footwear, and gems and jewellery and marks the most serious downturn in US-India relations since Trump returned to office in January.</p>
<p>In an <a class="link--external" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/addressing-threats-to-the-united-states-by-the-government-of-the-russian-federation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> issued from the White House, Trump said: ‚ÄúI find that the Government of India is currently directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAccordingly, and as consistent with applicable law, articles of India imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25pc.‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump said he determined it ‚Äúnecessary and appropriate‚Äù to impose an additional ad valorem duty on imports of articles of India since it was directly or indirectly importing Russian oil.</p>

</span></div>

<p>The tariff is set to take effect in three weeks and would be added on top of a separate 25pc tariff entering into force on Thursday. It maintains exemptions for items targeted by separate sector-specific duties, such as steel and aluminium, and categories that could be hit, such as pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs executive order does not mention China, which also buys Russian oil. A White House official had no immediate comment on whether an additional order covering those purchases would be forthcoming.</p>
<p>The development pays off on Trump‚Äôs repeated threats to hike the tariff rate on India for its oil purchases from Russia.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs foreign ministry said that the decision was ‚Äúextremely unfortunate‚Äù and that New Delhi would take all actions necessary to protect its national interests. ‚ÄúWe reiterate that these actions are unfair, unjustified and unreasonable,‚Äù it said.</p>

<p>A senior Indian official said New Delhi was blindsided by the sudden imposition of the new levy and the steep rate, as both countries continue to discuss trade issues.</p>
<p>Trump said a day ago he would increase the tariff charged on imports from India from 25pc <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928905/trump-says-he-will-very-substantially-raise-tariffs-on-india-in-next-24-hours-over-russian-oil-purchases">‚Äúvery substantially‚Äù</a> over the next 24 hours, given India‚Äôs continued purchases of Russian oil.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIndia has not been a good trading partner, because they do a lot of business with us, but we don‚Äôt do business with them. So we settled on 25pc but I think I‚Äôm going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they‚Äôre buying Russian oil,‚Äù he had told <em>CNBC</em> in a televised interview.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey‚Äôre fuelling the war machine, and if they‚Äôre going to do that, then I‚Äôm not going to be happy,‚Äù Trump had said, adding that the main sticking point with India was that its tariffs were too high.</p>
<p>Trump last week said he would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927587">impose</a> a 25pc tariff on goods imported from India and added that the world‚Äôs fifth-largest economy would also face an unspecified penalty, but gave no details. Later, Trump mou¬≠nted a sharp attack and said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.‚Äù</p>
<p>Over the weekend, two Indian government sources told <em>Reuters</em> that India would keep purchasing oil from Russia despite Trump‚Äôs threats. In turn, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928504/top-trump-aide-accuses-india-of-financing-russias-war-in-ukraine">accused</a> India of effectively financing Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine by purchasing oil from Moscow.</p>
<p>Trump had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928704">made the same threat</a> about substantially raising tariffs a day ago.</p>
<p>Responding to the threat, India‚Äôs Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had issued a statement claiming that the US and the European Union ‚Äútargeted‚Äù New Delhi for purchasing Russian oil after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.</p>
<p>The MEA highlighted in its statement that the very nations criticising India were engaging in trade with Russia themselves, adding that the goods exchanged include energy, fertilisers, mining products, chemicals, iron and steel and machinery and transport equipment.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhere the United States is concerned, it continues to import from Russia uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for its electric vehicle industry, fertilisers, as well as chemicals,‚Äù the MEA statement added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn this background, the targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable. Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security.‚Äù</p>
<p>India, the world‚Äôs third-largest oil importer, is the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854116">biggest buyer</a> of seaborne Russian crude, a vital revenue earner for Russia as it wages war in Ukraine for a fourth year.</p>
<p>The US levy on India exceeds those agreed by some other nations in deals with the Trump administration. For example, the tariff on Vietnam is set at 20pc and on Indonesia at 19pc, with levies of 15pc on Japanese and European Union exports.</p>
<p>Last week, Trump said Washington had reached a trade deal with India‚Äôs arch-rival Pakistan that Islamabad said would lead to lower tariffs on its exports.</p>
<p>Since India‚Äôs short but deadly conflict with Pakistan in May, New Delhi has been unhappy about Trump‚Äôs closeness with Islamabad and has protested, casting a shadow over trade talks.</p>
<p>Despite former public displays of bonhomie between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has taken a slightly harder stance against the US in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the India-Pakistan ceasefire he announced on social media on May 10, but India disputes his claim that it resulted from his intervention and trade threats.</p>
<p>By declaring the Indian economy dead in the water, Trump has put Modi and his party in a bind. Until recently, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was canvassing support for the US president‚Äôs election. Its supporters were holding special prayers and muttering mystical chants for Trump‚Äôs victory. There was at least one temple created where a sculptured image of Trump was worshipped.</p>
<p>But Trump has ignored the lavish praise and called out India‚Äôs energy imports from Russia and its tariff regime as non-negotiable.</p>
<p>The Indian government said it was trying to figure out a response by consulting all the ‚Äústakeholders‚Äù, a euphemism for angry businesses whose hopes were riding on Modi‚Äôs daring ability to play both sides of the street.</p>
<p>That appears to have hit a dead-end.</p></p>

                <h2>PHC stays ECP action against PTI‚Äôs Shibli Faraz, Omar Ayub</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Wednesday halted the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) from taking any action against PTI leaders Shibli Faraz and Omar Ayub.</p>
<p>The ECP on Tuesday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928901">disqualified</a> Faraz as the Senate opposition leader, Ayub as the National Assembly equivalent, then-MNAs Zartaj Gul, Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza and other PTI lawmakers following their convictions in cases related to the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan‚Äôs arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">attacking</a> the Lahore corps commander‚Äôs residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.</p>
<p>An anti-terrorism court in Faisalabad last week <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">senten¬≠ced</a> over PTI 100 leaders and workers to jail terms of up to 10 years in connection with the riots. Faraz, Zartaj Gul and Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan were among those awarded rigorous imprisonment.</p>
<p>Identical orders issued today by a bench comprising Justice Arshad Ali and Justice Farah Jamshed said that Faraz and Ayub were in the process of appealing their convictions in the Lahore High Court (LHC) and had surrendered themselves before the PHC so they could approach the LHC.</p>
<p>The orders said that their convictions were not final and the ECP had not waited for the outcome of their appeals before disqualifying them. They directed notices be issued to the respondents in the matter and meanwhile, ‚Äúthe ECP shall not take any further process‚Äù under its notifications to disqualify the PTI leaders.</p>
<p>The orders adjourned both cases to Aug 20. The bench had granted protective bail to the two and Gul earlier today.</p>
<p>Talking to the media, Ayub said the ECP had disqualified him without following due procedure. He thanked the PHC for granting transit bail so he could file his appeal.</p>
<p>A day prior, Ayub lambasted the ATC‚Äôs ‚Äúbogus verdict‚Äù in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/OmarAyubKhan/status/1952737607013576874" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, saying that he would contest it and the ECP‚Äôs disqualification in court.</p>
<p>He also posted a video of himself at the PHC with other PTI leaders and lawyers, saying the court had given him a few days and bail would be granted to him on filing his appeal.</p>
