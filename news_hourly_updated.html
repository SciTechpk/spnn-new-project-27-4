            </a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump has said said the escalation between India and Pakistan was a ‚Äúshame‚Äù.</p>
<p>He was the first world leader to react to the tense situation after India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">carried out strikes</a> inside Pakistan which also retaliated and reportedly shot down Indian jets.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame. We just heard about it as we were walking in the doors of the Oval [Office],‚Äù he said inside the White House after overseeing the swearing-in ceremony for his special envoy, Steve Witkoff.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past. They‚Äôve been fighting for a long time,‚Äù the US president added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI hope it ends very quickly.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a statement, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called for restraint from both countries, Associated Press  reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Secretary-General is very concerned about the Indian military  operations across the Line of Control and international border. He calls  for maximum military restraint from both countries. The world cannot  afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan,‚Äù said  the statement.</p>
<p>The US State Department also said it is ‚Äúclosely monitoring developments,‚Äù <em>CNN</em> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are aware of the reports, however we have no assessment to offer at this time,‚Äù the spokesperson said. ‚ÄúThis remains an evolving situation,and we are closely monitoring developments.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>May 9 riots: SC CB rules civilians can be tried in military courts</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>With two judges dissenting, the Supreme Court‚Äôs Constitutional Bench (CB) on Wednesday gave its go-ahead for civilians involved in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279/special-report-may-9-mayhem-and-military-trials-a-year-on">May 9, 2023 riots</a> to be tried in military courts.</p>
<p>The case pertains to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878498">military trials</a> and the subsequent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881338">sentencing of civilians</a> for their role in attacks on army installations during the riots that followed ex-premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">Imran Khan‚Äôs arrest</a> on May 9, 2023.</p>
<p>The 5-2 ruling came as the CB accepted a set of 38 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1797503">intra-court appeals</a> (ICAs) moved by the federal and provincial gover¬≠nments as well as Shuhada Forum Balochistan, among others, against the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783105">widely-praised</a> October 2023 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783065/may-9-riots-sc-declares-military-trials-of-civilians-null-and-void">ruling</a> that declared that trying the accused civilians in military courts <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783065/may-9-riots-sc-declares-military-trials-of-civilians-null-and-void">violated the Constitution</a>.</p>

<p>The bench ‚Äî led by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also including Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, and Shahid Bilal Hassan ‚Äî had been reviewing whether the trial of civilians in military courts was Constitutional or not.</p>
<p>Justice Aminuddin announced the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/downloads_judgements/i.c.a._5_2023_07052025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10-page short order</a> of the majority ruling. The bench also directed the government to make the necessary amendments in the PAA within 45 days to allow the convicted individuals the right to appeal their sentences before a high court.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Justices Mandokhail and Afghan dissented from the verdict, dismissing the appeals in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/downloads_judgements/i.c.a._5_2023_dn_07052025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">separate order</a> and upholding the earlier ruling that declared military trials as null and void.</p>

<p>That Oct 23, 2023 verdict by a five-member bench ‚Äî led by Justice Ijazul Ahsan and comprising Justices Munib Akhtar, Yayha Afridi, Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi and Ayesha A. Malik ‚Äî had declared the military trials of civilians as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783244/sc-strikes-down-military-justice-for-civilians">unconstitutional</a> by a majority of 4-1.</p>
<p>While the bench unanimously emphasised that the cases of the May 9 suspects will proceed before criminal courts, the majority ruling had struck down Section 2(1)d(i) and 2(1)(d)(ii) as well as Section 59(4) of the <a class="link--external" href="https://pakistancode.gov.pk/pdffiles/administrator5a436c410d7fc88fc27dae7b864c6f63.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pakistan Army Act, 1952</a>.</p>
<p>In today‚Äôs pivotal verdict, the constitutional bench ‚Äî formed under the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866652/president-zardari-gives-assent-to-26th-constitutional-amendment">26th Amendment</a> ‚Äî restored those sections of the PAA.</p>
<p>Section 2(1)(d)(i) says that those persons not otherwise subject to PAA become subject to the law if they were accused of seducing or attempting to seduce any army officer from his duty or allegiance to the government.</p>
<p>Likewise, Section 2(1)(d)(ii) says individuals could be tried under PAA if they have committed an offence in relation to any work of defence, arsenal, naval, military or air force establishment or station, ship or aircraft or otherwise in relation to the naval, military or air force affairs of Pakistan an offence under the Official Secrets Act 1923.</p>
<p>Section 59(4) says that any person who becomes subject to PAA will liable to be tried under this act.</p>
<p>The short order stated that by a majority of five judges, ‚ÄúICA no.5/2023 and other connected appeals are allowed and the impugned judgment, dated 23.10.2023, [‚Ä¶] is set aside.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhereas, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan dismissed the aforesaid intra-court appeals,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>While the CB did not specify a timeframe, a detailed verdict is expected later as only short orders were issued today.</p>

<p>The <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTIofficial/status/1920120679199875177" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PTI</a> ‚Äî whose supporters and activists are among those <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881338#:~:text=Among%20other%20notable%20individuals%20was%20PTI%20leader%20Abbad%20Farooq">handed the sentences</a> by military courts ‚Äî and lawyers strongly criticised the verdict and expressed their concerns about the right to fair trial.</p>
<p>Lawyer Reema Omer termed the order ‚Äúterrible‚Äù. ‚ÄúA pity the highest court of the land is on board with such militarisation of justice in the country,‚Äù she <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/reema_omer/status/1920060853832851785" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on X</a>.</p>
<p>Noting the court‚Äôs directives on legislation about right to fair trial, Omer said: ‚ÄúWhile important, [it is] insufficient to make military trials of civilians consistent with fair trial.‚Äù</p>
<p>She highlighted that the dissenting order clearly pointed out ‚Äúhow military trials of civilians violate the right to a fair trial in a number of ways, and why active military officers are not competent per se to conduct indepedent and impartial trials‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch    media--uneven  media--stretch">

<p>In another post, Omer shared an analysis by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866652/icj-derides-blow-to-judicial-independence-as-26th-constitutional-amendment-becomes-law">International Commission of Jurists</a> that detailed why military trials ‚Äúreflect a glaring surrender of human rights‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚ÄúLast night we faced an external threat from a foreign enemy. This morning we have been exposed to an internal threat to our democracy and freedom by our own Supreme Court,‚Äù he quipped, referring to the India-Pakistan military escalation.</p>
<p>Nasir affirmed: ‚ÄúWhile we stand with our armed forces to protect our borders, we in the midst of this crisis and wartime hysteria must not lose sight of the very constitutional rights and freedoms which we are fighting to protect.‚Äù</p>

<p>Lawyer Hassan A. Niazi lamented: ‚ÄúPakistan‚Äôs fundamental rights ‚Äî battered and waning ‚Äî were struck a death blow today. Even the judicial arm cedes its space.‚Äù</p>
<p>The lawyer added that the dircetives on right to appeal could not ‚Äúredeem the fact that civilian trials in military courts are unconstitutional and violate basic human rights‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have entered the era of ‚Äòmilitarisation‚Äô of justice ‚Äî spearheaded by a ‚Äôconstitutional bench,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe decision has been given on a day when purportedly the installed regime and the establishment want to build ‚ÄòNational Cohesion‚Äô,‚Äù he added, referring to the ongoing situation faced by the country in the wake of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">India‚Äôs strikes</a> last night.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe judges who have ruled in favour of allowing civilians trial in military courts will not be remembered kindly by history,‚Äù the NA opposition leader said, adding that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866452/26th-constitutional-amendment-awaits-presidential-assent-after-sailing-through-na-in-late-night-session">26th Amendment was passed</a> with ‚Äúill intent‚Äù and Imran as the ‚Äúsole target‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPeaceful assembly, association, or public demonstration/protest within the bounds and precincts of reasonable restrictions imposed by the law is not prohibited, but without violating or breaking the law, or taking the law in one‚Äôs hands,‚Äù the ruling stressed.</p>
<p>It noted that the AGP had pointed out that due to the striking down of some sections of the PAA, no action can be taken even against ‚Äúhardcore criminals and terrorists‚Äù involved in attacks on army installations, personnel or civilians, or against ‚Äúpersons accused of espionage or spies of enemy countries‚Äù.</p>
<p>Citing the cases of Brig (retired) F. B. Ali, Shahida Zahir Abbasi and District Bar Rawalpindi, the bench noted that the ‚Äúvarious provisions were vigorously highlighted by the learned counsel for the appellants to demonstrate‚Äù that the right to a fair trial was fully protected under the PAA.</p>
<p>On the right to appeal, the order said that AGP Awan had reiterated that if the CB referred the matter to the government/parliament to amend the law and create a window of an independent right of appeal over and above the one already provided under Section 133-B of the PAA, it would be considered seriously.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the CB referred the matter to the government/parliament for ‚Äúconsidering and making necessary amendments/legislation‚Äù in the PAA and allied Rules within 45 days to provide an independent right of appeal in the high court against the convictions handed by military courts under Section 2(1)d(i) and 2(1)(d)(ii) read with Section 59(4) of the PAA.</p>

<p>It clarified that individual cases/writ petitions before high courts challenging ATC orders, ‚Äúallowing the transfer of case/custody of any accused to the military court for trial, shall be decided by such courts on its own merits‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn our view, the provisions merely accentuating the right to a fair trial and due process in any statute and its actual application and proper implementation during the trial are two distinct features and situations,‚Äù the order stated.</p>
<p>The majority ruling further said: ‚ÄúWe, in unison, sensitise the need for legislative changes, which will also be compliant to the requirements laid down under the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-civil-and-political-rights" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) for maintaining and preserving the constitutional and societal norms in the existing legal framework.‚Äù</p>

<p>In their <a class="link--external" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/downloads_judgements/i.c.a._5_2023_dn_07052025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dissenting order</a>, Justices Mandokhail and Afghan set aside the convictions and sentences awarded to civilians by military courts over the May 9 riots, declaring them as ‚Äúwithout jurisdiction‚Äù.</p>
<p>The judges observed that the trial of civilians by military courts violated Articles 2A, 9 (security of person), 10 (safeguards as to arrest and detention), 10A (right to fair trial), 19A (right to information), 25 (equality of citizens) and 227(1) (provisions relating to the Holy Quran and Sunnah) of the Constitution, as well as ‚Äúoffends the fundamental principle of independence of judiciary‚Äù.</p>

<p>They determined: ‚ÄúThe accused under custody shall be treated as under-trial prisoners. Their cases stand transferred to the concerned courts of competent jurisdiction for trial. Upon receipt whereof, the concerned courts should proceed with their trials expeditiously and decide the same at the earliest, in accordance with law.‚Äù</p>
<p>The judges were of the opinion that suspects ‚Äúwho have completed/undergone their sentences or have been acquitted of the charge by the court martial or forum of appeal under the PAA shall have the effect of their discharge‚Äù under section 169 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>
<p>The order pointed out that Section 2(1)(d) did not ‚Äúqualify for exemption
from fundamental rights‚Äù as it related to ‚Äúpersons not otherwise subject to the PAA (‚ÄòCivilians‚Äô)‚Äù, and hence, cannot be retained as part of the PAA.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe courts martial comprising of executive, being outside the scope of Article 175(3) of the Constitution, cannot prosecute civilians,‚Äù the judges observed.</p>
<p>They clarified that the reasons for their judgment would be detailed ‚Äúlater on‚Äù.</p>

<p>On December 13, 2024, the SC‚Äôs constitutional bench <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878498">conditionally allowed</a> military courts to pronounce reserved verdicts of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279#:~:text=A%20year%20on%2C%20as%20of%20May%209%2C%202024%2C%2085%20of%20these%20civilians%20are%20still%20in%20military%20custody.">85 civilians</a> who were in custody for their alleged involvement in the May 9 riots.</p>

<p>Subsequently, on December 21, military courts <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880141">sentenced 25 civilians</a> to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their involvement. Days later, another <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881338">60 civilians</a> were handed jail terms for a similar period over the matter.</p>
<p>On January 2, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884089">mercy petitions</a> of 19 accused were accepted on humanitarian grounds, while 48 other pleas have been processed to Courts of Appeal.</p>
<p>The sentencing of civilians by military courts was not only condemned by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880270">PTI</a>, but the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880757/may-9-riots-us-joins-uk-eu-in-voicing-concerns-over-military-trials-of-civilians">United States</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880609/trying-civilians-in-military-courts-lacks-transparency-uk-says-after-may-9-fgcm-convictions">United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880384">European Union</a> also raised concerns, saying the move contradicted international laws.</p></p>
