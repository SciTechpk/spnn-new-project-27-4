                <h2>Pakistan slams Modi‚Äôs ‚Äòinflammatory monologue‚Äô, urges India to honour international order</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office on Wednesday condemned the ‚Äúinflammatory monologue‚Äù delivered by Indian PM Narendra Modi in Gujarat, urging India to ‚Äúreturn to the core principles of international order‚Äù.</p>
<p>The developments follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi‚Äôs allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam.</p>
<p>On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>. After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> was reached.</p>
<p>In a video <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ANI/status/1927255026990264356" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> by Indian news outlet <em>ANI</em>, Modi, addressing India‚Äôs youth, calls into question the contents of the Indus Waters Treaty. He said, ‚ÄúIf you study the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, you‚Äôll be shocked.‚Äù</p>

<p>He continued, ‚ÄúIt was decided that the dams built on the rivers of Jammu and Kashmir would not be cleaned‚Ä¶ For 60 years, these gates were never opened. Reservoirs that were supposed to be filled to 100 per cent capacity have now been reduced to only 2pc or 3pc.‚Äù</p>
<p>Stating that the treaty has only been held in abeyance as of now, he added, ‚ÄúRight now, I haven‚Äôt done anything, and people are sweating there [Pakistan].‚Äù</p>
<p>Calling Modi‚Äôs remarks ‚Äúunexpected‚Äù, the FO in its statement urged India to set aside its project of ‚Äúhistorical revisionism‚Äù.</p>

<p>The FO termed India‚Äôs approach towards the treaty as a ‚Äútroubling departure from international norms‚Äù, while drawing a contrast between Pakistan and India‚Äôs regional conduct and global ambitions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA leadership truly in pursuit of international respect might first look inward, and seek to cleanse its conscience before issuing threats to others,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>It further added, ‚ÄúPakistan urges India to return to the core principles of international order including respect for sovereign rights of others and its treaty obligations, as well as restraint in both language and action.‚Äù</p>
<p>The FO in its statement cautioned that ‚ÄúJingoism may stir applause on the campaign trail, but it undermines long-term peace and stability‚Äù. It continued that ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs youth, often the first casualty of chauvinistic nationalism, would do well to reject the politics of fear and instead work toward a future defined by dignity, reason, and regional cooperation‚Äù.</p>
<p>The statement read that such acts may serve domestic optics but cannot withstand international scrutiny or inspire India‚Äôs image as a responsible regional power, while highlighting that ‚Äúthe ideological followers of India‚Äôs current government have normalised mob violence, promoted hate campaigns and targeted religious minorities‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Indian government is linked to extraterritorial assassinations and foreign subversion.</p>
<p>India is in occupation of foreign people and territories. Its record in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir is defined by systematic repression. It is ironic that such a state now attempts to claim the mantle of victimhood.‚Äú</p></p>

<p>PM Shehbaz arrived in Lachin yesterday on the third leg of his four-nation tour after visiting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913346/pm-shehbaz-in-turkiye-to-elevate-strategic-partnership">Tukiye</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913442/ready-to-talk-with-india-pm-shehbaz-says-during-meeting-with-iranian-president-in-tehran">Iran</a>. He will later depart for Tajikistan, where he will attend the International Conference on Glaciers in Dushanbe.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the premier held a bilateral meeting with President <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913657">Ilham Aliyev</a> and thanked him for Azerbaijan‚Äôs support during the recent confrontation with India. Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir was also present on the occasion.</p>
<p>Both leaders ‚Äúunderscored the importance of coordinated efforts to promote regional stability, mutual prosperity, and principled positions on key international issues‚Äù, a press release by the PM‚Äôs Office said.</p>
<p>The prime minister thanked Azerbaijan for its ‚Äústeadfast support during the recent Pakistan-India confrontation in the face of Indian provocation and acknowledged the public expressions of solidarity from both the leadership and the people of brotherly Azerbaijan,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>He said that people of Azerbaijan celebrated Pakistan‚Äôs success in the Marka-e-Haq against India.</p>
<p>They reaffirmed their shared commitment to diversifying the strategic partnership through investment in mutually beneficial avenues.</p>
<p>The Azerbaijan side agreed to the exchange of delegations regarding the progress of Azerbaijan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845188">investment</a> in Pakistan. In this regard, it was agreed that delegation-level talks will be organised soon.</p>
<p>In a separate message, PM Shehbaz extended heartfelt felicitations to President Aliyev and the brotherly people of Azerbaijan on the joyous occasion of Azerbaijan‚Äôs Independence Day on the behalf of the people and Government of Pakistan.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/CMShehbaz/status/1927406750375801297" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, he said that Pakistan deeply values its close fraternal bonds with Azerbaijan-rooted in shared history, mutual trust and unwavering support for each other.</p>
<p>Shehbaz said that ‚Äúit gives me great pleasure to be able to celebrate this historic day in Azerbaijan, alongside President Aliyev and our Azerbaijani brothers and sisters‚Äù.</p>
<p>The prime minister expressed confidence that under President Aliyev‚Äôs ‚Äúwise and sagacious leadership, our multi-dimensional partnership will continue to grow from strength to strength‚Äù.</p>
