            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912572/bla-and-ttp-are-indian-proxies-govt-will-prove-indias-involvement-in-khuzdar-bus-attack-asif' target='_blank'><strong>BLA and TTP are Indian proxies, govt will prove India’s involvement in Khuzdar bus attack: Asif</strong></a>
            <p><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has said that two major terrorist groups operating in Pakistan were “Indian proxies”, adding that Islamabad will present “complete evidence” to prove New Delhi’s involvement in the attack on a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912542/pm-vows-strong-action-against-perpetrators-after-school-bus-blast-in-khuzdar">school bus</a> in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district that killed three children and injured several others.</p>
<p>At least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others — mostly students — sustained injuries after a bomb targeted the bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.</p>
<p>The condition of at least a dozen is said to be serious due to critical injuries, officials <a class="link--external" href="https://https:/https://www.dawn.com/news/1912542/pm-vows-strong-action-against-perpetrators-after-school-bus-blast-in-khuzdar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>, adding that at least 15 girl students were among the injured. Security forces vowed to “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357/4-students-killed-several-injured-as-school-bus-comes-under-attack-in-khuzdar-dc">relentlessly pursue</a>” the culprits of the attack as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir visited the injured in Quetta yesterday.</p>
<p>Speaking on <em>Geo News</em> programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ late on Wednesday, Asif asserted there was evidence that the proscribed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) was working as an Indian proxy.</p>
<p>“We will present evidence of India’s involvement. We will corroborate whatever we have claimed,” he said.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>“The relation between BLA and India is well-known as their leadership is in New Delhi. The allegation against us was unsubstantiated but BLA is fighting like an Indian proxy,” he added.</p>
<p>He was referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> last month in occupied Kashmir that killed 26 people, following which India, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">without evidence</a>, had blamed Pakistan for backing the attackers.</p>
<p>Asif further said, “BLA and TTP are Indian proxies. They have nothing to do with religion or nationalism, India is financing them and they’re involved in bloodshed here.”</p>
<p>In reply to a question on dealing with the situation, the minister said that “Pakistan will strike with full force and there will be no leniency”, stressing that attacking non-combatants, including school children, was unacceptable.</p>
<p>Asif said Pakistan called for an investigation into the Pahalgam attack, which India didn’t agree to, adding that the world should be informed that the Narendra Modi-led regime was “very irresponsible for using a false incident as a pretext to wage a nuclear war”.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan “will not start nuclear confrontation but cannot stay silent if nuclear devices are thrown at us”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan showed restraint, but still India attacked our bases in the dark of the night,” he highlighted.</p>

<p>A day ago, the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), also said that “Indian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians”.</p>
<p>It noted that India had “failed” against Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/india-attacks-pakistans-air-bases-pakistan-retaliates#:~:text=Force.%20Pakistan%20Zindabad.%E2%80%9D-,Operations%20commence,-At%20around%203">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a> during the recent conflict, and its [proxies] were “being hunted [down] by military and law enforcement agencies”.</p>
<p>“Use of terrorism as a state policy by [the] Indian political government is abhorrent and reflective of their low morality and disregard of [sic] basic human norms,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p>“Planners, abettors and executors of this cowardly Indian-sponsored attack will be hunted down and brought to justice and [the] heinous face of India will be exposed in front of the entire world,” the military vowed.</p>

<p>On Monday, the ISPR said <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005/3-terrorists-of-indian-proxy-blf-killed-in-balochistan-engagements-ispr">12 terrorists</a> of “Indian proxy” outfits were killed by security forces in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.</p>
<p>Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said India was activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan.</p>
<p>He had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">detailed the arrest</a> of a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India as “irr­e­futable evidence” of state-sponsored terrorism directed by Ind­ian military personnel.</p></p>

            <p><p>The festive occasion of Eidul Azha is likely to be celebrated across Pakistan on June 7, 2025, according to the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco).</p>
<p>In a statement, the commission issued a prediction regarding the sighting of the crescent moon for the month of Zilhaj 1446 AH, “based on scientific analysis, astronomical data, and modern observational techniques.”</p>
<p>It said according to astronomical models, the birth of the new moon for Zilhaj will occur on May 27, 2025, at 8:02pm PST.</p>
<p>The scientific analysis for May 27, 2025 (29 Ziqa’ad) in Pakistan indicates the age of the moon at sunset will be approximately 11 hours and 34 minutes, it mentioned.</p>
<p>“Even under the most optimal weather conditions, the possibility of the moon being sighted across the country is extremely low, as there will only be a 37-minute interval between sunset and moonset,” it added.</p>
<p>The commission said 1st Zilhaj is expected to fall on May 29. Therefore, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910869/five-temporary-sale-points-for-sacrificial-animals-planned">Eidul Azha</a> will be celebrated across Pakistan on June 7.</p>
<p>It added that the Central Ruet-e-Hilal Committee holds the final authority to confirm the moon’s sighting based on eyewitness testimonies and weather conditions.</p>
<p>Celebrated on the 10th of Zilhaj, Eidul Azha marks the culmination of Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam.</p></p>

            <p><p>• Observes things are calming down following contacts between DGMOs; NSA to lead Pakistan side during dialogue<br />
• Says Nawaz was consulted before army chief’s elevation to field marshal</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said Saudi Arabia could be the “neutral” venue for much-needed talks between Pakistan and India on critical issues.</p>
<p>The premier also said that he had consulted PML-N President Nawaz Sharif on his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912186/cabinet-approves-coas-gen-asim-munirs-promotion-to-field-marshal">decision</a> to elevate Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir to field marshal.</p>
<p>Talking to a group of TV anchors at the PM House, he said that Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism will be the key points during the dialogue with India.</p>
<p>In response to a question if there was a possibility of a third venue for talks in light of the mediation offered by US President Donald Trump, the premier ruled out the possibility of China as a neutral venue, saying India would never agree to that.</p>
<p>However, a participant told <em>Dawn</em>, the PM expressed the hope that Saudi Arabia could be the third country where both sides could agree to hold the negotiations.</p>
<p>When it was pointed out that India intends to hold dialogue on terrorism while Pakistan wants to focus on Kashmir, the PM reiterated: “Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism will be the key points during Pakistan-India talks.”</p>
<p>Regarding the appointment of COAS Gen Munir as field marshal, PM Shehbaz said: “It was my own decision to make the army chief a field marshal.”</p>
<p>Responding to a question that Nawaz Sharif had always remained opposed to giving extension to the army chief’s term in office, PM Shehbaz said he took his elder brother into confidence before taking any decision and likewise the COAS was made field marshal after consultation with the ruling party president.</p>
<p>“I always consult Nawaz Sharif before taking any key decision and that also happened in case of [elevation of] Gen Asim Munir,” he added.</p>
<p>In reply to a question that the PTI-led KP government needs to be supported in its efforts for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005">eradicating</a> terrorism, the prime minister said Centre was already helping the province in this regard as over Rs600 billion had been released to the KP government under the Public Sector Development Programme.</p>
<p>He said that situation between Pakistan and India was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910567">de-escalating</a> after the DGMOs of the two sides made contacts with each other.</p>
<p>He said if talks were held between the two arch rivals, the National Secur­ity Adviser will lead Paki­stan’s side in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting on housing</strong></p>
<p>Presiding over a meeting on the low-cost housing, the prime minister said that affordable projects would not only make residential units accessible to the common man but would also boost national economy and create jobs.</p>
<p>He said the relevant task force, in collaboration with the ministry of fina­n­ce and banks, should soon submit recommendations for financing low-cost hou­s­ing projects, which should be included in the upcoming budget proposals.</p>
<p>He observed that sustainable growth of economy was closely linked with the development of the construction sector.</p>
<p>Ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Riaz Hussain Pirzada, Ahad Khan Cheema, Muh­a­mmad Aurangzeb, and Ali Pervaiz Malik, the FBR chairman and other senior officials attended the mee­t­ing, the PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.</p>
<p>The meeting was infor­med that the Condominium Act 2025 and amendments to the Foreclosure Law were in their final stages and after their approval it would become easier to obtain loans for the construction and ownership of homes under the low-cost housing schemes.</p>
<p>The task force briefed the meeting on the progress in initiating construction projects, particularly low-cost housing schemes.</p>
