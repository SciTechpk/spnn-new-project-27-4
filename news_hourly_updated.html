                <h2>BLA and TTP are Indian proxies, govt will prove India‚Äôs involvement in Khuzdar bus attack: Asif</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has said that two major terrorist groups operating in Pakistan were ‚ÄúIndian proxies‚Äù, adding that Islamabad will present ‚Äúcomplete evidence‚Äù to prove New Delhi‚Äôs involvement in the attack on a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912542/pm-vows-strong-action-against-perpetrators-after-school-bus-blast-in-khuzdar">school bus</a> in Balochistan‚Äôs Khuzdar district that killed three children and injured several others.</p>
<p>At least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others ‚Äî mostly students ‚Äî sustained injuries after a bomb targeted the bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.</p>
<p>The condition of at least a dozen is said to be serious due to critical injuries, officials <a class="link--external" href="https://https:/https://www.dawn.com/news/1912542/pm-vows-strong-action-against-perpetrators-after-school-bus-blast-in-khuzdar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>, adding that at least 15 girl students were among the injured. Security forces vowed to ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357/4-students-killed-several-injured-as-school-bus-comes-under-attack-in-khuzdar-dc">relentlessly pursue</a>‚Äù the culprits of the attack as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir visited the injured in Quetta yesterday.</p>
<p>Speaking on <em>Geo News</em> programme ‚ÄòAaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath‚Äô late on Wednesday, Asif asserted there was evidence that the proscribed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) was working as an Indian proxy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will present evidence of India‚Äôs involvement. We will corroborate whatever we have claimed,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúThe relation between BLA and India is well-known as their leadership is in New Delhi. The allegation against us was unsubstantiated but BLA is fighting like an Indian proxy,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>He was referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> last month in occupied Kashmir that killed 26 people, following which India, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">without evidence</a>, had blamed Pakistan for backing the attackers.</p>
<p>Asif further said, ‚ÄúBLA and TTP are Indian proxies. They have nothing to do with religion or nationalism, India is financing them and they‚Äôre involved in bloodshed here.‚Äù</p>
<p>In reply to a question on dealing with the situation, the minister said that ‚ÄúPakistan will strike with full force and there will be no leniency‚Äù, stressing that attacking non-combatants, including school children, was unacceptable.</p>
<p>Asif said Pakistan called for an investigation into the Pahalgam attack, which India didn‚Äôt agree to, adding that the world should be informed that the Narendra Modi-led regime was ‚Äúvery irresponsible for using a false incident as a pretext to wage a nuclear war‚Äù.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan ‚Äúwill not start nuclear confrontation but cannot stay silent if nuclear devices are thrown at us‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan showed restraint, but still India attacked our bases in the dark of the night,‚Äù he highlighted.</p>

<p>A day ago, the military‚Äôs media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), also said that ‚ÄúIndian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians‚Äù.</p>
<p>It noted that India had ‚Äúfailed‚Äù against Pakistan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/india-attacks-pakistans-air-bases-pakistan-retaliates#:~:text=Force.%20Pakistan%20Zindabad.%E2%80%9D-,Operations%20commence,-At%20around%203">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a> during the recent conflict, and its [proxies] were ‚Äúbeing hunted [down] by military and law enforcement agencies‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUse of terrorism as a state policy by [the] Indian political government is abhorrent and reflective of their low morality and disregard of [sic] basic human norms,‚Äù the ISPR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPlanners, abettors and executors of this cowardly Indian-sponsored attack will be hunted down and brought to justice and [the] heinous face of India will be exposed in front of the entire world,‚Äù the military vowed.</p>

<p>On Monday, the ISPR said <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005/3-terrorists-of-indian-proxy-blf-killed-in-balochistan-engagements-ispr">12 terrorists</a> of ‚ÄúIndian proxy‚Äù outfits were killed by security forces in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.</p>
<p>Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said India was activating its ‚Äúassets‚Äù to inte¬≠nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan.</p>
<p>He had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">detailed the arrest</a> of a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India as ‚Äúirr¬≠e¬≠futable evidence‚Äù of state-sponsored terrorism directed by Ind¬≠ian military personnel.</p></p>

                <h2>Eidul Azha likely to fall on June 7: Suparco</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The festive occasion of Eidul Azha is likely to be celebrated across Pakistan on June 7, 2025, according to the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco).</p>
<p>In a statement, the commission issued a prediction regarding the sighting of the crescent moon for the month of Zilhaj 1446 AH, ‚Äúbased on scientific analysis, astronomical data, and modern observational techniques.‚Äù</p>
<p>It said according to astronomical models, the birth of the new moon for Zilhaj will occur on May 27, 2025, at 8:02pm PST.</p>
<p>The scientific analysis for May 27, 2025 (29 Ziqa‚Äôad) in Pakistan indicates the age of the moon at sunset will be approximately 11 hours and 34 minutes, it mentioned.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEven under the most optimal weather conditions, the possibility of the moon being sighted across the country is extremely low, as there will only be a 37-minute interval between sunset and moonset,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The commission said 1st Zilhaj is expected to fall on May 29. Therefore, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910869/five-temporary-sale-points-for-sacrificial-animals-planned">Eidul Azha</a> will be celebrated across Pakistan on June 7.</p>
<p>It added that the Central Ruet-e-Hilal Committee holds the final authority to confirm the moon‚Äôs sighting based on eyewitness testimonies and weather conditions.</p>
<p>Celebrated on the 10th of Zilhaj, Eidul Azha marks the culmination of Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam.</p></p>
