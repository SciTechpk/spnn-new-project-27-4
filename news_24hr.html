            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920309/sco-moot-in-china-unable-to-adopt-joint-statement-pakistan-reaffirms-commitment-to-fight-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>SCO moot in China unable to adopt joint statement; Pakistan reaffirms commitment to fight terrorism</strong></a>
            <p><p>Defence ministers attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting on Thursday failed to reach a consensus on a joint statement due to India’s refusal, while Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif reaffirmed the country’s commitment to combating terrorism and promoting regional peace and security within the SCO framework.</p>
<p>The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. Their defence ministers’ meeting was held as a precursor to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1865753">annual summit</a> of its leaders set for the autumn.</p>
<p>Addressing the session, Asif condemned Israel’s recent 12-day war against Iran and stressed the importance of collective efforts to address evolving global and regional security challenges, state broadcaster <em>PTV News</em> reported.</p>
<p>“Terrorism is a common threat. Pakistan calls on all states to desist from politicising the joint effort of the International Community to fight the means of terrorism to deflect attention from their internal failures,” the defence minister stated.</p>
<p>Noting that Pakistan denounced terrorism in all of its forms, Asif, according to <em>PTV</em>, said that the country condemned the April terrorist attack in occupied Kashmir’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam</a>, which left 26 people dead.</p>
<p>“We call upon all states to hold these states and their state actions to account who planned, financed and sponsored the terrorist attack as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897237">Jaffar Express</a> in Balochistan,” Asif added, not naming the country that aided the attack.</p>
<p>“We have in our custody … a serving Naval Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav [who] confessed to financing, planning and perpetrating multiple terrorist attacks in Pakistan.”</p>

<p>The defence minister highlighted Pakistan’s continuing role in counter-terrorism, using ongoing operations against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, the Balochistan Liberation Army and the Islamic State as an example.</p>
<p>The minister “welcomed SCO’s efforts against the ‘three evils’ — terrorism, separatism, and extremism — and emphasised the need to strengthen cooperation in cyber security, anti-narcotics, and counter-extremist ideologies”, <em>PTV’s</em> report read.</p>
<p>During his address, Asif also called for a ceasefire in Gaza and emphasised the need for a stable Afghanistan “for regional connectivity and long-term stability”.</p>
<p>However, a joint communique could not be signed by all members due to what the Indian foreign ministry deemed “a lack of consensus on referring to ‘terrorism’”.</p>
<p>“Certain members, member countries, could not reach [a] consensus on certain issues and hence the document could not be finalised on our side,” Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters at a weekly media briefing, according to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/proposal-objected-by-one-particular-country-mea-on-why-rajnath-singh-refused-to-sign-sco-statement-details/amp_articleshow/122094045.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Times of India</a></em>.</p>
<p>“India wanted concerns on terrorism reflected in the document, which was not acceptable to one particular country, and therefore, the statement was not adopted,” he said, without naming the country.</p>
<p>According to <em>The Times of India</em>, New Delhi refused to sign the document after it omitted a reference to the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>A Pakistani official at the moot, who requested anonymity, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that, “India faced diplomatic isolation at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting, where Pakistan achieved significant success.</p>
<p>“India failed to link the Pahalgam incident to Pakistan in the joint communique, declined to sign the communique to cover its embarrassment, received no support from any member state on the Pahalgam issue and also stood alone in its differing stance on Israeli aggression against Iran,” he stated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em>Reuters</em> reported that the foreign ministries of China and Pakistan did not immediately respond to a request for comment on India’s statement.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, when asked about the joint statement, a Chinese defence ministry spokesperson said the meeting had “achieved successful results”, without elaborating.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910113/world-community-hails-ceasefire-decision-between-pakistan-and-india">escalation</a> between the nuclear-armed neighbours began following the April 22 attack in Pahalgam, which killed 26 people. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.</p>
<p>Following the allegations, India launched a series of missile strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations, 24 impacts were recorded across six locations, leaving 33 Pakistani civilians dead and 76 injured. In response, Pakistan’s military shot down five Indian jets and destroyed brigade headquarters and multiple checkposts along the Line of Control.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 10, India targeted several Pakistani airbases, prompting a swift military response from Pakistan under the retaliatory campaign codenamed Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos. It took US intervention for the two countries to declare a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910060">ceasefire</a> the same day.</p>
<p>Thursday’s summit was the first time that senior ministers from India and Pakistan had shared a stage since the clash.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Finance Bill, 2025, was approved by parliament on Thursday, meaning that the Rs17.57 trillion budget for the coming fiscal year has been greenlit.</p>
<p>The PPP on Wednesday voiced strong reservations over a set of politically unpopular provisions in the federal budget for the next fiscal year, urging the government to amend “contentious” clauses ahead of its expected approval in the National Assembly today (Thursday).</p>
<p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s amendments to various legislation, including the Income Tax Ordnance, 2001, were all approved, while opposition amendments were rejected, according to a <em>Dawn.com</em> correspondent.</p>
<p>The bill was read out in the assembly and approved clause by clause. The session has been adjourned until 11am tomorrow.</p>

<p>Addressing the House, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said his party would “happily support the budget,” since the government had accepted the party’s proposals.</p>
<p>“We appreciate the government’s efforts as BISP’s (Benazir Income Support Programme) budget has been increased,” he said. “Moreover, the salaried class will not be taxed if their income equals to Rs1.2m per year and the solar tax has been reduced by 50 per cent.”</p>
<p>Bilawal added that after the PPP’s initial rejection, their recommendations regarding the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) were accepted.</p>
<p>“We are grateful to the government and the prime minister for accepting our proposals,” Bilawal said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, amendments to the Sales Tax Act, 1990, presented by Aurangzeb were approved by a majority vote in the House.</p>
<p>The amendment granted the finance committee powers to arrest traders involved in tax fraud exceeding Rs50 million. The federal government had earlier proposed an amendment to give the powers of arrest to the tax commissioner.</p>
<p>“The FBR will not have the power of arrest during the investigation stage,” the amendment added.</p>
<p>All amendments introduced by the opposition in the Sales Tax Act were rejected by majority vote.</p>
<p>Similarly, an amendment to the Salaries and Allowances Act was presented with the support of the finance minister, according to which ministers and ministers of state will receive the same salary as members of parliament.</p>
<p>The amendment was approved by a majority vote.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#107-institutions-granted-tax-exempt-status" id="107-institutions-granted-tax-exempt-status" title="Permalink"></a>107 institutions granted tax-exempt status</h2>
<p>During the session, 107 entities— including lawyers’ bodies, hospitals and government projects — were granted tax-exempt status as part of amendments to the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001.</p>
<p>The finance minister’s amendments were all approved, while those presented by the opposition were rejected.</p>
<p>According to the amendments, the following institutions and organisations are exempt from tax:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provincial bar councils</li>
<li>Pakistan Bar Council</li>
<li>The Military Foundation</li>
<li>Army Welfare Trust</li>
<li>Foundation University</li>
<li>Forman Christian College</li>
<li>LUMS</li>
<li>Ghulam Ishaq Khan University</li>
<li>FBR Foundation</li>
<li>Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital</li>
<li>The Edhi Foundation</li>
<li>Al-Shifa Trust and Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital</li>
<li>The Poverty Alleviation Fund</li>
<li>National Rural Support Programme</li>
<li>National Endowment Scholarship</li>
<li>Pakistan Agricultural Research Council</li>
<li>Audit Oversight Board</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the amended ordinance, the pensions of former presidents and their widows will also be tax-exempt.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Aurangzeb unveiled Pakistan’s annual <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292">federal budget</a> in a charged National Assembly session, outlining ambitious proposals to drive 4.2 per cent economic growth in the coming fiscal year while cutting back on overall spending and tightening tax measures.</p>
<p>The federal budget for fiscal year 2026 has a total outlay — the sum of expenditures and net lending of funds — of Rs17.573 trillion, representing a 6.9 per cent decrease from the previous year’s budget.</p>
<p>The government has proposed Rs16,286bn for current expenditure in the FY26 budget, a 5.33pc decrease from the previous year.</p>

            <p><p>Magazine legend Anna Wintour is stepping down as editor of fashion bible <em>US Vogue</em> after 37 years in the post, US media reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>British-born Wintour, 75, has been one of the most influential and formidable figures in fashion and magazine journalism for decades, famous for her ever-present sunglasses and unchanging bob haircut.</p>
<p>She was widely seen as the inspiration behind <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em>, a hit 2003 novel and 2006 movie, in which the role of a tyrannical magazine editor was played by Meryl Streep.</p>
<p>Wintour, who took the helm at <em>US Vogue</em> in 1988, announced her departure at a staff meeting, but she will stay on as group owner Conde Nast’s global chief content officer and as editorial director at <em>Vogue</em>, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://people.com/style/anna-wintour-steps-down-vogue-editor-in-chief/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">People</a></em> magazine reported.</p>
<p>Several other publications also reported this news.</p>
<p>Wintour, who held the title of Vogue’s editor-in-chief, was made a British dame in 2017 and in February this year was made a companion of honour, joining a select group never numbering more than 65 recognised for major contributions in their field.</p>
<p>At the ceremony in London in February, she removed her trademark sunglasses to receive the award and said she had told King Charles III that she had no plans to stop working.</p>
<p>Wintour, who was raised in the UK by a British father and an American mother, is described by many as the single most powerful person in the global fashion industry.</p>
<p>Her choice of covers for the monthly magazine was seen as authoritative in the publication’s heyday, and she was renowned for her strict control over content, sometimes axing work without discussion.</p>
<p>A 2015 documentary about her life pointed to her ice queen image and steely ambition, but also revealed her warmer side.</p></p>
