            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907108/cci-endorses-govt-move-to-halt-contentious-canals-project-until-mutual-understanding-among-provinces' target='_blank'><strong>CCI endorses govt move to halt contentious canals project until ‘mutual understanding’ among provinces</strong></a>
            <p><p>A meeting of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) on Monday endorsed the federal government’s move to halt the initiative of the much-contested <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897446/why-sindhs-farmers-are-up-in-arms-over-the-cholistan-canal-project">six new canals</a> on the Indus River until “mutual understanding” could be achieved among provinces in the wake of widespread blowback to the project.</p>
<p>Chief of the Army Staff Gen Asim Munir and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892222">inaugurated</a> the ambitious Cholistan project to irrigate South Punjab’s lands on February 15 amid public uproar and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889401">strong reservations</a> in Sindh.</p>
<p>After months of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1873082/sindh-erupts-in-protest-against-centres-plan-to-dig-six-canals-from-indus-river">protests</a> from various fragments of society as well as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1865042/cdwp-approval-of-punjabs-water-project-irks-sindh">opposition from Sindh</a>, the federal government on April 23 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906331/govt-agrees-to-halt-construction-of-new-canals-until-cci-consensus-amid-iwt-suspension-uncertainty">announced</a> it was halting the contentious project until a consensus on the issue could be reached in the CCI. The decision came amid uncertainty created by India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">unilateral suspension</a> of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) last week.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam and the four provincial chief ministers attended today’s CCI meeting, which was moved forward from its previous date of May 2.</p>
<p>A press release issued after the meeting said: “The CCI endorses the policy of the federal government as given below: Federal government has decided that no new canals will be built without mutual understanding from CCI. It has been decided that the federal government will not move further until mutual understanding is evolved among the provinces.”</p>
<p>The CCI also endorsed the government’s move to engage all provincial governments to chart out a long-term consensus roadmap for the development of agriculture policy and water management infrastructure across Pakistan and to form a committee with representation from the federation and all provinces to allay the concerns of all provinces and to ensure the country’s food and ecological security.</p>
<p>It added that the committee would propose solutions to Pakistan’s long-term agriculture needs and water use of all provinces in line with the Water Apportionment Accord, 1991, and Water Policy, 2018.</p>
<p>“Water is one of the most precious commodities and the makers of the Constitution recognised this, mandating all water disputes to be resolved amicably through mutual understanding and concerns of any province shall be addressed through due diligence amongst all stakeholders,” the press release said.</p>
<p>As a result, the statement said the CCI also decided that the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council’s provisional <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1812083">approval</a> dated February 7, 2024, for the construction of new canals and the Indus River System Authority’s (Irsa) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1809731">water availability certificate</a> issued in its meeting dated January 17, 2024, be returned.</p>
<p>The Planning Division and Irsa were directed to ensure consultation with all stakeholders, in the “interest of national cohesion and to address any and all concerns until mutual understanding is reached”.</p>
<p>The statement said the CCI also strongly condemned India’s “unilateral, illegal and irresponsible <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">actions</a> after the Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a>”.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>It said the CCI Council of Common Interests, while representing national aspirations, conveyed a message of unity and solidarity for the entire country and nation in the context of any “possible Indian aggression and misadventure”.</p>
<p>The CCI said Pakistan was a peaceful and responsible country that knew how to defend itself. The statement added that all provincial chief ministers also vowed to “stand shoulder to shoulder with the federal government against India’s illegal actions”.</p>
<p>Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said earlier today that the federal government convened the meeting for today. In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/sindhinfodepart/status/1916742688751132887" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> issued by his spokesperson Husain Mansoor, Memon said a decision on the canals’ matter would be made in the CCI meeting.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch    media--uneven  media--stretch">
        <div class="media__item  "><img alt="" src="https://i.dawn.com/primary/2025/04/281246517c26719.png" /></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“A decision will be made as per the discussion between [PPP Chairman] Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and the prime minister, and the issue of canals will end,” he said, referring to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906355/canals-project-placed-on-back-burner-until-consensus">Friday’s meeting</a> between the coalition allies.</p>
<p>The meeting earlier amid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906959/canal-protests-continue-to-hinder-movement-of-goods">increasing concerns</a> of traders and the business community as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905157/lawyers-start-indefinite-dharna-in-khairpur-against-canals-project">protests</a> against the project have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906219/sindh-protests-take-a-toll-on-national-supply-chain">paralysed</a> interprovincial traffic by blocking national highways in parts of Sindh.</p>

<p>The legal fraternity has been staging a sit-in at the Babarloi bypass in Sindh’s Khairpur district <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905157/lawyers-start-indefinite-dharna-in-khairpur-against-canals-project">since April 18</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Geo News</em>, Memon confirmed that the Sindh government had made the request for the meeting to be moved ahead due to the ongoing protests.</p>
<p>The minister noted that the CCI meeting was to be called on May 2, but despite that, “some groups refused to end the protests until the CCI meeting happens and its [decision’s] formal announcement” is made.</p>
<p>“In light of that, the Sindh government requested the prime minister to summon the meeting today, and it is set to take place in the evening in Islamabad,” Memon added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to a query, he said the provincial government had requested earlier as well to call the meeting “soon but considering the state of the country at the moment, it was difficult”.</p>
<p>“We had to appeal again as transport had come to a halt due to the protests, resulting in economic loss for businesses as well as farmers,” the minister stressed.</p>
<p>Asked about the Sindh government’s plan of action if the protests on highways continued even after the CCI meeting, Memon said: “We are hopeful that if we don’t give them an excuse, even though there was no excuse before either, but the government believes in dialogue.”</p>
<p>He highlighted, “The public interest is important to us at the moment as it was creating issues for the business community and the farmers.”</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/sindhinfodepart/status/1916731397793779979" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> posted by the Sindh Information Department on X today, Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar said the government acknowledged the right to peaceful protest but requested the lawyers not to create difficulties for the public.</p>
<p>He asserted that no legal action would be taken against those protesting peacefully and urged the lawyers to “keep an eye on miscreants around them”.</p>

<p>To protest the continued blockade, the All Pakistan Goods Transport Alliance (APGTA) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906959/canal-protests-continue-to-hinder-movement-of-goods">announced</a> plans to hold a demonstration outside the Sindh CM House in Karachi at 4pm today (Monday).</p>
<p>Yesterday, Nisar Jafry of the APGTA said he had received a call from Memon — also Sindh’s transport minister — requesting him to call off today’s rally with the assurance that the roads will be cleared soon.</p>
<p>Jafry said that the movement of around 30,000 trucks and oil tankers was impeded. He said that on average, one vehicle carries goods worth Rs10 million, be they meant for import, export or locally produced.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>In his statement, Memon had called on all political parties and the legal community to reopen the roads to ensure the smooth flow of goods transport, so that no one suffers any further financial or economic loss.</p>
<p>Manufacturers said they have been forced to halt production due to a shortage of raw materials, while port authorities also anticipate serious congestion.</p>
<p>The past few months have seen nationwide protests from <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1873082">political parties</a>, including the ruling <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900329">coalition ally PPP</a>, and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905158/growers-protest-in-tando-mohammad-khan">residents</a> against the proposed project. The Sindh Assembly also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897765">passed</a> a unanimous resolution against the project in March.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907158/khawaja-asif-clarifies-remarks-about-imminent-indian-military-incursion-says-words-misinterpreted' target='_blank'><strong>Khawaja Asif clarifies remarks about ‘imminent’ Indian military incursion, says words misinterpreted</strong></a>
            <p><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif clarified on Monday that his earlier remarks, which suggested an “imminent Indian military incursion” following a deadly militant attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir last week that strained bilateral relations, were misinterpreted.</p>
<p>The April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, and was one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front, said it “unequivocally” denied involvement in the attack, after an initial message that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=The%20Resistance%20Front%E2%80%99%2C%20is%20said%20to%20have%20claimed%20responsibility%20for%20the%20attack.">claimed</a> responsibility.</p>
<p>India, without offering any evidence, has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">strongly denied</a> any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a> into the incident. India’s defence forces have conducted several military exercises across the country since the attack. Since the incident, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Asif told <em>Reuters</em> in an interview at his office in Islamabad: “We have reinforced our forces because it is something which is imminent now. So, in that situation, some strategic decisions have to be taken, so those decisions have been taken.”</p>
<p>Asif said since India’s rhetoric was ramping up, the Pakistani military had briefed the government on the possibility of an Indian attack. He did not go into further details on his reasons for thinking an incursion was imminent.</p>
<p>After the Kashmir attack, India alleged that two suspected attackers were Pakistani. Islamabad has denied any role and called for a neutral investigation.</p>
<p>Asif said Pakistan was on high alert and that it would only use its arsenal of nuclear weapons if “there is a direct threat to our existence”.</p>
<p>In a separate interview on <em>Samaa TV</em> show ‘Red Line’, Asif said: “We should be mentally prepared there is a war looming on the horizon. The possibility is there, a very vivid possibility that we can have war in the next day or two or three or four.”</p>
<p>Questioned about his remarks in an interview on <em>Geo News</em>, Asif said: “I think it has been misinterpreted on some other channel, <em>Samaa</em>. I have already talked to them and I have not said anything like this. They (the channel) asked me what are the chances of war, so I said that the next two to three days were crucial.</p>
<p>“If something has to happen, then it will occur in the next two to four days … otherwise the immediate danger will pass.”</p>
<p>Asif clarified that his statement should not be misconstrued as a categorical prediction that war would begin within the next two to three days, reiterating that he had only said the “upcoming days would be crucial.”</p>
<p>He said the news channel was making the necessary corrections as well.</p>
<p>The defence minister said there was “absolutely no doubt” that danger was looming, but “I never said anything about its inevitability.”</p>
<p>Asif added that other countries in the region were working to avert any contentious situation and de-escalate the matter.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is 100 per cent ready to face any combat situation if the country’s sovereignty is threatened or war imposed on it,” he said.</p>
<p>He reiterated that he had said there was a danger of war breaking out in the next few days but it could also be averted.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907142/at-least-40-injured-in-noshki-as-oil-tanker-explodes-after-catching-fire-officials' target='_blank'><strong>At least 40 injured in Noshki as oil tanker explodes after catching fire: officials</strong></a>
            <p><p>At least 40 people were injured when an oil tanker exploded after catching fire in Balochistan’s Noshki district on Monday, officials said.</p>
<p>“The oil tanker was parked at a truck depot when it caught fire, injuring at least 40 people,” Noshki Deputy Commissioner (DC) Amjad Soomro told <em>Dawn.com</em>, adding that the fire was caused by welding work on the tanker.</p>
<p>“The fire brigade was trying to control the fire when the truck exploded,” DC Soomro said, adding that fire brigade personnel were seriously injured as a result.</p>
<p>He said that four police personnel present a the scene to move citizens away were also injured, while those near the oil tanker suffered 70 to 80 per cent burns.</p>
<p>“Those with severe burns will be shifted to Quetta via helicopter,” DC Soomro said.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media later, DC Soomro said, “The fuel tank of the tanker caught fire due to a short circuit and exploded, consequently engulfing people standing around the tanker.</p>
<p>Soomro said that 28 of the injured were undergoing treatment, while more than 10 people with minor injuries were discharged after receiving treatment.</p>
<p>“Twenty-three people with serious injuries have been moved to Quetta, where an emergency has been declared,” he said</p>
<p>In a statement, Balochistan Government Spokesperson Shahid Rind noted that over 30 people were burned in the incident.</p>
<p>“The fire was so intense it engulfed the fire brigade vehicle present at the scene,” Rind was quoted as saying. “There are reports of more than 30 people being burned in the accident.</p>
<p>“The injured are being shifted to the Civil Hospital and BMC (Bolan Medical College) after [receiving] first aid,” he said, adding that an emergency had been declared in hospitals.</p>
<p>“The incident is unfortunate … investigations are being conducted,” Rind was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti expressed sorrow over the incident and directed officials to speed up relief activities.</p>
<p>He said that the injured should be provided with immediate and quality medical facilities, stating that the provincial health minister was effectively supervising all stages of the treatment of the injured.</p>
<p>“A complete and transparent investigation into the Nushki incident has been ordered,” Bugti said.</p>
<p>The CM directed to take immediate and comprehensive steps to prevent such tragedies in the future.</p>
<p>“All possible assistance and guidance should be provided to the injured and the attendants,” he said, adding that the government would not leave the victims alone.</p>
<p>Oil tanker explosions frequently result from high-impact collisions. Beyond crashes, explosions can stem from defective fuel tanks, overloaded tanks, faulty muffler systems sparking fires, or various other issues. Given that tankers transport highly flammable or hazardous materials, accidents are not unexpected.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1838641">a man was killed while five others</a> were injured in an oil tanker explosion in Karachi’s Shireen Jinnah Colony near the terminals of the 20-bus route.  Police said some workers were welding under the oil tanker, which was empty of oil, but some gases had accumulated in it, leading to the explosion.</p>
<p>In 2017, <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/energy/oil/death-toll-in-pakistan-oil-tanker-fire-jumps-to-212/1714" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">212</a> people were killed when a tanker carrying 40,000 litres of fuel overturned after trying to make a sharp turn while travelling from Karachi to Lahore on the main highway. The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1341713">incident</a> occurred when hundreds of residents of a nearby village gathered at the site of the overturned oil tanker to collect the leaking fuel.</p>
<p>According to initial investigations, a cigarette was suspected to have caused the massive blaze that engulfed the people collecting the spilled fuel.</p></p>
