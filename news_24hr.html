            <p><p>Pakistan has officially decided to brief the United Nations Security Council on the latest situation in the region amid sky-high tensions with India, according to a statement issued by the foreign ministry on Sunday.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> on April 22 in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> as it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an incursion and India’s premier granting “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war">military</a> warning of a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907785/any-military-misadventure-by-india-will-be-met-with-swift-resolute-notch-up-response-coas">swift</a>” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907930/us-hopes-that-indias-response-to-pahalgam-attack-doesnt-lead-to-broader-regional-conflict-vance">diplomatic channels</a> have remained engaged to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has directed Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar, to take immediate steps to convene a meeting of the Security Council.</p>
<p>“Pakistan will inform the UNSC about India’s aggressive actions, provocations, and provocative statements,” the statement said.</p>
<p>“Pakistan will specifically highlight India’s illegal actions to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty,” it said, adding that the country would clarify how New Delhi’s aggressive actions are jeopardising “peace and security” in the region.</p>
<p>“This important diplomatic move is part of Pakistan’s efforts to present accurate facts to the international community.”</p>

<p>A briefing on the prevailing national security situation, delivered by the federal information minister and the military’s spokesperson, began on Sunday night, <em>DawnNewsTV</em> reported.</p>
<p>Earlier, state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/03-05-2025/info-minister-dg-ispr-to-brief-political-leadership-on-security-situation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> and <em><a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvnews/urdunewsdetail/5665" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PTV News</a></em> reported that Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Federal Information Minister Attaullah Tarar would jointly brief the top leaders of “all political parties” on the situation with India today.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>According to <em>Radio Pakistan</em>, the high-level background briefing would focus on national security in the context of Pakistan-India relations and the “implications of recent developments”.</p>
<p>“Participants will be briefed on the defensive preparedness of Pakistan’s armed forces, ongoing diplomatic efforts, and the official stance of the state on key issues,” the report read.</p>
<p><em>PTV News</em> highlighted that in the current circumstances, the briefing was a “great example of national unity, solidarity and consensus”.</p>
<p>Without <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">investigation</a>, India had accu­s­ed “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers and escalated tensions with Pak­­i­s­tan through military and diplomatic actions.</p>
<p>India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906957">cancelled visas</a> of Pak­istani travellers, held the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">Indus Water Treaty</a> in abeyance, initiated <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension#:~:text=Pakistan%20responds%20to%20unprovoked%20Indian%20firing%20on%20LoC">ski­rmi­shes</a> along the Line of Control (LoC) and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">hinted</a> at potential airstrikes.</p>
<p>Pakistan denied involvement and issued retaliatory steps.</p>

<p>The standoff, marked by exchange of fire on the LoC and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908171/pakistan-bans-all-ports-to-indian-flag-carriers-in-tit-for-tat-move">tit-for-tat actions</a>, has raised fears of broader conflict, prompting international <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907930/us-hopes-that-indias-response-to-pahalgam-attack-doesnt-lead-to-broader-regional-conflict-vance">calls for restraint</a> and renewed dialogue.</p>
<p>In the latest show of strength, Pakistan yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908176/pakistan-successfully-tests-launch-of-short-range-abdali-ballistic-missile">successfully tested</a> an improved version of its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908281/pakistan-tests-enhanced-version-of-abdali-missile">nuclear-capable</a> Abdali missile, significantly increasing its range to 450 kilometres.</p>
<p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir on Thursday asserted that any “misadventure” by India would be met with a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907785/any-military-misadventure-by-india-will-be-met-with-swift-resolute-notch-up-response-coas">swift, resolute and notch-up response</a>”. The next day, the army’s top brass also warned India of a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war">sure and decisive</a>” response should it attempt to impose war.</p>

<p>To prepare itself for any military action by India, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) has accelerated efforts to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908278/ajk-ramps-up-flour-supply-to-loc-areas-amid-tensions">replenish wheat flour stocks</a> in vulnerable areas along the LoC.</p>
<p>It is increasing reserves in forward locations to meet the needs of residents for at least two months and relocating food depots from areas exposed to potential shelling or military activity to relatively safer zones.</p>

<p>Separately, in a statement on X, PTI said its participation in the briefing was “unnecessary” as the party believed there was “no serious attempt to create a national consensus” by the government and that there was no intention to include PTI founder Imran Khan either.</p>

<p>The party said it had always unequivocally condemned every kind of terrorism in all its forms.</p>
<p>It said that the government should have immediately convened a multi-party conference, so that a common course of action could have been drawn up by taking all parties into confidence.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, the government wasted this opportunity,” the party said, adding that not only was the multi-party conference not convened, but instead, “a one-sided briefing is being given by a government minister”.</p>
<p>“Considering all these factors, the PTI political committee has unanimously decided that the party will not participate in the briefing,” the statement read.</p>

<p>As several friendly countries and global powers have been attempting to reduce Pak-India tensions, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is expected to visit Pakistan tomorrow, according to Iranian media.</p>
<p>Araghchi was expected to visit Pakistan on Monday to “discuss the recent developments at the regional and international levels”, Iran’s state news agency <em><a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85821878/Foreign-Minister-Araqchi-plans-to-visit-Pakistan-on-Monday" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IRNA</a></em> quoted Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei as saying.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>Araghchi would also pay an official visit to India later next week, the spokesperson added. Iran’s semi-official <em><a class="link--external" href="https://farsnews.ir/Qaysar/1746333274237494657/Iran's-FM-to-Visit-Pakistan%2C-India-Amid-Tensions-Between-Nuclear-Armed-Neighbours" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fars News</a></em> and <em><a class="link--external" href="https://en.mehrnews.com/news/231364/Iran-FM-Araghchi-to-travel-to-Pakistan-India-early-next-week" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mehr News Agency</a></em> also reported the same.</p>
<p>Iran on April 25 had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">offered to mediate</a> between Pakistan and India as tensions heightened in the wake of the Pahalgam attack. The next day, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906916">spoke on the phone</a> with President Masoud Pezeshkian, welcoming Iran’s readiness to calm the situation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, continuing his diplomatic engagements, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar today spoke on phone with his Malaysian counterpart, Dato Seri Mohamad Hassan, to brief him on the current regional developments.</p>
<p>FM Hasan, expressing support for Pakistan’s position, called for restraint by all parties, the Foreign Office <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1918889826188656845" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>During their call, Dar “categorically rejected India’s provocative actions, including its baseless allegations [and] inflammatory propaganda”. He termed India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">suspension</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a> “an outright violation of treaty provisions and international legal obligations”.</p>
<p>While reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and security, Dar asserted that Pakistan reserved the “right to safeguard its sovereignty and national interest”.</p>
<p>Both leaders agreed to maintain close contact on the evolving situation, the FO added.</p>
<p>Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif conveyed “serious concerns” to Malaysian Prime Minister Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim over the prevailing tensions because of India’s provocative behaviour since the Pahalgam incident.</p>
<p>During a telephone conversation with his counterpart, PM Shehbaz categorically rejected any attempts to link Pakistan to the incident, without any evidence from the Indian government and reiterated Pakistan’s offer for an international, transparent, credible and neutral investigation to ascertain the facts.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan would welcome Malaysia’s participation in this investigation.</p>
<p>While stressing that Pakistan had always condemned terrorism in all forms and manifestations, PM Shehbaz highlighted Pakistan’s role as a frontline state in the war against terror and the tremendous sacrifices of the country.</p>
<p>“India’s actions are distracting Pakistan from its counter-terrorism efforts on the western border,” he added.</p>
<p>He emphasised that it was unthinkable for Pakistan to get involved in such a controversy, particularly at a time when the country had just emerged from a “serious economic crisis and was back on the path to economic stability”.</p>
<p>The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) yesterday had called for restraint and the “urgent resumption of dialogue” between Pakistan and India to de-escalate the situation.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/OIC_OCI/status/1918407229729865760" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, the OIC General Secretariat expressed its “deep concern over the deteriorating security situation in the South Asian region”.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>“It stressed the need to resolve differences through peaceful means, in accordance with international law and the United Nations Charter, to safeguard peace, security, and stability in South Asia.”</p>
<p>The OIC recalled the decisions of the Islamic Summit and the resolutions adopted by the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers that reaffirmed the organisation’s “unwavering support for the Jammu and Kashmir question”.</p>
<p>Noting that the unresolved issue of Kashmir remained the “core challenge to lasting peace and stability in the region”, the OIC urged the international community to intensify efforts to find a peaceful resolution to it, in line with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.</p>

<p>In a statement issued today, according to <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em>, Bilawal House spokesperson Surendar Valasai condemned India’s move to block the X account of PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.</p>
<p>He described the action as a retaliatory response to the party leader’s “unequivocal and bold stance on the Pahalgam incident”.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said India’s move to block the PPP chairman’s X account proved that India was an undemocratic country and its premier was an “extremely cowardly person”.</p>
<p>Separately, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman, in reaction to the Indian step to block Bilawal’s X account, said that suppressing voices does not hide the truth.</p>
<p>She added that the Indian government should present evidence and not resort to censorship.</p>
<p>“Efforts to suppress critical voices are increasing concern not only in Pakistan but also globally,” the PPP leader said.</p>

            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump said in a television interview airing on Sunday that he does not know whether he must uphold the US Constitution.</p>
<p>He also said he is not seriously considering running for a third White House term, after musing publicly over an idea clearly barred by the nation’s founding legal document.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Trump responded when the host of <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.nbc.com/meet-the-press/video/trump-asked-if-he-has-to-uphold-the-constitution-says-i-dont-know/NBCN872645674" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NBC News</a></em> programme ‘Meet the Press’, Kristen Welker, asked directly whether he believes he needs to uphold the supreme law of the land.</p>
<p>Asked specifically whether American citizens and non-citizens alike deserve the due process of law, as the US Constitution states, Trump said: “I’m not a lawyer. I don’t know.”</p>
<p>The president’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907891/trumps-use-of-law-for-deportations-unlawful">aggressive moves</a> to deport undocumented migrants — some without the benefit of a court hearing — have drawn widespread criticism, but Trump insists it is necessary in the face of what he has declared to be a “national emergency”.</p>
<p>The suggestion of possibly seeking a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1848515#:~:text=In%20May,%20speaking%20at%20a%20National%20Rifle%20Association%20gathering,%20Trump%20quipped%20about%20serving%20more%20than%20two%20terms%20as%20president.">third term in office</a> has been sharply questioned by legal and constitutional scholars.</p>
<p>The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”</p>
<p>But Trump said in March he was “not joking” about seeking a third term, adding without elaboration that there are “methods” that would allow it to happen.</p>
<p>Changing the Constitution to allow a third term would be a heavy lift, requiring a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress and ratification by at least 38 of the 50 US state legislatures.</p>
<p>But “this is not something I’m looking to do”, Trump told <em>NBC’s</em> Welker, adding: “I’m looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody, ideally a great Republican, a great Republican to carry it forward.”</p>
<p>Asked who that might be, he mentioned Vice President JD Vance — calling him a “fantastic, brilliant guy” — and Secretary of State <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908186/now-a-trusted-ally-little-marco-gets-trumps-big-jobs">Marco Rubio</a>, while adding that “we have a lot of good people in this party.”</p></p>

<p>Rio’s civil police force said that “together with the ministry of justice”, it had “prevented a bomb attack that would have occurred at Lady Gaga’s concert in Copacabana” on Saturday night.</p>
<p>Officials said the superstar’s huge free gig on the beach, her first concert in Brazil since 2012, drew up to two million people.</p>
<p>Writing on X, Rio police said it had arrested an adult who was “responsible for the plot” as well as a teenager in the operation codenamed “Fake Monster” — a reference to the US pop diva’s pet name for her fans, “Little Monsters”.</p>
<p>It said those involved had recruited people online to “carry out attacks using improvised explosives” and Molotov cocktails as “a collective challenge with the aim of “gaining notoriety on social media”.</p>
<p>The police added that the group behind the plot “spread hate speech”, radicalised youths, and used self-harm on digital platforms as mechanisms to develop social belonging.</p>
<p>Police carried out raids across Rio de Janeiro state as well as in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso.</p>
<p>Lady Gaga’s concert was the second million-strong show on Copacabana beach in a year, after a huge concert <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1831710">last year</a> by Madonna.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#scared-sick" id="scared-sick" title="Permalink"></a>‘Scared sick’</h2>
<p>Security was extremely tight for Saturday’s show, with some 5,000 officers, drones and both surveillance and facial recognition cameras deployed.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old star’s fans reacted with shock to the news of the foiled plot.</p>
<p>“Thank god. This would have had an impact on over 2m people,” posted the LadyGagaFansTogether Instagram account, which has 307,000 followers.</p>
<p>Writing on the same account, one fan said he was “scared sick about her (Gaga) being safe at all times”.</p>
<p>The gig was part of a strategy by Rio to hold mega-concerts in May in an effort to boost tourism during what is considered the low season.</p>
<p>All week, Gaga fans had flocked to Rio, a city famous for its annual Carnival that attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists from around the world.</p>
<p>Mayor Eduardo Paes has also hinted that he plans to bring in Irish rock band U2, although no date has been given.</p>
<p>Lady Gaga had kicked off her show perched more than two metres (6.5 feet) above the stage in a massive scarlet hoop gown which opened to reveal a vertical cage from which her dancers exited to a rendition of her 2011 song “Bloody Mary”.</p>
<p>“Brazil, I missed you so much,” screamed the popstar, who performed several tracks from her latest album, “Mayhem”, as well as favourites from throughout her career.</p></p>
