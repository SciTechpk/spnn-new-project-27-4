                <h2>25 Israeli-made drones used by India in attempt to attack Pakistan, all shot down: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan‚Äôs armed forces have taken down 25 Israeli-made <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909385/all-you-need-to-know-about-israel-made-harop-drones-used-by-india-in-pakistan">Harop drones</a> sent into the country by India since last night, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A day earlier, Pakistan mourned the loss of 31 lives in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">overnight attacks</a> by Indian forces on civilians, describing New Delhi‚Äôs actions as ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù and accusing it of continuous ceasefire violations on the Line of Control (LoC).</p>
<p>The Pakistan military termed the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824#:~:text=The%20Pakistani%20military%20has%20brought%20down%20five%20Indian%20jets%20in%20retaliation%20for%20late%2Dnight%20strikes%20launched%20by%20its%20neighbouring%20country%20at%20six%20sites%2C%20including%20in%20Punjab%E2%80%99s%20Sialkot%20and%20Bahawalpur%2C%20as%20well%20as%20Azad%20Jammu%20and%20Kashmir.">downing of five Indian fighter jets</a> as a major victory ‚Äî  and it was seemingly acknowledged when Indian officials <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909047">admitted</a> that at least three of their aircraft had ‚Äúcrashed‚Äù within their territory.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, as both countries continued to trade heavy artillery fire, authorities revealed the extent of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">damage caused by Indian strikes</a> at six locations ‚Äî Ahmedpur East, Muridke, Sialkot and Shakkargarh in Punjab and Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Azad Kashmir.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Pakistan Army, using their soft-kill (technical) and hard-kill (weapons) skills fully, have shot down 25 Israeli-made Harop drones,‚Äù the ISPR said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7282" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> today.</p>
<p>Referring to Pakistan‚Äôs response to Indian strikes, the ISPR press release said: ‚ÄúAfter the destruction of its five modern jets, drones and several posts, as well as soldier deaths, India is attacking Pakistan using these Israeli-made Harop drones in panic.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis cowardly attack is a sign of India‚Äôs worry and panic,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe debris of these Israeli-made Harop drones is being collected from various locations across Pakistan,‚Äù the military‚Äôs media wing said. It asserted that the Pakistan Army was ‚Äúgiving a befitting reply to the enemy and crushing all its nefarious designs‚Äù.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Indian defence ministry <a class="link--external" href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2127670" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">admitted</a> that its armed forces targeted a number of locations in Pakistan in the morning today. Indian outlet <em><a class="link--external" href="https://aninews.in/news/national/general-news/harpy-drones-used-by-indian-military-to-target-enemy-air-defence-systems20250508154319/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ANI News</a></em> reported that Harpy drones were used by the Indian military to target Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúair defence system‚Äù. According to the <a class="link--external" href="https://dimse.info/harpy-harop/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Database of Israeli Military and Security Export</a>, the Harop is a ‚Äúlater development of the Harpy‚Äù.</p>
<p>The ministry‚Äôs statement also alleged that Pakistan had ‚Äúincreased the intensity‚Äù of firing at the LoC, where the two countries‚Äô troops have been exchanging fire for the past several days.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Harpy is designed to attack radar systems and is optimised for the suppression of enemy air defences (Sead) role. It carries a high explosive warhead,‚Äù the <em>ANI</em> report read.</p>
<p>In a press briefing early today, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said Pakistan‚Äôs forces had neutralised 12 drones sent by India since last night. He also stated that four army personnel were injured as one drone, besides those downed, managed to engage a military target partially.</p>
<p>The ISPR DG detailed the locations where 12 of those drones sent by India were neutralised ‚Äî Lahore, Attock, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi and Bahawalpur in Punjab, as well as Sukkur‚Äôs Miano, Umerkot‚Äôs Chhor and near Karachi in Sindh.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOther than these 12, one drone, however, managed to engage a military target near Lahore partially,‚Äù Lt Gen Chaudhry said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFour men of the Pakistan Army have been injured in this attack near Lahore and partial damage to an equipment has occurred,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The DG ISPR further said that as a result of India‚Äôs drone activity, one civilian embraced martyrdom and another was injured in Miano.</p>

<p>During the press briefing, the military‚Äôs media spokesman also showed a series of pictures showing the debris of the drones. He added that the debris and downed drones were being collected from multiple locations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs we speak, the process of India sending across these Harop drones, this naked aggression continues, and the armed forces are on high degree of alert and neutralising them as we speak,‚Äù he continued.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is a serious, serious provocation,‚Äù the DG ISPR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Indians have resorted to these measures after] having miserably failed on the night of May 6 and 7, when they attacked places of worship and civilian infrastructure and killed innocent civilians, including children, women and [the] elderly,‚Äù he continued.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

<p>He further said: ‚ÄúNot only that, having faced the destruction of five of their aircraft, multiple drones, and suffering heavy casualties along LoC and damage, it appears that India has apparently lost the plot.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd rather than going on a path of rationality, it is further escalating in a highly charged environment to satisfy the hubristic mindset of the Indian government,‚Äù Lt Gen Chaudhry asserted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe international community can visibly see the path that India is treading through this extremely provocative military aggression in a region, which is highly fragile and putting the security of the region and beyond at risk,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The DG ISPR added that the Pakistan armed forces remain ‚Äúfully vigilant to any type of threat‚Äù. He then repeated the details of the Indian drones downed in Urdu.</p></p>

‚Ä¢ 13 people, including two girls, martyred in Subhan mosque strike<br />
‚Ä¢ Funeral of Bahawalpur victims held at Dring Stadium</p>
<p>LAHORE: Tensions between India and Pakistan have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">intensified</a> after a series of Indian air and drone strikes resulted in the deaths of at least 31 Pakistani civilians, with many others injured, including 16 martyred only in Muridke and Bahawalpur.</p>
<p>As many as three civilians were kil¬≠led when four Indian missiles struck Jamia Masjid Ummul Qura and an ad¬≠¬≠joining house in Muridke, some 40 kilometres from Lahore. The decea¬≠sed were identified as Abdul Malik (from Jhang), Mohammad Alam (Samundri), and Midasar (Chunian).</p>
<p>Two others were injured and shif¬≠ted to local hospitals. Sources said that the area had reportedly been evacuated earlier due to warnings of a possible strike, which helped reduce further casualties. The mosque was des¬≠troyed and local authorities later arr¬≠a¬≠¬≠¬≠nged visits for both international and domestic media to inspect the site.</p>
<p><strong>Bahawalpur</strong></p>
<p>In Bahawalpur, officials confirmed that 13 civilians, including four men, seven women and two three-year-old girls, were killed in the missile strike on Subhan Mosque, located in the Chowk Azam area on the outskirts of Bahawalpur between the night of May 6 and 7.</p>
<p>The military‚Äôs media wing ISPR has yet to release an official list of the deceased. Most of the victims belonged to the same family, but they have yet to be officially identified.</p>
<p>When <em>Dawn</em> contacted the related government officials for the lists of the martyrs and injured, it was informed that the ISPR was finalising it before releasing it to the media.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>High-level visits were conducted by Corps Commander Bahawalpur Lt Gen Aqeel, Divisional Commissioner Musarrat Jabeen and Punjab Health Minister Khawaja Salman Rafique, who met with the injured at Bahawal Victoria Hospital on directives from the Punjab chief minister.</p>
<p>The targeted mosque and madressah complex are located in Azam Chowk, not in Ahmedpur East as previously speculated.</p>
<p>The madressah premises also include residences, where most of the deceased lived and were targeted by the Indian missiles.</p>
<p><em>Dawn</em> learnt that the private seminary during the last week had been evacuated by the local administration, apprehending any Indian assault on it. However, the residents of the seminary‚Äôs residential quarters and students were allowed to return just a day before the attack.</p>
<p>Witnesses reported hearing four po¬≠¬≠werful explosions that shook windows as far as Satellite Town and Ba¬≠¬≠ghdadul Jadeed Railway Station. Des¬≠pite the panic, many residents rushed towards the blast site, chanting slogans in support of the armed forces.</p>
