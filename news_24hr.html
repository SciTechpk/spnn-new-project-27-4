            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir on Monday dismissed Indian claims of Pakistan receiving external support in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent tensions with India, terming them “irresponsible and factually incorrect”.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">US-brokered ceasefire</a> for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> reported that the deputy chief of India’s army alleged last week that China gave Islamabad “live inputs” on key Indian positions during the conflict. India fought two adversaries during the conflict, with Pakistan being the “front face” while China provided “all possible support”, Lieutenant General Rahul Singh had said at a defence industry event in New Delhi.</p>
<p>“When the DGMO (director general of military operations) level talks were going on, Pakistan … said that we know that your such and such important vector is primed and it is ready for action … he was getting live inputs from China,” he said. Singh did not elaborate on how India knew about the live inputs from China.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the Inter-Services Publications said that Field Marshal Munir addressed the matter today while speaking at the National Defence University (NDU) in Islamabad.</p>
<p>He said that India’s “inability” to achieve its military objectives during Operation Sindoor and the subsequent claims signified “its lack of operational readiness and strategic foresight”.</p>
<p>“Insinuations regarding external support in Pakistan’s successful Operation Bunyanum Marsoos are irresponsible and factually incorrect and reflect a chronic reluctance to acknowledge indigenous capability and institutional resilience developed over decades of strategic prudence.</p>
<p>“Naming other states as participants in the purely bilateral military conflagration is also a shoddy attempt at playing camp politics and desperately trying that India remains the beneficiary of larger geopolitical contestation as the so-called net security provider in a region which is getting increasingly weary of its hegemonic and extremist Hindutva ideology.”</p>

<p>It further stated that “in contrast to India’s strategic behaviour resting on parochial self-alignment”, Pakistan had forged “lasting partnerships based on principled diplomacy, anchored in mutual respect and peace, establishing itself to be a stabiliser in the region”.</p>
<p>In his remarks, the army chief reiterated the country’s “principled stance”, warning that any misadventure or attempts to undermine national sovereignty or territorial integrity would be met with a “swift and resolute response”.</p>
<p>“Any attempt to target our population centres, military bases, economic hubs and ports will instantly invoke a ‘deeply hurting and more than reciprocal response’. The onus of escalation will squarely lie on the strategically blind arrogant aggressor who fails to see the grave repercussions of such provocative actions against a sovereign nuclear state,” the statement quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>“Wars are not won through media rhetoric, imported fancy hardware, or political sloganeering, but through faith, professional competence, operational clarity, institutional strength and national resolve,” the army chief concluded.</p>
<p>He lauded the armed forces and urged the graduating officers to remain steadfast in the values of integrity, selfless service, and unwavering commitment to the nation, the statement added.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Monday announced that Sweden has resumed visa services in Islamabad and Pakistani nationals will be able to apply for a Schengen visa from today onwards</p>
<p>Sweden in April 2023 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1747335">indefinitely closed</a> its embassy in Islamabad, citing the security situation as the reason. As a result, the Migration Section was unable to handle requests, nor could any documents be sent to consulates, Gerry´s, or applicants’ addresses.  “We understand that this will cause inconvenience; however, the safety of our applicants and staff members are of highest priority,” a notice placed on the embassy’s website had read at the time.</p>
<p>The embassy reopened in April this year, according to its <a class="link--external" href="https://www.swedenabroad.se/en/embassies/pakistan-islamabad/current/news/reopening-info-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>According to the FO, the Swedish and Pakistani foreign ministries held bilateral consultations in Stockholm on July 2, where the decision to resume visa services was announced by the Swedish side.</p>
<p>“Effective July 7, 2025, Pakistani nationals can apply for a Schengen visa from within Pakistan for visits to Sweden of up to 90 days,” the FO said.</p>

<p>It welcomed the positive development, saying it “reflects the strengthening of bilateral relations between the two countries”.</p>

            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump’s administration has revoked the foreign terrorist organisation designation for Al-Nusrah Front, also known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, according to a State Department memo filed on Monday, a major step as Washington moves to ease sanctions on Syria.</p>
<p>The memo dated June 23 was signed by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and was published in a preview of the Federal Register before official publication on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The move comes a week after Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921393">signed</a> an executive order terminating a US sanctions programme on Syria, to help end the country’s isolation from the international financial system and build on Washington’s pledge to help it rebuild after a devastating civil war.</p>
<p>“In consultation with the attorney general and the secretary of the Treasury, I hereby revoke the designation of Al-Nusrah Front, also known as Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (and other aliases) as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation,” Rubio wrote in the memo.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, was previously Al-Qaeda’s Syria branch. In December, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa led the HTS, which, together with other rebels, conducted a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1876908">lightning offensive</a> that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1877481">ousted</a> Syria’s former president Bashar Al-Assad.</p>
<p>Sharaa’s HTS severed Al-Qaeda ties years ago and says it wants to build an inclusive and democratic Syria.</p>
<p>Syria’s foreign ministry had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>Sharaa and Trump met in Riyadh in May, where, in a major policy shift, Trump unexpectedly announced he would lift US sanctions on Syria, prompting Washington to significantly ease its measures.</p></p>
