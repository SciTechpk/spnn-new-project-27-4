            <p><p>The federal cabinet on Wednesday marked major reforms after key decisions in strategic areas, including the approval of the National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Policy 2025.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif chaired a meeting of the federal cabinet today, which unanimously approved the National AI Policy 2025, designed to create a complete AI ecosystem in the country. The policy aims to democratise access to artificial intelligence, enhance public services and open up new employment and innovation avenues.</p>
<p>“Our youth are Pakistan’s greatest asset. Providing them with education, skills, and equal opportunities in AI is a top priority,” PM Shehbaz said.</p>
<p>The AI policy outlined training a million AI professionals by 2030, establishing an AI Innovation Fund and AI Venture Fund to boost private sector involvement, creating 50,000 AI-driven civic projects and 1,000 local AI products in the next five years.</p>
<p>It also called for the distribution of 3,000 annual AI scholarships and facilitation of 1,000 research projects, inclusion of women and individuals with disabilities through accessible education and financing, strengthening cybersecurity and national data security protocols, promoting global partnerships and compliance with international AI regulations.</p>
<p>An AI Council and a comprehensive master plan and action matrix will oversee the policy’s implementation.</p>

<p>The prime minister applauded the Ministry of IT and allied institutions for their timely efforts, saying, “AI will not only modernise our economy but also enhance productivity across agriculture, public services, and governance.”</p>

<p>The cabinet also ratified decisions made in earlier sessions of the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation and the Committee on Legislative Business held on July 8, 17, and 25, respectively.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Pakistani AI platform SOCByte <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922579">launched</a> the country’s first AI-powered cybersecurity programme designed to provide critical information to professionals.</p>
<p>In May, the Ministry of Finance <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913342">announced</a> the allocation of 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bit­coin mining and AI data centres to “transform Pak­is­tan into a global leader in digital innovation”.</p>
<p>In April, in a landmark judgement, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903685">emphasised</a> the potential of AI to streamline the judicial system, reduce delays, improve case management systems and expand legal knowledge — particularly at the district level — but urged a cautious and ethically grounded approach to its integration.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#cabinet-approves-haj-policy-2026" id="cabinet-approves-haj-policy-2026" title="Permalink"></a>Cabinet approves Haj Policy 2026</h2>
<p>The cabinet also approved next year’s Haj policy, with the prime minister also directing complete digitisation of the Haj operation beginning in 2026, ensuring transparency, efficiency and world-class services for pilgrims.</p>
<p>He emphasised that no compromise would be tolerated in providing top-tier facilities to Pakistani pilgrims. “Ensuring comfort, transparency, and timely support for every pilgrim is our foremost duty,” PM Shehbaz said.</p>
<p>The new Haj policy allocates 70 per cent quota to the government and 30pc to private operators. Notably, private companies that failed to fulfil their responsibilities in the previous year would now be required to accommodate affected individuals in 2026.</p>
<p>Moreover, the federal cabinet approved third-party validation for all Hajj operations, real-time monitoring of payments and application processes under private operators, a mandatory minimum of 2,000 pilgrims per private company, 1,000 seats reserved for hardship cases,</p>
<p>It also approved the use of enhanced digital tools, including the Pak Hajj mobile app, digital wristbands and mobile SIMs for better tracking and service delivery, transparent selection of assistants through competitive testing, emergency compensation mechanisms and upgraded lodging and food arrangements.</p>
<p>The prime minister also directed the Ministry of Information Technology to collaborate with the Ministry of Religious Affairs to ensure seamless digital transformation of the entire Hajj process.</p></p>

            <p><p>Incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s son Kasim Khan has highlighted that his father was jailed in “really poor conditions” that were “getting worse by the moment”.</p>
<p>Imran’s sons — Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim, 26 — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910789">called attention</a> to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Earlier this month, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">said</a> Sulaiman and Kasim will go to the United States before coming to Pakistan as part of a movement calling for the ex-premier’s release. The siblings visited the US and engaged US lawmakers on the issue of their father’s incarceration.</p>
<p>Imran, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a> since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.</p>
<p>In an interview on US media outlet <em>Real America’s Voice</em> shared today, Kasim said, “Right now he’s in really, really poor conditions and it looks like they’re getting worse and worse by the moment. So we’re looking for any way out possible.”</p>
<p>While emphasising that Imran was “incarcerated in a solitary confinement cell”, he said, “The state of the cell he’s in is awful, quite frankly.”</p>
<p>He continued, “He’s showering in muddy water.  I don’t mean unfiltered water. It’s muddy, dirty water,” alleging that 10 people who were incarcerated had died from filthy conditions.</p>
<p>Kasim expressed worry over not being able to see his father and said, “There were moments … he went 10 days without any light in his cell,” calling it a “torture tactic”.</p>
<p>“He gets only two hours a day in daylight. We’re not able to speak to him at all,” he added.</p>

<p>Kasim said that he and his brother were “looking to America at the moment” for support, stating, “A lot of the people here have expressed concern. It seems like it might be the only route out at the moment.”</p>
<p>Speaking about meeting US President Donald Trump’s key aide Richard Grenell, he said, “Grennell was very kind to spend some time with us.”</p>
<p>He continued, “We spoke at length and I don’t want to get into details but I’m very, very hopeful from that.”</p>
<p>He said that Imran from a prison cell won the Feb 2024 elections, which went through “vicious rigging”.</p>
<p>“[Despite] the amount of underhand tactics they used before the election to rig it against his favour, [he] still he managed to win.”</p>
<p>Separately, Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan said today that the sons would “definitely” come to Pakistan as they had a National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (Nicop) and they were “citizens of Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“If anything were to happen to Imran’s sons, it would become an international matter,” she told reporters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif remarked, “Why would the government stop Imran’s sons from coming to Pakistan?”</p>
<p>He told reporters in Islamabad that the government did not want PTI to “resort to any violence”. “The PTI will not be allowed to pull off another May 9 or Nov 26.”</p>
<p>A day earlier, PTI swiftly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927421">rubbished</a> media reports claiming that the incarcerated leader told reporters at Adiala Jail that his sons would not be coming to Pakistan and taking part in or leading any protest.</p>
<p>PTI Central Information Secretary Waqas Akram had stated: “The news circulating in the media regarding Imran Khan Sahib’s children is completely false. Imran Khan sahib has absolutely not stopped his children from coming to Pakistan.</p>
<p>“I would request those media friends who report from Adiala to only broadcast exactly what Khan sahib says. It is inappropriate to take things out of context, selectively, or to present conversations according to their own wishes.”</p></p>

            <p><p>The Pakistani veterans team advanced into the World Championship of Legends (WCL) final on Wednesday after Indian players forfeited the semi-final scheduled for Thursday.</p>
<p>The WCL is an international cricket league where retired, non-contracted international players return to competitive T20 cricket, according to the league’s <a class="link--external" href="https://edgbaston.com/wcl/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>. The tournament commenced on July 18 and is being held in Birmingham, England.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, a group match between the two teams was also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925419/pak-india-cricket-veteran-match-cancelled-after-indian-players-pull-out-of-game">cancelled</a> after Indian players, including Shikhar Dhawan, refused to play against Pakistan.</p>
<p>In a statement posted on X today, WCL organisers announced: “Taking all factors into consideration, the match between the India Champions and the Pakistan Champions has been called off. As a result, Pakistan Champions will advance to the final.”</p>

</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The WCL said it respected the India Champions’ decision to withdraw from the semi-finals and “we equally respect the Pakistan Champions’ readiness to compete”.</p>
<p>The league organisers added they believed in the power of sport to inspire and bring about positive change in the world; however, “public sentiment must always be respected — after all, everything we do is for our audience.”</p>
<p>The owner of Pakistan Champions, Kamil Khan, <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/SardarAurangzab/status/1950598154031595934" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>: “We have been given a walkover by the WCL management as their stance was that whoever does not play the semi-final, the opposition will be given a walkover.”</p>
<p>The Edgbaston Stadium management also <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/Edgbaston/status/1950603146545271080" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that the WCL event organisers had confirmed that tomorrow’s (Thursday’s) match between Pakistan and India was cancelled.</p>
<p>The management said that spectators would receive a 50 per cent refund and that the second semi-final scheduled for later in the day would go ahead as planned.</p>

<p>In May, Pakistan and India stepped back from an all-out war after a four-day military <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">confrontation</a> — the worst in decades — in the aftermath of the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> in India-occupied Kashmir. New Delhi blamed Pakistan for the attack without evidence, launching <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988">Operation Sindoor</a>. Islamabad has strongly denied the accusations.</p>
<p>During the conflict, India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908921">called</a> for a complete halt to cricketing engagements with Pakistan at any forum.</p>
<p>The recent tensions also briefly cast a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915285">shadow</a> on this year’s Asia Cup, with speculation that India would pull out of the Asia Cup. However, the two teams are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921620">due</a> to face each other in the tournament in September this year.</p>
<p>However, Indian parliamentarians have also <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ANI/status/1949869689695326600" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a> for a boycott of that match.</p></p>
