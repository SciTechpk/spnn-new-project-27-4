            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908062/un-security-council-may-meet-soon-on-india-pakistan-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>UN Security Council may meet soon on India-Pakistan tensions</strong></a>
            <p><p>UNITED NATIONS: Greece, which holds the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council, has said that a council meeting on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war">rising tensions</a> between India and Pakistan may happen “sooner rather than later”, while Pakistan indicated that it is keeping “all options” open, including raising the issue at the Security Council.</p>
<p>“All the options are [on the table], including raising it in the Security Council. We will take the decision at the appropriate time,” said Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, at a news conference at the UN headquarters on Friday. He was responding to a question from the president of the UN Correspondents Association (UNCA).</p>
<p>Ambassador Evangelos Sekeris of Greece made his remarks on Thursday while briefing UN reporters in New York on the Security Council’s work programme under Greece’s month-long presidency.</p>
<p>“We are in close contact … but this is something which might happen, I would say, sooner rather than later. We will see, we are preparing. It’s the first day of our (UNSC) presidency,” Sekeris said.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Envoy to UN says Guterres, heads of General Assembly and Security Council, OIC Group in New York have been briefed on Pakistan’s position</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He noted that a formal request had not yet been submitted but emphasised the value of such a discussion.</p>
<p>“Of course, if a request comes for a meeting, then… I think this meeting should take place because, as we said, maybe it’s also an opportunity to have views expressed and this might help to diffuse a bit tensions. We will see.”</p>
<p>Pakistan’s envoy warned that the current crisis could escalate rapidly.</p>
<p>“In this politically motivated and highly provocative environment created by India’s irresponsible and destabilising actions in the wake of the Pahalgam attack … as we speak, there is reasonable intelligence indicating towards imminent threat of kinetic action by India against Pakistan.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He said Islamabad had already briefed key international stakeholders: “We have briefed the UN Secretary-General, Presidents of the General Assembly and the Security Council, the OIC Group in New York, and fellow members of the Security Council. We have also shared our position and concerns with various other international partners.”</p>
<p>Should India initiate hostilities, he said, “Pakistan will exercise its inherent and legitimate right to self-defence, as enshrined in the UN Charter”.</p>
<p>At the same time, Ambassador Asim condemned terrorism in clear terms. “Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Nothing justifies targeting of innocent civilians. We are concerned over the loss of lives in the Pahalgam attack, and we extended our condolences.”</p>
<p>He also criticised India’s reported move to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">suspend</a> the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). “Holding of IWT in abeyance is unilateral and illegal. There are no such provisions in the Treaty. India’s unilateral and unlawful actions are bound to undermine regional peace and stability with catastrophic implications.”</p>
<p>Ambassador Sekeris acknowledged the seriousness of the situation. “I have to tell you that we are also seriously concerned with the growing bilateral tension in the atmosphere, which has been evolving between India and Pakistan.”</p>
<p>“We are also joining others who are calling for de-escalation and dialogue so that the situation does not spiral out of control,” he added, noting that larger member states were in contact with both sides.</p>
<p>On the Pahalgam incident, Sekeris said, “It’s an issue which is very pertinent. As I said before, as a position of principle, we strongly condemn any act of terrorism and this is what we did” on the “heinous terrorist attack” in Pahalgam in which innocent civilians died.</p>
<p>He added, “Both India and Pakistan are far larger than Greece. So the size and volume are of a different nature. We also join calls for de-escalation and dialogue so that the situation does not spiral out of control”.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908068/india-continues-blocking-social-media-channels-tries-to-undercut-imf-deal' target='_blank'><strong>India continues blocking social media channels; tries to undercut IMF deal</strong></a>
            <p><p>NEW DELHI: As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470">handed</a> the defence of the country back to the military and busied himself with economic management, the strategy to deal with Pakistan appeared to be shaping into an imitation of what the government does with critics at home — shutting their finances and media outlets.</p>
<p>Modi was inaugurating a port in Kerala on Friday, and mocking the opposition when the Indian government also blocked access to the official YouTube channel of Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for users in India, invoking concerns over national security and public order, Kolkata-based <em>Telegraph</em> newspaper said on Friday.</p>
<p>It said the move was part of a wider crackdown on Pakistani digital content, following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam that left 26 civilians dead, most of them tourists.</p>
<p>Users trying to access PM Shehbaz’s YouTube profile are now met with a standard message: “This content is currently unavailable in this country because of an order from the government related to national security or public order.”</p>
<p>This is the most high-profile block since similar action was taken against the YouTube channels of Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the paper said.</p>
<p>India’s ministry of information and broadcasting has invoked emergency provisions under the Information Technology Act to direct major social media platforms to geo-restrict several Pakistani accounts that were allegedly involved in spreading anti-India narratives and misinformation.</p>
<p>Officials say the restrictions are part of a “coordinated counter-disinformation effort” in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>A notable segment of the crackdown has been directed at high-profile Pakistani cricketers, whose social media accounts enjoy massive Indian viewership.</p>
<p>“The Instagram handles of current and former players including Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf have been blocked for Indian users,” according to the report.</p>
<p>Attempts to access these profiles in India, it said, now return a message stating: “Account not available in India. This is because we complied with a legal request to restrict this content.”</p>
<p>The YouTube channels of Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Akhtar, and Basit Ali have also been geo-restricted, making their content inaccessible to Indian audiences.</p>
<p>The action, officials say, is based on concerns that these public figures were either directly sharing or amplifying content that could be used to spread anti-India sentiment, particularly in the wake of the Kashmir attack.</p>
<p>Former players including Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Afridi (on Instagram) continue to have visible accounts, although, according to the report, more profiles could be under review.</p>
<p>Earlier, the YouTube channels of Shoaib Akhtar, Syed Muzammil Shah, and Arzoo Kazmi, channels such as Duniya Merey Aagay, Ghulam Nabi Madni, <em>HAQEEQAT TV</em> and <em>HAQEEQAT TV 2.0</em> were also blocked for Indian users.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Olympic javelin silver medallist Arshad Nadeem’s Instagram account has also been blocked in India. The tenth edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL), currently underway, is not being broadcast or streamed in India. Broadcasters <em>Sony Sports Network</em> and <em>FanCode</em> suspended telecast of the tournament following the Pahalgam strike, <em>The Telegraph</em> said.</p>
<p>The restrictions go beyond politics and sport. Earlier, the Instagram profiles of leading Pakistani actresses Mahira Khan and Hania Aamir were blocked for Indian users. Other celebrities, including Ali Zafar and Fawad Khan, have also faced similar action in recent days.</p>
<p>Officials in the ministry said that the government would continue to monitor and act against digital assets that pose a threat to India’s sovereignty, particularly in the context of terrorism, defence and foreign affairs.</p>
<p><strong>IMF programme</strong></p>
<p>Separately, India has also asked global multilateral agencies, including the IMF, to review funds and loans <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845536">provided</a> to Pakistan, as New Delhi seeks “to corner the neighbouring state diplomatically”.</p>
<p>“We will be asking all multilateral agencies to review the loans and support to Pakistan,” Reuters quoted a government source as saying.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Pakistan secured a $7 billion bailout programme from the IMF last  year and was granted a new $1.3 billion climate resilience loan in  March.</p>
<p>Although the IMF and India’s finance ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, an adviser to Pakistan’s finance minister said the IMF programme is  “well on track”.</p>
<p>“The latest review has been done well and we are completely on  track,” Khurram Schehzad told Reuters, adding that Pakistan had  very productive spring meetings with financial institutions in  Washington.</p>
<p>“We did about 70 meetings … interest has been very  high for investing and supporting Pakistan as the economy turns around,”  Schehzad said.</p>

            <p><p>QUETTA/KHUZDAR: Unknown armed men blocked the Quetta-Karachi Highway in the Mongochar area of Kalat district and set fire to several government buildings in the Mongochar bazaar on Friday night.</p>
<p>According to sources, a group of armed men obstructed the national highway, intercepting numerous vehicles. They searched several vehicles, including passenger buses and private cars, halting all types of traffic along the route.</p>
<p>The sources said the armed group entered the Mongochar bazaar and took control of several government buildings, including the offices of Nadra, Judicial Complex, and National Bank of Pakistan, and set them on fire. The buildings suffered significant damage due to the fire.</p>
<p>The armed men fled the scene before security forces arrived.</p>
<p>Officials said that an operation was launched in the area, and traffic on the highway was restored late in the night.</p>
<p>In a separate incident, a group of armed men on motorcycles attacked a Levies check post near Kot-Langove, opening fire and killing a Levies official, identified as Haq Nawaz Langove.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Levies officials also reported a powerful explosion under a bridge on the Quetta-Karachi National Highway near the Rahimabad area of Kalat district, which slightly damaged a portion of the bridge. No casualties were reported.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, six people, including a woman and two children, were injured in a firing at a passenger coach in the Khudkocha area of Mastung.</p>
<p>Mastung Assistant Commissioner Akram Harifal said the injured were shifted to Ghous Bakhsh Memorial Hospital.</p>
