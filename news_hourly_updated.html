                <h2>Air chief meets senior military, political leadership in landmark US visit</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakis¬≠tan Air Force (PAF) Chief Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu held a series of high-level meetings with senior military and political leadership of the United States in a landmark visit to the country, it emerged on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Last month, Field Marshal Asim Munir became the first serving chief of army staff to have a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044">face-to-face meeting</a> with a sitting US president when he met Donald Trump for talks at the White House. The occasion also marked the first time a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law. The two had discussed joint counter-terrorism efforts and expanding bilateral trade during their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093">‚Äúcordial‚Äù meeting</a> in Washington.</p>
<p>Today, PAF‚Äôs Directorate General of Public Relations (DGPR) said that in a ‚Äúsignificant development‚Äù aimed at strengthening bilateral defence cooperation and advancing mutual interests, the air chief undertook an official visit to the US, adding that it was the ‚Äúfirst by a serving PAF air chief in over a decade‚Äù.</p>
<p>It said the high-profile visit marked a ‚Äústrategic milestone‚Äù in Pakistan-US defence cooperation and ‚Äúproved instrumental in deepening institutional ties‚Äù in addition to addressing key regional and global security issues.</p>

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The DGPR said that at the Pentagon, the air chief called on US Air Force (International Affairs) Secretary Kelli L Seybolt and  Chief of Staff of the US Air Force General David W Allvin.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe discussions centred around advancing bilateral military cooperation, enhancing interoperability and exploring avenues of joint training and technology exchange. Chief of the air staff highlighted the historic and multifaceted relationship between Pakistan and US, particularly in the domains of defence and security cooperation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe reiterated his resolve to further enhance the existing ties in the realms of military-to-military cooperation and training between the air forces of the two countries. The two sides also agreed upon the continuation of high-level military engagements in future through senior-level interactions,‚Äù the DGPR said.</p>
<p>It said these interactions were deemed crucial for maintaining momentum in ongoing cooperative endeavours in the areas of joint training, operational exercises and military exchange programmes between the two nations.</p>
<p>At the US State Department, the air chief met Brown L Stanley from the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and Eric Meyer from the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs. The DGPR said the meetings served as a forum to ‚Äúunderscore Pakistan‚Äôs constructive role in promoting regional stability, its firm commitment to counter-terrorism efforts and its nuanced perspective on the evolving geopolitical dynamics of South and Central Asia‚Äù.</p>
<p>As part of his engagements at Capitol Hill, the air chief held ‚Äúsubstantive dialogues with prominent members‚Äù of the US Congress, including Mike Turner, Rich McCormick and Bill Huizenga.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese interactions reinforced the importance of robust engagement in strengthening bilateral relations and provided a valuable opportunity to share Pakistan‚Äôs views on strategic challenges, regional security frameworks and the impact of emerging technologies on defence cooperation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEmphasising Pakistan‚Äôs status as a peace-loving nation, the air chief reaffirmed the country‚Äôs enduring sacrifices and notable operational achievements in the global war on terror, while also outlining Pakistan‚Äôs evolving security calculus in response to the rapidly shifting regional geopolitical landscape.‚Äù</p>
<p>The DGPR said the ‚Äúlandmark visit‚Äù not only reaffirmed PAF‚Äôs commitment to promoting regional and global peace, but also laid the groundwork for renewed institutional collaboration, strategic dialogue and enhanced interoperability between it and the US Air Force.</p></p>

                <h2>PTI presents ‚Äòmessage of unity‚Äô, warns against toppling KP govt</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Wednesday said that the party was standing together and presenting a ‚Äúmessage of unity‚Äù amid rumours of rifts while warning the federal government against toppling the party‚Äôs Khyber Pakhtunkhwa administration.</p>
<p>Background briefings revealed a complete <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920889/lack-of-trust-sparks-fissures-within-pti#:~:text=Background%20briefings%20revealed%20a%20complete%20lack%20of%20trust%20among%20PTI%20leaders,%20with%20doubts%20about%20each%20other%E2%80%99s%20sincerity%20and%20intentions,%20particularly%20regarding%20Imran%20Khan%E2%80%99s%20messages.">lack of trust</a> among PTI leaders, with doubts about each other‚Äôs sincerity and intentions, particularly regarding messages from party founder Imran Khan, who has been behind bars since August 2023.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Islamabad and flanked by senior PTI leaders, the party chairman outlined the issues discussed in a high-level meeting and maintained that the PTI would continue efforts to try and free Imran.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe discussed the aftermath of the reserved seat ruling, which was the first time that the party formed a strategy together,‚Äù Gohar said. ‚ÄúIt is our decision that we will stand up together for Imran Khan. We have no personal conflict, we are and will remain united and a message of unity needed to be sent in today‚Äôs meeting.‚Äù</p>
<p>Gohar added that the meeting discussed Imran‚Äôs plan for the party to launch a protest movement, stating: ‚ÄúWhatever Khan <em>sahib</em> decides, we will execute it.‚Äù</p>

<p>Gohar said that PTI MNAs, MPAs and senators all attended today‚Äôs meeting, which discussed a wide range of issues from the reserved seats verdict and the party‚Äôs direction to addressing dialogue with the government.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhatever direction will be announced, you will see it in due course.‚Äù</p>
<p>Discussing the letter from jailed PTI leaders suggesting dialogue with the government, Gohar noted that the media would often infer that the government extended offers for talks, which were rejected by the PTI.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is incorrect, from the beginning, Khan <em>sahib</em> said that there should be dialogue,‚Äù Gohar said. ‚ÄúEven after our mandate was stolen, he said that. You have taken our seats, but you have registered cases against three of our MNAs, yet Khan <em>sahib</em> says that dialogue needs to be meaningful,‚Äù the party chairman added.</p>
<p>Gohar said that there was no delay on the PTI‚Äôs part, but said that the government was ‚Äúnot sincere‚Äù since it refused to grant the party access to Imran.</p>
<p>Talking about the reserved seats, he noted that there were 25 seats from KP. ‚ÄúEven if these seats go to the opposition ‚Ä¶ then they are 35 members short. We will protect the KP government at all costs,‚Äù Gohar stated. ‚ÄúThose who want to bring a no-confidence motion do not have the required numbers to move even a resolution.‚Äù</p>
<p>PTI KP President Junaid Akbar said that all of the provincial political leadership was also present at the meeting and stressed that within the party, decisions by the founder were respected by all members, with ‚Äúdiscord set to one side‚Äù.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur challenged other parties and institutions to topple the PTI‚Äôs government in KP.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf you have it in you, I challenge your strength and I challenge the state ‚Ä¶ if you are able to topple our government, then I will leave politics,‚Äù he stated.</p>

<p>He criticised the government, saying that it was a ‚Äúdisgraceful stain on the state and its institutions‚Äù within the country‚Äôs political history, but ‚Äúthey are not ashamed‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are time-tested people who have given sacrifices ‚Ä¶ So this is a challenge to your powers to try anything only without any conspiracies or unconstitutional ways. But you cannot do it. You cannot topple Khan‚Äôs people.‚Äù</p>

<p>Speaking on the Feb 8 elections, PTI Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja said that they would always be remembered as the most ‚Äúdemocratic day‚Äù in history, along with the ‚Äúattack on Pakistani people‚Äù, referring to the election results.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will continue to struggle for the public. We will succeed. Do not think that by stealing seats, suppressing the judiciary, the people will step back. We are with the people.‚Äù</p>
<p>He further said, ‚ÄúWe stand with Imran‚Äôs struggle for the public. We will continue to struggle for the public.‚Äù</p>
<p>Meanwhile, party spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram said the assembled leadership passed a unanimous resolution against the Constitutional Bench‚Äôs verdict on reserved seats and stated that the party would work to ensure the release of Imran and other jailed PTI leaders.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLegal action, peaceful protest and negotiation are steps we are willing to take,‚Äù Akram said, quoting the resolution. He too said the party was united under Imran‚Äôs leadership and would remain so.</p></p>
