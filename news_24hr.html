            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday expressed his willingness to talk with India to resolve ongoing disputes between the two countries, including the Kashmir issue and water security, during his visit to Iran.</p>
<p>The PM is currently on a four-nation tour to friendly countries, where he will express his gratitude for supporting Pakistan during the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military escalation</a> with India.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, PM Shehbaz was received Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian at Saadabad Palace in the Iranian capital, where he received a guard of honour.</p>

<p>Addressing a joint press conference with Iranian President Masood Pezeshkian, PM Shehbaz said that the two countries’ delegations had a “very productive and useful meeting … which covered all areas of our mutual interests and cooperation”.</p>
<p>“There was total agreement that our two brotherly and neighbourly countries must enhance our cooperation in the field of trade, investments, commerce, in fact, every walk of life,” he said.</p>
<p>The prime minister said that he thanked Pezeshkian for his support during the military conflict with India and emphasised that both nations have deep-rooted cultural ties and historical relations, adding that they decided to turn these relations into a “very productive cooperation in various fields of life”.</p>
<p>“My dear brother, I dearly appreciate your sense of concern and brotherly feelings for the people of Pakistan and your ardent desire that this crisis comes to a grinding halt before it, God forbid, escalates,” Shehbaz said, addressing the Iranian president.</p>

<p>The PM also lauded Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi for visiting Pakistan during the military escalation, calling him an “outstanding diplomat” and stating that they had a “heart to heart discussion”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan came out of this conflict victorious … through our brave actions by our outstanding armed forces,” Shehbaz said.</p>
<p>“We wanted peace, we want peace and we will work for peace in the region through talks on the table and resolve our outstanding issues, including the Kashmir problem, according to the resolutions passed by the [United Nations] Security Council … and even by Indian Lok Sabha (parliament) back in 1954,” he added, speaking about when then-prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru committed to a plebiscite in the disputed territory.</p>

<p>“But if they choose to remain aggressors, then we shall defend our territory … like we have done a few days ago,” he added. “But if they accept my offer of peace, then we will show that we really want peace, seriously and sincerely.”</p>
<p>Later on Monday, the PM visited Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, according to <em>PTV News</em>.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister briefed [Khamenei] about recent conflict with India and … profusely thanked [the] leadership of Iran for supporting Pakistan against Indian aggression,” the broadcaster wrote in a post on X. “The Prime Minister underlined that Pakistan always desired that peace could prevail in the region, leading to economic development and prosperity.”</p>
<p><em>PTV News</em> added that Khameini appreciated PM Shehbaz’s efforts in “promoting regional peace and stability with farsightedness” and praised his personal commitment to further strengthening ties between both nations.</p>

            <p><p>PTI officials on Monday announced that the party will launch a “countrywide movement” and urged party members and supporters to get ready, though no date was announced.</p>
<p>Party founder and ex-premier Imran Khan has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1778114">imprisoned</a> at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail for over two years upon his conviction in four cases — two Toshakhana references, the cipher case, and the Iddat case, in which his wife, Bushra Bibi, is also jailed.</p>
<p>The party has since launched several mass protests demanding his release, notably a march to Islamabad on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875003/day-of-islamabad-clashes-ends-in-pti-protesters-retreat">November 26</a>, 2024, where a day of pitched battles between security forces and PTI protesters ended in a hasty retreat of the party’s top leadership and supporters from the Red Zone.</p>
<p>In a post on X, PTI Senator Ali Zafar wrote that the party would be mobilising nationwide after having a six-hour discussion with the ex-premier today.</p>
<p>“Some very important matters were discussed. Amongst them was a countrywide movement for which the party should prepare and be well-organised,” the senator wrote.</p>
<p>Zafar warned that according to Imran, “there is no room for anyone in PTI to play both sides, and everyone must stand united for the cause of truth and justice.”</p>
<p>Quoting Imran, Zafar wrote, “I am bearing all the hardship in jail for the sake of the nation, and PTI leadership should not be scared of sacrifice.”</p>
<p>He did not give a date for when this movement is set to take place.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum also spoke to reporters outside the Adiala Jail about the mass mobilisation, though she too did not give a date for when the movement would take place.</p>
<p>“Imran Khan issued instructions to get the party ready,” Aleema said. “He said ‘I will not call anybody to Islamabad, since they (authorities) sit with sniper rifles and people get shot … it brings me great pain, I will not do this.’</p>
<p>“Imran Khan has said that the party should get ready, as he will announce a mass movement across Pakistan soon,” she added.</p>

            <p><p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari assailed the PTI-run Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Monday for its “harsh police response” to a protest by PPP workers and supporters in Peshawar against corruption, calling out the administration’s “cowardice”.</p>
<p>PPP protesters on Monday staged a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PPPKP_Official/status/1927005565844111628" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">protest</a> in Peshawar against corruption in the province. In a statement <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PPP_Org/status/1927040753244533008" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on X, the party alleged that the protesters faced shelling and violence at the hands of the police.</p>
<p>In response to the situation, Bilawal took to X and posted a statement calling out the KP government, stating that they had “demonstrated cowardice” by attacking unarmed party workers.</p>

<p>PPP Senator Saleem Mandviwala also condemned the alleged incident in the statement. He was quoted as saying, “The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government tried to cover up its failures by suppressing public protests with force.”</p>
<p>He added, “Shelling and violence against peaceful activists shows the government’s desperation.</p>
<p>“PPP workers are certainly unarmed and peaceful, but they are not helpless. Every attempt to suppress our voice will fail.”</p>
<p>Last week, PPP expressed serious concern about the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905556">reports</a> of massive <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891133/probe-begins-into-graft-allegations-against-pti-lawmakers">corruption</a> in KP and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912037">announced</a> to hold a protest rally against the provincial government on May 26.</p>
<p>The party’s provincial president Mohammad Ali Shah Bacha had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910421">accused</a> the PTI government of widespread corruption and administrative collapse in the province.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#pti-protest-fails-due-to-low-attendance" id="pti-protest-fails-due-to-low-attendance" title="Permalink"></a>PTI protest fails due to low attendance</h2>
<p>Separately, PTI provincial president and MNA Junaid Akbar Khan expressed anger over the “failure” of the party’s protest in Peshawar.</p>
<p>The protest was <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTIKPOfficial/status/1926992348954644564" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">staged</a> against drone strikes in the tribal districts of KP, the party wrote on X.</p>
<p>However, it ended shortly due to the low attendance of party workers, MNAs and MPAs.</p>
<p>No MPAs from Nowshera and Mohmand districts participated in the protest. Only MPA Arif Ahmad Zai from Charsadda attended the protest.</p>
<p>The provincial president was also angry when the workers and supporters did not come out in large numbers.</p>
<p>Due to a low number of protesters, Akbar left without making a speech.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Akbar handed over his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910779">resignation</a> as the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to the party. The development came after PTI founding chairman Imran Khan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910714">directed</a> Akbar to resign from the position and focus on provincial matters.</p></p>
