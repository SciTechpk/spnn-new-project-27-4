            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911867/ceasefire-has-no-expiry-date-officials-say' target='_blank'><strong>Ceasefire has no expiry date, officials say</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Diplomat says military dialogue aimed at making truce ‘sustainable’<br />
• ISPR DG believes ceasefire can ‘hold easily’<br />
• Confirms CBMs from both sides<br />
• Says Indian policy on Kashmir not working</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> reached between Pakistan and India following days of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military confrontation</a> does not have an expiry date, officials from both countries confirmed, putting to rest the speculations that the truce would lapse this weekend unless renewed.</p>
<p>Rumours of a Sunday deadline gained traction after Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Pakistan’s Senate last Thursday that the directors general of military operations (DGMOs) from both sides had agreed during a May 14 conversation to extend the ceasefire <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911216">until May 18</a>.</p>
<p>Media outlets then widely reported that the ceasefire was set to expire. However, officials from both sides clarified on Sunday that no DGMO talks were scheduled for the day and that the ceasefire, originally brokered through intensive US diplomacy, remained in force without a set end date.</p>
<p>“There is no expiry date to the break in hostilities, as reaffirmed in the DGMOs interaction of May 12,” an Indian official said, countering speculations of an imminent breakdown.</p>
<p>There was no official statement from the Pakistan Army, but a diplomat on the condition of anonymity said the ceasefire remained in effect and carried no set time frame for expiration. He said the discussions of the DGMOs were aimed at “making the ceasefire sustainable”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The May 10 ceasefire came after the most serious escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours in over two decades, with cross-LoC shelling, drone incursions, and air force strikes pushing both sides to the brink. The United States, led by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, played a key role in mediating the truce, with support from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Initial violations were reported on the day following the ceasefire. But since then, military commanders have engaged in constructive dialogue. The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1910624">May 12 call</a> between Pakistan’s Maj Gen Kashif Abdullah and India’s Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai focused on reinforcing mutual commitments to avoid any aggressive or hostile actions, officials said.</p>
<p>In that conversation, the two sides had agreed to begin a phased reduction of forward deployments and regular troops along the international border, restoring the usual peacetime arrangement where the border is manned primarily by Pakistan’s Rangers and India’s Border Security Force.</p>
<p>Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said both DGMOs “have maintained periodic contact since May 10” and agreed to develop a structured mechanism for de-escalation.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>While Islamabad views the ceasefire as a potential stepping stone toward broader peace talks on long-standing issues like the Kashmir dispute and water rights, India has taken a more rigid stance.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the ceasefire as a “temporary pause,” and Defence Minister Rajnath  Singh declared that “Operation Sindoor is not over yet … Pakistan is on probation”.</p>
<p><strong>‘Ceasefire will hold easily’</strong></p>
<p>In comments underscoring Pakistan’s stance, military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry told <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/2601190/pakistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Arab News</a></em> that the ceasefire was holding.</p>
<p>The DG ISPR also reiterated Pakistan’s longstanding position on Kashmir, warning that the dispute remains a flashpoint unless resolved through dialogue.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“As far as Pakistan army is concerned, this ceasefire will hold easily and there have been confidence-building measures in communication between both the sides,” he said.</p>
<p>“If any violation occurs, our response is always there … but it is only directed at those posts and those positions from where the violations of the ceasefire happen. We never target civilians. We never target any civil infrastructure.”</p>
<p><strong>Conflict potential persists</strong></p>
<p>On a separate, the Pakistani military spokesman also warned of far-reaching consequences if India attempts to follow through on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911383">threats to cut Islamabad’s share</a> of the Indus River water system.</p>
<p>Last month, New Delhi unilaterally suspended the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">1960 Indus Waters Treaty</a>, blaming Pakistan for a deadly militant attack in Indian-Occupied Kashmir, an allegation Pakistan denies.</p>
<p>“Their policy on Kashmir — of oppression and trying to internalise it — is not working,” he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Till the time Indians don’t sit and talk about Kashmir, then (as) two countries sit, and we find a solution to it, the conflict potential is there.” “I hope that time doesn’t come, but it will be such actions that the world will see and the consequences of that we will fight for years and decades to come,” the army spokesperson said. “Nobody dares stop water from Pakistan.”</p>
<p>The waters treaty, brokered by the World Bank, has survived multiple wars between the two neighbours and is considered one of the most successful water-sharing agreements globally. Its potential unravelling adds a dangerous new tier to an already volatile regional equation.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911866/questions-raised-over-rs22bn-vehicle-spending-in-fbr-reforms' target='_blank'><strong>Questions raised over Rs2.2bn vehicle spending in FBR reforms</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Planning Commission urges review of expenditure amid austerity measures<br />
• FBR defends procurement of 179 vehicles, says it’s essential to operational needs across terrains</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: The Planning Commission has raised concerns over the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1888804/purchase-of-over-1000-vehicles-for-fbr-stopped-senate-panel-told">procurement of 179 vehicles</a>, including 15 fully bulletproof units, under the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) Rs41 billion Revenue Raises Project, urging a review of the Rs2.237bn expenditure in light of the Finance Division’s austerity measures.</p>
<p>Funded by a $150 million World Bank loan at an annual interest rate of 2.5 per cent over 30 years, the project is a cornerstone of the Prime Minister’s FBR transformation plan. Despite its strong economic indicators — boasting benefit-cost ratios of 42 to 70 and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 130pc to 195pc — the Planning Commission flagged lax scrutiny in its implementation, particularly regarding vehicle procurement.</p>
<p>“An amount of Rs2,237.5m has been proposed for procurement of 179 vehicles of different makes at a unit cost of Rs12.5m for Digital Enforcement Units without provision of specifications of vehicles,” the Planning Commission pointed out and demanded its rationalisation “in light of austerity measures of Finance Division”.</p>
<p>The FBR, however, defended the procurement, claiming it was essential to operational needs across varied terrains, where the digital enforcement stations would be established.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“The proposed vehicles represent the minimum essential specifications necessary for effective field operations, with no inclusion of luxury features. The selection strictly adheres to functional utility for anti-smuggling activities,” the revenue authority said. The project is expected to be completed in June 2027.</p>
<p>The estimated cost savings from the project’s investments in information communication technology (ICT) hardware, taking into account the project’s investment in the new equipment and the associated operational and maintenance costs, would have been estimated at $100m in nominal terms.</p>
<p>This investment in FBR’s data centre and network equipment has been described as unavoidable in averting the failure of the organisation’s ICT systems. “If the FBR does not invest in these upgrades soon, it will incur costs of around $200m to rebuild the data centres,” the FBR advocated.</p>
<p>The Planning Commission noted that the end-of-period target for time spent on customs clearance at the border is set at 48.5 hours against the baseline of 97.5 hours. It said the project’s benefit-cost ratio ranges from 42 to 70, and the internal rate of return from 130pc to 195pc.</p>
<p>The programme, originally envisaged in 2017, aims to achieve a 17pc tax-to-GDP ratio, which still struggles at about 10pc — well below the Asia-Pacific average of 19.3pc.</p>
<p>The change in the base year of national accounts will further reduce Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio. Some studies observed that 64pc of economic activities are undocumented, leading to a loss of billions of rupees in tax collection, the Planning Commission observed, adding that the country’s tax system was overregulated, with the large number of taxes stifling businesses.</p>
<p>“The cost of documentation of tax compliance even for a small business is around Rs250,000,” the Planning Commission said and noted that cash circulation in Pakistan was 28pc compared to 18pc in India and 17pc in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The Planning Commission called for reforms aimed at simplifying tax procedures, reducing the number of levies, and accelerating the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1876817">digitisation of the tax system</a> to integrate it with broader economic activity.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The project also envisages mobile tax facilitation services, initiatives for improved taxpayer compliance, establishing a forum for technical consultations with provincial tax authorities on tax harmonisation, staff capacity-building, bac­k­up power equipment upgradation, and control rooms and monitoring systems.</p>
<p>The FBR has recently adopted Strategic Plans for the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) and Pakistan Customs. Key components of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1863314">transformation plan</a> include value chains’ digital transformation, introduction of tracking technology, implementation support for digital transformation, and value chain implementation support.</p>
<p>In addition, 37 digital enforcement stations will be equipped with hard and soft interventions to counter smuggling.</p>
<p>Out of these 37 stations, 24 will be established on the Indus and Hub rivers and surrounding areas to work as a protective wall, supported by three mobile enforcement units. Additionally, 10 stations will be set up at strategically located checkpoints in Balochistan.</p>
<p>The Customs Tracking System will be integrated with existing databases, which would be important in identifying and targeting people or vehicles involved in transporting smuggled goods on which duties and taxes have not been paid.</p>
<p>The FBR expects its reform efforts to generate an additional $81bn by the end of fiscal year 2028-29. The project also covers replacement of end-of-life ICT equipment, cloud infrastructure, updated software licences, data warehousing, business intelligence tools, and complete LAN and VoIP connectivity for field offices.</p>
<p>As part of the Rs2.237bn allocation, the FBR will also procure 350 bulletproof jackets and helmets for operational personnel.</p>
<p>The tax authority defended its expanded resource needs by pointing to a fourfold increase in the number of tax filers, from 1.5m in 2017 to over 6m by the end of June 2024. It also cited the growing volume of third-party data being gathered to broaden the tax base and identify defaulters.</p>

            <p><p>The Supreme Court will resume hearing today an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1747988/noor-mukadam-murder-zahir-jaffar-approaches-sc-against-ihc-verdict-upholding-death-sentence">appeal</a> against the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer, the main suspect in the gruesome <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636267">murder</a> of Noor Mukadam.</p>
<p>Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636764">tortured</a> before being beheaded. Zahir’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810">death sentence</a> by the trial court was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1741974">upheld</a> by the Islamabad High Court (IHC), which had also turned his jail term over rape charges into a second death penalty.</p>
<p>Justice Hashim Kakar would lead the three-member bench, which includes Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/3  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The appeals of the convicted co-accused in the case would be taken up as well. An appeal by Noor’s father, retired diplomat Shaukat Mukadam, against the acquittal of Zahir’s father, Zakir Jaffer, is also among the pleas being heard.</p>
<p>In October last year, Noor’s father had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867225">urged the SC</a> to take up the murder case pending for more than one and a half years in the top court.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#case-history" id="case-history" title="Permalink"></a>Case history</h2>
<p>Noor, 27, was found <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636267">murdered</a> at a residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4 on July 20, 2021. A first information report (FIR) was registered later the same day against Zahir Jaffer, who was arrested at the site of the murder.</p>
<p>In February 2022, a district and sessions judge <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810">sentenced Jaffer to death</a> for the murder and handed him 25 years of rigorous imprisonment, finding him guilty of rape. His household staff, Mohammad Iftikhar and Jan Mohammad — co-accused in the case — were each sentenced to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>Zahir’s parents, leading businessman Zakir Jaffer and Asmat Adamji, had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1651981">indicted</a> by an Islamabad district and sessions court in October 2021 but were later <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810">acquitted</a> by the court.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1640810/noor-mukadam-murder-therapyworks-owner-5-employees-remanded-in-day-long-physical-custody">Six officials</a> of Therapy Works, whose employees had visited the site of the murder before police, were also among those indicted by the lower court but were later freed of the charges along with the parents. According to the challan, the parents and the therapy workers tried to conceal the crime and attempted to destroy the evidence.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In March 2023, the IHC, dismissing the Zahir’s <a class="link--external" href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2348054/zahir-jaffer-moves-ihc-challenging-death-sentence-in-noor-case" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appeal</a>, not only <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1741974">upheld the death sentence</a> but also converted his 25-year jail term into another death penalty. The IHC had also rejected the pleas of the main suspect’s staff challenging their conviction.</p>
<p>The next month, Zahir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1747988/noor-mukadam-murder-zahir-jaffar-approaches-sc-against-ihc-verdict-upholding-death-sentence">approached the SC</a> against the IHC verdict, insisting that his conviction resulted from “erroneous appreciation” of the case evidence and the high court and trial court could not identify the “fundamental flaws” in the FIR.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#the-murder" id="the-murder" title="Permalink"></a>The murder</h2>
<p>After an FIR was registered in the case and Zahir was arrested, his parents and household staff were also taken into custody by police on July 24, 2021 over allegations of “hiding evidence and being complicit in the crime”. They were made a part of the investigation based on the statement of Noor’s father.</p>
<p>In his complaint, Shaukat had stated that he had gone to Rawalpindi on July 19 to buy a goat for Eidul Azha, while his wife had gone out to pick up clothes from her tailor. When he had returned home in the evening, the couple found their daughter Noor absent from their house in Islamabad.</p>
<p>They had found her cellphone number switched off and started a search for her. Sometime later, Noor had called her parents to inform them that she was travelling to Lahore with some friends and would return in a day or two, according to the FIR.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The complainant said he had later received a call from Zahir, whose family were their acquaintances. Zahir had informed Shaukat that Noor was not with him, the FIR said.</p>
<p>At around 10pm on July 20, the victim’s father had received a call from Kohsar police station, informing him that Noor had been murdered.</p>
<p>Police had subsequently taken the complainant to Zahir’s house in Sector F-7/4 where he discovered that his “daughter has been brutally murdered with a sharp-edged weapon and beheaded”, according to the FIR.</p>
<p>Shaukat, who identified his daughter’s body, had sought the maximum punishment under the law against Zahir for allegedly murdering his daughter.</p>
<p>Police later said that Zahir had confessed to killing Noor, while his DNA test and fingerprints also showed his involvement in the murder.</p>
