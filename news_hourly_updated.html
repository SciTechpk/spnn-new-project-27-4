                <h2>Govt allocates 2,000MW for Bitcoin mining and AI data centres</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>In a groundbreaking move to transform Pakistan into a global leader in digital innovation, the government has announced the allocation of 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the first phase of a national initiative to power Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.</p>
<p>The government recently decided to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899163">legalise</a> cryptocurrency to lure international investment in Pakistan. The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) was launched in March to ‚Äúregulate and integrate blockchain technology and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912539/govt-sets-up-digital-assets-authority-as-per-fatf-requirement">digital assets</a>‚Äù into the country‚Äôs financial landscape.</p>
<p>The federal government appointed entrepreneur <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895975">Bilal Bin Saqib</a> as the chief adviser to the finance minister on the council.</p>
<p>A statement by the Finance Division says this ambitious initiative is spearheaded by the PCC ‚Äî a government-backed body under the Ministry of Finance ‚Äî as part of a broader strategy to ‚Äúmonetise surplus electricity, create high-tech jobs, attract billions of dollars in foreign direct investment, and generate billions of dollars for the government‚Äù.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb stated that this strategic allocation marks a pivotal moment in Pakistan‚Äôs digital transformation journey, unlocking economic potential by turning excess energy into innovation, investment, and international revenue.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan is uniquely positioned ‚Äî both geographically and economically ‚Äî to become a global hub for data centres. As a digital bridge between Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, Pakistan offers the most strategic location in the world for data flow and digital infrastructure,‚Äù the statement says.</p>
<p>It said that since the inception of the PCC, there has been tremendous interest from global Bitcoin miners and data infrastructure companies. Several international firms have already visited the country for exploratory discussions, and following this landmark announcement, more global players are expected to visit in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan‚Äôs underutilised power generation capacity is now being repurposed into a high-value digital asset. AI data centres and Bitcoin mining operations, known for their consistent and heavy energy usage, provide an ideal use case for this surplus.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRedirecting idle energy, especially from plants operating below capacity, allows Pakistan to convert a long-standing financial liability into a sustainable, revenue-generating opportunity,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>PCC CEO Bilal Bin Saqib emphasised the transformative nature of this initiative and explained that with proper regulation, transparency, and international collaboration, Pakistan can become a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1609742">global crypto</a> and AI powerhouse.</p>
<p>Saqib said that this energy-backed digital transformation not only unlocks high-value investment but enables the government to generate foreign exchange in US dollars through Bitcoin mining.</p>
<p>Additionally, as regulations evolve, Pakistan can accumulate Bitcoin directly into a national wallet ‚Äî marking a monumental shift from selling power in Pakistani rupees to leveraging digital assets for economic stability.</p>
<p>By offering stable and affordable energy, the statement said Pakistan presents a highly competitive environment compared to regional counterparts like India and Singapore, where rising power costs and land scarcity limit scalability.</p>
<p>Pakistan‚Äôs strategic advantage is further underscored by the global context as while AI data centre demand has soared to over 100 gigawatts (GW), the global supply remains around 15GW. This massive shortfall creates an unprecedented opportunity for countries like Pakistan with surplus power, land and an emerging regulatory framework, it added.</p>
<p>The statement further said the country‚Äôs digital connectivity has also been significantly strengthened by the landing of the world‚Äôs largest submarine internet cable. The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893743">Africa-2 Cable Project</a>, a 45,000-kilometre global network connecting 33 countries through 46 landing stations, has now landed in Pakistan.</p>
<p>This milestone enhances Pakistan‚Äôs internet bandwidth, latency and resilience through redundant fiber routes ‚Äî key for ensuring high availability and operational continuity for AI data centres.</p>
<p>With more than 40 million crypto users, Pakistan holds immense potential as a regional leader in digital services. Establishing local AI data centres will not only address growing concerns around data sovereignty but will also enhance cybersecurity, improve digital service delivery, and empower national capabilities in AI and cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>These centres are expected to create thousands of direct and indirect jobs, catalysing the development of a skilled workforce in engineering, IT, and data sciences.</p>
<p>The statement adds that this announcement marks only the first phase of a broader, multi-stage digital infrastructure rollout. Future developments are expected to include renewable energy-powered facilities ‚Äî leveraging Pakistan‚Äôs immense <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1861999">wind</a> (50,000MW potential in the Gharo-Keti Bandar corridor), solar, and hydropower resources ‚Äî as well as strategic international partnerships with leading blockchain and AI companies, and the establishment of fintech and innovation hubs.</p>
<p>These efforts will be complemented by proposed incentives such as tax holidays, customs duty exemptions on equipment, and reduced taxes for AI infrastructure developers, it added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan‚Äôs combination of surplus power, geographic advantage, advanced subsea cable connectivity, renewable energy potential, and a large, digitally engaged population creates a compelling case for becoming a regional epicentre of Web3, AI, and digital innovation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith the right incentives, strategic investments, and collaborative partnerships, Pakistan is positioning itself not only as a destination for global digital infrastructure but also as a sovereign economy that can accumulate digital assets, export digital services, and lead in the next generation of technological transformation.‚Äù</p></p>

                <h2>PM Shehbaz departs for Turkiye on first leg of four-nation regional outreach tour</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif departed for Turkiye from Lahore on Sunday afternoon as he embarked on the first leg of his four-nation tour aimed at strengthening ties with the friendly countries.</p>
<p>The premier will visit Turkiye, Iran, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan from May 25-30, according to the <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/curtain-raiser-prime-ministers-visit-to-turkiye-iran-azerbaijan-and-tajikistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Foreign Office</a>. The tour follows diplomatic support voiced by three of these countries for Pakistan during the recent military confrontation with India.</p>
<p>The prime minister is accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi, state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/25-05-2025/pm-leaves-for-turkiye-on-first-leg-of-four-nation-tour" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> reported.</p>

<p>During the visit, PM Shehbaz will have ‚Äúwide-ranging discussions with the leaders of these countries on an entire range of issues covering bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance‚Äù, according to the FO.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe will also have the opportunity to express the deepest appreciation and acknowledgement for the support extended to Pakistan by the friendly countries during the recent crisis with India,‚Äù it noted.</p>
<p>Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan will hold talks with PM Shehbaz in Istanbul later today, <em>Reuters</em> reported, citing Erdogan‚Äôs head of communications.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring the meeting, bilateral relations, regional and international issues, including the fight against terrorism, will be discussed,‚Äù Fahrettin Altun <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/fahrettinaltun/status/1926561438107107658" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on X</a>.</p>
<p>Altun said ‚Äúvarious aspects of bilateral relations between Turkiye and Pakistan will be evaluated‚Äù, according to a Google translation of his post.</p>
<p>Joint steps taken within the scope of the Pakistan-Turkiye High Level Strategic Cooperation Council as per the two leaders‚Äô <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891812">last meeting</a> in February will be reviewed, the Turkish official said.</p>
<p>While in Tajikistan ‚Äî likely the last leg of his tour ‚Äî the premier will also attend the International Conference on Glaciers being held in its capital, Dushanbe, on May 29 and 30.</p>
<p>As tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi escalated, with India launching deadly strikes on Pakistan on May 6, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909193/erdogan-conveys-turkiyes-solidarity-to-pm-shehbaz-amid-india-escalation">conveyed his solidarity</a> to the prime minister and said it supported Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúcalm and restrained policies‚Äù.</p>
<p>Following the tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">airbase attacks</a> and a US-brokered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> between the two neighbours, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev had ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911194/azerbaijan-hails-pakistans-remarkable-success-during-recent-military-strife-with-india-pmo">warmly congratulated</a> PM Shehbaz upon Pakistan‚Äôs remarkable success‚Äù, according to the PM Office.</p>
<p>Iran had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">offered to mediate</a> during the escalation and paid a visit to both <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">Islamabad</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909355/irans-foreign-minister-repeats-call-for-restraint-in-india-pakistan-standoff">New Delhi</a> in peace efforts, which were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911597">appreciated</a> by PM Shehbaz and the military‚Äôs spokesperson.</p>

<p>The diplomatic support voiced by Turkiye and Azerbaijan stoked anger in India as people <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cancelled their holidays</a> in popular resorts in the two countries.</p>
<p>The moves <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911469">intensified</a> as Adani group-operated Mumbai and Ahmedabad airports ended the ground handling concession agreements with √áelebi, an Istanbul-headquartered airport.</p>
<p>Small Indian grocery shops and major online fashion retailers also began a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912015">boycott of Turkish products</a> ranging from chocolates, coffee, jams and cosmetics to clothing.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz‚Äôs tour adds to Pakistan‚Äôs spree of diplomatic engagement amid tensions with New Delhi.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Dar held a telephonic conversation with Uzbekistan Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov, where views were ‚Äúexchanged on current regional situation‚Äù.</p>
<p>The two leaders discussed existing bilateral relations, particularly the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894417/pakistan-and-uzbekistan-agree-to-expand-bilateral-trade-to-2bn#:~:text=%E2%80%98Detailed%20negotiations%E2%80%99%20held%20on%20joint%20railway%20project">Railway Line Project</a>, the FO <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1926519844997927089" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>
