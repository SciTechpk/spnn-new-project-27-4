                <h2>11 suspects arrested in Balochistan couple‚Äôs killing, case transferred to serious crimes wing: police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least 11 suspects, including a tribal leader, have been arrested for their alleged involvement in the killing of a man and a woman in Balochistan after a video of the murder went viral on social media, with the case now handed over to the Serious Crimes Investigation Wing (SCIW), police said.</p>
<p>Superintendent of Police (SP) SCIW Syed Saboor Agha told <em>Dawn.com</em>, ‚ÄúEleven people have been arrested, including a tribal leader who issued directives to shoot the couple, and all of them will appear before a judicial magistrate today.‚Äù</p>
<p>The viral video showed a group of men leading a couple out of vehicles and into a desert before gunning them down with pistols and shooting the bodies. Political figures and activists said it was an ‚Äòhonour‚Äô killing incident. On Sunday, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PakSarfrazbugti/status/1946928844923195709" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced on X</a> that he had directed the Balochistan Police to take immediate action, following which one suspect was apprehended.</p>
<p>According to a first information report (FIR) ‚Äî a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em> ‚Äî registered by the Station House Officer (SHO) Naveed Akhtar at Quetta‚Äôs Hanna-Urak Police Station, he lodged the complaint after receiving the video clip that had gone viral on social media, showing a man and a woman being brutally shot and killed by armed individuals.</p>
<p>SHO Akhtar stated that he, along with his team, reached Balochistan‚Äôs Dagari, situated on the outskirts of Quetta and, upon investigation, discovered that the incident occurred three days before Eidul Azha in the area of Sanjidi in Dagari.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe victims seen in the viral video have been identified as Bano Bibi and Ihsanullah,‚Äù the FIR said, naming eight suspects who allegedly shot the couple dead. The FIR also mentioned 15 other unknown suspects involved in the incident.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, SHO Naveed Akhtar said, ‚ÄúOwing to the nature of the murder, the case has now been transferred to the Serious Crime Investigation Wing for further investigation.‚Äù</p>
<p>Prior to being killed, the victims were allegedly taken to a tribal leader, who declared them guilty of being involved in an ‚Äòimmoral relationship‚Äô (locally termed ‚ÄòKaro Kari‚Äô) and ordered their execution, following which they were taken to the [desert] and shot dead, the FIR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe murder was filmed and uploaded to social media to spread fear and panic among the public,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>According to the FIR, a case was registered against the suspects under Sections 302 (murder), 149 (unlawful assembly), 148 (rioting while armed with a deadly weapon), 147 (rioting) of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.</p>
<p>One of the main suspects ‚Äî tribal leader Sardar Sherbaz Satakzai ‚Äî was presented before an anti-terrorism court today with Judge Muhammad Mubeen presiding over the case.</p>
<p>The suspect was handed over to SCIW on a two-day physical remand on the judge‚Äôs order upon the police‚Äôs request.</p>
<p>Chief Justice Balochistan High Court Justice Rozi Khan Barrech took notice of the case and summoned the additional chief secretary and inspector general of police Balochistan to the court in the matter.</p>
<p>In a press release issued by BHC ‚Äî seen by <em>Dawn.com</em> ‚Äî it was notified that BHC Chief Justice ‚Äúhas taken notice of the news circulating on electronic, print and social media of the murder of a couple for marrying out of choice at Dagari‚Äù. The statement added that, ‚ÄúIn this matter, the chief justice has summoned the chief secretary and IG Balochistan to court on July 22, 2025‚Äù.</p>
<p>The incident was widely condemned by politicians, civil society activists, and the public, who termed it ‚Äúbarbaric‚Äù and urged the government to take swift action against the perpetrators.</p>
<p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari called the suspects ‚Äúbeasts‚Äù, saying that they deserved no concessions. ‚ÄúI have faith that the criminals involved in this murder will be brought to justice soon,‚Äù he said, according to the state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/domestic/bilawal-condemns-murder-of-couple-in-balochistan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)</a>.</em>  ‚ÄúThis murder should be a test case for the Balochistan government, as it is gender terrorism.‚Äù</p>
<p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif shared the video in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KhawajaMAsif/status/1946923637686284672" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, with a message for the people of Balochistan. Referring to the growing militancy in the province, he said: ‚ÄúThose who have taken up arms against the state ‚Äî start by raising your voice against the unjust system that surrounds you.‚Äù</p>
<p>He continued that the ones responsible for this ‚Äúoppression are your own brothers, not the travellers and labourers from other provinces‚Äù, pointing out the recent bus attack in Balochistan‚Äôs Kalat district, which left three people dead and other similar incidents in the recent past.</p>
<p>PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman also <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/sherryrehman/status/1946955545946337781" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">condemned</a> the murder in a post on X, labelling it an ‚Äúunforgivable crime‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCrushing the right to marry is a violation of fundamental human rights. Killing in the name of tribal decisions is a despicable act. The cycle of brutality in the name of honour must be stopped,‚Äù she wrote.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBy mercilessly killing the married couple, not only have law and justice been insulted, but the authority of the provincial government has also been challenged,‚Äù Rehman added. ‚ÄúThe chapter of oppression and barbarism under the guise of jirgas must be closed.‚Äù</p>
<p>The senator emphasised that the perpetrators must be brought to justice and that legislation to end ‚Äúoutdated customs‚Äù was indispensable.</p>
<p>Baloch activist Sammi Deen Baloch decried the shooting as an ‚Äòhonour‚Äô killing, appealing to Baloch elders to ‚Äúrespect women‚Äôs decisions‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs a woman, this chilling incident is deeply painful and heart-wrenching for me,‚Äù she wrote on X. ‚ÄúKilling any woman in the name of honour is not only a heinous crime but also the worst humiliation of humanity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI appeal to Baloch and Pashtun tribal elders, influential sections of society, and intellectuals to respect women‚Äôs decisions. Today‚Äôs woman is the same woman who is educated, aware, and fully capable of making decisions about her future.‚Äù</p>
<p>She demanded that the killing be investigated transparently and comprehensively so that the suspects would be brought to justice and ‚Äúno one dares to repeat such a barbaric act in the future‚Äù.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849480">‚Äòhonour‚Äô killings</a> continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881836">Data</a> from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‚Äòhonour‚Äô killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‚Äòhonour‚Äô crimes in the country.</p>
<p>The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‚Äòhonour‚Äô.</p></p>

            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has arrived in New York to attend high-level signature events of Pakistan‚Äôs UN Security Council (UNSC) Presidency, including a conference on Palestine, according to the Foreign Office.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921308">assumed</a> the UNSC Presidency for the month of July 2025, making it the country‚Äôs eighth term on the Security Council as a non-permanent member. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026. The presidency involves a focus on multilateralism, peaceful dispute resolution, and regional cooperation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDeputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar,
arrived in New York for an official visit from 21 to 28 July 2025,‚Äù the FO announced in a post on X.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring the visit, he will lead high-level signature events under Pakistan‚Äôs Presidency of the UN Security Council, hold bilateral and multilateral meetings in New York and Washington, DC, and represent Pakistan at the International Conference on the two-state solution, co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and France.‚Äù</p>

<p>It added that upon his arrival, FM Dar was received by Pakistan‚Äôs Permanent Representative to the UN, Asim Iftikhar, and the Ambassador of Pakistan to the United States, Rizwan Saeed Sheikh.</p>
<p>According to a July 19 <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/curtain-raiser-deputy-prime-ministerforeign-ministers-visit-to-the-united-states-to-attend-high-level-signature-events-of-pakistans-security-council-presidency" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> issued by the FO, Dar will attend a high-level conference on the ‚ÄúPeaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution‚Äù, to express Pakistan‚Äôs strong commitment and unwavering support for the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>The conference was originally planned for June but was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917074">postponed</a> due to the Iran-Israel war, which also led to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917150">rescheduling</a> of Dar‚Äôs visit. According to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/13/macron-not-expected-to-attend-un-summit-on-two-state-solution-for-palestine-and-israel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Guardian</a></em>, the moot will now be held on July 28 and 29.</p>
<p>Since October 8, Israeli strikes have killed more than 58,000 Palestinians in Gaza. Pakistan has consistently raised its voice for the people of Palestine, calling for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921570/dont-be-a-bystander-pakistan-tells-unsc">urged</a> the UNSC not to remain ‚Äúa bystander‚Äù amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>
<p>Aside from the Palestine conference, Dar is also set to chair a high-level briefing of the UNSC, focused on enhancing cooperation between the UN and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe meeting is being held as part of Pakistan‚Äôs efforts to strengthen collaboration between the OIC and the UN for maintenance of international peace and security,‚Äù the FO statement said.</p>
<p>Dar is expected to have several other bilateral engagements with his counterparts, as well as senior UN officials, during his stay. He will also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925550">meet</a> US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on July 25.</p></p>
