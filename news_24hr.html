            <p><p>Pakistani pilgrims will be barred from travelling by road to Iran and Iraq for the Arbaeen pilgrimage due to public and national security, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Pilgrims <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855955">visit Iraq</a> to attend the chehlum commemoration — also known as Arbaeen (40 in Arabic) — to mark the 40th day of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922472/ashura-processions-in-major-cities-of-country-conclude-peacefully">mourning</a> for the martyrdom of Imam Husain, the grandson of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</p>
<p>“After extensive consultations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [the] Balochistan Government, and security agencies, it has been decided that <em>zaireen</em> (pilgrims) will not be allowed to travel to Iraq and Iran by road for Arbaeen this year,” Naqvi said on X.</p>
<p>He added that the “difficult decision was taken in the interest of public safety and national security”.</p>
<p>However, the pilgrims will be able to travel by air, the minister noted.</p>

<p>Naqvi stressed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed authorities to “arrange maximum flights to facilitate their pilgrimage in the coming days”.</p>
<p>Naqvi’s statement came after he met with PM Shehbaz earlier today to brief him on the new policy for pilgrims, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> (<em>APP</em>) <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/interior-minister-calls-on-pm-briefs-over-zaireens-new-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The premier also directed Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif to arrange “special flights” for the pilgrims, <em>APP</em> stated, citing a press release from the PM Office.</p>
<p>Iraq’s Karbala, where Imam Hussein and his brother Abbas are buried in two enormous mausoleums facing each other, is the centre of the Shia world during this time. More than <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854804/millions-of-pilgrims-rally-for-arbaeen">21 million</a> devotees took part in the pilgrimage last year.</p>
<p>Pakistan is set to introduce a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922178">new travel management system</a> from Jan 1, 2026, under which pilgrims will only be allowed to undertake the journey under registered organisers.</p>

<p>Under the new measures, the traditional Salar System will be abolished and replaced with a Zaireen Group Organisers model. Alongside weekly flights to Iran being increased from six to 15, 107 additional special flights will also be arranged for pilgrims heading to Iraq.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousuf <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925358/religious-affairs-minister-retracts-40000-missing-pilgrims-remark">retracted</a> his statement that 40,000 pilgrims had not returned from trips to Iran and Iraq. He clarified that a “misunderstanding” of outdated paper records that had not yet been fully digitised resulted in the statement.</p>

<p>During their meeting, PM Shehbaz and Naqvi also discussed the law and order situation in Balochistan, with the premier telling the minister to initiate work on the Gwadar Safe City project.</p>

<p>Senator Marri had sought a report on a critical discrepancy — the Gwadar Development Authority officials blamed a lack of funds for the project delays, while the Finance Division said it had received no funding demand from the Balochistan government.</p>

            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Sunday announced that Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates have agreed on multiple visa waivers for diplomatic and official Pakistani passports, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the Middle East and a major source of remittances, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.</p>
<p>In a post on X, Dar announced the agreement with the UAE’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, hailing the decision between “our two brotherly countries”.</p>
<p>“I have been informed by the UAE authorities that the visa waiver for diplomatic and official Pakistani passports entering the United Arab Emirates has been activated, effective July 25, 2025, at all UAE airports,” the foreign minister wrote.</p>
<p>“We agreed [on] mutual visa waivers on diplomatic and official passports between our two brotherly countries and we both signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to make this arrangement effective and operative after 30 days of the signing,” he added.</p>
<p>According to Dar, reciprocal arrangements have also been activated for Emirati nationals at all Pakistani airports.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, UAE’s Interior Minister Lt Gen Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923500/uae-assures-full-visa-facilitation-support-for-pakistanis">assured</a> “full support” in expediting visas for Pakistani citizens.</p>
<p>Al Nahyan’s statement came during a meeting with his Pakistani counterpart Mohsin Naqvi.</p>
<p>During the visit, Naqvi emphasised the importance of easing the visa policy, stating, “We want Pakistani citizens to come to the UAE with ease. Relaxation in visa policies will bring great relief.”</p>
<p>In June, Pakistan and the UAE <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920059">signed</a> an MoU on mutual visa exemption during the 12th session of the Pakistan-UAE Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC).</p></p>

            <p><p>Protesters demonstrating against counter-terrorism operations in the province were fired upon in the Mohmand Ghoz area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tirah Valley, a local official told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, two children were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925907/mortar-shell-kills-two-children-in-kps-tank">killed</a> by a mortar shell in the Raghzai village in Tank district. Following the incident, the grieving families and residents of the area staged a protest by blocking the Tank-South Waziristan Road, demanding immediate identification and action against those responsible.</p>
<p>According to Sohail Afridi, Special Assistant for KP Communications and Works, there had been an incident a day prior where a mortar struck a house and killed a young girl, prompting local residents to protest in front of the Frontier Corps (FC) compound today.</p>
<p>“Angry locals gathered at the gates and shots were fired when the crowd was near the compound,” he told <em>Dawn.com</em>. He said there were reports of fatalities and injuries in the incident.</p>
<p>Sohail added that there were conflicting reports about who opened fire on the demonstrators.</p>
<p>“I talked to district officials who told me that terrorists belonging to <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> fired at the protesters,” he said, using the term designating members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>“However, some of the protesters alleged that the forces at the gates fired at them when they were demonstrating,” he added.</p>
<p>In a statement from his office, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the firing by <em>Khawarij</em> and issued instructions to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured.</p>
<p>“The heinous intentions of terrorists cannot shake our resolve,” he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Following the incident, a jirga was convened between civil and military officials, local elders and Security Forces Commandant Brigadier Muhammad Qasim, according to a social media post by the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F).</p>
<p>The jirga condemned the incident in strong terms, emphasising that peaceful protest is a constitutional and democratic right and that no security force has the right to fire on protesters.</p>
<p>According to the post, the commandant stated that an inquiry will be launched into the incident and strict action will be taken against those responsible. He added that the person behind yesterday’s mortar attack has been identified and action against him is underway.</p>

<p>“Drone attacks and mortar shells will no longer hit innocent and oppressed people and their homes,” the commandant was quoted as saying. “All closed roads will be opened and nobody will be stopped at the Tirah check post.”</p>
<p>Additionally, the jirga agreed that the security forces would pay Rs1.5 million for every person killed in the incident, with the injured receiving treatment at the FC hospital in Shah Kas for free. The injured will also receive Rs2.5m each.</p>
<p>“If any injured person dies, they will also be given a martyr package,” the statement added, outlining that these packages would be distributed by the civil administration.</p></p>
