                <h2>Tense phonecall on Pak-India ceasefire reason for deterioration in Trump-Modi relations: report</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A tense phone call on the ceasefire between Pakistan and India became the basis for the current breakdown in relations between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and United States President Donald Trump, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-08/trump-s-50-india-tariff-threats-upend-decades-of-us-policy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on Friday.</p>
<p>Trump on Wednesday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929119/trump-imposes-additional-25pc-tariff-on-indian-goods-relations-hit-new-low">imposed</a> an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, citing New Delhi‚Äôs continued imports of Russian oil in a move that sharply escalated tensions between the two nations after trade talks reached a deadlock. The new import tax, set to come into place in three weeks, will raise duties on some Indian exports to as high as 50pc ‚Äî among the highest levied on any US trading partner.</p>
<p>While the rupture in US-India ties was abrupt, there have been strains in the relationship. Delhi has repeatedly rebutted Trump‚Äôs repeated statements that the US brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after four days of fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Trump also hosted Pakistan‚Äôs army chief at the White House in the weeks following the conflict.</p>
<p>The two leaders <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917877">spoke</a> over the phone at the insistence of Trump on the sidelines of June‚Äôs G7 summit in Canada, which Modi attended as a guest. The call lasted 35 minutes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPM Modi told President Trump clearly that during this period, there was no talk at any stage on subjects like India-US trade deal or US mediation between India and Pakistan,‚Äù Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had said of the talk. ‚ÄúTalks for ceasing military action happened directly between India and Pakistan through existing military channels, and on the insistence of Pakistan. Prime Minister Modi emphasised that India has not accepted mediation in the past and will never do,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p><em>Bloomberg</em> reported today that ‚Äútensions came to a head‚Äù between the two leaders in the call with Trump‚Äôs repeated claiming of credit and India‚Äôs downplaying of the matter.</p>
<p>‚ÄúModi felt like he needed to set the record straight in the call after his aides discovered that Trump planned to host a lunch the following day at the White House for Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir,‚Äù the report cited officials in New Delhi familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to speak about confidential discussions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile India had no problem if Trump met Pakistan‚Äôs civilian leaders, hosting Munir was seen as giving legitimacy to a military that Modi‚Äôs government accuses of supporting militant groups, they said. Wary that Trump would look to orchestrate a meeting between Munir and Modi, the Indian leader turned down an invitation to stop by the White House on the way back from Canada, they said, adding that he was also committed to visiting Croatia,‚Äù the report said.</p>
<p>It added that since the phone call, ‚ÄúIndia saw a shift in tone from the White House after that phone call, according to the officials in New Delhi‚Äù despite the US not making a direct request for Modi to acknowledge Trump‚Äôs role.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOnce Trump began publicly attacking India, they added, it was clear the episode marked a turning point in the broader relationship,‚Äù the report said.</p>
<p>Modi said a day ago he would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929293">not compromise</a> on the agriculture sector.</p>
<p>For New Delhi, one of the main sticking points in trade negotiations has been Washington‚Äôs demand to access India‚Äôs vast agricultural and dairy market. India has remained steadfast about its labour-intensive agricultural sector, unwilling to risk angering farmers, a powerful voting bloc.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will not compromise with the interests of our farmers, our dairy sector, our fishermen,‚Äù Modi said during a speech at a conference in New Delhi, his remarks widely seen as his first public response to the tariffs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI know I will have to pay a personal price for this, but I am ready for it,‚Äù he added, without giving further details.</p>
<p>In February, Trump said that he found a ‚Äúspecial bond‚Äù with Modi when he visited Washington ‚Äî complimenting Modi as being a ‚Äúmuch tougher negotiator‚Äù than he was.</p>
<p>Successive US administrations have seen India ‚Äî the world‚Äôs most populous nation and fifth-largest economy ‚Äî as a key partner, with like-minded interests in the face of powerful China.</p>
<p>India and neighbouring China have long been intense rivals competing for strategic influence across South Asia.</p>
<p>Now, India is bracing for a bumpy ride, as the US is its largest trading partner, with New Delhi shipping goods worth $87.4 billion in 2024.</p></p>

            <p><p>Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) founder Altaf Hussain was hospitalised again in London on Friday after falling ill.</p>
<p>In a post on the party‚Äôs X account, it said: ‚ÄúThe health of MQM founder and leader Altaf Hussain has deteriorated again, after which he has been taken to a local hospital. According to details released by the MQM Central Information Department, on Friday, Altaf Hussain‚Äôs health worsened again.</p>
<p>‚ÄúImmediate medical attention was sought, and an ambulance was called. The doctor promptly dispatched a medical emergency team. The emergency team initially examined Altaf Hussain at his residence, after which he was shifted to a local hospital for further examination and treatment.‚Äù</p>
<p>The MQM Coordination Committee appealed to all workers and the public to pray for his recovery.</p>

<p>Hussain was hospitalised in London <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923515">last month</a> due to ‚Äúsevere illness‚Äù, where he underwent multiple tests.</p>
<p>Previously known as the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, Hussain founded his party in 1984 to represent the Urdu-speaking community, which had migrated to Pakistan amid Partition.</p>
<p>Under Hussain‚Äôs leadership, MQM swept the 1988 election in Sindh‚Äôs urban areas, emerging as the third-largest party in the country.</p>
<p>The MQM under Hussain was accused of using violent tactics to attain and retain political power. On the contrary, Hussain maintained that the state and other political parties have targeted MQM and its workers ever since its formation.</p>
<p>Hussain currently lives in London, where he has been in self-imposed exile since 1992. He was later granted British citizenship. From London, Hussain played an active role in politics, regularly broadcasting political speeches to his followers in Karachi.</p>
<p>He was in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1604892">intensive care unit</a> at a hospital in Britain, apparently after contracting Covid-19 in February 2021.</p>
<p>Hussain was born on September 17, 1953, in Karachi. He obtained his early education at a public school in Karachi‚Äôs Azizabad neighbourhood, a middle-class locality in Karachi where he spent his early years and his youth. He later enrolled at the University of Karachi to study Pharmacy and graduated from the programme in 1979.</p>
<p>His political career began during his student years in KU when he and Azeem Ahmed Tariq founded the All-Pakistan Mohajir Students Organisation (APMSO).</p>
<p>Formed in 1978, APMSO gained a massive following within a short period of time.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, the MQM chief went into exile as the government at the time conducted an operation in Karachi.</p>
<p>Viewed as the man who controlled Karachi from London, Hussain came under fire in May 2013 for his televised speech across Pakistan, where he allegedly demanded the separation of Karachi from the rest of Pakistan if the public mandate of his party was not acceptable to the ‚Äòestablishment‚Äô. The party later clarified, saying it was taken out of context.</p>
<p>However, the final undoing of the MQM, as it was known, came after Hussain delivered an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1279393">incendiary speech</a> in August 2016 in which he not only raised slogans against Pakis¬≠tan but also called the country ‚Äúa cancer for the entire world‚Äù. Hours after the speech, MQM workers had attacked the ARY News office in Kara¬≠chi.</p>
<p>Authorities launched a crackdown following the speech and the MQM‚Äôs Karachi headquarters and Hussain‚Äôs residence in Azizabad were sealed. Later, Hussain‚Äôs own party leaders in Pakistan distanced themselves from him and omitted his name from the party constitution.</p>
<p>In October 2019, Hussain was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1510088/altaf-hussain-charged-by-uk-police-with-terrorism-offence-over-2016-speech">charged</a> with ‚Äúencouraging terrorism‚Äù by British police over his speech. He was also arrested in the case earlier in 2019 but was released on bail.</p>
<p>After deliberations that spanned three days, a 12-member jury had returned a majority verdict in Rex (crown) versus Altaf Hussain in February 2022, acquitting the MQM founder on two counts of ‚Äòencouraging terrorism‚Äô.</p>
<p>The jury found Hussain <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1675337">not guilty</a> on both counts of encouraging terrorism, contrary to section 1(2) of the UK‚Äôs Terrorism Act 2006.</p></p>
