            <p><p>The latest round of US-Iran nuclear talks scheduled for Sunday in Muscat will not take place due to an ongoing military confrontation between Tehran and arch-foe Israel.</p>
<p>The development comes a day after nearly 80 people, including <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916918/who-was-hossein-salami-the-revolutionary-guards-chief-killed-in-israeli-attacks">top army officers</a>, were killed while civilians were among over 300 wounded in Iran as a result of Israel’s strikes on military sites and private residences, according to the country’s UN envoy Amir Saeid Iravani.</p>
<p>Israel’s military announced earlier it was launching attacks on several sites across Iran as it kept up its campaign targeting Tehran’s military and nuclear sites, following earlier threats that the Iranian capital “will burn” amid the latter’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/tel-aviv-in-smoke-as-iran-launches-missiles-under-operation-true-promise-3-after-day-long-israeli-attacks">retaliatory strikes</a> targeting Israel.</p>

<p>Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi confirmed that the talks were cancelled on X on Saturday. Oman has been mediating the talks.</p>
<p>“Diplomacy and dialogue remain the only pathway to lasting peace,” he added.</p>
<p>Albusaidi’s statement came a day after Israel launched a sweeping air offensive against Iran, killing commanders and scientists and bombing nuclear sites in a stated bid to stop it from building an atomic weapon.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Iran said that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906722">dialogue</a> with the US over Tehran’s nuclear programme is “unjustifiable” after Israel’s biggest-ever military strike against its longstanding enemy, abandoning <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">planned talks</a> on Sunday.</p>
<p>“Continuing Iran-US nuclear talks is unjustifiable while barbarous Israeli attacks persist on the country, Iranian state media quoted Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi as saying on Saturday.</p>
<p>Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said that Israel’s attack on Iran made the talks “meaningless”, though adding that it was uncertain Iran would attend Sunday’s round of talks in Oman.</p>
<p>“The other side (the US) acted in a way that makes dialogue meaningless. You cannot claim to negotiate and at the same time divide work by allowing the Zionist regime (Israel) to target Iran’s territory,” state media quoted foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei as saying on Saturday.</p>
<p>“It is still unclear what decision we will make on Sunday in this regard,” Baghaei was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>He said Israel “succeeded in influencing” the diplomatic process and the Israeli attack would not have happened without Washington’s permission, accusing Washington of supporting the attack.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed in a video message to intensify his country’s offensive, warning that the attacks over the past 48 hours are “nothing compared” to what will happen in the coming days.</p>
<p>He added that Israeli strikes on Iran have set Tehran’s nuclear programme back, possibly by years, adding that heavier blows were yet to come.</p>
<p>“We will hit every site and every target of the Ayatollahs’ regime and what they have felt so far is nothing compared with what they will be handed in the coming days,” Netanyahu said in a video message.</p>
<p>He added that the military was now destroying Iran’s ability to manufacture ballistic missiles.</p>

<p>Iranian state TV reported that around 60 people, including 20 children, had been killed in an attack on a housing complex, with more strikes reported across the country. Israel said it had attacked more than 150 targets.</p>
<p>In Israel, air raid sirens sent residents into shelters as waves of missiles streaked across the sky and interceptors rose to meet them. At least three people were killed overnight. An Israeli official said Iran had fired around 200 ballistic missiles in four waves.</p>
<p>“We are currently launching attacks on several sites in Iran,” military spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said in a televised press conference following an overnight barrage of missiles and drones launched by Iran.</p>
<p>Defrin later said that Israel’s ongoing air campaign had created “aerial freedom of action” from western Iran to Tehran.</p>
<p>“We have created aerial freedom of action from west Iran all the way to Tehran… Tehran is no longer immune,” he told journalists, adding that the air force “launched a massive strike involving more than 70 fighter jets, targeting objectives in Tehran” overnight.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that the UK is moving additional military assets, including fighter jets, to the Middle East to provide support across the region.</p>
<p>“We are moving assets to the region, including jets, and that is for contingency support in the region,” Starmer told reporters en route to the Group of Seven meeting in Canada on Saturday.</p>
<p>Iran’s <em>Tasnim</em> news agency reported that two Revolutionary Guards were killed in an Israeli strike on a base in central Iran.</p>
<p>“Following the brutal attack by the Zionist regime on the Zarandiyeh Basij base, two members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were martyred,” the news agency said, citing the Guards.</p>
<p>The student-run <em>ISNA</em> network, meanwhile, reportedthat  a police chief and another officer were killed in a drone strike about 300 kilometres west of Tehran.</p>
<p>“This morning, police chief Major Habibollah Akbarian, along with second lieutenant Amir Hossein Seifi, were martyred by a drone strike in Asadabad city in the western province of Hamedan,” <em>ISNA</em> reported.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Israeli military said that its air strikes on Iran had killed more than 20 Iranian army and Revolutionary Guards commanders.</p>
<p>“Since the beginning of the operation (on Friday), over 20 commanders in the Iranian regime’s security apparatus have been eliminated,” the military said in a statement, naming several top commanders in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the armed forces.</p>
<p>Iran’s state-owned broadcaster <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/06/14/749816/Iran-air-defense-forces-Iranian-Army-shoot-down-f-35-fighter-jet-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Press TV</a></em> reported that an Israeli F-35 fighter jet had been shot down in the western part of the country on Saturday.</p>
<p>“Iranian Army’s Public Relations Office said in a statement … that its air defence forces had successfully struck and destroyed another F-35 fighter jet belonging to the Israeli regime over the western part of the country,” the report read.</p>
<p><em>Press TV</em> reported that “the fate of the pilot remains unknown and is currently under investigation”, adding that more information would be released in due course.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Iranian media reported Israeli strikes in cities in the west and northwest, which house key defences and military bases.</p>
<p>The <em>Fars</em> and <em>Mehr</em> news agencies said the strikes hit the northwestern city of <a class="link--external" href="https://www.mehrnews.com/news/6498987/%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%BA%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%B8-%D8%A7%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tabriz</a> as well as parts of the western provinces of Lorestan, Hamedan, and Kermanshah.</p>

<p><em>Fars</em> said two projectiles hit Tehran’s Mehrabad airport, and Iranian media said flames were reported there. Close to key Iranian leadership sites, the airport hosts an air force base with fighter jets and transport aircraft.</p>
<p>The <em>Tasnim</em> news agency reported on X that an Israeli drone struck the Hakim Children’s Hospital in Tehran.</p>
<p>“A hostile drone launched by the Israeli regime hit Hakim Children’s Hospital, which is affiliated with Tehran University of Medical Sciences,” the agency reported, quoting a statement from the university’s public relations office.</p>

<p>After his country claimed to have struck multiple targets in Iran, Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened that “Tehran will burn” if Iran fired more missiles at Israel.</p>
<p>“The Iranian dictator is turning the citizens of Iran into hostages and bringing about a reality in which they — especially the residents of Tehran — will pay a heavy price because of the criminal harm to Israeli civilians,” Katz was quoted as saying in a statement.</p>
<p>“If [Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei continues to fire missiles toward the Israeli home front — Tehran will burn.”</p>
<p>Israel’s military also said its fighter jets were set to resume striking targets in Tehran, after announcing it had hit air defences in the area of the Iranian capital overnight.</p>
<p>“The way to Iran has been paved,” the military’s chief of staff and air force chief were quoted as saying in an army statement.</p>
<p>The military “is proceeding according to its operational plans, and [Israeli air force] fighter jets are set to resume striking targets in Tehran”, it added.</p>

<p>The Israeli army claimed: “For the first time since the beginning of the war, over 1,500km from Israeli territory, the [Israeli air force] struck defence arrays in the area of Tehran.”</p>
<p>“We damaged — and will continue to damage — strategic sites and enemy sources of knowledge,” the commanding officer of the Israeli air force, MG Tomer Bar, was quoted as saying in a military statement.</p>
<p>Iranian forces shot down Israeli drones on a reconnaissance mission over the northwest, state media reported, as exchanges of fire between the two sides continued.</p>
<p>“Islamic fighters (Iranian forces) in the Salmas border region successfully shot down Israeli drones that had violated the country’s airspace,” state television said, adding that the “drones had entered Iranian airspace on espionage and reconnaissance missions”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Baghdad asked Tehran not to target US interests on Iraqi soil, a senior security official said on Saturday amid the heightened tensions.</p>
<p>Fearing being caught up in a regional escalation, the Iraqi government asked Tehran not to strike in its territory, a senior Iraqi security official told <em>AFP</em>.</p>

<p>The official added that Tehran has shown understanding with regards to Baghdad’s request.</p>

<p>Air raid sirens and explosions rang out across Israel overnight, with its military calling on residents to take refuge in bomb shelters in the morning.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said dozens of missiles — some intercepted — had been fired in the latest salvos from Iran</p>
<p>An Israeli military official said Iran fired hundreds of drones and missiles towards Israel, claiming most of which were intercepted. <em>AFP</em> images of the city of Ramat Gan near Tel Aviv showed blown-out buildings, destroyed vehicles and streets strewn with debris.</p>

<p>“We expect that the Iranians, who have a considerable volume of ballistic missiles, somewhere in the neighbourhood of 2,000, will continue to fire them,” he said.</p>
<p>“Israel is in war, not with the people of Iran … we are in a war against a regime that is intent on achieving nuclear power,” Leiter said.</p>
<p>He added that Israel wouldn’t know “precisely how much” damage it could inflict on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure until its forces “continue and complete the campaign”. “Ask me that question in four or five days,” the envoy added.</p>
<p>Brigadier General Ahmadi Vahidi, a top advisor to the commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, claimed his country hit three Israeli airbases that were used as launch sites for attacks on Iran, the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/06/14/3334994/israel-s-nevatim-ovda-tel-nof-airbases-struck-by-iran-general" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tasnim</a></em> news agency reported.</p>

<p>A senior Iranian official <a class="link--external" href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-news-06-12-25-hnk-intl#cmbvg0j3u002w3b76nxw5vcfd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>CNN</em></a> that Iran would intensify its attacks on Israel and target the regional bases of any country that “attempts to defend the regime”.</p>

<p>Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz took shelter inside a bunker, conducting a situation assessment after Iran’s retaliatory strikes, an Israeli official <a class="link--external" href="https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-news-06-12-25-hnk-intl#cmbvc0ru000113b766n6zew28" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>CNN</em></a>.</p>
<p>Katz said the Iranian leadership had crossed a red line by firing at “civilians” and would “pay a heavy price for it”.</p>
<p>Smoke was billowing above skyscrapers in downtown Tel Aviv, an <em>AFP</em> journalist reported, as Iran’s Revolutionary Guard said it had attacked dozens of targets in Israel.</p>
<p>Israel’s firefighting service said its teams were responding to the aftermath of Iranian missile strikes, including working to rescue people trapped in a high-rise building.</p>
<p>Resident Chen Gabizon told <em>AFP</em> he ran to an underground shelter after receiving an alert notification.</p>
<p>“After a few minutes, we just heard a very big explosion, everything was shaking, smoke, dust, everything was all over the place,” he said.</p>

<p>Iran had confirmed that above-ground sections of the Natanz enrichment plant had been destroyed, but the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said radiation levels outside the site “remained unchanged”.</p>
<p>“Most of the damage is on the surface level,” said Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI) spokesperson Behrouz Kamalvandi.</p>
<p>There was only limited damage to the Fordow and Isfahan nuclear sites, Iran said.</p>
<p>It said that its Fordow nuclear facility sustained limited damage following recent attacks, the semi-official <em>ISNA</em> news agency reported today, citing a spokesperson for the country’s atomic energy organisation.</p>
<p>“There has been limited damage to some areas at the Fordow enrichment site,” Kamalvandi said.</p>
<p>“We had already moved a significant part of the equipment and materials out, and there was no extensive damage and there are no contamination concerns.”</p>
<p>However, an Israeli military official claimed the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites were significantly damaged due to Israeli strikes, according to <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>The official said that it would take more than a few weeks for Iran to repair damage at the two sites.</p>
<p>Dozens of people took to the streets of Tehran overnight to cheer their country’s military response, with some waving national flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans.</p>

<p>“No flights will be operated at any airports in the country in order to protect the safety of passengers… until further notice,” the news agency said.</p>
<p>Israel’s Ben Gurion International Airport was also closed until further notice, a spokeswoman said. “There is no date or day set to reopen the airport,” airport spokeswoman Lisa Diver told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s attacks prompted several countries in the region to temporarily ground air traffic, though on Saturday morning, Jordan reopened its airspace.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#calls-for-dialogue" id="calls-for-dialogue" title="Permalink"></a>Calls for dialogue</h2>
<p>After a day of back-and-forth bombardments, Pope Leo appealed on Saturday for authorities in Iran and Israel to act with “reason” after recent airstrikes and to pursue dialogue.</p>
<p>He told an audience in St. Peter’s Basilica he was following the situation with “great concern”. “In such a delicate moment, I strongly wish to renew an appeal to responsibility and to reason,” said the pope.</p>
<p>“The commitment to building a safer world free from the nuclear threat must be pursued through respectful encounters and sincere dialogue to build a lasting peace, founded on justice, fraternity, and the common good,” he said.</p>
<p>“No one should ever threaten the existence of another,” said Leo. “It is the duty of all countries to support the cause of peace, initiating paths of reconciliation and promoting solutions that guarantee security and dignity for all.”</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araqchi in a phone call on Saturday that Moscow condemns Israel’s use of force against Iran and is ready to help de-escalate the situation in the Middle East.</p>
<p>“Russia is prepared to continue to work to resolve issues surrounding Iran’s nuclear programme,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also called for the two nations to cease fire.</p>
<p>“Enough escalation. Time to stop. Peace and diplomacy must prevail,” he <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/antonioguterres/status/1933663677619519743" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X earlier today.</p>

<p>US officials said they were helping Israel defend against the missile attacks, even as Washington insisted it had nothing to do with Israel’s strikes on Iran.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump agreed on a call with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer that “dialogue and diplomacy” were needed to calm the crisis, Starmer’s office said.</p>
<p>Trump also spoke with Netanyahu on Friday, US officials said, without elaborating.</p>
<p>Iran’s missile salvo came hours after Israel said its widespread air raids had killed several top Iranian generals, including most of the senior leadership of the IRGC’ air force.</p>
<p>It had launched several rounds of strikes that hit about 200 targets, including nuclear facilities and air bases.</p>
<p>Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to bring Israel “to ruin” during a televised address.</p>

<p>In Israel, Netanyahu issued a statement calling on the Iranian public to unite against their own government. But he also warned more attacks were coming.</p>
<p>“In the past 24 hours, we have taken out top military commanders, senior nuclear scientists, the Islamic regime’s most significant enrichment facility and a large portion of its ballistic missile arsenal,” Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>Iran earlier accused the US of being complicit in Israel’s attacks, but Washington denied the allegation and told Tehran at the United Nations Security Council that it would be “wise” to negotiate over its nuclear programme.</p>
<p>Tehran said Washington would be “responsible for consequences” as the US warned Iran not to attack its personnel or interests, stressing that it was not involved in the Israeli attacks.</p>
<p>The conflict raised questions as to whether Sunday’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">sixth round of talks</a> planned between the US and Iran to seek a deal on Iran’s nuclear programme would go ahead in Oman.</p>
<p>Iran has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a> that its uranium enrichment programme is for anything other than civilian purposes, rejecting allegations from the US and Israel that it is secretly developing nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Netanyahu claimed Israeli intelligence had concluded that Iran was approaching the “point of no return” on its nuclear programme. Israel had called for global action after the IAEA accused Iran on Thursday of non-compliance with its obligations.</p>
<p>Iran currently enriches uranium to 60 per cent, far above the 3.67pc limit set by a largely moribund <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1194411">2015 agreement</a> with major powers, but still short of the 90pc threshold needed for a nuclear warhead.</p>

<p>After months of urging Israel not to strike Iran while he worked toward a nuclear deal, Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-tells-reuters-its-unclear-if-iran-still-has-nuclear-program-2025-06-13/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Reuters</em></a> in a phone interview on Friday that he and his team had known the attacks were coming — and still saw room for an accord.</p>
<p>“We knew everything, and I tried to save Iran [from] humiliation and death. I tried to save them very hard because I would have loved to have seen a deal worked out,” Trump said.</p>
<p>“They can still work out a deal, however, it’s not too late,” he added.</p>
<p>Trump’s shifting stance around the Israeli strikes, which he called “<a class="link--external" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-tells-abc-israel-strikes-iran-excellent-warns/story?id=122807155" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">excellent</a>” and “<a class="link--external" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/12/politics/trump-israel-iran-strike#:~:text=called%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20strikes%20on%20Iran%20overnight%20%E2%80%9Ca%20very%20successful%20attack" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">very successful</a>” in a series of media interviews on Friday, offered one of the most striking examples yet of how he conducts high-stakes negotiations through both frank public rhetoric and behind-the-scenes maneuovers.</p>

<p>There were reports of new <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/israel-continues-attacks-on-iran-warns-tehran-will-burn-if-it-continues-retaliatory-missile-barrage">Israeli strikes</a> in Iran earlier today as Tel Aviv warned “Tehran will burn” after the Islamic Republic continued its barrage of overnight missiles in response to Israeli <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/tel-aviv-in-smoke-as-iran-launches-missiles-under-operation-true-promise-3-after-day-long-israeli-attacks">onslaught</a> on its nuclear facilities that killed its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916918/who-was-hossein-salami-the-revolutionary-guards-chief-killed-in-israeli-attacks">top generals</a>.</p>
<p>The missile exchange comes a day after nearly 80 people, including top army officers, were killed while civilians were among over 300 wounded in Iran as a result of Israel’s strikes on military sites and private residences, according to the country’s UN envoy Amir Saeid Iravani.</p>
<p>According to <em>PTV News</em>, the PM spoke over the phone to Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian, informing him that Pakistan stands in complete solidarity with the “brotherly people of Iran against Israel’s unprovoked and unjustified aggression”.</p>
<p>“He (the PM) strongly condemned the Israeli attacks against Iran, which are a violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and a complete violation of the UN Charter and international law,” the report read. The PM added that Iran has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.</p>
<p>“The prime minister condemned Israel’s provocations and adventurism, calling them a serious threat to regional and global peace and stability,” <em>PTV News</em> reported. “He also strongly condemned Israel’s unabated acts of brutal genocide against the brave Palestinians.”</p>
<p>According to <em>PTV News</em>, PM Shehbaz urged the international community and the UN to take “immediate and credible steps” against Israeli aggression, stating that Pakistan is fully committed to promoting peace in the region.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian thanked the PM for Pakistan’s support, saying that this was a “reflection of the close and brotherly relations between the two countries”.</p>
<p><em>PTV News</em> reported that Pezeshkian apprised PM Shehbaz of Iran’s perspective on the crisis with Israel and urged the international community, especially Islamic countries, to work together to confront these threats. The two leaders agreed to remain in close contact.</p>

<p>While addressing a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MediaCellPPP/status/1933832480001228826" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press conference</a> in Brussels, Bilawal said, “We certainly do not want a war on this border (with Iran). Pakistan has condemned the strikes that took place over the last couple of days on our neighbouring country.</p>
<p>“We will continue to advocate for peace on all our borders. Be it with Afghanistan, be it with Iran, be it with India. We absolutely cannot afford this conflict in Iran to turn into Iraq 2.0 or World War III.”</p>

<p>He said that it had become “far too easy to have a war every month” and added that war had become the “default setting” that “whenever there is a conflict or dispute, to launch into a full-scale war”.</p>
<p>Bilawal called on the international community to “immediately impose a ceasefire in this Iranian conflict with occupying forces in Palestine”.</p>
<p>“We cannot have perpetual war. It serves none of our interests,” he added.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Pakis­tan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">launched</a> a broad-based engagement campaign to present its perspective on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914500/indian-military-confirms-fighter-jets-shot-down-by-pakistan">recent conflict</a> with India to the world and counter New Delhi’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">unproven</a> allegations. As part of its global outreach, the team has visited the United States, is currently in London, and will also head to Brussels.</p>
<p>The delegation comprises Ex-FMs Bilawal, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; and Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.</p>

<p>Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday said that Pakistan will “safeguard Iran’s interests” amid exchanges of missiles between Tehran and Israel, state media <a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/14-06-2025/pakistan-to-safeguard-irans-interests-at-all-intl-forums-defense-minister" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Radio Pakistan</em></a> reported.</p>
<p>Condemning the Israeli attack on Pakistan’s “neighbour and fraternal country” during a session of parliament, the defence minister urged that a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) be convened to launch an initiative that “manifests the unity of [the] Muslim Ummah”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan stands firm on its traditional stance, as it has neither recognised Israel nor established relations with it,” Asif said. “Pakistan will safeguard Iran’s interests at all international fora, including the United Nations.”</p></p>

            <p><p>India’s government is urgently inspecting all Boeing 787s after a devastating Air India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916728/air-india-flight-with-242-onboard-crashes-near-ahmedabad-airport">crash</a> that claimed at least 279 lives this week, the country’s aviation minister said on Saturday, adding that the authorities were investigating all possible causes.</p>
<p>The aviation regulator on Friday ordered Air India to conduct additional maintenance checks on its Boeing 787-8/9 aircraft equipped with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917018">GEnx engines</a>, including assessments of certain take-off parameters, electronic engine control tests and engine fuel-related checks.</p>
<p>“We have also given the order to do the extended surveillance of the 787 planes. There are 34 in our Indian fleet,” aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu told a media briefing in New Delhi, without saying if the checks will apply to all Indian airlines.</p>
<p>“Eight have already been inspected and with immediate urgency, all of them are going to be done.” Air India operates 33 Boeing 787s, while rival airline IndiGo has one, according to data from Flightradar24.</p>
<p>The planes, however, have not been grounded, but a source on Friday told <em>Reuters</em> the Indian government was considering that as an option.</p>
<p>Naidu also said the government will look at all possible theories of what led to the crash.</p>
<p>Air India and the Indian government were looking at several aspects of the crash, including issues linked to its engine thrust, flaps, and why the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916797/did-wing-flaps-or-landing-gear-play-a-role-in-crash">landing gear</a> remained open as the plane took off and then came down, <em>Reuters</em> has reported.</p>
<p>Forensic teams are still looking for the second black box as they probe why the plane lost height and crashed straight after takeoff.</p>
<p>The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner with 242 people on board bound for Britain’s Gatwick Airport began losing height seconds after take-off on Thursday and erupted in a fireball as it hit buildings below, in what has been the world’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916894">worst aviation disaster</a> in a decade.</p>
<p>At least 270 bodies have been recovered from the site of the plane crash, Dhaval Gameti, president of the Junior Doctors Association at B.J. Medical College, told reporters.</p>
<p>Only one of the 242 passengers and crew onboard survived while others were killed as the plane struck the medical college’s hostel as it came down.</p>
<p>The crisis has cast a shadow on Air India, which has for years struggled to rebuild its reputation and revamp its fleet after the Tata Group took over the airline from the Indian government in 2022. Tata’s chairman said on Friday the group wants to understand what happened, but “we don’t know right now”.</p>
<p>Dozens of anxious family members have been waiting outside an Ahmedabad hospital to collect bodies of loved ones killed in the crash, as doctors were working overtime to gather dental samples from the deceased to run identification checks and DNA profiling.</p>

<p>Rafiq Abdul Hafiz Memon, who lost four relatives in the incident, said he was not getting any answers from authorities and was “very hassled”.</p>
<p>“We have lost our children … we are not understanding anything. Please help us get information about our children. Tell us when they are going to release their bodies,” Memon said.</p>

<p>Another father was upset about not being able to get the body of his son, Harshad Patel, saying he was told by authorities it would take 72 hours for DNA profiling. “The authorities are trying to help, but our patience is running out,” he said.</p>
<p>Most bodies in the crash were badly charred, and authorities are using dental samples to run identification checks.</p>
<p>Jaishankar Pillai, a forensic dentist, told reporters on Friday they had the dental records of 135 charred victims, which can then be matched through reference to victims’ prior dental charts, radiographs or other records.</p></p>
