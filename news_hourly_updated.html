                <h2>BLA and TTP are Indian proxies, govt will prove India‚Äôs involvement in Khuzdar bus attack: Asif</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has said that two major terrorist groups operating in Pakistan were ‚ÄúIndian proxies‚Äù, adding that Islamabad will present ‚Äúcomplete evidence‚Äù to prove New Delhi‚Äôs involvement in the attack on a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912542/pm-vows-strong-action-against-perpetrators-after-school-bus-blast-in-khuzdar">school bus</a> in Balochistan‚Äôs Khuzdar district that killed three children and injured several others.</p>
<p>At least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others ‚Äî mostly students ‚Äî sustained injuries after a bomb targeted the bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.</p>
<p>The condition of at least a dozen is said to be serious due to critical injuries, officials <a class="link--external" href="https://https:/https://www.dawn.com/news/1912542/pm-vows-strong-action-against-perpetrators-after-school-bus-blast-in-khuzdar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>, adding that at least 15 girl students were among the injured. Security forces vowed to ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357/4-students-killed-several-injured-as-school-bus-comes-under-attack-in-khuzdar-dc">relentlessly pursue</a>‚Äù the culprits of the attack as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir visited the injured in Quetta yesterday.</p>
<p>Speaking on <em>Geo News</em> programme ‚ÄòAaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath‚Äô late on Wednesday, Asif asserted there was evidence that the proscribed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) was working as an Indian proxy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will present evidence of India‚Äôs involvement. We will corroborate whatever we have claimed,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúThe relation between BLA and India is well-known as their leadership is in New Delhi. The allegation against us was unsubstantiated but BLA is fighting like an Indian proxy,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>He was referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> last month in occupied Kashmir that killed 26 people, following which India, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">without evidence</a>, had blamed Pakistan for backing the attackers.</p>
<p>Asif further said, ‚ÄúBLA and TTP are Indian proxies. They have nothing to do with religion or nationalism, India is financing them and they‚Äôre involved in bloodshed here.‚Äù</p>
<p>In reply to a question on dealing with the situation, the minister said that ‚ÄúPakistan will strike with full force and there will be no leniency‚Äù, stressing that attacking non-combatants, including school children, was unacceptable.</p>
<p>Asif said Pakistan called for an investigation into the Pahalgam attack, which India didn‚Äôt agree to, adding that the world should be informed that the Narendra Modi-led regime was ‚Äúvery irresponsible for using a false incident as a pretext to wage a nuclear war‚Äù.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan ‚Äúwill not start nuclear confrontation but cannot stay silent if nuclear devices are thrown at us‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan showed restraint, but still India attacked our bases in the dark of the night,‚Äù he highlighted.</p>
<p>A day ago, the military‚Äôs media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), also said that ‚ÄúIndian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians‚Äù.</p>
<p>It noted that India had ‚Äúfailed‚Äù against Pakistan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/india-attacks-pakistans-air-bases-pakistan-retaliates#:~:text=Force.%20Pakistan%20Zindabad.%E2%80%9D-,Operations%20commence,-At%20around%203">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a> during the recent conflict, and its [proxies] were ‚Äúbeing hunted [down] by military and law enforcement agencies‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUse of terrorism as a state policy by [the] Indian political government is abhorrent and reflective of their low morality and disregard of <em>[sic]</em> basic human norms,‚Äù the ISPR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPlanners, abettors and executors of this cowardly Indian-sponsored attack will be hunted down and brought to justice and [the] heinous face of India will be exposed in front of the entire world,‚Äù the military vowed.</p>

<p>On Monday, the ISPR said <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005/3-terrorists-of-indian-proxy-blf-killed-in-balochistan-engagements-ispr">12 terrorists</a> of ‚ÄúIndian proxy‚Äù outfits were killed by security forces in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.</p>
<p>Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said India was activating its ‚Äúassets‚Äù to inte¬≠nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan. He had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">detailed the arrest</a> of a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India as ‚Äúirr¬≠e¬≠futable evidence‚Äù of state-sponsored terrorism directed by Ind¬≠ian military personnel.</p>

<p>In a separate development, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912541">trilateral meeting</a> between China, Pakistan and Afghanistan, all sides agreed that their soil would not be used for cross-border terrorism.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference is Islamabad, Dar said, ‚ÄúThe government has a clear resolve. We will deal with terrorism the same way we dealt in 2013 and 2018.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Chinese interest also lies in this. [‚Ä¶] This was also discussed in the trilateral meeting,‚Äù the deputy premier said, referring to the recent moot in China.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHe reaffirmed that Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty, territorial integrity and its dignity were very close to them [China],‚Äù Dar said.</p>
<p>Dar highlighted that China agreed the Kashmir issue should be resolved according to the UN resolutions, adding that Beijing, like Islamabad, believed that a major reason for the tension in the region was the Kashmir dispute.</p>

                <h2>PTI felicitates Gen Munir on field marshal title, says he has ‚Äòmore responsibility‚Äô now</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan has felicitated Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir for his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912277/coas-elevated-to-field-marshal-for-decisive-role-in-marka-i-haq">elevation</a> to the rank of field marshal, saying that he now had more responsibility to ‚Äúmake the situation better‚Äù.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the government promoted Gen Munir to the rank of field marshal in recognition of his ‚Äústrategic leadership and decisive role‚Äù in defeating India during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military confrontation</a> between the two countries that ended with a US-mediated <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>Field marshal is the highest rank in armies modelled after the British Army. In Pakistan, it was awarded only once before, to General Mohammad Ayub Khan in 1959.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters outside Rawalpindi‚Äôs Adiala Jail yesterday after meeting with incarcerated ex-premier Imran Khan, Gohar said: ‚ÄúA long time has passed. The PTI is a major party, Khan <em>sahib</em> is the most popular leader. We want these difficulties to end now.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is why I am saying that the [army chief] has gotten this new honour of field marshal. [We] have congratulated but after this new honour, there is an increased responsibility on him to play his role even more and make the situation better.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to a question, Gohar said that the PTI would issue a formal stance on the development. He added, ‚ÄúWe have no strife with the military. Khan <em>sahib</em> also said yesterday that we stand with our armed forces and whoever is related to the armed forces will be uncontroversial.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúContacts have not been restored for now, but it is definitely our desire. Khan <em>sahib</em> has said that we never closed the door for talks with the establishment,‚Äù Gohar further said.</p>
<p>Gohar‚Äôs comments echoed those stated in a post on Imran‚Äôs X account, wherein the ex-PM said he was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912535/imran-says-ready-for-talks-but-not-to-cut-any-deal">willing to speak</a> to those who have power, in the best interest of the country.</p>
<p>Asked specifically about alleged intervention in politics, Gohar said, ‚ÄúWe all say that the military should have no role in politics, [‚Ä¶] and I say that whatever happens should be above politics.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter all, it is a major institution. It has had an influence and remains, so I will request that whoever can play their role in making the situation better to do so,‚Äù the PTI leader added.</p>
<p>The elevation, first cleared by the federal cabinet and later communicated by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to President Asif Ali Zardari, marks the first such promotion in over six decades.</p>
<p>The government also announced a second, open-ended extension in the tenure of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu, making him the first Pakistan Air Force head to receive two extensions.</p>
<p>Gohar also spoke about India, saying that ‚Äúan air of war was still lingering‚Äù.</p>
<p>He termed that the Pakistani forces had secured an ‚Äúamazing victory, which India could not have even imagined‚Äù. ‚ÄúIn my opinion, this war was even more serious than the 1965 or 1971 wars, because both countries are now nuclear powers,‚Äù he highlighted.</p>
<p>However, he cautioned the nation to remain united and alert against India‚Äôs ‚Äúanother such attempt and nefarious intentions‚Äù.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#implications-for-military-hierarchy" id="implications-for-military-hierarchy" title="Permalink"></a>Implications for military hierarchy</h2>
<p>A Ministry of Defence notification said that Gen Munir‚Äôs promotion to field marshal had been made under Rule 199A of the Army Regulations (Rules) 1998.</p>
<p>The rules are classified, but according to a military source, the mentioned rule reads: ‚Äú199-A. Promotion to field marshal. A general officer, whether serving or retired, may be promoted to the rank of field marshal by the federal government without regard to seniority or any specific appointment.‚Äù</p>
<p>However, experts noted the silence of the Constitution and the Pakistan Army Act on such an appointment.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>While the rank does not grant additional operational authority, its conferral during a period of heightened regional tension carries strategic and political symbolism. It may also bolster Field Marshal Munir‚Äôs standing both within the military and in political circles, particularly amid ongoing internal instability and civil-military friction.</p>
<p>Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, who previously headed the Senate defence committee, noted: ‚ÄúField Marshal Asim Munir is now very much in the driving seat as the pivot of the power structure, more so, given the weakness and divisions amongst the civilian politicians. Even before May, which has become an inflection point for Pakistan, for India and for South Asia, all the mainstream political forces were convinced that the road to Islamabad lies through Rawalpindi.‚Äù</p>
<p>COAS Munir‚Äôs promotion is not expected to alter operational command but serves as a symbolic acknowledgement of his wartime leadership.</p>
<p>The global precedent supports this view. In India, Field Marshals Sam Manekshaw (1973) and K.M. Cariappa (1986) were promoted purely for ceremonial reasons, with no changes to the army‚Äôs structure. Similarly, in the United Kingdom and the United States, five-star titles have historically honoured extraordinary service during major wars without altering command frameworks.</p></p>
