            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the headquarters of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) on Tuesday, where he was briefed on the country’s preparation for a “conventional threat” amid the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586">ongoing tensions</a> with India.</p>
<p>The high-level visit comes nearly a week after Pakistan said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected a military action</a> by India in the wake of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack%20were%20brought%20out">cross-border linkages</a>” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">firmly</a> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315/pahalgam-attack-fm-dar-throws-down-gauntlet-to-india-asks-for-evidence-of-allegations-against-pakistan">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>“The visit entailed a detailed briefing on the prevailing security environment, with a particular focus on preparedness for [a] conventional threat in the light of India’s increasingly aggressive and provocative posture along Pakistan’s eastern border,” a statement from the PM Office (PMO) said.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>“The leadership was apprised of regional security developments and the evolving threat matrix, including conventional military options, hybrid warfare tactics and terrorist proxies,” it added.</p>
<p>The premier was accompanied by Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and the services chiefs, the PMO said.</p>
<p>The services chiefs — Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar — were part of the visiting team, according to a group photo released on the occasion.</p>
<p>The picture also showed ISI Director General Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik — who was recently appointed as the country’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907660">national security adviser</a> — and the military’s media spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, present there.</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz and the accompanying dignitaries “underscored the imperative of heightened national vigilance, seamless inter-agency coordination, and reinforced operational readiness to deter and decisively respond to any violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”, the PMO said.</p>
<p>Commending the ISI’s “professionalism and strategic acumen”, the prime minister lauded its “critical role in safeguarding national interests and enabling informed national security decision-making under complex and dynamic conditions”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan Army is one of the most professional and disciplined force in the world,” the premier was quoted as saying. He reaffirmed that the entire nation was standing with “our brave armed forces”.</p>
<p>“The leadership reaffirmed Pakistan’s unambiguous resolve to defend the homeland against all threats — conventional or otherwise,” the statement read.</p>
<p>The leaders reiterated that with the nation’s full support, the armed forces, supported by all other elements of national power and state institutions, remained “fully prepared to uphold Pakistan’s security, prestige, and honour under all circumstances”.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also visited the newly established National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre (NIFTAC) and formally inaugurated its state-of-the-art headquarters, “which will serve as the central node for coordinating Pakistan’s national counterterrorism strategy”, the PMO said.</p>
<p>“NIFTAC, a federal institution, integrates over 50 relevant federal and provincial departments and agencies into a unified intelligence and threat management architecture supported by a centralised national database.”</p>
<p>The statement added that at the subnational level, NIFTAC is linked to six Provincial Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centres (PIFTACs), including those in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, ensuring seamless coordination from the federation to the provinces.</p>
<p>Commending the efforts of all stakeholders involved in operationalising this vital capability, the prime minister described NIFTAC as a quintessential national platform for collaborative threat assessment and response. He underscored that “dismantling the nexus between terrorism, illicit networks, and external sponsorship requires robust and efficient institutional mechanisms.”</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said NIFTAC would play a pivotal role in uprooting terrorism and its support structures from the country.</p>
<p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have spiked since the former’s aggressive measures following the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforced its forces</a> and has conducted two <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908595/pakistan-tests-launch-of-120km-range-fatah-missile-ispr">missile tests</a> in a short span of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908176/pakistan-successfully-tests-launch-of-short-range-abdali-ballistic-missile">three days</a>. On the other hand, India’s premier has granted “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>” to his military.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Pakistan has also taken the matter to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586">United Nations Security Council</a>, which was briefed on the country’s stance on the Pahalgam attack and India’s “unsubstantiated” allegations.</p>
<p>In the latest moves by the two nuclear-armed nations, the Civil Defence in Rawalpindi has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908691/civil-defence-activates-14-posts-in-rawalpindi">activated its 14 posts</a> in the garrison city while all states in India are set to conduct <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908697/indian-states-told-to-conduct-air-raid-drills">mock drills</a> for “effective civil defence”.</p>

<p>Separately, the Foreign Office said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar held a telephonic conversation with Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan Amir Khan Muttaqi who “appreciated Pakistan’s proactive steps to ease trade and facilitate travel”, amid rising tensions with India.</p>
<p>It added that Muttaqi extended an invitation to Dar to visit Afghanistan again. “He conveyed prayers and best wishes for the government and people of Pakistan,” the FO said.</p>
<p>Dar also briefed his Afghan counterpart on recent provocation and “illegal and unilateral measures” by India against Pakistan, reiterating Pakistan’s commitment to peace and safeguarding its sovereignty.</p>
<p>Both leaders expressed satisfaction with the pace of progress made by the two sides in bilateral relations since the deputy PM’s visit to Afghanistan on April 19, with a focus on trade, connectivity, economic cooperation, people-to-people contacts and reactivating political consultative mechanisms.</p>
<p>The two sides also agreed on the importance of maintaining high-level contacts for fostering long-term cooperation to promote peace and security in the region and beyond, the statement concluded.</p>

            <p><p>Seven soldiers were martyred in a blast from an improvised explosive device planted by “Indian proxy” terrorists in Balochistan’s Kacchi district, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7280" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said: “On May 6, 2025, terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, so-called ‘Baloch Liberation Army’, targeted security forces’ vehicle with an improvised explosive device in general area Mach.”</p>
<p>It said the following seven soldiers were subsequently martyred in the attack: Subedar Umar Farooq, 42, resident of Karachi; Naik Asif Khan, 28, resident of Karak district; Naik Mashkoor Ali, 28, resident of Orakzai district; Sepoy Tariq Nawaz, 26, resident of Lakki Marwat district; Sepoy Wajid Ahmed Faiz, 28, resident of Bagh district; Sepoy Muhammad Asim, 22, resident of Karak district and Sepoy Muhammad Kashif Khan, 28, resident of Kohat district.</p>
<p>“Nefarious designs of India and its proxies operating on Pakistani soil will be defeated by the valiant security forces, LEAs (law enforcement agencies) and the brave nation of Pakistan,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p>It added that sanitisation of the area was being carried out to eliminate any terrorists present in the area and the perpetrators of the “heinous and cowardly act” would be brought to justice.</p>
<p>“Security forces of Pakistan, in step with the nation, remain determined to thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan, and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve.”</p>
<p>Two Pakistan Coast Guards personnel were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908760">injured</a> on Monday when a remote-controlled bomb targeted their patrol vehicle in the Jiwani area, while a Levies official escaped unharmed when his private vehicle was destroyed by a separate roadside bomb in Pishin district.</p>
<p>Last week, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">accused</a> India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.</p>
<p>“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said, using the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Militant violence and security operations intensified in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901722/militant-attacks-in-march-surged-to-highest-level-since-2014">report</a> by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">ranked second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Israeli military carried out an airstrike on Yemen’s main airport in Sanaa on Tuesday, its second attack in two days on Houthi fighters after a surge in tensions between the group and Israel.</p>
<p>Three people were killed in the strike, according to Houthi-run <em>Al-Masirah TV</em>.</p>
<p>Israel warned people to leave the area around Sanaa International Airport before Tuesday’s attack, which it said targeted Houthi infrastructure and “fully disabled the airport”. Witnesses later reported four strikes in the capital.</p>
<p>Tensions have been high since the Gaza conflict began, but have risen further since a Houthi missile <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908455">landed near</a> Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport on Sunday, prompting Israeli airstrikes on Yemen’s Hodeidah port on Monday.</p>
<p>“A short while ago, IDF (Israel Defence Forces) fighter jets struck and dismantled Houthi terrorist infrastructure at the main airport in Sanaa, fully disabling the airport,” the Israeli military said.</p>
<p>“The strike was carried out in response to the attack launched by the Houthi terrorist regime against Ben Gurion Airport. Flight runways, aircraft, and infrastructure at the airport were struck.”</p>
<p>Three airport sources told <em>Reuters</em> that the strikes targeted three civilian aeroplanes, the departures hall, the airport runway and a military air base under Houthi control.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said the airport had been “a central hub for the Houthi terrorist regime to transfer weapons and operatives”.</p>
<p>In a statement carried by <em>al-Masirah</em>, the Houthis said: “The operations of our armed forces will continue and the support by Yemen to Palestine will only end with the end of the aggression and siege against Gaza.”</p>
<p>The United Nations Special Envoy to Yemen Hans Grundberg <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/OSE_Yemen/status/1919762802886967525" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X that the latest hostilities “mark a grave escalation in an already fragile and volatile regional context”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>An official at Yemen’s flag carrier Yemenia Airways told <em>Reuters</em> that three of its aircraft were destroyed according to an initial assessment.</p>
<p>Separately, President Donald Trump said the US would stop bombing the Houthis after the group agreed to stop interrupting important shipping lanes in the Middle East.</p>
<p>In an Oval Office meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump announced that the Houthis no longer want to fight but did not elaborate on the message.</p>
<p>“They said please don’t bomb us any more and we’re not going to attack your ships,” Trump said.</p>
<p>There was no immediate response from the Houthis.</p>
<p>The US president said Washington would take the Houthis’ word that they would not be blowing up ships any longer.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#axis-of-resistance" id="axis-of-resistance" title="Permalink"></a>‘Axis of resistance’</h2>
<p>The Houthis have been firing at Israel and at shipping in the Red Sea since Israel began its military offensive against Hamas in Gaza after the group’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.</p>
<p>The Houthis say they are doing so in solidarity with the Palestinians and have pressed on with attacks in response to Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908699/israeli-cabinet-gives-green-light-to-plan-for-gaza-conquest">expanding its military operations</a> in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The Houthis said on Sunday they would impose a “comprehensive” aerial blockade on Israel by repeatedly targeting its airports.</p>
<p>Sixty per cent of Yemenis live under the control of the Houthis, a resilient group that withstood years of Saudi-led bombing during the country’s devastating civil war.</p>
<p>The Houthis are part of Iran’s “Axis of Resistance” against Israeli and US interests in the Middle East, which also includes Hamas and Lebanon’s Hezbollah.</p>
<p>While Israel has weakened those groups by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867926">assassinating top leaders</a> and destroying military infrastructure since the Gaza conflict began, the Houthis are still a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>The Israeli strikes around Hodeidah on Monday killed four people and wounded 39, the Houthi-run health ministry said.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had vowed to retaliate after the missile launched by the Houthis landed near Ben Gurion Airport and led to European and US airlines cancelling flights.</p></p>
