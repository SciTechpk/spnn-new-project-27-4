            <p><p>The death toll from the five-storey <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050">building collapse</a> in Karachi has risen to 27, with several people still missing under the rubble, officials said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Rescue teams worked overnight on Friday to pull out more bodies from the rubble of the building situated in Lyari on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market.</p>
<p>Till Saturday, 80 per cent of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922268">rescue operation</a> had been completed, according to South Deputy Commissioner (DC) Javed Nabi Khoso.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em> today at around 1:30pm, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said “it will take five to six more hours to complete the rescue operation”.</p>
<p>Khan added that several people are still missing under the rubble but he could not cite an official figure yet since rescue operations were ongoing.</p>
<p>“Five people, including three women have been injured and so far,” said a statement from Edhi Rescue Service.</p>
<p>A total of 27 bodies have been recovered so far, including nine women, 15 men, a 13-year-old child, a 10-year-old child, and a one-year-old infant. The bodies have been shifted to Civil Hospital Karachi by Edhi Ambulance.</p>
<p>Ten people who were injured have been discharged.</p>
<p>While speaking to the media today after leading the Ashura procession, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah provided details on the building collapse.</p>
<p>“Immediate rescue efforts were launched to save any survivors trapped under the rubble,” he said, adding that the bodies recovered had been handed over to the families.</p>
<p>He echoed Khan’s statement of rescue operations being expected to conclude today.</p>
<p>The chief minister assured that a detailed inquiry into the causes of the collapse would be conducted, with committees already formed to investigate the matter thoroughly.</p>
<p>He revealed that over 480 buildings in old city areas, mostly in District South, have been declared dangerous.</p>
<p>“The government plans to assist affected residents in finding alternative housing,” he said.</p>
<p>CM Murad added that the recently collapsed building was constructed only a few months ago, apparently without proper approval, and those responsible for unauthorised construction would face strict punishment.</p>
<p>He also urged  the public to verify that any building they purchase has proper approval from the Building Control Authority.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that several people resist evacuation due to poverty and lack of alternatives, often buying or renting cheaper properties without checking safety approvals and later demanding government protection.</p>
<p>While empathising with these difficulties, he stressed that sometimes strict action is necessary to ensure public safety, as demonstrated by recent enforcement measures.</p></p>

<p>“Flash floods occurred in small, dry nullahs originating from the mountains and leading to small streams,” he said. “A nine-year-old boy was swept away by the flash flood in a small dry nullah. His grandmother, around 55-years-old, tried to save him but was also swept away.</p>
<p>The additional AC said that a rescue operation was launched immediately and that the boy’s body was recovered from the Pir Kalay Harichan Charsadda/Badragga Malakand boundary, while the body of the woman was recovered from the Zormandi Quaidabad area.</p>
<p>Additional AC Waheedullah further said that he was present in the field and people were discouraged from approaching or crossing the nullahs through announcements and the deployment of Levies personnel.</p>
