            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday landed in Azerbaijan’s Lachin District to attend a summit as he continued his four-nation tour to appreciate their support for Pakistan during the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military confrontation</a> with India.</p>
<p>Starting his expedition on May 25, the premier has already paid a visit to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913346/pm-shehbaz-in-turkiye-to-elevate-strategic-partnership">Turkiye</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913442/ready-to-talk-with-india-pm-shehbaz-says-during-meeting-with-iranian-president-in-tehran">Iran</a>, with Tajikistan his final stop of the trip ending on May 30.</p>
<p>Upon his arrival in Lachin, PM Shehbaz was received by Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Azerbaijan Qasim Mohiuddin and other diplomatic staff, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-arrives-in-azerbaijan-to-attend-trilateral-summit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>, citing a PM Office press release.</p>
<p>The prime minister is set to attend the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit alongside presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ilham Aliyev, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/27-05-2025/pm-in-lachin-to-attend-pakistan-turkiye-azerbaijan-trilateral-summit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. He is also scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting with the Azerbaijani president.</p>

<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi have been accompanying the prime minister on the four-nation tour.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913346/pm-shehbaz-in-turkiye-to-elevate-strategic-partnership">In Istanbul</a>, Shehbaz and Erdogan had “reaffirmed their principled support for each other’s core concerns, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute”. In Tehran, the premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913442/ready-to-talk-with-india-pm-shehbaz-says-during-meeting-with-iranian-president-in-tehran">expressed his willingness</a> to talk with India to resolve ongoing issues, including Kashmir and water security.</p>
<p>During his visit, PM Shehbaz will have “wide-ranging discussions with the leaders of these countries on an entire range of issues covering bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance”, the Foreign Office had said earlier.</p>
<p>“He will also have the opportunity to express the deepest appreciation and acknowledgement for the support extended to Pakistan by the friendly countries during the recent crisis with India,” it noted.</p>
<p>While in Tajikistan — likely the last leg of his tour — the premier will also attend the International Conference on Glaciers being held in its capital, Dushanbe, on May 29 and 30.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, who also visited Istanbul and Tehran alongside PM Shehbaz, met with his Iranian counterpart Major General Mohammad Bagheri.</p>
<p>Gen Munir met with Bagheri at the General Staff Headquarters in Tehran, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7304" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> today.</p>
<p>The two military leaders engaged in discussions on the “evolving regional security landscape, with particular focus on strengthening bilateral defence ties”, the ISPR said.</p>

<p>“Key areas of mutual interest included enhancing military-to-military cooperation, improving security mechanisms along the shared border, and exploring avenues for transforming the border regions into zones of trade and economic connectivity, thereby contributing to regional stability and prosperity.”</p>
<p>COAS Munir was “accorded a warm welcome upon his arrival, including a ceremonial guard of honour presented by a well-turned-out contingent of the Iranian Armed Forces”, the statement added.</p>
<p>The ISPR stated that COAS Munir was on an official visit to Türkiye, Iran and Azerbaijan — three of the countries on Shehbaz’s itinerary.</p>

<p>As tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi escalated, with India launching deadly strikes on Pakistan on May 6, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909193/erdogan-conveys-turkiyes-solidarity-to-pm-shehbaz-amid-india-escalation">conveyed his solidarity</a> to the prime minister and said it supported Pakistan’s “calm and restrained policies”.</p>

<p>Iran had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">offered to mediate</a> during the escalation and paid a visit to both <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">Islamabad</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909355/irans-foreign-minister-repeats-call-for-restraint-in-india-pakistan-standoff">New Delhi</a> in peace efforts, which were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911597">appreciated</a> by PM Shehbaz and the military’s spokesperson.</p>

            <p><p>Locals staging a sit-in against a suspected drone strike in Mir Ali last week, claiming the lives of four children, announced on Tuesday that they have ended their protest after having reached an agreement with the local administration.</p>
<p>For the past seven days, the locals in Mir Ali had been staging a sit-in, demanding justice in the wake of a suspected <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912113">strike</a> that took place in Mir Ali’s Hurmuz village on May 19 during the daytime, leaving four children of the same family dead and injuring five others, including a woman. While the military’s media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912393">clarified</a> that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>Allama Iqbal Dawar, one of the organisers, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that following a series of talks held between the protesters and officials, both sides reached an agreement on late Monday night.</p>
<p>The bodies of the deceased have been buried, and the roads previously blocked by the protesters are now open, while officials are set to meet the affected families and announce compensatory measures soon.</p>
<p>Additionally, Mufti Baitullah, spokesman for the Jirga, also announced the agreement while addressing the protesters in a video seen by <em>Dawn.com.</em> Baitullah was seen lauding the Jirga members for playing a positive role in the whole affair.</p>
<p>When approached by <em>Dawn.com</em>, District Police Officer Waqar Ahmad confirmed that the agreement had been signed but did not reveal any details about the pact.</p>
<p>Similarly, Mir Ali Tehsildar Sher Bahadar told <em>Dawn.com</em> that a four-point agreement had been reached. However, he too did not elaborate any further.</p>
<p>However, North Waziristan Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Yousuf Karim told the local media that he had held thorough talks with the tribal leaders, assuring them that the government and the army would pay “serious attention” to the safety of the residents during operations against the militants.</p>
<p>Last week, the local elders had threatened to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1913361">march</a> to Islamabad to protest against the drone strike in case their demands were not met.</p></p>

            <p><p>The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on Tuesday announced a public auction of six Bahria Town properties in Rawalpindi and Islamabad on June 12.</p>
<p>The development adds on to NAB’s previous actions against property tycoon Malik Riaz, who owns Bahria Town and is an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1803717">absconder</a> in the £190 million <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751790/imran-arrest-what-is-the-al-qadir-trust-case">Al Qadir Trust Case</a>.</p>
<p>In a notification today, NAB listed six properties of the project owned by tycoon Malik Riaz, including five in Rawalpindi and one in Islamabad.</p>
<p>The properties were being auctioned to recover the defaulted amount of a plea bargain under Section 33E of the <a class="link--external" href="https://pakistancode.gov.pk/english/UY2FqaJw1-apaUY2Fqa-apaUY2Npa5ljaQ%3D%3D-sg-jjjjjjjjjjjjj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NAB Ordinance 1999</a>, it added.</p>
<p>NAB media director Birj Lal Dosani confirmed the details to <em>Dawn.com</em>, stating that the amount was being recovered in connection with corruption charges under a plea bargain.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Earlier this year, the watchdog <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886785">warned</a> the public against investing in Bahria Town’s Dubai project and began <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1888343">extradition</a> efforts for Riaz and his son.</p>
<p>In February, NAB [filed] a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889193">reference</a> against Riaz, ex-Sindh chief minister Syed Qaim Ali Shah, Minister Sharjeel Memon, and others for land transfer to Bahria Town. The watchdog also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892931">filed</a> two corruption references for unlawf­u­lly acquiring 4,500 kanals of state land in Rawalpindi’s New Murree for Bahria Golf City and Takht Pari forest area.</p>
<p>In March, NAB said it had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898491">sealed</a> “numerous” commercial and residential properties of Bahria Town in Karachi, Lahore, Takht Pari, New Murree/Golf City, and Islamabad over corruption cases filed against Riaz. It had also frozen hundreds of bank accounts and vehicles of Bahria Town.</p>
<p>Separately, a Rawalpindi Accountability court had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898491#:~:text=Arrest%20warrants%20issued%20for%20Malik%20Riaz%2C%20Parvez%20Elahi">issued</a> non-bailable arrest warrants for Riaz and his son, Ali Ahmed Malik, in the Takht Pari reference.</p>
<p>NAB has multiple times warned the public to “avoid any attractive inducements from Bahria Town and to protect their hard-earned savings”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>According to senior counsel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1713850#:~:text=Khawaja%20Haris%20said%20a%20plea%20bargain%20agreement%20was%20considered%20successful%20if%20an%20accused%20confesses%20to%20a%20crime%20and%20then%20agrees%20to%20return%20the%20money%20in%20return%20for%20%E2%80%9Ca%20lighter%20punishment">Khawaja Haris</a>, a plea bargain agreement was considered successful if an accused confesses to a crime and then agrees to return the money in return for “a lighter punishment”.</p>
<p>From 2000 to 2022, the accountability watchdog recovered Rs65 billion through plea bargain out of a total of Rs91.55bn, a NAB official <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1713850#:~:text=From%202000%20to%202022%2C%20NAB%20recovered%20an%20amount%20of%20Rs91.547%20billion%20%E2%80%94%20Rs65bn%20through%20plea%20bargain%20and%20the%20rest%20under%20the%20voluntary%20ret%C2%ADurn%20plan">told the Supreme Court</a> in 2022.</p></p>
