                <h2>2 killed, cops among 10 injured in Wana bomb blast: Waziristan police</h2>

            <p><p>Two people were killed while 10 others were injured in a bomb blast in the Wana tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Lower South Waziristan district on Thursday, police said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">surge</a> in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies‚Äô personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">broke</a> a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.</p>
<p>Lower South Waziristan‚Äôs District Police Officer Tahir Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>: ‚ÄúTwo people died, while two policemen were among 10 individuals injured in a blast in the Wana bazaar.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that the wounded were immediately taken to the Wana District Headquarters Hospital. Security forces have cordoned off the area and initiated a search operation to trace the perpetrators, DPO Khan added.</p>

<p>Investigation was also underway to determine the nature of the bomb used, the officer noted.</p>
<p>The incident follows residents‚Äô complaints of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929167/action-sought-against-armed-men-roaming-wana-bazaar">open display of firearms</a> and the free movement of armed men in Wana‚Äôs Rustam Bazaar, an important commercial hub of Lower South Waziristan.</p>
<p>Sources said no one was allowed to roam Rustam Bazaar openly carrying weapons, and that strict measures would be implemented soon to curb the practice.</p>
<p>Pakistan witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928076/militant-attacks-see-slight-rise-in-july-says-think-tank">slight uptick</a> in militant violence in July, according to a report released by the think tank Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss). KP, including its tribal districts, remained the epicentre of militancy, accounting for 53 of the 82 attacks recorded nationwide.</p>
<p>A day ago, a police constable was among <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929116/2-injured-as-upper-south-waziristan-dcs-vehicle-comes-under-attack">two people injured</a> when Upper South Waziristan Deputy Commissioner Asmatullah Wazir‚Äôs vehicle came under attack in the district‚Äôs Ladha tehsil.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, four security personnel and a policeman were among <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929080">seven people martyred</a> in two separate firing incidents in KP‚Äôs Karak and Peshawar districts.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, unidentified attackers fired a rocket targeting a Scout camp in Wana. Although there were no reports of casualties or property damage, the explosion caused widespread fear and concern among residents.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, two militant commanders and the brother of a tribal elder were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928528/two-terrorists-elders-brother-killed-in-waziristan-clash">killed in a clash</a> between the banned TTP (Gul Bahadar group) and family members of elder Malik Ashiq Noor in the Dana area of Lower South Waziristan‚Äôs Birmal tehsil.</p>

                <h2>4 rescued after emerald mine collapse in Swat: rescue officials</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Four workers trapped 900 feet underground in a Swat emerald mine were rescued during an operation, Rescue 1122 said on Thursday.</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, a major rescue operation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929128/rescue-operation-underway-after-emerald-mine-collapses-in-kps-malook-abad">was launched</a> after a section of the emerald mine collapsed, trapping multiple workers underground. According to initial reports by Rescue 1122 Swat, the mine caved in suddenly during extraction activity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRescue 1122 medical teams are providing immediate medical assistance to the rescued workers,‚Äù Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi told <em>Dawn.com</em>. ‚ÄúThe operation continued for several hours after the mine collapsed, in which more than 40 personnel participated.‚Äù</p>
<p>The rescue operation was led by District Emergency Officer Swat Rafiullah Marwat, as per Faizi.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe trained personnel and modern equipment of Rescue 1122 made the operation successful,‚Äù Faizi said.</p>
<p>Mining in Swat‚Äôs lush mountains, particularly for emeralds, has long been criticised for poor regulation and inadequate oversight, often putting the lives of workers at <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875437">serious risk</a>.</p>
<p>The current incident has once again brought attention to the pressing need for standardised safety frameworks and proper training for mine workers in the region.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, the mining industry in Swat has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921194/washed-away-how-unregulated-mining-turned-the-swat-river-into-a-killer">seen a boom</a>, with around 350 crush plants established along the path of the 240km-long river, from Kalam to downstream Kanju.</p>
<p>In November, two workers <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875437">were killed</a> after elevator in an emerald mine collapsed. The tragic incident occurred when an elevator rope snapped, causing two workers to fall to their death.</p></p>
