            </a>
            <p><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Sunday discussed counterterrorism efforts in a meeting with his Afghan counterpart Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul.</p>
<p>The visit comes after a series of steps between both nations to improve ties, such as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904628">revival</a> of the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914300">upgrading</a> of each country‚Äôs diplomats from the rank of charg√© d‚Äôaffaires to ambassador. Both countries also held the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922614/pakistan-afghanistan-recognise-terrorism-as-serious-threat-in-1st-round-of-additional-secretary-talks">inaugural</a> round of the Additional Secretary-Level Mechanism talks earlier in the month.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFederal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi holds an important meeting with his Afghan counterpart Sirajuddin Haqqani,‚Äù the Interior Ministry said in a post on X.</p>
<p>Naqvi was warmly welcomed by interim Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani upon arrival at the Afghan Ministry of Interior, the post said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDiscussion on bilateral relations, particularly counter-terrorism, infiltration, and the banned Tehrik-i-Taliban [Pakistan],‚Äù took place, according to the interior ministry.</p>
<p>Effective management of the Pak-Afghan border, prevention of narcotics, and mechanisms for regulating cross-border movement were also discussed, the post said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTerrorist organisations are causing chaos and instability; We must stop them together,‚Äù Naqvi was quoted as having said to his counterpart.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan has selflessly hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades; the doors are open for the legal entry of Afghan citizens,‚Äù the interior minister said.</p>
<p>The process of repatriation of Afghan citizens illegally residing in Pakistan was also a subject of the conversation between Naqvi and Haqqani.</p>
<p>Afghanistan‚Äôs Senior Deputy Interior Minister Ibrahim Sardar, Pakistan‚Äôs Special Representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq, Federal Interior Secretary Khurram Agha and other senior diplomatic officials were there as part of the country‚Äôs delegation. Officials from the Afghan Ministry of Interior were also present on the occasion.</p>

                <h2>KP governor administers oath to opposition MPAs</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Twenty-five MPAs-elect of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa opposition were sworn into office on Sunday after KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi administered their oaths.</p>
<p>The oath-taking issue has risen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1831068">once again</a> after the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925091/ptis-senate-poll-campaign-beset-by-political-wrangling">redistribution</a> of reserved seats in the wake of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920721/ptis-hopes-dashed-as-rivals-set-to-receive-reserved-seats">verdict</a> by the Supreme Court‚Äôs constitutional bench that effectively took away the seats <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">from the PTI</a> and declared other political parties eligible for them.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Kundi delivered a press conference following the swearing-in ceremony, where he highlighted that the government reneged on an agreement it had made with the opposition.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA formula of 6-5 was agreed upon and our opposition candidates withdrew,‚Äù the KP governor said. ‚ÄúAll of them agreed that they will contest five seats ‚Äî two will be contested by the JUI-F, two by the PPP, and the PML-N will for one.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe PTI founder [Imran Khan] then made a decision, and their information secretary said, ‚Äòour Senate candidates are not in our control‚Äô. If your Senate candidates are not in control, then how are the MPAs-elect in your control?‚Äù Kundi asked.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe point is, we had a deal in place, we had an agreement. But their members were not completely on board.‚Äù</p>
<p>The KP governor highlighted that there are between 30 and 35 independent members of the assembly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have spoken with them, and we are hopeful that we can move towards 6-5. As soon as the leader of the opposition briefs us, we will have a strategy ready for tonight and then we will contest tomorrow‚Äôs [Senate] elections,‚Äù Kundi said.</p>
<p>Earlier, the opposition MPAs could not take their oaths on reserved seats due to a lack of quorum in the provincial assembly.</p>
<p>At today‚Äôs assembly session, which had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924631">called</a> by the KP government, the 25 MPAs-elect on reserved seats for women and minorities were expected to be sworn in. The session had assumed importance as the non-administration of oaths could lead to the postponement of Senate polls <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922230">set for tomorrow</a> for 11 seats from the legislature.</p>
<p>The session was scheduled for 9am but began with a delay of two hours and 20 minutes, with KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati presiding over it. As soon as the session started, MPA Sher Ali Afridi of the ruling PTI pointed out a lack of quorum, leading to the session being adjourned till July 24.</p>
<p>Upon Afridi‚Äôs remarks, PML-N‚Äôs Sobia Shahid contended that a lack of quorum could not be pointed out between the recitation of the Holy Quran and the oath-taking. ‚ÄúYou (KP government) have been making a joke out of this province for a year,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>Swati asked her to point out the legal provisions for her argument instead of giving a speech.</p>
<div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0;"></div>
<p>Ahmad Karim Kundi, the PPP‚Äôs parliamentary leader in the KP Assembly, also spoke on the floor of the assembly, backing Shahid. He asserted that the administration of oath was ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù, citing Article 255 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>The speaker also asked Ahmad to state the relevant provisions requiring so and issued a ruling to count the MPAs in attendance, at which it emerged that only 25 lawmakers were present.</p>
<p>Addressing PML-N‚Äôs Dr Ibadullah, Swati said: ‚ÄúOpposition leader <em>sahib</em>, there are 25 members present. The quorum is incomplete; ring the bells.‚Äù</p>
<p>The opposition lawmakers then came to the front of the speaker‚Äôs dais to protest. Swati then adjourned the session, saying: ‚ÄúAs the quorum is incomplete, the sitting is adjourned till 2pm on Thursday, July 24.‚Äù</p>

<p>The ECP had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924686/jui-f-loses-two-ppp-one-seat-in-kp-assembly#:~:text=reserved%20for%20women.-,ECP%20approaches%20PHC,-The%20Peshawar%20High">approached</a> the Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Wednesday, requesting that Chief Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah appoint a person to administer the oath to the notified MPAs-elect under Article 255(2) (oath of office) of the Constitution.</p>
<p>Subsequently, after today‚Äôs session, the PHC registrar issued an order by Justice Shah that accepted the ECP request and nominated Governor Kundi to administer the oaths ‚Äúat the earliest‚Äù.</p>
<p>It stressed that the governor should ensure that the oaths are ‚Äúadministered in the manner prescribed and proper record be maintained in accordance with the official procedure‚Äù. The judge also directed the KP Assembly secretary to facilitate the newly notified MPAs to sign the Roll of the Members.</p>
<p>A notification by the KP Governor‚Äôs secretariat, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, said Kundi would administer the oaths to the MPAs-elect at 6pm today.</p>
<p>The ECP has <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ECP_Pakistan/status/1946879928189755772" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">changed</a> the timing for the Senate elections from 9am to 11am.</p>

It ordered KP Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed, the chief secretary and the Federal Constabulary IG to ensure foolproof security arrangements for the ceremony.</p>
<p>Speaking outside the KP Assembly after the session, Ibadullah said he would approach the courts against the delay in the oath-taking, assailing the PTI government.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDo not hand over whatever political space is left to others,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNo one can stop these oaths [‚Ä¶] at which forum will they (PTI) challenge it?‚Äù the PML-N lawmaker said.</p>
<p>Ibadullah stressed that the opposition‚Äôs women and minority members had not had representation in the Senate for one and a half years, since the 2024 general elections.</p>
<p>Terming the PTI ‚Äúpolitically immature‚Äù, he pointed out that it was the PTI government‚Äôs ‚Äúresponsibility‚Äù to ensure a proper quorum, given their majority in the KP Assembly.</p>
<p>Before the assembly session, the PTI held a parliamentary party meeting, in which it decided that none of its MPAs would attend the proceedings, calling the oaths a ‚Äútheft of its right‚Äù.</p>

<p>In a statement, PTI‚Äôs Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, public relations adviser to KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, called it a ‚Äúblack day for parliamentary politics‚Äù and a ‚Äúmurder of democracy‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe oaths of opposition MPAs on reserved seats are an insult to the public‚Äôs opinion. [‚Ä¶] The opposition is dissatisfied despite winning, while the PTI is satisfied even after losing as it has the public‚Äôs support,‚Äù Saif said.</p>

<p>The opposition now holds a total of 52 lawmakers in the KP Assembly. After the latest notifications by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and the PML-N each hold 17 seats in the 125-member house, while the PPP holds 10 seats.</p>
<p>The Awami National Party (ANP) and PTI-Parliamentarians (PTI-P) each have three seats, while two seats were to be decided through a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924686/jui-f-loses-two-ppp-one-seat-in-kp-assembly#:~:text=decided%20by%20a%20draw%20between%20ANP%20and%20PTI%2DP%2C%20while%20the%20reserved%20seat%20for%20non%2DMuslims%20will%20be%20determined%20through%20a%20similar%20process%20between%20JUI%2DF%20and%20PML%2DN.">separate draw</a> for each.</p>
