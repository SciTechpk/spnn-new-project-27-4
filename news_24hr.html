            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925887/lahore-atc-acquits-qureshi-sentences-yasmin-rashid-ejaz-chaudhry-and-others-to-10-years-in-may-9-riots-case' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ATC acquits Qureshi, sentences Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry and others to 10 years in May 9 riots case</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Lahore Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Tuesday acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi while sentencing Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry and others to 10 years in prison over a May 9 riots case related to violence on Sherpao Bridge.</p>
<p>Following the arrest of ex-premier Imran Khan on May 9, 2023, from the Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) premises, riots erupted across the country and went on for at least 24 hours. Protesters vandalised and torched government buildings and military installations, while also breaking into the residence of the Lahore corps commander. The state subsequently launched a crackdown against him and his party, filing several other cases against Imran and party leaders since the events of May 9.</p>
<p>Sarwar Road police had registered a case against PTI leaders and workers on charges of ransacking and burning public property at Sherpao Bridge in the Cantonment area during the violent protests.</p>
<p>Advocate Burhan Moazzam Malik, the lead defence counsel, confirmed today’s sentencing to <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>He said Yasmin, former provincial minister Mian Mehmoodur Rashid, Senator Chaudhry and former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema were among those sentenced to 10 years in prison. The others were Khalid Qayyum, Riaz Hussain, Ali Hassan and Afzal Azeem Pahat.</p>
<p>Along with Qureshi, Malik said the others acquitted were Hamza Azeem, Aitzaz Rafiq, Rana Tanvir, Iftikhar Ahmad and Zayas Khan.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference soon after the development emerged, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said there was now “an addition to the controversial cases of Pakistan’s judiciary” after today’s legal developments.</p>
<p>Noting Qureshi’s acquittal, he said Chaudhry, Dr Yasmin, Mian Mian Mehmoodur and Cheema were sentenced to 10 years “without fulfilling the requirements of the law”.</p>
<p>He criticised the jail trial proceedings and said it would not bode well for the country, causing public disillusionment in the courts.</p>
<p>Blasting the verdict, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said an “edifice of lies” was constructed and the matter no longer concerned just the party but the entire nation, saying that institutions and courts were being destroyed.</p>
<p>He called the verdict a “joke and attack on democracy”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik welcomed the development while speaking on <em>Geo News</em>. “These people were using delaying tactics,” he said.</p>
<p>Malik said due process and a fair trial process was followed and all evidence on record was considered by the judge, saying that the verdict was in line with the law and the Constitution.</p>
<p>The ATC had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925804/atc-hears-final-arguments-in-sherpao-bridge-violence-case">heard the concluding arguments</a> of the prosecution and defence in the jail trial proceedings of the case a day ago.</p>
<p>Deputy Prosecutor General Abdul Jabbar Dogar had presented final arguments, saying the “May 9 conspiracy” was hatched on May 7 at Zaman Park. He said it had already been decided what actions were to be taken in case of the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan.</p>
<p>He alleged that on May 9, according to the plan, party leaders incited the workers. He said the witnesses to the conspiracy had recorded their statements before the court. He said these witnesses were present during the meeting of the PTI leaders held at Zaman Park, the residence of the former prime minister.</p>
<p>The prosecutor stated that 61 witnesses of the attacks and vandalism incidents had testified in the trial. Therefore, he said, in the light of the documents, evidence and the witness statements, the accused persons should be convicted.</p></p>

            <p><p>A man allegedly shot dead his daughter and nephew in Quetta on Tuesday in the name of ‘honour’, just days after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925555">Degari</a> case, in which a couple was gunned down in broad daylight, drawing widespread condemnation, according to the police.</p>
<p>Shalkot Sub-Divisional Police Officer Athar Rashid told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “The daughter and the nephew died in the firing, while the suspect managed to escape after the incident.”</p>
<p>The bodies were taken to the hospital for medicolegal formalities, after which they were handed over to the heirs.</p>
<p>Rashid added that a team from Kechi Baig police station was conducting raids to arrest the suspect.</p>
<p>“The suspect will be arrested soon, while further investigation into the incident is underway,” he said.</p>
<p>The incident comes two days after the police  <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925718">arrested</a> at least 14 suspects for their involvement in the killing of a man and a woman in Quetta’s Degari area, who were shot dead on the orders of a tribal jirga ahead of Eidul Azha for so-called ‘honour’.</p>
<p>The arrests were made after a video of the killing went viral on social media, in which a group of people could be seen shooting the couple.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849480">continued</a> to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.</p>
<p>Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p>
<p>The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#balochistan-assembly-condemns-honour-killings" id="balochistan-assembly-condemns-honour-killings" title="Permalink"></a>Balochistan Assembly condemns ‘honour killings’</h2>
<p>The Balochistan Assembly, during its session today, strongly denounced ‘honour killings’, the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/domestic/balochistan-assembly-condemns-honor-killings-and-offers-prayer-for-shaheed-major-anwar-kakar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>Presided over by Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, the assembly passed a joint resolution denouncing the brutal killing of the man and woman in Degari.</p>
<p>Deputy Speaker Ghazala Gola presented the resolution, describing the act as inhumane, unlawful, and devoid of any cultural, religious, or legal justification. She reaffirmed that justice lies solely with the state, not individuals who take the law into their own hands, <em>APP</em> added.</p>
<p>The resolution urged the provincial government to ensure swift action against the culprits of the Degari incident and deliver appropriate punishment.</p>
<p>MPA Shahida Rauf decried the incident as barbaric and criticised unauthorised “Jirgas” for dispensing unlawful judgments, calling for tougher legislation and accountability.</p>
<p>Chief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti proposed forming a parliamentary committee to monitor the investigation and ensure transparency in the dual murder case.</p>
<p>Education Minister Rahila Hameed Durrani emphasised the psychological impact of the incident across society and noted that while it occurred before Eid, it only recently gained public attention after circulating online.</p>
<p>Adviser Meena Majeed Baloch condemned the deep-rooted customs leading to recurring violence against women. She called for the elimination of parallel laws, underscoring the contrast between women’s global achievements and their oppression at home.</p>
<p>Maulana Hidayat-ur-Rehman Baloch addressed the need for both moral upbringing and systemic reform while acknowledging cultural sensitivities around honour. He strongly opposed vigilante justice.</p>
<p>MPA Farah Azeem Shah argued that the incident reflects a societal regression, urging adherence to the Islamic principles of compassion and justice.</p>
<p>She criticised unequal enforcement of law and challenged patriarchal norms surrounding honour.</p>
<p>Minister Haji Noor Muhammad Dummar called for decisive actions to prevent future tragedies, stating no one has the right to claim lives in the name of tradition.</p>
<p>The resolution was adopted unanimously after a thorough and impassioned debate.</p></p>
