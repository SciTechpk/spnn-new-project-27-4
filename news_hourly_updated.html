            <p><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Monday acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi in two more cases related to the May 9 riots, while sentencing Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudry, Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mehmoodur Rashid to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting party founder Imran Khan‚Äôs arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, following which thousands were arrested.</p>

<p>The ATC had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929899/verdict-in-two-may-9-riots-cases-reserved">reserved its verdict</a> in the two cases on Saturday related to the May 9 riots ‚Äî the Shadman police station attack and burning of police vehicles near Jinnah House ‚Äî after completing proceedings at Kot Lakhpat jail. The judge concluded the hearings inside the jail in two sessions during the whole day.</p>
<p>ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced the judgments today and convicted Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema and Rashid in both cases.</p>
<p>PTI leaders Aliya Hamza and Sanam Javed were also sentenced to five years in prison in the Shadman case.</p>
<p>Advocate Rana Mudassar confirmed today‚Äôs sentencing to <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>In the Shadman police station case, the court indicted 25 accused out of 41 nominated in the challan and recorded statements of 45 prosecution witnesses. At least 15 accused have been declared proclaimed offenders in this case.</p>
<p>In the police vehicles torching case, the court indicted 17 accused, declared seven proclaimed offenders and recorded statements of 65 prosecution witnesses.</p>
<p>Last month, the Lahore ATC had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925887/lahore-atc-acquits-qureshi-sentences-yasmin-rashid-ejaz-chaudhry-and-others-to-10-years-in-may-9-riots-case">acquitted</a> Qureshi while sentencing Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema, Rashid and others to 10 years in prison over a May 9 riots case related to violence on Sherpao Bridge.</p>
<p>Sarwar Road police had registered a case against PTI leaders and workers on charges of ransacking and burning public property at Sherpao Bridge in the Cantonment area during the violent protests.</p>

            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930198/pakistan-gets-offers-in-100000-tonnes-white-sugar-tender-traders-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <h2>Pakistan gets offers in 100,000 tonnes white sugar tender, traders say</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) on Monday received offers in its international tender to buy 100,000 tonnes of white sugar, European traders said in initial assessments.</p>
<p>On July 8, the government had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923204/trading-corporation-of-pakistan-to-import-035m-tonnes-of-sugar">approved plans</a> to import 500,000 tonnes of sugar to help maintain price stability. Market analysts said that retail sugar prices in the country have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923873">risen sharply</a> since January.</p>
<p>TCP had last week <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928691">issued</a> a fresh international tender to purchase 100,000 tonnes of white refined sugar, after a previous one for 50,000 tonnes of sugar in July reportedly received <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925968">no offers</a>.</p>
<p>The lowest price offered in the tender was believed to be $539.00 a tonne, cost and freight (c&amp;f) included, according to traders. They said offers were still being considered and no purchase had been reported yet.</p>
<p>The lowest offer was said to have been submitted by trading house ED&amp;F Man for 50,000 tonnes of fine-grade sugar sourced from any origin.</p>
<p>There were reportedly three other participants in the tender.</p>
<p>Dreyfus was said to have offered $580.75 a tonne c&amp;f for 25,000 tonnes of fine-grade sugar from any origin, while Al Khaleej Sugar offered $586.00 a tonne c&amp;f for 30,000 tonnes of medium-grade sugar sourced from the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Trading house Bare offered $555.00 c&amp;f for medium-grade and $550.00 c&amp;f for fine-grade sugar, both from Brazil.</p>
<p>Reports reflect the assessments so far from traders, and further estimates of prices and volumes are still possible later.</p>
<p>No purchase was reported in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926639/tcp-doubles-tender-size-amid-sugar-price-surge">previous tender</a> for 100,000 tonnes on July 31, with the lowest price offer also $539.00 a tonne c&amp;f.</p>
<p>The new tender seeks small/fine- and medium-grade sugar from worldwide origins, excluding India and Israel.</p>
<p>The sugar shipments should be organised to achieve the arrival of all the sugar in Pakistan by October 20, traders said.</p>
<p>Shipment of breakbulk supplies is sought from September 1 to September 15 for 50,000 tonnes, while the rest can be shipped from September 10 to September 25. Sugar in ocean shipping containers can also be shipped between September 1 to 20.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, traders remain puzzled by the government‚Äôs sugar trade policy.</p>
<p>During FY25, Pakistan exported 765,734 tonnes of sugar, generating $411 million in foreign exchange, with an average per tonne price of $537. By contrast, only 33,101 tonnes were exported in FY24, earning just $21m.</p>
<p>With the government vowing strict monitoring of sugar stocks, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928823">cartelisation case</a> involving 79 sugar mills and the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) is also being heard by the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP).</p></p>
