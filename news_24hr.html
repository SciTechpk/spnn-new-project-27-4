            <p><p>President Asif Ali Zardari <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921423">appointed</a> the chief justices to the four high courts on Monday.</p>
<p>Letters from the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) last week said that Justice Sarfraz Dogar was nominated as the new chief justice of the Islamabad High Court, Justice Rozi Khan Barrech as the chief justice for the Balochistan High Court, Justice Syed Muhammad Attique Shah for the Peshawar High Court and Justice Junaid Ghaffar for the Sindh High Court.</p>
<p>The JCP had held four consecutive meetings to make a decision related to the appointments and, by a majority of its total membership in each meeting, opted to allow the acting chief justices to continue serving the top roles.</p>
<p>Four identical notifications from the law ministry said that the president appointed the chief justices, with effect from the date they take their oath of office, under clause (1) of Article 193 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>Article 193 outlines the process for the appointment of high court judges.</p>
<p>The chief justices are likely to take the oath sometime this week. Sources had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922344/chief-justices-of-four-high-courts-likely-to-take-oath-next-week">said</a> the notifications were expected today and the top judges may take oath the following day.</p>
<p>President Zardari would administer the oath to Justice Dogar at the Presidency, while the chief justices of the other high courts would take the oath from the respective governors.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922576/army-chief-dismisses-factually-incorrect-claims-of-external-input-in-operation-bunyanum-marsoos' target='_blank'><strong>Army chief dismisses ‘factually incorrect’ claims of external input in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</strong></a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir on Monday dismissed Indian claims of Pakistan receiving external support in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent tensions with India, terming them “irresponsible and factually incorrect”.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">US-brokered ceasefire</a> for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> reported that the deputy chief of India’s army alleged last week that China gave Islamabad “live inputs” on key Indian positions during the conflict. India fought two adversaries during the conflict, with Pakistan being the “front face” while China provided “all possible support”, Lieutenant General Rahul Singh had said at a defence industry event in New Delhi.</p>
<p>“When the DGMO (director general of military operations) level talks were going on, Pakistan … said that we know that your such and such important vector is primed and it is ready for action … he was getting live inputs from China,” he said. Singh did not elaborate on how India knew about the live inputs from China.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the Inter-Services Publications said that Field Marshal Munir addressed the matter today while speaking at the National Defence University (NDU) in Islamabad.</p>
<p>He said that India’s “inability” to achieve its military objectives during Operation Sindoor and the subsequent claims signified “its lack of operational readiness and strategic foresight”.</p>
<p>“Insinuations regarding external support in Pakistan’s successful Operation Bunyanum Marsoos are irresponsible and factually incorrect and reflect a chronic reluctance to acknowledge indigenous capability and institutional resilience developed over decades of strategic prudence.</p>
<p>“Naming other states as participants in the purely bilateral military conflagration is also a shoddy attempt at playing camp politics and desperately trying that India remains the beneficiary of larger geopolitical contestation as the so-called net security provider in a region which is getting increasingly weary of its hegemonic and extremist Hindutva ideology.”</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>It further stated that “in contrast to India’s strategic behaviour resting on parochial self-alignment”, Pakistan had forged “lasting partnerships based on principled diplomacy, anchored in mutual respect and peace, establishing itself to be a stabiliser in the region”.</p>
<p>In his remarks, the army chief reiterated the country’s “principled stance”, warning that any misadventure or attempts to undermine national sovereignty or territorial integrity would be met with a “swift and resolute response”.</p>
<p>“Any attempt to target our population centres, military bases, economic hubs and ports will instantly invoke a ‘deeply hurting and more than reciprocal response’. The onus of escalation will squarely lie on the strategically blind arrogant aggressor who fails to see the grave repercussions of such provocative actions against a sovereign nuclear state,” the statement quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>“Wars are not won through media rhetoric, imported fancy hardware, or political sloganeering, but through faith, professional competence, operational clarity, institutional strength and national resolve,” the army chief concluded.</p>
<p>He lauded the armed forces and urged the graduating officers to remain steadfast in the values of integrity, selfless service, and unwavering commitment to the nation, the statement added.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922609/newlywed-19-year-old-girl-in-coma-after-alleged-brutal-sexual-violence-by-husband' target='_blank'><strong>Newlywed 19-year old girl in coma after alleged ‘brutal sexual violence’ by husband</strong></a>
            <p><p>A 19-year-old newlywed was admitted to Civil Hospital Karachi in critical condition after allegedly enduring “brutal sexual violence” at the hands of her husband, who has since been arrested, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “As per the family and the police record, the 19-year-old girl married in Lyari on June 15. She is now in a coma. Her physical examination findings are consistent with sexual violence.”</p>
<p>According to the contents of the first information report (FIR) registered at the Baghdadi Police Station on July 5 under Sections 324 (attempt to commit qatl-i-amd) and 376-B (punishment for gang-rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code, the complainant, the brother of the victim, said that he was a resident of Shah Beg Lane in Baghdadi, Lyari.</p>
<p>“On the third day of her marriage, my sister was subjected to brutal sexual violence allegedly by her husband. She remained admitted at a private hospital in the city and was later taken to Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre of Civil Hospital Karachi in a critical condition the other day,” the FIR read.</p>
<p>The complainant said his 19-year-old sister married the suspect on June 15. Her health condition deteriorated on June 30, compelling the family to bring her back home. She informed the parents that on July 17, her husband subjected her to an “unnatural sexual act”, per the FIR.</p>
<p>It added that the husband also sexually assaulted her with a foreign object. Subsequently, the husband subjected her to sexual violence, leading to bleeding. As per the FIR, the suspect threatened his wife with “dire consequences” if she disclosed anything to anyone.</p>
<p>The complainant said the family took his sister to a private hospital on Garden Road when her condition deteriorated, but no improvement was seen. The in-laws again took the victim to their home. Later on, she was brought to the trauma centre on July 4, where she was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), the FIR said, adding that the complainant was seeking legal proceedings against the suspect.</p>
<p>South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the suspect had been arrested and an investigation has been launched.</p>
<p>Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1761373">death penalty</a> or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899694/two-arrested-for-kidnap-gang-rape-of-minor-girl-in-bahawalnagar">prevail</a> in the country.</p>
<p>Last week, police had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922097/karachi-police-arrest-primary-suspect-in-ittehad-town-gang-rape-case">said</a> that they had arrested the primary suspect allegedly involved in the gang-rape of a girl in Ittehad Town.</p>
<p>In May, two sisters were subjected to a sexual assault in their home in North Karachi, police and doctors had said.</p>
<p>In April, in a rare verdict, an additional district and sessions judge in Gujranwala <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903932">handed down</a> 10-year rigorous imprisonment to a man for subjecting his wife to an unnatural sexual offence.</p></p>
