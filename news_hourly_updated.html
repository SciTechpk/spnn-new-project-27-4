                <h2>Fazl, others urge govt to review decision to nominate Trump for Nobel Peace Prize</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistani politicians on Sunday raised their concerns over the government‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514/govt-to-recommend-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize-for-decisive-diplomatic-intervention-in-india-pakistan-crisis">decision</a> to recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, as Washington <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">joined</a> Israel‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">war</a> with Iran.</p>
<p>The government had decided to nominate Trump for the prestigious award to hail his ‚Äúdecisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership‚Äù during last month‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">Pak-India conflict</a>, when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">US mediation</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/GovtofPakistan/status/1936159807326900577" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, it had highlighted that Trump ‚Äúdemonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi‚Äù, which ultimately secured a ceasefire.</p>
<p>However, after the US bombed Iran‚Äôs Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites, with Trump saying they were ‚Äútotally obliterated‚Äù, leaders across the political spectrum joined Pakistani <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193760/can-you-believe-pakistan-nominated-trump-for-a-nobel-peace-prize-the-internet-cant-either">citizens</a> in voicing their reservations.</p>
<p>Veteran politician Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who heads his own faction of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F), demanded that the government rescind its decision.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äôs claim of peace has proven to be false, the proposal for the Nobel Prize should be withdrawn,‚Äù Fazl told workers at a party meeting in Murree today, according to a JUI-F <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/juipakofficial/status/1936808805804765304" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>

<p>He said that Trump‚Äôs recent meeting and lunch with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir ‚Äúpleased Pakistani rulers so much‚Äù that they recommended nominating the US president for the Nobel prize.</p>
<p>The JUI-F chief noted that Trump won the presidential election with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20what%20I%20want%20to%20be%3A%20a%20peacemaker%20and%20unifier.">slogan of peace</a> but was ‚Äúproven false in his claim‚Äù.</p>
<p>Fazl said that when Pakistan ‚Äúdestroyed India‚Äôs defence force‚Äù, President Trump intervened and said he had declared a ceasefire.</p>
<p>‚Äú[But] Trump has supported the Israeli attacks on Palestine, Syria, Lebanon and Iran. How can this be a sign of peace?‚Äù Fazl questioned. ‚ÄúWith the blood of Afghans and Palestinians on America‚Äôs hands, how can he claim to be a proponent of peace?‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump campaigned for office as a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20what%20I%20want%20to%20be%3A%20a%20peacemaker%20and%20unifier.">peacemaker</a>‚Äù who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end wars in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging five months into his presidency.</p>
<p>The US has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1873752">several</a> times <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1815897">vetoed</a> resolutions calling for a ceasefire in Gaza at the UN Security Council, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915498/us-vetoes-security-councils-call-for-gaza-ceasefire">latest</a> earlier this month.</p>

<p>Fazl said his party was in favour of friendship with the US but not of its ‚Äúslavery‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNational sovereignty, the right of the people to govern themselves, and economic freedom should be maintained in relations with America,‚Äù the JUI-F chief asserted.</p>
<p>Fazl further said that in the last three months, a US delegation has visited him three times, after which he attended their diplomatic ceremony in Islamabad.</p>
<p>He also expressed his view that the attacks on Iran were an attempt to stop China‚Äôs economic growth in the Middle East. China is the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899284#:~:text=China%20is%20the%20largest%20importer%20of%20Iranian%20oil.">largest importer</a> of Iranian oil.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan‚Äôs economic strength in the region has been affected the most. The economic balance is shifting towards Asia instead of Europe, which is a good omen for Asia,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p>Calls to reconsider the government‚Äôs decision also came from other politicians.</p>
<p>Former senator Mushahid Hussain <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/Mushahid/status/1936730192094876044" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X: ‚ÄúSince Trump is no longer a potential peacemaker, but a leader who has willfully unleashed an illegal war, [the] Pakistan government must now review, rescind and revoke his Nobel nomination!‚Äù</p>
<p>He said Trump had been ‚Äútrapped by Netanyahu and Israeli war lobby, committing [the] biggest blunder of his presidency‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTrump will now end up presiding over [the] decline of America!‚Äù</p>

                <h2>Suicide bombing at Damascus church kills 20</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least 20 people were killed and dozens injured when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the Mar Elias Church in the Dweila neighbourhood of the Syrian capital Damascus on Sunday, health authorities and security sources said.</p>
<p>It was the first suicide bombing in Damascus since Bashar al-Assad was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1877481">toppled</a> by an Islamist-led rebel insurgency in December.</p>
<p>Syria‚Äôs interior ministry said the suicide bomber was a member of Islamic State. ‚ÄúHe entered the church, opened fire and then detonated his explosive vest,‚Äù a ministry statement added.</p>
<p>A security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two men were involved in the attack, including the one who blew himself up.</p>
<p>Islamic State has been behind several attempted attacks on churches in Syria since Assad‚Äôs fall, but this was the first to succeed, another security source told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>Syria‚Äôs state news agency cited the health ministry as saying that 52 people were also injured in the blast.</p>
<p>A livestream from the site by Syria‚Äôs civil defence, the White Helmets, showed scenes of destruction from inside the church, including a bloodied floor and shattered pews and masonry.</p>
<p>Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the offensive against Assad before taking over in January for a transitional phase, has repeatedly said he will protect minorities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe unequivocally condemn the abhorrent terrorist suicide bombing at the Mar Elias Greek Orthodox Church in Damascus, Syria,‚Äù the Greek foreign ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe demand that the Syrian transitional authorities take immediate action to hold those involved accountable and implement measures to guarantee the safety of Christian communities and all religious groups, allowing them to live without fear.‚Äù</p>
<p>Islamic State had previously targeted religious minorities, including a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1264204">major attack</a> on Shia pilgrims in Sayeda Zainab in 2016 ‚Äî one of the most notorious bombings during Assad‚Äôs rule.</p>
<p>The latest assault underscores the group‚Äôs continued ability to exploit security gaps despite the collapse of its territorial control and years of counterterrorism efforts.</p></p>
