<p>The missile salvo comes after nearly 80 people, including top army officers, were killed while over 300 were wounded in Iran a day ago as a result of Israel‚Äôs strikes on military sites and private residences, according to the country‚Äôs UN envoy Saeed Iravani.</p>

<p>Air raid sirens and explosions rang out across Israel overnight, with its military calling on residents to take refuge in bomb shelters in the morning.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said dozens of missiles ‚Äî some intercepted ‚Äî had been fired in the latest salvos from Iran.</p>
<p>One woman was killed and ‚Äúsome 40 people‚Äù were injured by the Iranian strikes, Israel‚Äôs Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe faced three salvos of ballistic missiles fired from Iran today, about 150 in total,‚Äù Leiter <a class="link--external" href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-news-06-12-25-hnk-intl#cmbviaw2v00003b6wvywxa11k" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>CNN</em>‚Äôs Kaitlan Collins.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe expect that the Iranians, who have a considerable volume of ballistic missiles, somewhere in the neighbourhood of 2,000, will continue to fire them,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIsrael is in war, not with the people of Iran ‚Ä¶ we are in a war against a regime that is intent on achieving nuclear power,‚Äù Leiter said.</p>
<p>He added that Israel wouldn‚Äôt know ‚Äúprecisely how much‚Äù damage it could inflict on Iran‚Äôs nuclear infrastructure until its forces ‚Äúcontinue and complete the campaign‚Äù. ‚ÄúAsk me that question in four or five days,‚Äù the envoy added.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIn this operation, the missile and drone units of the IRGC Aerospace Force employed a combination of precision-guided and smart missile systems to strike military centres, airbases used as launch sites for the criminal aggression against our nation,‚Äù the IRGC statement said.</p>
<p>It added that other targets included ‚Äúmilitary-industrial facilities instrumental in producing missiles and other weaponry for the Zionist regime‚Äôs army to commit crimes against the resistant nations of the region ‚Äî particularly the oppressed people of Palestine and Gaza‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúField reports, satellite imagery and intelligence intercepts confirm the effective impact of dozens of ballistic missiles on strategic targets in occupied Palestine.

<p>The conflict raised questions as to whether Sunday‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">sixth round of talks</a> planned between the United States and Iran to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906722">seek a deal</a> on Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme would go ahead in Oman.</p>
<p>After the first wave of strikes on Friday, Trump urged Iran to ‚Äúmake a deal‚Äù while noting that a 60-day ultimatum had expired. He added that Washington was ‚Äúhoping to get back to the negotiating table‚Äù.</p>

<p>After months of urging Israel not to strike Iran while he worked toward a nuclear deal, Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-tells-reuters-its-unclear-if-iran-still-has-nuclear-program-2025-06-13/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Reuters</em></a> in a phone interview on Friday that he and his team had known the attacks were coming ‚Äî and still saw room for an accord.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe knew everything, and I tried to save Iran [from] humiliation and death. I tried to save them very hard because I would have loved to have seen a deal worked out,‚Äù Trump said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey can still work out a deal, however, it‚Äôs not too late,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs shifting stance around the Israeli strikes, which he called ‚Äú<a class="link--external" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-tells-abc-israel-strikes-iran-excellent-warns/story?id=122807155" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">excellent</a>‚Äù and ‚Äú<a class="link--external" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/12/politics/trump-israel-iran-strike#:~:text=called%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20strikes%20on%20Iran%20overnight%20%E2%80%9Ca%20very%20successful%20attack" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">very successful</a>‚Äù in a series of media interviews on Friday, offered one of the most striking examples yet of how he conducts high-stakes negotiations through both frank public rhetoric and behind-the-scenes maneuovers.</p>

<p>Iran confirmed that above-ground sections of the Natanz enrichment plant had been destroyed, but the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said radiation levels outside the site ‚Äúremained unchanged‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMost of the damage is on the surface level,‚Äù said the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran‚Äôs spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi.</p>
<p>Iran said there was only limited damage to the Fordo and Isfahan nuclear sites.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Israel‚Äôs strikes against Iran a ‚Äúunilateral action‚Äù and said Washington was not involved, while also urging Tehran not to target US interests or personnel in the region.</p>
<p>However, a US official told <em>AFP</em> that Washington was helping Israel defend against Iranian missile attacks.</p>

<p>The United States and other Western governments have repeatedly accused Iran of seeking a nuclear weapon, an ambition it has consistently denied.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said Israeli intelligence had concluded that Iran was approaching the ‚Äúpoint of no return‚Äù on its nuclear programme.</p>
<p>Israel had called for global action after the IAEA accused Iran on Thursday of non-compliance with its obligations.</p>
<p>Iran currently enriches uranium to 60 per cent, far above the 3.67pc limit set by a largely moribund <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1194411">2015 agreement</a> with major powers, but still short of the 90pc threshold needed for a nuclear warhead.</p></p>

                <h2>Pakistan warns UNSC of ‚Äògrave threat to world peace‚Äô posed by Israeli strikes on Iran</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Israel‚Äôs strikes on Iranian nuclear and military facilities constitute a ‚Äúgrave danger and a serious threat‚Äù to the peace, security, and stability of the entire region and beyond, Pakistan told the United Nations Security Council during an emergency session convened on Friday, the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/foreign-correspondent/pakistan-warns-unsc-of-grave-threat-to-world-peace-posed-by-israeli-strikes-on-military-targets-in-iran/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>Israel on Friday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">launched</a> widescale strikes on Iran, claiming that it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories, and military commanders. Iran‚Äôs ambassador told the UN that 78 people had been killed and 320 wounded in the first wave of strikes by Israel.  In a message, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks were the beginning of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.</p>
<p>Iranian media and witnesses reported explosions, including at the country‚Äôs main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, <em>Reuters</em> reported. Iran‚Äôs elite Revolutionary Guards corps said its top commander, Hossein Salami, was killed, and state media reported the unit‚Äôs headquarters in Tehran had been hit. Six Iranian nuclear scientists were killed, Iranian state media reported.</p>
<p>In his remarks, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, strongly condemned the ‚Äúunjustified and illegitimate‚Äù aggression by Israel against Iran, reaffirming that Islamabad stood in resolute solidarity with the Iranian government and people.</p>

<p>Iran‚Äôs Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi requested the Security Council meeting, saying Israel ‚Äúhas now crossed every red line, and the international community must not allow these crimes to go unpunished‚Äù.</p>
<p>Among those supporting the request for a meeting were Algeria, Pakistan, China and Russia.</p>
<p>Amid escalating tensions, the Pakistani envoy urged the Security Council to discharge its responsibility to uphold international law and stop this aggression immediately.</p>
<p>Ambassador Asim strongly called for the resolution of the crisis through dialogue and diplomacy</p>
<p>Briefing the Security Council, UN Under-Secretary-General for political affairs Rosemary DiCarlo, told ambassadors that the repercussions of the attacks were already reverberating.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI reaffirm the Secretary-General‚Äôs condemnation of any military escalation in the Middle East,‚Äù she said, urging both Israel and Iran to exercise maximum restraint and ‚Äúavoid at all costs a descent into deeper and wider regional conflict‚Äù.</p>
<p>She also noted that the military escalation came just as ‚Äúsome significant diplomatic developments‚Äù were unfolding, including the planned <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">resumption</a> of United States-Iranian talks in Oman at the weekend. Latest reports indicate that Iran will no longer attend.</p>
<p>DiCarlo urged parties to stay the diplomatic course.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA peaceful resolution through negotiations remains the best means to ensure the peaceful nature of Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe must at all costs avoid a growing conflagration which would have enormous global consequences.‚Äù</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916989/un-security-council-warned-of-deepening-crisis-in-middle-east">briefing</a> the Council, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi said his agency was in constant contact with the Iranian Nuclear Regulatory Authority to assess the status of affected facilities and determine broader impacts on nuclear safety and security.</p>
<p>He stressed that nuclear sites must never be targeted ‚Äî under any circumstances.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSuch attacks have serious implications for nuclear security, nuclear safety and safeguards, as well as regional and international peace and security,‚Äù Grossi said.</p>
<p>He stands ready to travel to the region at the earliest opportunity, he added, to assess the situation and support safety, security and non-proliferation efforts in Iran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is clear that the only sustainable path forward for Iran, for Israel, the entire region and the international community is one grounded in dialogue and diplomacy to ensure peace, stability and cooperation.‚Äù</p>
<p>Grossi concluded by offering the IAEA as a neutral platform where ‚Äúfacts prevail over rhetoric‚Äù and where technical engagement replace escalation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI reaffirm my personal and the agency‚Äôs readiness to facilitate dialogue and support efforts that promote transparency, security and the peaceful resolution of nuclear issues in Iran.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pakistan came out strongly in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917004">support</a> of Iran‚Äôs right to self-defence, following Israeli military strikes on Iranian targets, distinguishing its position from most other regional and global powers.</p>
<p>The Pakistani position was more than a diplomatic footnote; rather a bold assertion of principle in a region accustomed to cautious ambiguity.</p>

<p>When the Foreign Office described Isr¬≠¬≠ael‚Äôs action as ‚Äúunjustified and illegitim¬≠a¬≠¬≠te aggression‚Äù that violated ‚Äúthe soverei¬≠g¬≠nty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran‚Äù and flouted the UN Charter, it did not stop at condemnation.</p>
<p>It explicitly mentioned Article 51: ‚ÄúIran has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.‚Äù The statement further urged the world to ‚Äúhold the aggressor accountable for its actions.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a call with the Iranian foreign minister, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar condemned the blatant Israeli aggression and reiterated Islamabad‚Äôs strong support to Iran for the sake of peace in the region.</p>
<p>He also conveyed the deepest sympathies on the loss of many precious lives in Israeli attacks on Iranian territory.</p></p>
