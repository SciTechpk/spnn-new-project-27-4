            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912622/armys-top-brass-vows-to-stop-externally-sponsored-terrorists-from-destroying-national-peace-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Army’s top brass vows to stop ‘externally-sponsored terrorists’ from destroying national peace: ISPR</strong></a>
            <p><p>The armed forces have vowed to prevent the country’s peace being compromised by externally-sponsored terrorism, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A day earlier, at least six people, including three students, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912572/bla-and-ttp-are-indian-proxies-govt-will-prove-indias-involvement-in-khuzdar-bus-attack-asif">slain</a> while over 40 others — mostly students — were injured after a bomb targeted a school bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.</p>
<p>According to a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7300" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the vow was made during the 270th Corps Commander Conference (CCC) at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, chaired by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir.</p>
<p>“A comprehensive review of the prevailing internal and external security environment was undertaken, with particular emphasis on the successful conclusion of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910729/operation-bunyanum-marsoos-11-soldiers-martyred-78-wounded-while-defending-pakistan">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a>, a decisive chapter of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566/marka-i-haq-pakistan-army-names-period-of-conflict-with-india-since-april-22-may-10">Marka-i-Haq</a>,” the statement read.</p>
<p>It was observed that “following its military failure in the wake of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam incident</a>, India so-called and self-claimed victim of terrorism, but actually a perpetrator of terrorism and the epicentre of regional instability, has upscaled the use of covert means, employing non-state actors to pursue its destabilisation agenda,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p>“The forum resolved that Pakistan will never allow its peace to be compromised by externally-sponsored terrorism. The Armed Forces, in close synergy with intelligence and law enforcement agencies, will pursue all proxies and facilitators of terrorism with unrelenting resolve.</p>
<p>“These hostile elements, trained and financed to incite chaos and fear, will be dismantled and decimated with the full force of national will and institutional strength.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>It further said that the nation will take “all measures necessary to safeguard its vital interests”.</p>
<p>The conference also deliberated on the regional environment in India-occupied Kashmir and along the working boundary with India, expressing “deep concern” over human rights violations committed by Indian forces against Kashmiris. The forum also congratulated COAS Munir on his promotion to the rank of field marshal.</p>
<p>“[The] forum underscored the urgent need for international attention and intervention to prevent further deterioration of peace and security in South Asia,” the statement read. “[The] forum reiterated full diplomatic, political, moral and humanitarian support for Kashmiri brothers and sisters and their just resistance for [the] right of self-determination.”</p>
<p>Additionally, the meeting paid tribute to the martyrs of Marka-i-Haq and reaffirmed that the “sacred blood of the <em>shuhuda</em> (martyrs)” would not go in vain, while also recognising the spirit and dynamic contributions of the youth and Pakistan’s “media and information warriors” for their role during the brief conflict.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357">statement</a> by the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday claimed that the Khuzdar attack was carried out by “state-sponsored proxies of India (<em>Fitna al Hindustan</em>)” and added that “dastardly terrorist incidents” were being orchestrated through proxies in Balochistan and KP, “deliberately targeting civilians in a futile attempt to destabilise Pakistan”.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">ranked second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>
<p>However, a significant improvement was seen in Pakistan’s internal security landscape in April 2025, “as both militant attacks and resultant casualties dropped sharply compared to March”, according to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907799">data</a> released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) on May 2.</p>

<p>Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday presented Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Asim Munir with the baton of field marshal, formally marking the latter’s promotion to the highest rank in the military.</p>
<p>The rank of field marshal is the highest rank of armies built on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912572/bla-and-ttp-are-indian-proxies-govt-will-prove-indias-involvement-in-khuzdar-bus-attack-asif">pattern</a> of the British Army. It has only been awarded to one other — General Mohammad Ayub Khan — by the presidential cabinet in <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7300" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1959</a>. It is a ceremonial five-star rank that usually signifies extraordinary leadership and wartime achievement.</p>
<p>The federal cabinet on Tuesday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910729/operation-bunyanum-marsoos-11-soldiers-martyred-78-wounded-while-defending-pakistan">approved</a> the promotion of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir to field marshal for his leadership in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and the period of conflict against India known as Marka-i-Haq. He was formally promoted to the position with immediate effect in a notification from the Ministry of Defence under “Rule 199-A of the Pakistan Army Regulations (Rules), 1998”.</p>

<p>The ceremony to confer the baton was held at the Presidency in Islamabad on Thursday, attended by the president, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and civilian and military officials.</p>
<p>After he and President Zardari conferred the baton to Field Marshal Munir, PM Shehbaz said during his address, “Today is a moment of profound national pride and historic importance for Pakistan. We salute our national heroes, COAS Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.</p>
<p>“You have led our brave armed forces to a remarkable victory against an enemy caught in its own web of arrogance and hubris,” the PM said, addressing Munir.</p>
<p>“The aggressor was brought to its knees and taught a lesson. What transpired during those challenging days will not only be remembered for all times to come as an outstanding military victory but also as a moral and diplomatic triumph.”</p>
<p>The PM said that the field marshal “led our armed forces with great tenacity and indomitable resolve”. He thanked Munir for “his command during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and his resolute courage in safeguarding Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.</p>
<p>“The nation was granted a most glorious victory, which we will remember for the rest of our lives,” he added. “He not only thwarted the nefarious designs of the adversary, but rewrote the history of warfare.”</p>

<p>President Zardari paid tribute to the armed forces for defending “the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our motherland against unprovoked Indian aggression”.</p>
<p>“The entire nation is proud of all of you,” he said.</p>
<p>The president officially promoted Munir to the rank of field marshal and conferred the baton “in recognition of extraordinary services to Pakistan through the turbulent period and with full confidence in his command and character”.</p>
<p>“Your military career is forged with courage and defined by wisdom and commitment to lead with vision, strength and honour at the highest level of our armed forces,” Zardari said. “Throughout this week of Marka-i-Haq Field Marshal Asim displayed a pragmatic understanding of the need to avoid escalation.”</p></p>

            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump’s administration on Thursday revoked Harvard’s right to enrol foreign students — more than a quarter of its annual enrollment — in a major escalation of the president’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908798">fight</a> with one of the world’s most storied universities.</p>
<p>Trump is furious at Harvard, which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners, for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904734">hotbed</a> of anti-Semitism and “woke” liberal ideology.</p>
<p>“Effective immediately, Harvard University’s Student and Exchange Visitor (Sevis) Programme certification is revoked,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the Ivy League institution, referring to the main system by which foreign students are permitted to study in the United States.</p>
<p>Last month, Trump threatened to stop Harvard from enrolling foreign students if it did not agree to government demands that would put the private institution under outside political supervision.</p>
<p>“As I explained to you in my April letter, it is a privilege to enrol foreign students,” Noem wrote.</p>
<p>“All universities must comply with Department of Homeland Security requirements, including reporting requirements under the Student and Exchange Visitor Programme regulations, to maintain this privilege,” she said.</p>
<p>“As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ policies, you have lost this privilege.”</p>
<p>More than 27 per cent of Harvard’s enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data.</p>
<p>Harvard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></p>

            <p><p>A man and his two sons were shot dead in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mardan district, police and rescue officials said on Thursday, adding that the five suspects had fled the scene.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 Mardan spokesperson Mohammad Abbas Shah told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the incident took place on Wednesday and that a case was registered at Shahbaz Garhi police station on the complaint of the victim’s sister.</p>
<p>“Five suspects opened fire on the victims, Qubad Khan and his sons, in a field in the Gariala area of Mardan,” Shah said. “The victim and his young sons died at the scene, while women nearby were able to narrowly escape.”</p>
<p>He added that the suspects were able to flee the scene after the incident.</p>
<p>According to the police report, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, the suspects were charged under sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of a common object), 302 (punishment for murder) and 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, six people, including three women, lost their lives in an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911967">exchange of fire</a> over a family feud in the Khatko Pul area of Peshawar, according to a Rescue 1122 spokesperson.</p>
<p>Seven people were reported to have been shot in the exchange of fire between two families, six of whom died on the spot.</p>
<p>The deceased have been identified as Fazl Amin, Hazrat Amin, Ahmed, along with three women. Another woman was reported to be critically injured and has been shifted to Lady Reading Hospital.</p></p>
