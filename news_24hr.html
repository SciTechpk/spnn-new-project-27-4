            <p><p>• Over 500 injured nationwide since rains began<br />
• NDMA blames climate change, glacier melt for floods<br />
• PDMA issues fourth spell alert as rivers swell<br />
• Rs5m relief package announced in Punjab</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: As the country grapples with a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919360">monsoon season</a> that has intensified by up to 60 per cent over previous years, the national and provincial disaster management authorities have predicted further rains in the coming days.</p>
<p>According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), at least 180 people have already been killed and more than 500 injured so far since the rains began unusually early in July.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Saturday forecast further rain, wind and thundershowers, with isolated heavy falls, in Sindh over the next 24 hours. Cities and districts likely to be affected include Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Thatta, Badin, Larkana, Jaco­babad, Nawabshah, Mirpurkhas and others.</p>
<p>The NDMA’s NEOC has also issued alerts for urban flooding in low-lying parts of Sindh. It advised citizens to stay indoors during intense rainfall, avoid travelling to vulnerable areas and ensure household drainage systems remain clear.</p>
<p>The Provincial Disaster Mana­gement Authority (PDMA) of Punjab also issued an alert about the fourth spell of monsoon rains starting from July 20 (today). It forecasted strong winds, dusty winds and rain in most districts of Punjab from July 20 to 25.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>Rain with strong winds is predicted in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Mandi Bahauddin, Hafizabad, Gujrat, Jhelum and Gujranwala. There are also chances of rain in Lahore, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Narowal, Toba Tek Singh, Jhang, Sargodha, Mianwali, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur and Bahaw­alnagar from July 18 to 23.</p>
<p>The PDMA also issued a high-level flood pre-alert for all major rivers and associated streams acro­ss the province, warning of pote­ntial flooding from July 22 due to an incoming weather system.</p>

<p>According to the Flood Forecasting Division, increased water flows are expected in the Chenab, Jhelum, Ravi, Sutlej and Indus rivers, along with their tributaries and low-lying areas, posing significant risks.</p>
<p><strong>KP, Islamabad on alert</strong></p>
<p>In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the monsoon system and glacial melt pose serious risks of flash flooding, particularly in the rivers Kabul, Swat, Panjkora, Bara and Kalpani Nullah. The NDMA warned of potential disruptions in transport across hilly and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>In Islamabad and central Punjab, strong monsoon currents are forecast to bring moderate to heavy rainfall through July 24, increasing the risk of urban flooding.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, due to rising water levels from recent downpours, the Rawal Dam reached its full capacity of 1,748 feet. Authorities announced the opening of its spillways at 6am on Sunday to reduce the level to 1,746 feet. Residents nearby have been advised to stay cautious.</p>
<p><strong>Three children die in Attock</strong></p>
<p>In a series of rain-related incidents in Attock, three children lost their lives on Saturday. A six-year-old girl, Fatima, drowned in a water channel in Amanpur, 12-year-old Muhammad Suleman died when the roof of his house collapsed in Bhattar, and five-year-old Umer Ayub was electrocuted in Ghourghushti after touching a live electric pole.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in an incident unrelated to the rains, a man was shot dead in Mirza village in a targeted attack. Police said Inayat Rehman, 45, was going towards the mosque when two men hiding in a restaurant opened fire, killing him on the spot.</p>
<p><strong>Over 1,500 rescued in Punjab</strong></p>
<p>In Punjab, Rescue 1122 has rescued 1,594 people since June 25 in rain and flood-related emergencies, according to Secretary Emergency Services Dr Rizwan Naseer. Of these, 449 were seriously injured and shifted to hospitals. Moreover, 119 deaths have been confirmed, the majority due to the collapse of dilapidated buildings.</p>
<p>Rescue efforts included pre-emptive evacuation of 444 residents from high-risk areas and the deployment of over 100 boats and 312 rescue personnel. Lahore recorded the highest deaths at 27, followed by 15 in Faisalabad, 11 in Sheikhupura and 10 in Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>Since June 25, 369 building collapse incidents, 23 electrocutions, 62 rain-related crashes and multiple other emergencies have been reported, Dr Naseer said.</p>
<p>He urged the public to inspect rooftops, avoid contact with electric poles during rainfall and check forecasts before travelling to flood-prone or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif directed the immediate restoration of flood-affected roads. Key arteries including Pind Dadan Khan-Jhelum Road, Matta Khurd Road, and Chakwal-Kallar Kahar Road have been reopened. In Rawalpindi, the Crowley Dhok Bridge and Dhok Parwana Road, damaged by floodwater, were also made accessible.</p>
<p>The chief minister also visited Chakwal on Saturday, where she announced Rs5 million in compensation for families of the deceased.</p>
<p>Five lives were lost in Chakwal’s record-breaking 430mm downpour earlier in the week. CM Maryam chaired a briefing at the district complex and commended district officials for their round-the-clock rescue efforts.</p>
<p>She ordered the evacuation of families from houses deemed vulnerable ahead of the next spell, and ordered the installation of a steel bridge at Dumman on the Chakwal-Sohawa Road, a key artery damaged by soil erosion. She also sought reports on privately built mini-dams, which worsened flooding in parts of Chakwal and Talagang.</p>
<p>The Punjab government on Saturday decided to ensure drainage in private housing societies, install modern alarm systems around Rawalpindi Nallah Lei and evacuate people living near the basins of Ravi, Sutlej and Beas rivers.</p>
<p><strong>Intensified monsoon</strong></p>
<p>NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik stated that this year’s unusually severe monsoon season, which he said began a month earlier than usual in July, was forecast by the authority four months in advance. He said the current monsoon season has intensified by up to 60pc compared to previous years. In an interview with <em>PTV News</em>, he emphasised that comprehensive disaster response measures had been put in place under the guidance of the prime minister, with coordinated efforts from the armed forces, PDMAs and key stakeholders including NGOs and industries.</p>
<p>He attributed the heightened rainfall and disaster risk to climate change and accelerated glacier melting.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925309/pakistan-us-near-breakthrough-as-trade-talks-enter-final-stage' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, US near breakthrough as trade talks enter final stage</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Aurangzeb returns home, dubs ongoing discussions ‘very constructive’<br />
• Dar to visit US next week to attend high-level signature events</p>
<p>WASHINGTON/ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has said that Pakistan and the United States are close to concluding a crucial trade agreement as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922229/pakistan-us-reach-accord-on-trade-and-tariffs">negotiations</a> in Washington entered their final phase.</p>
<p>Both sides expressed optimism that the deal would pave the way for a broader and more strategic economic partnership.</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb and his team returned to Pakistan early Saturday after two days of high-level talks in Washington.</p>
<p>In a statement after a key meeting on Friday with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer, Mr Aurangzeb described the discussions as “very constructive” and pointed to “clear commitment from both sides” to resolve outstanding issues.</p>
<p>“We had a very constructive dialogue with Secretary Lutnick and Ambassador Greer,” said the finance minister. “There is a very clear commitment from both sides to get closure on the remaining items so that we can move towards the finishing line.”</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb was joined in the meetings by Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh and Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul.</p>
<p>“This is very important for us because the US is Pakistan’s largest trading partner,” he said. “It is critical that we move forward in the same positive spirit that has defined our discussions over the past few weeks and months.”</p>
<p>The talks are part of Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to shield its exports from steep <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904017">US tariffs</a> — currently at 29 per cent under President Donald Trump’s trade policy aimed at reducing American deficits with trading partners. Pakistan’s surplus stood at around $3 billion in 2024.</p>
<p>Islamabad has responded by offering to import more US goods, including crude oil, and by opening investment opportunities in key sectors such as mining, digital infrastructure, and technology.</p>
<p>A Pakistani delegation, led by Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul, also visited Washington in early July with the aim of finalising a long-term reciprocal tariff agreement that would prevent the re-imposition of the 29pc tariff on Pakistani exports.</p>
<p>Officials familiar with the negotiations say the talks were successful, with both sides agreeing to a broad framework.</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb said both sides agreed that the relationship should not be limited to trade alone. “We have to move beyond the immediate trade imperative,” he noted. “For the Pakistan-US relationship to move to the next level, investment is the key — and we believe areas like minerals, AI, and crypto could be real game changers.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He also said that ongoing trade talks would soon be followed by a new phase of dialogue focusing on bilateral investment. “Trade is the starting point,” he explained, “but it will very quickly be followed through with investment discussions and real execution of the investment upside available to both sides — so that it becomes a real win-win for Pakistan and the United States.”</p>
<p>Sources close to the talks say that while a broad understanding has already been reached, a formal announcement is expected only after the US concludes similar deals with other partners.</p>
<p>The renewed momentum in US-Pakistan ties follows last month’s White House <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044">meeting</a> between President Trump and Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir — the first such meeting in recent memory — signaling a strategic reset in the relationship.</p>
<p>Since the start of his second term, President Trump has signaled a desire to improve relations with Pakistan. In his inaugural address to Congress, he publicly thanked Pakistan for capturing and handing over a notorious terrorist, a gesture that was well received in Islamabad.</p>

<p><strong>Dar to visit US</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Senator Muhammad Ishaq Dar, is scheduled to visit the United States next week to attend the high-level signature events of Pakistan’s UN Security Council (UNSC) Presidency in New York, as well as to participate in various engagements in Washington. In New York, as part of Pakistan’s Security Council signature events, he will chair a high-level open debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes”.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr Dar will preside over the quarterly open debate of the Security Council on the “Situation in the Middle East including the Palestinian Question”.</p>
<p>He will also chair a high-level briefing of the UN Security Council that will focus on enhancing cooperation between the UN and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).</p>
<p>The deputy prime minister is scheduled to attend the high-level conference on “Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of Two-State Solution”.</p>

            <p><p>ISLAMABAD:  Climate change could significantly slow progress in poverty reduction and climate-induced income losses could push an additional 41 million people into extreme poverty by 2050, according to a new World Bank report.</p>
<p>The projections show the number of poor could rise by up to 148.8 million, with those in South Asia projected to be at 48.8m by  2030.</p>
<p>As per the findings — part of the report titled ‘The Future of Poverty’: Projecting the Impact of Climate Change on Global Pov­erty  through 2050 — the number of people living in extreme poverty worldwide could be nearly doubled due to climate change.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The rise in poverty due to climate change is likely to be profound in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean, where the effects of extreme weather events are likely to interact with existing structural vulnerabilities and weaker social protection systems.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>WB report emphasises need for social safety nets, subsidies for less privileged</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The study emphasised international cooperation will be essential for addressing the global nature of the climate challenge.</p>
<p>High-income countries, which have contributed the most to global emissions, have a responsibility to support low- and middle-income countries in their efforts to adapt to climate change, it said.</p>
<p>This includes providing financial resources, technology transfer, and capacity-building support to help countries build resilience to climate shocks and transition to low-carbon development pathways.</p>
<p>The WB report said efforts to reduce income inequality must be central to any poverty reduction strategy, as the projections show, even small increases in inequality can lead to large increases in poverty.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Policies that promote inclusive economic growth, reduce barriers to education and employment and enhance social protection systems will be critical for ensuring the benefits of economic development are shared more broadly, according to the study.</p>
<p>It stressed the need to  streng­th­­­­en social safety nets and provide targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>This includes expanding access to healthcare, education, and financial services, as well as improving the resilience of livelihoods through investments in agriculture, infrastructure, and climate adaptation measures.</p>
<p>According to the report, climate change-induced rising food prices may significantly increase global poverty, particularly in the developing world, where food consumption accounts for a large share of household expenditures.</p>
<p>If nothing changes, the projections suggest that global economic output could be reduced by 23pc by 2100 compared to a world without climate change.</p>
<p>In most scenarios, projected global income losses exceed 20pc, underscoring the potentially severe economic consequences of inaction.</p>
<p>The report said even though rich and poor countries respond similarly to temperature chan­ges, the economic impacts are substantially larger for the latter, as these are predominantly located in already warm regions.</p>
