                <h2>8 bodies recovered among 18 reported missing in Swat River flash floods</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Rescue teams on Friday recovered eight bodies after 18 people were earlier reported missing due to flash floods in Swat River following heavy rains, according to officials.</p>
<p>Flash floods prompted by heavy rain in Swat district have engulfed several areas, resulting in the loss of life with reports of dozens stranded, according to an initial report by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122.</p>
<p>According to a statement by the KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah, eight bodies have been recovered among 18 people who went missing, with three people being rescued.</p>
<p>The incident prompted the provincial government to immediately launch a rescue operation, the statement said, adding, “Rescue operations are currently being conducted at eight different locations in Swat.”</p>
<p>The statement further said, “A total of 75 people were trapped at different places along the Swat River on the bypass road,” adding that 58 of them had been rescued alive.</p>
<p>The provincial government has formed a committee to inquire into the matter, it added.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Faizi confirmed that eight bodies were recovered from reports of 16 people gone missing.</p>
<p>According to the initial report by KP Rescue 1122, search and rescue operations were underway for the remaining bodies in several areas.</p>
<p>Three bodies have been recovered from Ingaroderai. One body was also recovered from Ghalegy, where seven people were stranded and rescue operations are still underway.</p>
<p>More 10 people have drowned at the Bypass Relax Hotel, the report confirmed.</p>
<p>At least 120 Rescue 1122 personnel have been deployed in rescue operations.</p>
<p>“More than 22 people were trapped in the water in Imam Dhirai, who were rescued safely by the team of Rescue Station 33,” the report stated, adding that the search operation of Rescue Station 44 was ongoing.</p>
<p>Seven people are also reported to be trapped in Manyar, with Rescue Stations 44 and 55 working jointly in rescue activities.</p>
<p>One person was trapped at Panjigram village, where a rescue operation was underway.</p>
<p>At least 20 to 30 people have been rescued from Bara Bamakhela, the report said.</p>
<p>“All Rescue 1122 teams are present on site and rescue operations are in full swing,” the report said.</p>
<p>A flood alert has been issued by the Charsadda Deputy Commissioner Qaiser Khan asking relevant staff to be on high alert following flooding in Swat.</p>
<p>A notice from the DC’s office said the “discharge at Khwazakela in River Swat has increased to 77,782 cusecs, categorised as a very high flood.”</p>
<p>DC Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em> that rescue teams had been deployed to the bank of River Kabul and River Swat.</p>
<p>“Announcements were made via mosque loudspeakers to inform the public about the dangers of floodwater,” the DC said, adding that officials were instructing people to move to safer places.</p>
<p>“We are keeping an eye on the Munda headworks; till 3pm, the flow was normal.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Former climate change minister and PPP Senator Sherry Rehman has said that the continued “sleepwalk” on climate stress was triggering such incidents.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/sherryrehman/status/1938536887544676708" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, she wrote, “The tragic drowning of several people in the River Swat is NOT the result of a random ‘natural disaster’.”</p>
<p>“We need to understand that this and other disasters are the deadly impact of super heavy monsoons in Swat, all triggered by climate stress, and it is not just one area,” she added.</p>
<p>Rehman also said that the district and provincial administration had alerted but “early warning systems are being ignored by the general public in KP”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan needs to understand that such hazards are triggered by global warming and climate change … So please stop calling it a natural disaster or a random flash flood that is disconnected from human actions or responsibility.”</p>

<p>The KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued a flood alert after water discharge levels at Khwazakhela in Swat River surged to 77,782 cusecs, categorising it as a very high flood situation due to the ongoing heavy rainfall in the region.</p>
<p>In an official communication addressed to the Deputy Commissioners of Peshawar, Charsadda, and Nowshera, the PDMA advised all concerned authorities to take urgent precautionary measures to prevent any loss of life, damage to infrastructure, crops and livestock.</p>
<p>The PDMA directed local administrations to immediately identify vulnerable points and at-risk communities and put in place effective safety and mitigation measures. It emphasised maintaining a heightened state of alert, with constant monitoring of the evolving flood situation to ensure a timely response.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122, Civil Defence, and all other emergency services have been instructed to stay on high alert, particularly in low-lying and high-risk areas.</p>
<p>Communities living along the banks of Kabul River and its tributaries are being sensitised to the expected rise in water levels.</p>
<p>Local authorities have been advised to ensure timely evacuation of at-risk populations in flood-prone areas in accordance with existing evacuation plans, and to ensure the availability of shelter, food, and medical supplies in designated camps.</p>
<p>Farmers and cattle herders have been warned to move their livestock to safer locations away from low-lying riverbanks, while the general public is urged to avoid unnecessary travel or vehicle movement in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>The PDMA also directed concerned departments to remain ready for road clearance operations in case of blockages or waterlogging, and to pre-position emergency equipment at critical locations.</p>
<p>The Provincial Emergency Operations Center (PEOC) at PDMA remains active 24/7 and can be reached via helpline 1700 for any assistance or guidance.</p></p>

<p>In its July 12, 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">short order</a>, eight out of 13 judges ruled that 39 out of a list of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621#:~:text=the%20verdict%20stated.-,List%20of%2080%20MNAs,-The%20verdict%20listed">80 MNAs</a> were and are the returned candidates of the PTI, setting it to emerge as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845532">single largest party</a> in the National Assembly.</p>

<p>An 11-member bench headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan resumed the hearing today.</p>
<p>Initially, a full-strength 13-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin took up the review pleas on May 6. However, Justices Ayesha and Abbasi declared the applications as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908809/two-judges-object-as-sc-accepts-review-pleas-on-reserved-seats-for-hearing">inadmissible</a> and were not part of the subsequent proceedings, with the CB head judge noting they had stepped back voluntarily.</p>
<p>Justice Ayesha had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909890/justice-ayesha-malik-piqued-by-failure-to-upload-dissenting-order">formally complained</a> to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi about her dissenting order not being uploaded to the SC’s website.</p>
<p>In her <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909890/justice-ayesha-malik-piqued-by-failure-to-upload-dissenting-order#:~:text=Justice%20Malik%20while%20rejecting%20the%20review%20petitions%20observed%20that%20the%20ECP%20and%20other%20petitioners%20could%20not%20reargue%20the%20case%20under%20the%20review%20jurisdiction">judgement</a>, she had criticised the ECP for not implementing the earlier order, observing that it would “not only undermine the authority of the Supreme Court but also erode the foundational values of democracy itself”.</p>
<p>The SIC, which allied with the PTI during the 2024 elections and was a party in the reserved seats case, had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911722/sic-seeks-fresh-bench-for-reserved-seats-case-review">requested</a> the bench to put off the hearing until challenges to the 26th Amendment were decided and to include judges who had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908809/two-judges-object-as-sc-accepts-review-pleas-on-reserved-seats-for-hearing#:~:text=are%20not%20part%20of%20the%20CB">heard the original case</a>.</p>
<p>However, the CB <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912745/sc-allows-live-streaming-of-reserved-seats-review-case#:~:text=dismissed%20other%20applications%20seeking">dismissed</a> those pleas, with Justice Aminuddin <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912136/smaller-bench-can-review-cases-after-26th-amendment-scs-justice-aminuddin">observing</a> that review petitions could be heard even by a bench smaller than the original bench after the 26th Amendment.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#the-hearing" id="the-hearing" title="Permalink"></a>The hearing</h2>
<p>Justice Panhwar noted that Hamid Khan, counsel for the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), had yesterday raised an objection to the bench.</p>
<p>“Hamid Khan raised an objection to the inclusion of judges in the bench who came to the Supreme Court after the 26th Amendment in the bench,” Justice Panhwar said, noting that he is one of the judges included in the objection.</p>
<p>“Public trust in the judiciary is essential,” Panhwar stated.</p>
<p>“It is essential that no party has any objection to the bench,” he said. “It is because of these objections that I cannot sit on this bench.”</p>
<p>The judge told Khan that although he was hurt by his remarks — having worked together since 2010 — this was not a personal matter.</p>
<p>Khan said he appreciated Panhwar’s decision.</p>
<p>However, Justice Aminuddin Khan told him that this was not a matter to be appreciated. “This is a result of your conduct,” he said.</p>
<p>“We gave you respect, that’s why we are listening to you, otherwise we were not under any obligation to hear you,” Justice Khan said. “We gave you this opportunity, don’t misuse it.”</p>
<p>Following Justice Panhwar’s recusal, the SIC’s counsel also objected to a 10-memebr bench taking up the hearing.</p>
<p>To this, Justice Mandokhail questioned under which law the counsel was making this argument.</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail added that the 10-member bench will continue hearing cases.</p>
<p>“Giving respect is what gets you respect,” he told Khan. “Whatever respect you have today is because of the Supreme Court.”</p>
<p>“Today we are here, tomorrow we will not be here, you will not be here,” Justice Mandokhail said.</p>
<p>The SIC counsel told Justice Mandokhail not to use the case if he was angry.</p>
<p>Justice Aminuddin interjected here, asking the SIC counsel what objection he had.</p>
<p>“My objection is that a twelve-member bench cannot hear the review of the decision of a thirteen-member bench,” Khan said.</p>
<p>Justice Aminuddin rejected this objection and asked him to proceed with his arguments.</p>
<p>Here, the debate between Khan and the judges became heated.</p>
<p>“The SIC lawyer had given his arguments, you had no right to speak,” Justice Mandokhail said. “We gave you respect.”</p>
<p>The SIC counsel responded saying: “you are not authorised to tell me not to speak.”</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail told Khan that the SIC had appointed Faisal Siddiqui as its lawyer, not him. “You have 10 minutes to make your argument, otherwise sit down.”</p>
<p>Khan said: “You are angry, do not hear the case just now.”</p>
<p>The conversation continued in a confrontational manner, with Justice Mandokhail telling him to sit down if he does not want to present his arguments.</p>
<p>“I know how to do my job, you be careful with your words,” Justice Mandokhail said. “I have skipped my mother’s funeral to be here and you are joking.”</p>
<p>He noted that the bench would not hear anything irrelevant and had already heard enough.</p>
<p>“We consider you a good lawyer, but what you are doing right now is not the work of a good lawyer,” Justice Mandokhail said.</p>
<p>Khan told him he had no right to say such a thing, to which Mandokhail again reminded him he had 10 minutes to present his arguments.</p>
<p>“It’s not as if we don’t know how to be strict.”</p>
<p>The SIC counsel asserted that the Judicial Commission forms a bench, to which Justice Mandokhail asked him under which law he has made this assertion.</p>
<p>“According to Article 191A of the 26th Amendment,” Khan said.</p>
<p>“You are against the 26th Amendment, how are you now referencing it?” Justice Mandokhail quipped.</p>
<p>“This is why I had said to make a decision on the 26th Amendment first,” Khan said.</p>
<p>Khan asked if the SC made the amendment. Justice Mandokhail asked if he, as a senator, had voted against the amendment, which the SIC counsel affirmed.</p>
<p>“You all boycotted it,” Justice Mandokhail said.</p>
<p>“As long as it is like this, either you accept it, or say you don’t and leave the practice of law.”</p>
<p>Justice Aminuddin said the bench would take a break from the hearing till 2pm, with Justice Mandokhail adding that the bench was aiming to pronounce a verdict today.</p>
<p><em>More to follow</em></p></p>
