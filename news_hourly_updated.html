                <h2>Air India crash report shows pilot confusion over engine switch movement</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A preliminary report depicted confusion in the cockpit shortly before an Air India jetliner <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916728">crashed</a> and killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923062/toll-of-air-india-disaster-rests-at-260-as-focus-turns-to-crash-report">260 people</a> last month, after the plane‚Äôs engine fuel cutoff switches flipped almost simultaneously and starved the engines of fuel.</p>
<p>The Boeing 787 Dreamliner bound for London from the Indian city of Ahmedabad began to lose thrust and sink shortly after takeoff, according to the report on the world‚Äôs deadliest aviation accident in a decade released on Saturday by Indian accident investigators.</p>
<p>The report by India‚Äôs Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) about the June 12 crash raises fresh questions over the position of the critical engine fuel cutoff switches.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after the plane lifted off the ground, closed-circuit TV footage showed a backup energy source called a ram air turbine had deployed, indicating a loss of power from the engines.</p>
<p>In the flight‚Äôs final moments, one pilot was heard on the cockpit voice recorder asking the other why he cut off the fuel. ‚ÄúThe other pilot responded that he did not do so,‚Äù the report said.</p>
<p>It did not identify which remarks were made by the flight‚Äôs captain and which by the first officer, nor which pilot transmitted ‚ÄúMayday, Mayday, Mayday‚Äù just before the crash.</p>
<p>The commanding pilot of the Air India plane was Sumeet Sabharwal, 56, who had a total flying experience of 15,638 hours and, according to the Indian government, was also an Air India instructor. His co-pilot was Clive Kunder, 32, who had 3,403 hours of total experience.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The fuel switches had almost simultaneously flipped from run to cutoff just after takeoff. The preliminary report did not say how the switches could have flipped to the cutoff position during the flight.</p>
<p>The crash is a challenge for Tata Group‚Äôs ambitious campaign to restore Air India‚Äôs reputation and revamp its fleet, after taking the carrier over from the government in 2022.</p>
<p>Air India acknowledged the report in a statement. The carrier said it was cooperating with Indian authorities but declined further comment.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#fuel-switches" id="fuel-switches" title="Permalink"></a>Fuel switches</h2>
<p>Experts have said a pilot would not be able to accidentally move the fuel switches.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf they were moved because of a pilot, why?‚Äù asked US aviation safety expert Anthony Brickhouse.</p>
<p>The switches flipped a second apart, the report said, roughly the time it would take to shift one and then the other, according to US aviation expert John Nance. He added that a pilot would normally never turn the switches off in flight, especially as the plane is starting to climb.</p>
<p>Flipping to the cutoff almost immediately cuts the engines. It is most often used to turn engines off once a plane has arrived at its airport gate and in certain emergency situations, such as an engine fire. The report does not indicate there was any emergency requiring an engine cutoff.</p>
<p>At the crash site, both fuel switches were found in the run position and there had been indications of both engines relighting before the low-altitude crash, said the report, which was released around 1:30am IST today (1:00am PKT).</p>
<p>Asked about the report, the father of first officer Kunder told reporters, ‚ÄúI am not from the airline‚Äù, declining to comment further during a prayer meeting held in the memory of the airline‚Äôs crew on Saturday in Mumbai, where emotional scenes played out among grieving relatives.</p>
<p>The US National Transportation Safety Board thanked Indian officials for their cooperation in a statement and noted that there were no recommended actions in the report aimed at operators of Boeing 787 jets or the GE engines.</p>
<p>The US Federal Aviation Administration said its priority was to follow the facts where they lead, and it was committed to promptly addressing any risks identified throughout the process.</p>
<p>Boeing said it continued to support the investigation and its customer, Air India. GE Aerospace did not respond immediately to a request for comment.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#crash-probe" id="crash-probe" title="Permalink"></a>Crash probe</h2>
<p>The AAIB, an office under India‚Äôs civil aviation ministry, is leading the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917018/air-india-crash-probe-focuses-on-engine-flaps-landing-gear">probe</a> into the crash, which killed all but one of the 242 people on board and 19 others on the ground.</p>
<p>Most air crashes are caused by multiple factors, with a preliminary report due 30 days after the accident, according to international rules, and a final report expected within a year.</p>
<p>The plane‚Äôs black boxes, combined cockpit voice recorders and flight data recorders, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918113/india-to-send-crashed-planes-black-box-to-us-local-media-report">recovered</a> in the days following the crash and later downloaded in India.</p>
<p>The report said ‚Äúall applicable airworthiness directives and alert service bulletins were complied [with] on the aircraft as well as engines.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>The airport closed-circuit TV recording from Ahmedabad had earlier shown the Air India plane rose to a height of 650 feet after it took off, but then suddenly lost altitude, crashing in a fireball into a nearby building.</p>
<p>The investigation report said as the Dreamliner lost altitude, it initially made contact with several trees and an incineration chimney, before hitting the building.</p>
<p>Air India has faced additional scrutiny on other fronts after the crash.</p>
<p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said last week it plans to investigate its budget airline, Air India Express, after <em>Reuters</em> reported the carrier did not follow a directive to change engine parts of an Airbus A320 in a timely manner and falsified records to show compliance.</p>
<p>India is banking on a boom in aviation to support wider development goals, with New Delhi saying it wants India to be a job-creating global aviation hub along the lines of Dubai.</p></p>

                <h2>One California worker dead, hundreds arrested after cannabis farm raid</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A farm worker died on Friday after being injured during a raid by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918869">US immigration agents</a> on a legal cannabis farm in California that resulted in the arrests of 200 undocumented migrants and clashes with protestors.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, called demonstrators involved in attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents ‚Äúslimeballs‚Äù and said they should be arrested.</p>
<p>In another development, a district judge ordered a halt to ‚Äúroving patrols‚Äù in Los Angeles by federal agents who were detaining suspected undocumented migrants without probable cause and denying them due process.</p>
<p>District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong ordered an end to the arrests, which she said were being made ‚Äúbased upon race alone‚Äù, on whether a person was speaking Spanish or English with an accent or because of their place of work and ordered them stopped.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs remarks and the court order come a day after a chaotic raid on a cannabis plantation in Ventura County, some 56 miles (90 kilometers) from Los Angeles, left one farm worker critically injured.</p>
<p>The United Farm Workers labour union said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/UFWupdates/status/1943778822761197939" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X on Friday that the worker had ‚Äúdied of injuries they sustained as a result of yesterday‚Äôs immigration enforcement action‚Äù.</p>

<p>Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman, said the man who died was never in custody.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlthough he was not being pursued by law enforcement, this individual climbed up to the roof of a greenhouse and fell 30 feet (10 metres),‚Äù McLaughlin said.</p>
<p>‚Äú[Customs and Border Patrol] immediately called a medivac to the scene to get him care as quickly as possible.‚Äù</p>
<p>The DHS said 200 undocumented migrants were arrested during raids on marijuana growing sites in Carpinteria and Camarillo on Thursday and 10 children were rescued ‚Äúfrom potential exploitation, forced labour, and human trafficking‚Äù.</p>
<p>Glass House Brands, which owns the farms, said in a statement that it has ‚Äúnever knowingly violated applicable hiring practices and does not and has never employed minors‚Äù.</p>
<p>DHS said more than 500 ‚Äúrioters‚Äù had attempted to disrupt the operation and four US citizens are facing charges for assaulting or resisting officers.</p>
<p>Tear gas was used against the protestors, some of whom were seen in television footage throwing projectiles at law enforcement vehicles.</p>
<p>The department said immigration agency vehicles were damaged and a $50,000 reward was being offered for the arrest of an individual who allegedly fired a gun at law enforcement officers.</p>

<p>Trump said he was authorising law enforcement officers who are ‚Äúon the receiving end of thrown rocks, bricks, or any other form of assault, to stop their car, and arrest these SLIMEBALLS, using whatever means is necessary to do so‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am giving Total Authorisation for ICE to protect itself, just like they protect the Public,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p>Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to deport millions of migrants, has been involved in a showdown over immigration enforcement with Democratic-ruled California for weeks.</p>
<p>The Republican president sent thousands of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916010/troops-sent-by-trump-reach-protest-hit-los-angeles-over-governors-wishes">National Guard troops</a> to Los Angeles last month to quell <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915984">protests</a> against roundups of undocumented migrants by federal agents.</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has said the troops were not necessary to address the mostly peaceful protests, but his legal efforts to have them removed have failed so far.</p>

<p>The cannabis farm in Camarillo was calm during a visit by an <em>AFP</em> reporter on Friday as workers waited in line to collect their belongings and paychecks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been here since six this morning asking questions but they‚Äôre not giving us any information,‚Äù said Saul Munoz, a 43-year-old Colombian whose son was detained on Thursday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI just want to know how he‚Äôs doing,‚Äù Munoz said. ‚ÄúBring him back to me and if it‚Äôs time for us to leave, we‚Äôll leave.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe truth is the American dream is no longer really the American dream.‚Äù</p></p>
