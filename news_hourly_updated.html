                <h2>Pakistani pilgrims barred from by-road travel to Iran, Iraq this Arbaeen: interior minister</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistani pilgrims will be barred from travelling by road to Iran and Iraq for the Arbaeen pilgrimage due to public and national security, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Pilgrims <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855955">visit Iraq</a> to attend the chehlum commemoration ‚Äî also known as Arbaeen (40 in Arabic) ‚Äî to mark the 40th day of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922472/ashura-processions-in-major-cities-of-country-conclude-peacefully">mourning</a> for the martyrdom of Imam Husain, the grandson of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter extensive consultations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [the] Balochistan Government, and security agencies, it has been decided that <em>zaireen</em> (pilgrims) will not be allowed to travel to Iraq and Iran by road for Arbaeen this year,‚Äù Naqvi said on X.</p>
<p>He added that the ‚Äúdifficult decision was taken in the interest of public safety and national security‚Äù.</p>
<p>However, the pilgrims will be able to travel by air, the minister noted.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Naqvi stressed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed authorities to ‚Äúarrange maximum flights to facilitate their pilgrimage in the coming days‚Äù.</p>
<p>Naqvi‚Äôs statement came after he met with PM Shehbaz earlier today to brief him on the new policy for pilgrims, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> (<em>APP</em>) <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/interior-minister-calls-on-pm-briefs-over-zaireens-new-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The premier also directed Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif to arrange ‚Äúspecial flights for the pilgrims, <em>APP</em> stated, citing a press release from the PM Office.</p>
<p>Iraq‚Äôs Karbala, where Imam Hussein and his brother Abbas are buried in two enormous mausoleums facing each other, is the centre of the Shia world during this time. More than <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854804/millions-of-pilgrims-rally-for-arbaeen">21 million</a> devotees took part in the pilgrimage last year.</p>
<p>Pakistan is set to introduce a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922178">new travel management system</a> from Jan 1, 2026, under which pilgrims will only be allowed to undertake the journey under registered organisers.</p>

<p>Under the new measures, the traditional Salar System will be abolished and replaced with a Zaireen Group Organisers model. Alongside weekly flights to Iran being increased from six to 15, 107 additional special flights will also be arranged for pilgrims heading to Iraq.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousuf <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925358/religious-affairs-minister-retracts-40000-missing-pilgrims-remark">retracted</a> his statement that 40,000 pilgrims had not returned from trips to Iran and Iraq. He clarified that a ‚Äúmisunderstanding‚Äù of outdated paper records that had not yet been fully digitised resulted in the statement.</p>

            </a>
            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has said that Pakistan received ‚Äúrecent assurances‚Äù from Afghan authorities that the neighbouring country‚Äôs soil would not be used for terrorism ‚Äî a key issue of contention between Islamabad and Kabul.</p>
<p>Both countries have witnessed an improvement in bilateral relations after taking steps to improve ties, such as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904628">revival</a> of the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914506/kabul-also-levels-up-its-pakistan-diplomat-to-ambassador-as-ties-see-normalisation">upgrading</a> diplomatic ranks. Dar visited Kabul earlier this month where an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924880/pakistan-uzbekistan-afghanistan-ink-deal-on-railway-project">agreement</a> was signed for the Pakistan, Uzbek¬≠istan and Afghanistan railway project to boost regional trade and connectivity.</p>
<p>According to a statement issued on Saturday, the foreign minister, during an interaction with the Pakistani community at the Pakistan Consulate in New York, highlighted the country‚Äôs outreach to Afghanistan with a view to enhancing regional connectivity through rail and trade corridors to Central Asia.</p>
<p>He shared Pakistan‚Äôs expectation that Afghan soil would not be used for terrorism, noting recent assurances received from Afghan authorities in that regard, according to a statement by the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925440/interior-minister-naqvi-discusses-counterterrorism-in-kabul-meeting-with-afghan-counterpart">visited</a> Kabul earlier this month and discussed counterterrorism efforts and mechanisms for regulating cross-border movement in a meeting with his Afghan counterpart, Sirajuddin Haqqani. Naqvi had expressed concerns over the infiltration by terrorist organisations causing ‚Äúchaos and instability‚Äù and the need to stop them.</p>
<p>Islamabad accuses Afghan-based terror groups of launching cross-border attacks and planning and executing terrorist attacks here, facilitated by the Afghan Taliban administration‚Äôs indifference to Pakistan‚Äôs concerns. In response, Pakistan has conducted military strikes against terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan and initiated a mass deportation drive targeting Afghan nationals.</p>
<p>In April, Afghanistan‚Äôs acting prime minister, Mullah Hasan Akhund, had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905407">assured</a> Pakistan that Afghan territory would not be used for hostile activities against any country.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#country-witnessing-economic-revival" id="country-witnessing-economic-revival" title="Permalink"></a>Country witnessing ‚Äòeconomic revival‚Äô</h2>
<p>During the interaction in New York, Dar stated that Pakistan is experiencing a significant positive boost in its standing on the world stage, saying it had emerged from a period of diplomatic isolation and is witnessing economic revival.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have made considerable progress, especially in political and economic fields, in the past three years, despite heavy odds. We are indeed a resilient nation,‚Äù he said. Dar underscored that Pakistan was actively engaging on the international stage, including through recent high-level visits and multilateral diplomacy.</p>
<p>He invited the diaspora to actively contribute to Pakistan‚Äôs development, particularly in investment, trade, education, and digital innovation. He appreciated the contributions of the Pakistani diaspora to both Pakistan and the United States, acknowledging their vital role in strengthening bilateral relations and enhancing Pakistan‚Äôs image globally.</p>
<p>The foreign minister informed the community gathering on Pakistan‚Äôs economic recovery, noting that the country had successfully completed the IMF programme, significantly reduced inflation, and restored investor confidence.</p>
<p>Sharing that global credit rating agencies had recently acknowledged Pakistan‚Äôs improved macroeconomic outlook, he reaffirmed the government‚Äôs aspiration for Pakistan to join the ranks of G-20 economies.</p>
<p>He outlined key initiatives of the government, particularly the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), designed to streamline investment procedures and unlock opportunities in priority sectors.</p>
<p>Dar assured the community that the government was actively working toward the early resumption of PIA flights to New York, including steps toward <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924570/uk-lifts-ban-on-pakistani-airlines-removes-country-from-air-safety-list">restoring</a> routes to Europe and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed the government‚Äôs commitment to engaging the Pakistani-American diaspora as strategic partners in national development as well as in strengthening mutually beneficial Pakistan‚ÄìUS bilateral cooperation.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#pakistan-to-defend-sovereignty" id="pakistan-to-defend-sovereignty" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòPakistan to defend sovereignty‚Äô</h2>
<p>Speaking to the Pakistani community in New York, FM Dar reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs resolve to defend its sovereignty and regional stability, recalling the country‚Äôs firm and resolute response during Operation <em>Bunyanum Marsoos</em> that led to the downing of six Indian aircraft. He praised the unity demonstrated by the nation and the diaspora during this critical moment.</p>
<p>He appreciated the solidarity and support extended by Pakistani-Americans during the recent tensions with India and their constructive role in amplifying the voice of the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>The government termed its retaliatory operation against India as ‚ÄòBunyan-un- Marsoos‚Äô after Pakistan and India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186">clashed</a> in May. After India launched a series of strikes under ‚ÄòOperation Sindoor‚Äô, Pakistan‚Äôs military swiftly responded and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">downed</a> 6 Indian jets before a ceasefire came into effect following US mediation.</p>
<p>The foreign minister earlier on Saturday returned from Washington, DC where he held a ‚Äúcordial‚Äù <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926499/rubio-lauds-pakistans-role-in-global-and-regional-peace-in-1st-meeting-with-fm-dar">meeting</a> with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. ‚ÄúThe meeting went very well. We discussed key global and regional issues,‚Äù he said, expressing hope that bilateral ties would be further strengthened.</p>
<p>Rubio had lauded Pakistan‚Äôs role in ‚Äúglobal and regional peace‚Äù in his first meeting with Dar.</p></p>
