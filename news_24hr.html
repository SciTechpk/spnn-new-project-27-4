            <p><p>Over 200 trapped tourists have been rescued in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer district after flash floods triggered by heavy rain swept through the city, the provincial government spokesperson said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued a landslide alert amid floods triggered by heavy rains.</p>
<p>A day ago, at least four tourists were killed, two others injured, and 15 went missing due to the floods in GB’s Babusar area in Diamer district. The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge have become more visible in GB as cloudburst-induced floods wreaked havoc across the region.</p>
<p>The provincial government spokesperson, Faizullah Faraq, said in a statement,  “More than 200 rescued tourists have been shifted to Chilas and provided shelter in hotels and guest houses.”</p>
<p>He added that the tourists were now able to contact their families after being stranded for hours.</p>
<p>Faraq detailed that rescue operations were still underway to look for missing tourists, while the deceased ones have been identified.</p>
<p>“The military is participating in the rescue operation, and helicopters will be brought in for rescue, if necessary,” he said in the statement.</p>
<p>On Monday, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abdul Hameed told <em>Dawn</em> that 20 to 30 tourists from different parts of the country might be missing.</p>
<p>According to rescue authorities in Skardu’s WhatsApp channel, three people were injured due to the flood in Sadpara, while the deluge has also hit the Kharmang district.</p>
<p>“The rescue operation was launched again at 6am today,” <em>AFP</em> reported the spokesperson as saying.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, spokesperson for the Baltistan Division Police Department Ghulam Muhammad said in a statement that “In Deosai, 413 tourist vehicles were stranded on the road connecting Sapara and Deosai, after it was closed at ten different points due to the floods.”</p>
<p>According to his statement, the stranded people have been rescued by the police and shifted to Skardu.</p>
<p>“The flood water entered homes and caused severe damage to public infrastructure and crops,” he added.</p>
<p>Outlining the damage, the GB govt spokesperson said that “more than 50 houses have been damaged in the flood since yesterday.”</p>
<p>In Babusar, a wheat depot, a girls’ school, a police checkpoint, a tourism police shelter, and four bridges have been washed away, while two mosques and a windmill have also been damaged.“</p>
<p>A local social worker, Muhammad Ali, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that, “Thirty vehicles were swept away by the floods, and most people have been rescued by the locals.”</p>
<p>Faraq shared that construction has begun on the restoration of highways and connecting roads, after the floods damaged a portion of the Karakoram Highway (KKH), leaving thousands of tourists and passengers stranded on both sides.</p>

<p>The NDMA advised citizens to avoid travelling to mountainous areas and directed authorities to remain alert in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>On June 26, the GB Disaster Management Authority issued a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">warning</a> of increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glof) and flash floods. The public and tourists were advised to avoid going near rivers, streams and other waterways, and avoid bathing or washing clothes in streams since the water flow can reach dangerous levels.</p>

<p>According to the NDMA, 221 people have been killed and more than 500 others injured in incidents linked to nearly a month of heavy monsoon rains, <em>AFP</em> reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Since June 26 up to July 21, 221 people have lost their lives, including 104 children and 40 women,” a spokesperson from the national disaster management agency told <em>AFP.</em></p>
<p>In June, at least 13 tourists were swept to their deaths in Swat while sheltering from <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920992">flash floods</a> on a raised river bank.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country.</p></p>

            <p><p>Pakistan on Monday signed a United Nations (UN) agreement aimed at conserving marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, the Foreign Office (FO) said.</p>
<p>In 2015, Pakistan’s seabed territory <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1170986">grew</a> by about 50,000 square kilometres after a UN body accepted Islamabad’s claim for extension of sea limits.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar signed the “Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction” (<a class="link--external" href="https://www.un.org/bbnjagreement/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BBNJ Agreement</a>) at the UN Headquarters in New York.</p>
<p>The BBNJ pact is the third implementing agreement under the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/legal/pages/unitednationsconventiononthelawofthesea.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UN Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> (Unclos), which was adopted in 1982 and entered into force in 1994.</p>

<p>Pakistan signing the BBNJ agreement “reflects on its commitment to multilateral cooperation and protection and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction”, the FO noted in a <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/pakistan-signs-agreement-under-unclos-on-the-conservation-and-sustainable-use-of-marine-biological-diversity-of-areas-beyond-national-jurisdiction-bbnj-agreement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>The BBNJ agreement was adopted on 19 June 2023 by an intergovernmental conference.</p>
<p>“Pakistan played a leading role in the negotiations to finalise the treaty,” the FO highlighted in a post on X.</p>
<p>“As chair of the Group of 77 and China during the two main sessions, Pakistan, representing developing countries, endeavoured to promote equity, in line with the principle of the common heritage of humankind.”</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The FO statement recalled that Pakistan “consistently advocated for fair benefit-sharing, capacity-building, and technology transfer”.</p>
<p>According to the UN, the BBNJ agreement addresses four main issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Marine genetic resources, including the fair and equitable sharing of benefits</li>
<li>Measures such as area-based management tools, including marine protected areas</li>
<li>Environmental impact assessments</li>
<li>Capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Unclos, under which the BBNJ pact falls, <a class="link--external" href="https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/legal/pages/unitednationsconventiononthelawofthesea.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lays down</a> a “comprehensive regime of law and order for the world’s oceans, establishing rules for the allocation of states’ rights and jurisdiction in maritime spaces, the peaceful use of the oceans and the management of their resources”.</p>

<p>Within Pakistan’s territory, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1861305">Churna Island</a> was last year <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856910">designated</a> as the country’s second-ever marine protected area in a bid to preserve its unique but eroding biodiversity.</p>
<p>In 2020, experts found “amazing wildlife”, well-diversified bird fauna, rich marine habitat and dozens of species of corals at <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1596694">Astola Island</a> in Balochistan.</p></p>

            <p><p>At least 25 children were among the 27 dead pulled from scorched buildings after a Bangladesh Air Force jet on a training mission <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925645">crashed</a> into a college and school campus in Dhaka, officials said on Tuesday, with 88 people being treated in hospital.</p>
<p>The F-7 BGI aircraft crashed soon after it took off at 1:06pm (12:06pm PKT) on Monday from the airbase in Kurmitola in the capital on a routine training mission. The military said the plane experienced a mechanical failure.</p>
<p>Visuals showed rescue workers scouring the charred buildings for debris as distressed family members surrounded the site.</p>
<p>Sayedur Rahman, special assistant to the chief adviser on health, told reporters that 27 people had died and 88 were admitted to hospital with burn injuries. Those dead included 25 children, a teacher and the pilot.</p>
<p>The <a class="link--external" href="https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/govt-declares-state-mourning-tomorrow-3944571" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">government announced</a> a day of mourning, with flags at half-mast and special prayers at all places of worship.</p>
<p>The F-7 BGI is the final and most advanced variant in China’s Chengdu J-7/F-7 aircraft family, according to Jane’s Information Group. Bangladesh signed a contract for 16 aircraft in 2011 and deliveries were completed by 2013.</p>
<p>The incident comes as neighbour India is still grappling with the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade after an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916728">Air India plane crashed</a> into a medical college hostel in Ahmedabad last month, killing 241 of the 242 people on board and 19 on the ground.</p></p>
