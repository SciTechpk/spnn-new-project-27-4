                <h2>DG ISPR warns of ‚Äòswift and assured response‚Äô in case India breaks ceasefire</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Thursday warned in an interview with British broadcaster <em><a class="link--external" href="https://news.sky.com/story/pakistan-vows-swift-response-if-india-violates-ceasefire-13368060" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sky News</a></em> that any Indian ceasefire violation would be met with a ‚Äúswift and assured response‚Äù by Pakistan, cautioning that serious escalation could result in mutual destruction.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>On May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">announced</a> that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan. According to the government, forty civilians ‚Äî including seven women and 15 children ‚Äî <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910733">lost</a> their lives in the Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Sky News</em>, DG ISPR warned that by rooting for war, India was carving out a ‚Äúrecipe for mutual destruction,‚Äù adding that the world now recognised the extent of the nuclear threat.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAny sane player like the USA understands this absurdity and what the Indians are trying to do here,‚Äù Lt Gen Chaudhry told the publications.</p>
<p>Talking about India‚Äôs actions in Kashmir, he accused the country of trying to ‚Äúinternalise the issue and harassing‚Äù Kashmiri people with a heavy troop presence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is a problem that has to be resolved by the people of Kashmir as per the United Nations Security Council resolution,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He continued: ‚ÄúAnyone who tries to violate our territory and integrity and sovereignty, our response will be brutal.‚Äù</p>
<p>DG ISPR warned that a ‚Äúserious escalation between India and Pakistan would destroy both sides‚Äù under the concept of mutually assured destruction ‚Äî a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy which posits that a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by an attacker on a nuclear-armed defender with second-strike capabilities would result in the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender.</p>
<p>In a press conference <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910381">held</a> last week after the ceasefire was brokered, DG ISPR had cautioned that a conflict between Islamabad and New Delhi ‚Äúcan lead to peril of more than 1.6 billion people.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn reality, there is no space for war between India and Pakistan,‚Äù he added.</p></p>

            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911215/trump-asks-apple-chief-to-expand-production-back-to-us-instead-of-india" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <h2>Trump asks Apple chief to expand production back to US instead of India</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook and told him not to expand his production facilities in India, but to do so in America.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,‚Äù Trump said during his visit to Qatar.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI said to him, Tim, you‚Äôre my friend, I treated you very good. You‚Äôre coming here with $500 billion, but now you‚Äôre building all over India,‚Äù he said, referring to Apple‚Äôs plan announced in February to invest $500bn in the US over the next four years.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Trump said he informed Cook that he does not want him to build production facilities in India, and that Apple will be ‚Äúupping their production in the United States‚Äù.</p>
<p>The US president claimed that selling American goods in the world‚Äôs most populous country is ‚Äúvery difficult‚Äù because India has one of the highest tariff barriers in the world.</p>
<p>However, he noted that while the Asian country looks for a deal on import duties, India has offered them a ‚Äúno-tariff‚Äù deal.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs remarks came after Tim Cook said earlier this month that the majority of Apple‚Äôs products to be sold in the US in the coming months will be sourced from India and Vietnam rather than China, which has been the target of US President Donald Trump‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911203/india-has-offered-us-a-trade-deal-with-no-tariffs-trump">highest tariffs</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin,‚Äù Cook said.</p>
<p>The primary production location ‚Äúfor almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods products sold in the US‚Äù will be Vietnam in the meantime.</p>
<p>Cook noted that the great bulk of all products sold outside the US will continue to be manufactured in China.</p>
<p>Apple is among the most impacted tech firms in the US, with its shares falling by around 5.1 per cent since the tariffs were announced.</p>
<p>Due to low production costs, the majority of Apple products are now manufactured in China.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has repeatedly stated that it wants Apple to move production to the US.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the US and China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910528">agreed</a> to a sweeping rollback of punitive tariffs for an initial 90-day period, signalling a rare moment of relief in their protracted trade conflict and raising hopes for longer-term economic stability.</p></p>
