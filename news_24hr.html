            <p><p><strong>• OMCs, refineries, dealers to benefit from additional Rs75bn
• Petroleum division mulls GST on oil products</strong></p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: For a third time in two months, the government is considering imposing additional costs — this time at the rate of Rs4.12 per litre — on the prices of petroleum products, a move that may deprive consumers of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910906">potential relief</a> in prices due to be announced for the next fortnight today (Thursday).</p>
<p>This has been proposed by the petroleum division to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet. The impact of Rs4.12 per unit works out to be around Rs75 billion on an annual basis to be paid to oil marketing companies (OMCs), refineries and retail dealers to meet their demands.</p>
<p>On top of this, the petroleum division has also recommended imposition of general sales tax on petroleum products at the rate of Rs3-5 per litre from July 1, through the finance bill 2025-26.</p>
<p>Without these proposed measures, the prices of petrol and diesel were estimated to decline by about Rs3.5 and Rs7 per litre, respectively, for the next fortnight starting May 15, owing to decline in the international market and a slight ease in import premium on petrol. Over the last two months, the government has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904539/fuel-price-relief-denied-as-govt-raises-levy-to-rs80">disallowed</a> about Rs18 per litre potential reduction in petroleum prices to discourage rise in petroleum consumption.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>This was done through increase in petroleum levy, including through a special presidential ordinance, to divert funds for higher subsidy on electricity rates and construction of highways and motorways in Balochistan and Sindh.</p>
<p>According to a summary sent to the ECC, the petroleum division has proposed a Rs1.87 per litre allowance through changes in the pool of inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM) to satisfy OMCs and refineries with an estimated financial impact of Rs34bn. In addition, the division has proposed an increase in sale margins to the OMCs at the rate of Rs1.13 and Rs1.12 per litre for petroleum dealers from their existing rates of about Rs8 and Rs8.64 per litre.</p>
<p>On the annual basis, the additional financial impact of the increase in margins is estimated to be more than Rs40bn depending on sales volume.</p>
<p>The division argued that petroleum products (petrol, high speed diesel, kerosene and light diesel oil) had been classified as “exempted” under Finance Act 2024-25. Resultantly, the input sales tax became cost of refineries and OMCs (Rs34bn for FY2024-25) which could not be recovered through the product prices as the petroleum products rates were regulated by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).</p>
<p>Strangely, the division claimed that petroleum prices were “being fixed by Ogra under GoP Policy”. It is, however, a matter of record that actually calculations made by Ogra are forwarded by the division to the ministry of finance which itself moves a summary to the prime minister for approval every fortnight.</p>
<p>The major price cuts are then anno­unced by the prime minister himself or his office, otherwise price revisions are announced by the ministry of finance.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The petroleum division also said a draft proposal to levy 3-5pc sales tax on petrol and HSD was developed in consultation with the oil industry, finance ministry and Federal Board of Revenue which could “not be implemented due to non-agreement with IMF to allow these products be taxed at reduced rates of GST”.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the petrol and diesel price increase due to standard rate of 18pc GST would be around Rs45 per litre, which was not desirable. Any amendment to the sales tax rate will require consultation with IMF and parliament’s approval.</p>
<p><strong>Supply chain</strong></p>
<p>Besides the sales tax issue, OMCs and dealers have requested for enhancement of their margins on petrol and HSD. Ogra has recommended an increase of OMCs and petroleum dealers’ margin by Rs1.13 and Rs1.40/litre, respectively, to ensure sustainability of the supply chain.</p>
<p>However, with partial amendment the summary proposed Rs1.13 per litre additional benefit to OMCs and Rs1.12 per litre to dealers. It said that since petroleum products were exempted from sales tax during current financial year, the refineries and OMCs’ unadjusted sales tax during July 2024-June 2025 on these products may be compensated through IFEM (estimated at Rs34bn).</p>
<p>“For FY2025-26, 3-5pc sales tax on these products may be imposed through Finance Act. However, in case the products remain exempted from sales tax in the FY 2025-26, the unadjusted sales tax may continue to be compensated through IFEM as a fallback option to keep the oil supply chain sustainable,” the petroleum division insisted.</p>

            <p><p>The first of 180 Pakistani Hajj flights scheduled to fly to Saudi Arabia’s Jeddah — part of the Road to Makkah Initiative — arrived at the King Abdul Aziz International Airport from Islamabad carrying 310 Haj pilgrims, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported today.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1492274">Launched</a> in 2019 at the Islamabad airport and later extended to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1833103">Karachi</a>, the Road to Makkah initiative offers an exemption to Haj pilgrims from the immigration process at Saudi airports by clearing them at their respective airports in Pakistan by Saudi immigration officials before boarding their flights.</p>
<p>Marking the second phase of the initiative, the passengers were received at the airport by Minister of Religious Affairs &amp; Interfaith Harmony Sardar Muhammad Yousaf, Consul General of Pakistan in Jeddah Khalid Majid, DG Hajj Abdul Wahab Soomro and the senior officers of the Consulate General of Pakistan. The pilgrims were presented bouqets by the receiving party.</p>
<p>This year, an estimated 50,500 Haj pilgrims will travel to Saudi Arabia under the initiative, with 28,000 departing from Islamabad and 22,500 from Karachi throughout 180 flights, out of which 100 will depart from Islamabad and 80 from Karachi.</p>
<p>Housing and other essential facilities have been arranged for all the pilgrims, including service personnel such as medical staff and officials from the Ministry of Religious Affairs, to facilitate the Haj pilgrims.</p>
<p>In April, a Saudi immigration team <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906978/saudi-immigration-team-to-process-haj-pilgrims-at-karachi-islamabad-airports">arrived</a> in the country to process Pakistani Haj pilgrims at Jinnah International Airport and Islamabad International Airport.</p>
<p>In 2025, Pakistan’s Haj quota was set at 179,210, with half of the quota meant to be managed by private Haj operators. However, only 23,000 people were able to go under private operators.</p>
<p>Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870331">Haj quotas</a> from Saudi Arabia.</p></p>

            <p><p>A powerful explosion targeted the vehicle of local JUI-F leader Maulana Noorullah on Thursday near a seminary in the lower South Waziristan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, police said.</p>
<p>The explosion hit Maulana Noorullah’s car near Shahzad Madrassah, adjacent to a police station in the district’s Azam Warsak market. According to a police statement, the bomb attack was carried out to target Maulana Noorullah, who remained unharmed.</p>
<p>Police confirmed the incident and said there were no casualties in the explosion. Security forces cordoned off the area and started an investigation.</p>
<p>According to a video later released by the JUI-F, Maulana Noorullah told his supporters that he was accompanied by local party leaders Maulana Ishaq and Maulana Amanullah when the blast occurred.</p>
<p>“We all are safe,” he told his supporters. “We want peace in the country and protection of religious schools, mosques and all Muslims.”</p>
<p>JUI-F leaders have been targeted in different parts of KP and Balochistan over the past several months.</p>
<p>On March 14 this year, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897859">bomb exploded</a> at a mosque in South Waziristan district during Friday prayers, injuring JUI district chief Abdullah Nadeem and three others, police said. Nadeem was seriously wounded, while three others, also belonging to the JUI, sustained minor injuries.</p>
<p>Local JUI-F leaders have also come under attack in Balochistan. On April 25, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906374/jui-f-leader-among-three-killed-in-kalat-blast">local leader of the JUI-F</a> and two women were killed and five others were injured in a roadside explosion near the Kalat district.</p>
<p>The incident occurred in the Kapootu area when a pickup vehicle carrying eight people was hit by an improvised explosive device (IED) planted on the roadside near Killi Kapootu, according to Levies officials.</p>
<p>The vehicle was coming from Kalat when the blast took place. The pickup was driven by JUI-F local leader and union council member Maulana Abdullah Nachari.</p>
<p>In another incident on March 2, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895225">two leaders of JUI-F</a> Balochistan were killed in the Zehri area of Khuzdar district in Balochistan.</p>
<p>The JUI-F leaders, Wadera Ghulam Sarwar and Molvi Amanullah were on their way home in the Tarsani area of Zehri when unknown assailants riding motorcycles opened fire on them with automatic weapons.</p>
<p>Both died on the spot after being shot multiple times, while the security guard of one of the leaders received bullet injuries.</p></p>
