            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, a member of the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench (CB), has questioned why the offices of the president, prime minister and the law division are being dragged into the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893249">controversy</a> over the appointment of judges when <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1824028">allegations</a> had been levelled against intelligence agencies for interference in judicial affairs.</p>
<p>The observation came when senior counsel Muneer A. Malik, representing five Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges, argued that the real reason behind the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889123">transfer of three judges</a> to the IHC was the allegation levelled against intelligence agencies by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1824028">six IHC judges</a>.</p>
<p>In a joint letter sent to the Supreme Judicial Council on March 25, 2024, the six judges had blamed intelligence agencies for meddling in judicial affairs.</p>
<p>In response to the argument by the senior lawyer, Justice Afghan asked if the allegations were attributed to the intelligence ag­­e­­ncies, why the three high offices were being dragged into the controversy to build a gro­und of malice. He also wondered if the intelligence agencies had demolished the en­­tire appointment procedure when they had no constitutional role in judges’ appointment.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Counsel alleges judges transferred to IHC for ‘extraneous collateral reasons’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, the five-judge constitutional bench was hearing a joint petition <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893212">filed by five IHC judges</a> — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — pleading that three transferred judges should not be treated as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194, read in conjunction with Schedule III of the Constitution.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The counsel said the letter to the SJC triggered a reaction, as a bitter social media campaign against the judges ensued, whereby the degree of a signatory of the letter and the loyalty of another judge were questioned and cameras were allegedly installed in the bedroom of another judge.</p>
<p>He further alleged that this was a conspiracy contrived at the offices of the PM and law ministry to take over the control of IHC and if the president had also applied his mind to this effect, then the entire exercise fell within the category of malice in law.</p>
<p>Since direct proof of malice was always virtually impossible, malice was always drawn by inferences, he said.</p>
<p>At this, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan interjected to make a statement that during his 13-year career as a judge, he was never approached by any intelligence agencies. He also reminded the counsel that soon after the letter by IHC judges, full-court meetings were conducted in all high courts wherein it was resolved that no such interference by intelligence agencies had ever occurred and the problem confined to the IHC only.</p>
<p>Justice Hassan also noted that the allegations of malice against the office of the president and the members of the Judicial Com­mission of Pakistan — a body that appoints judges — were very serious in nature.</p>
<p>In response, the counsel cited the example of Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui who was removed as IHC judge and later vindicated by the SJC and also cited interviews of certain government functionaries in the media.</p>
<p>At this, Justice Salahuddin Panwhar questioned if the constitutional bench was bound by the interviews or newspaper clippings.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The counsel recalled how JCP, while appointing two additional judges in IHC, deliberately left vacant three permanent offices of the judges in the high court. Since the JCP left three seats vacant, the president took it upon himself to fill these seats by invoking Article 200 when the authority to appoint permanent judges rests only with JCP.</p>
<p>According to the counsel, the Constitution does not contemplate filling of vacant seats by invoking Article 200, rather the article should be exercised only for a temporary basis.</p>
<p>Justice Mazhar asked both the counsel and Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan to come up with reasons on the part of the JCP to leave the three offices of the judges vacant while appointing two additional judges.</p>
<p>The counsel said, “A judge on the 16th position in seniority was imported from the Lahore High Court and put in place at the senior-most position in IHC”, adding that after the transfer of the three judges, the administrative and promotion committees of the IHC were also changed.</p>
<p>The transfer of the three judges to the IHC was not in the public interest, but done for extraneous collateral reasons, he alleged.</p>

            <p><p>LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court on Wednesday allowed the prosecution/police to conduct polygraph (lie detection) and photogrammetric (facial and voice analysis) tests of incarcerated PTI founding chairman Imran Khan in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885852">12 cases</a> of May 9 (2023) riots against him.</p>
<p>ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill granted the permission to the prosecution accepting its written application, which was opposed by the lawyer of the former prime minister.</p>
<p>The judge has ordered completion of the tests within 12 days, saying the prosecution may meet the PTI founding chairman in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi, during that period.</p>
<p>Earlier, the judge heard the concluding arguments of PTI founder’s lawyer, Barrister Salman Safdar, and the prosecution before reserving the verdict.</p>
<p>Barrister Safdar opposed the prosecution request, questioning the police decision to conduct the polygraph and photogrammetric tests 727 days after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279/special-report-may-9-mayhem-and-military-trials-a-year-on">May 9 incidents</a>.</p>
<p>The lawyer argued that bail had already been granted to the former prime minister in 21 cases and the statements on the basis of which the police were seeking these tests had already been declared lawful by the Lahore High Court.</p>
<p>He urged the court to dismiss the petition of the prosecution.</p>
<p>Special Prosecutor Rana Aazar stated that the Supreme Court allowed such tests to fulfill investigative requirements. However, he said, the PTI founding chairman refused to undergo these tests in jail without the presence of his lawyer.</p>
<p>He further stated that conducting the voice match test of the accused was a legal requirement.</p>
<p>He asked the court to grant permission to conduct the polygraph, photogrammetric, and voice match tests.</p>
<p>After hearing both sides, the judge reserved his decision on the plea.</p>
<p>In the application, the police sought permission to conduct photogrammetric and polygraph tests of Imran inside Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi, where he is currently imprisoned.</p>
<p>The tests are to be carried out in 12 cases, including those pertaining to Jinnah House and Askari Tower attacks.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>Other cases include attacks on Shadman police station and party offices of the PML-N.</p>
<p>MAY 9 TRIALS: The Lahore High Court registrar has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902342">issued</a> an amended schedule of the trials of the May 9 cases being conducted at Kot Lakhpat Jail to meet the timeline of four months set by the Supreme Court to conclude these trials.</p>
<p>Last month, a three-judge bench of the SC headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi directed the anti-terrorism courts (ATCs) to conclude May 9 violence trials within four months.</p>
<p>The hearing of May 9 cases would now be heard in jail four days a week — Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The jail trials were earlier being held three days a week but have been extended to expedite their disposal.</p>
<p>The ATCs in Lahore are hearing the jail trials of 14 cases including attack on the Jinnah House, which also serves as residence of corps commander.</p>
<p>Several PTI leaders including former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, former provincial ministers Dr Yasmin Rashid and Mian Mehmoodur Rashid are facing trials at the Kot Lakhpat jail.</p>

            <p><p>BENGALURU: Indians are cancelling holidays in popular resorts in Turkiye and Azerbaijan after the two countries supported Pakistan during the recent conflict, two booking firms said.</p>
<p>Turkiye and Azerbaijan, popular budget holiday destinations for Indians, issued statements backing Islamabad after India’s air strikes last week. “Bookings for Azerbaijan and Turkiye decreasing by 60 per cent (over the last week) while cancellations have surged by 250pc during the same period,” a spokesperson for <a class="link--external" href="https://www.makemytrip.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MakeMyTrip</a> said.</p>
<p>EaseMyTrip’s Chief Executive Officer, Rikant Pittie, said the platform had seen a 22pc rise in cancellations for Turkiye and 30pc for Azerbaijan “due to recent geopolitical tensions”.</p>
<p>Travellers had switched to Georgia, Serbia, Greece, Thailand and Vietnam, he added. Another ticketing platform, <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ixigo.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ixigo</a>, earlier said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ixigo/status/1921130776805986510" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X that it would be suspending flight and hotel bookings for Turkiye, Azerbaijan and China.</p>
<p>EaseMyTrip’s founder and chairman Nishant Pitti said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/nishantpitti/status/1920910141647712761" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a> that 287,000 Indians visited Turkiye last year and 243,000 visited Azer­baijan. “When these nations openly support Pakistan, should we fuel their tourism and their economies?” Pitti said.</p>
