            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Friday stressed that the “enduring partnership” between Pakistan and China will continue to play a pivotal role in regional stability.</p>
<p>Pakistan and China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/china-says-it-backs-pakistan-in-defending-sovereignty">share</a> a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure — with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884628">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.</p>
<p>The army chief made the remarks at the 98th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China, which was commemorated at General Headquarters in Rawalpindi today, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7374" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> by the military’s media affairs wing.</p>
<p>“He emphasised that their enduring partnership will continue to play a pivotal role in promoting regional stability and safeguarding shared strategic interests,” said the statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).</p>
<p>China’s Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong graced the occasion as the chief guest, while Defence Attaché Major General Wang Zhong, Chinese Embassy officials and senior military officers from the Pakistani tri-services were also present.</p>
<p>COAS Munir extended a warm welcome to the Chinese guests and congratulated the PLA on its 98th founding anniversary, lauding the army’s “pivotal role in China’s defence, security and nation-building”, the ISPR said.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The army chief emphasised that “despite shifting strategic dynamics, the friendship between the two nations has remained steadfast and unshakable”, according to the press release.</p>
<p>“The COAS underscored the strength and strategic significance of Pakistan-China relations, emphasising that the bond between the two nations is unique, time-tested, and exceptionally resilient amid evolving regional and global challenges.</p>
<p>“The Field Marshal highlighted that the Pakistan-China strategic relationship exemplifies mutual trust, unwavering support, and shared commitment,” the statement added.</p>
<p>Concluding his address, COAS Munir “reaffirmed that the Pakistan Army and the PLA are true brothers-in-arms”, the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>Addressing the gathering, Ambassador Zaidong expressed his sincere gratitude to the army chief for hosting the event commemorating the PLA’s 98th anniversary.</p>
<p>He acknowledged the steadfast role of the armed forces in the “fight against terrorism and reaffirmed China’s unwavering support for and commitment to its strategic partnership with Pakistan”, according to the ISPR.</p>

<p>Today’s renewed affirmation of the strong bilateral ties comes just a week after COAS Munir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926523/chinese-leadership-lauds-pakistans-role-in-regional-peace-during-meeting-with-coas-munir">paid an official visit</a> to China, where he met with Vice President Han Zheng and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.</p>
<p>During the visit, the Chinese leadership hailed the Pakistan Army as a “cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor” for peace in the region.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924658">reaffirmed</a> their commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation and promoting regional peace, stability, and development.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, both countries have strengthened their cooperation in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926296/pakistan-signs-maritime-mou-with-chinese-shipping-giant-to-boost-collaboration">maritime</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925364/pak-china-to-form-panels-for-agriculture-projects">agriculture</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923261/pakistan-china-agree-on-joint-media-cooperation-against-fake-news">media</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927081/pakistan-eyes-better-disaster-response-with-new-satellite">disaster management</a> and various <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924072/pakistan-china-to-launch-joint-training-programmes">other fields</a>.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928046/sindh-high-court-suspends-order-removing-ke-ceo' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh High Court suspends order removing KE CEO</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Friday suspended an order by the provincial ombudsman for protection against harassment of women removing K-Electric (KE) Chief Executive Officer Moonis Alvi from his position over allegations of sexual harassment.</p>
<p>A day prior, the ombudsman <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927799">ordered</a> the removal of KE CEO Alvi after finding him guilty of workplace harassment.</p>
<p>Alvi, along with other KE employees, was accused of workplace harassment by the company’s former chief marketing and communication officer, Mahreen Aziz Khan, read the order issued by provincial ombudsman retired Justice Shahnawaz Tariq.</p>
<p>According to a petition Alvi filed with the SHC today — available with <em>Dawn.com</em> — his lawyers argued that Khan has neither levelled any allegations of “harassment of a sexual or physical nature” before the ombudsman, nor presented any evidence of gender discrimination within KE.</p>
<p>“There was no allegation that the petitioner, being in a position of authority, sought out any sexual favour, nor any gender based discrimination was alleged or could be made out as several women are holding high-level positions within the organisation,” the petition read.</p>
<p>“In the circumstances, the findings in the impugned order are flimsy, not sustainable and completely disproportionate. No hostile work environment was alleged or proved as a result of gender based discrimination nor as a result of harassment.”</p>
<p>The plea also noted: “The learned provincial ombudsman did not have jurisdiction over the affairs of a trans-provincial organisation such as KE and so also did not have jurisdiction to take cognisance on a complaint filed by an ex-employee.”</p>
<p>In a court order issued today and seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, the SHC ruled that since KE is a “trans-provincial entity/establishment”, the provincial ombudsman has no jurisdiction to act upon the complaints.</p>
<p>“Has placed on record the earlier order passed by this bench on [July 29] in CP No D-3589/2025, wherein it is, inter alia, stated that the court has held in reported Judgements … that in case of trans-provincial establishment/entity, the federal ombudsman is competent to look into such complaints,” the order read.</p>
<p>The order added that the petitioner’s lawyers noted that KE was classed as a trans-provincial entity in a 2015 judgement. The bench stated that the “contention raised requires consideration”.</p>
<p>“Issue notices to the respondents as well as learned advocate general Sindh and DAG (deputy attorney general) for [August 8]. Till the next date of hearing, [the] operation of the impugned decision will remain suspended,” the order read.</p>
<p>It, however, ordered Alvi to pay a Rs2.5 million penalty to the court.</p>
<p>In her application, Khan had accused Alvi, KE Chief People Officer Rizwan Dallia, Chief of Security retired Colonel Wahid Asghar and Member of the Board of Directors and Chairman Board HR Committee Khalid Rafi, of “causing harassment, intimidation and mental agony”.</p>
<p>The ombudsman’s order said that Alvi had “committed harassment, created a hostile environment and caused mental agony at the workplace to [Khan] and her team”.</p>
<p>Consequently, Alvi was penalised under Section 4(4)(ii)(c) of the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, and ordered removed from his service instantly, along with a penalty of Rs2.5 million, which would be paid to Khan as compensation within 30 days of the order being passed.</p></p>

            <p><p>Rescue officials recovered the car of retired Colonel Ishaq Qazi that was swept away by an overflowing rainwater drain along with him and his daughter <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/pmd-issues-glof-alert-for-gb-kp-as-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-from-diamer-amid-floods#:~:text=Two%20swept%20away%20in%20Rawalpindi%E2%80%99s%20DHA'">last week</a> in Rawalpindi, an official said on Friday.</p>
<p>The car, a grey Honda City vehicle, was recovered from the Kak Bridge. Search teams found Qazi’s body <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926363">last Friday</a>, who was aged approximately 62–64 years and a resident of Defence Housing Authority (DHA) Phase 5.</p>
<p>The body of the colonel’s daughter, Muneba, however, has not been found yet. “The body of the girl who drowned in the floodwater will also be found soon,” District Emergency Officer (DEO) Sibghatullah told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>The retired colonel and his daughter headed to the gate in their car, despite heavy rains and waterlogged streets.</p>
<p>According to a statement by Islamabad’s Sihala police station, “Due to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain.”</p>
<p>With the onset of the monsoon season in Pakistan, which typically lasts from late June to September, different parts of the country witness heavy rainfall and a heightened risk of extreme weather events like flash floods and landslides, especially in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/officials-say-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-amid-gb-floods-govt-issues-landslide-alert">northern and western regions</a>.</p></p>
