            <p><p>The United Kingdom on Wednesday removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, thereby allowing Pakistani airlines to now apply to operate flights to the UK, according to a statement from the British High Commission in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Debt-ridden Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1566153">banned</a> from flying to the European Union, UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1558944">killing nearly 100 people</a>. The ban on operating to Europe was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875575">lifted</a> in November last year.</p>
<p>Today’s development comes after a team from the UK Department for Transport <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923408/uk-audit-approves-pakistan-aviation-security">concluded</a> an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”.</p>
<p>“Following air safety improvements, the UK’s Air Safety Committee has lifted UK restrictions on Pakistani carriers,” said a statement from the British High Commission.</p>
<p>“Individual airline carriers will still need to apply for permits to operate to the UK through the UK Civil Aviation Authority.”</p>
<p>British High Commissioner Jane Marriott was quoted as saying: “I’m grateful to aviation experts in the UK and Pakistan for their collaborative work to drive improvements to meet international safety standards.</p>
<p>“While it will take time for flights to resume, once the logistics are in place, I look forward to using a Pakistani carrier when visiting family and friends.”</p>
<p>In a post on X, Marriott called the approval “an important step, and a testament” to PIA’s air safety improvements.</p>

<p>Decisions on de-listing states and air carriers from the UK Air Safety List are made through an independent aviation safety process, according to the statement.</p>
<p>“This is overseen by the UK’s Air Safety Committee, who have <em>[sic]</em> been closely engaging with the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority over several years.</p>
<p>“The committee has judged that necessary safety improvements have been made since its original decision in 2021. Therefore, based on this independent and technically-driven process, it has decided to remove Pakistan and its air carriers from the list.”</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the move, saying it will provide “ease in travel between the UK and Pakistan will help this vital trade relationship grow manifold”.</p>
<p>“With over 1.6 million people of Pakistani heritage living in the UK and thousands of British nationals in Pakistan, today’s announcement brings long-awaited relief and new opportunities for families and friends to reunite,” he wrote on X.</p>

<p>Reacting to today’s development, Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif commended the government led by his party for “crossing another milestone”. “Three years of continuous hard work have borne fruit,” he <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KhawajaMAsif/status/1945389259881406550" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X.</p>
<p>“The green crescent flag is once again soaring proudly in the skies,” Asif added, commending his aviation ministry for its efforts.</p>

<p>The move adds to another positive development, with the UK government yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924354">launching</a> e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an “enhanced” border and immigration system.</p>
<p>A day prior to that, the two countries formally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924280/pakistan-uk-ink-accord-to-boost-economic-cooperation">signed</a> the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.</p></p>

            <p><p>Two policemen were gunned down in a “terrorist” attack on Wednesday in Kulachi area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district, police said.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, DI Khan Police Spokesperson, Yaqoob Khan, said, “The two police personnel were on their way to buy food when the terrorists opened fire on them.”</p>
<p>The deceased have been identified as head constable Ghulam Muhammad and constable Shahzad, both of whom were ex-servicemen.</p>
<p>Following the attack, police and Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) personnel tracked down the terrorists and killed one of them during an operation, while the other two, though injured, fled.</p>
<p>“Weapons and ammunition have been recovered from the slain terrorist, while a search operation is underway for the terrorists at large,” according to the spokesperson.</p>
<p>Federal Minister for Interior Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack, paying tribute to the martyred personnel.</p>
<p>He saluted the “sacrifices made by the brave sons” of KP in their fight against terrorism. Expressing sympathy for the families of the deceased, he said that the government stands with them at this difficult time.</p>
<p>Naqvi vowed that “their sacrifices will not go in vain”.</p>
<p>“KP police is leading the fight against terrorism in the country,” he noted.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents, with a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a> across Peshawar, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, and Bajaur in the past few months.</p>
<p>On June 21, KP Police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918714">killed</a> a terrorist and injured two others belonging to the TTP group in Dera Ismail Khan as they attempted to attack the police.</p>
<p>On June 3, terrorist <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915202">attacks</a> on two police stations in KP’s Bajaur and Bannu districts injured four police personnel. In May, two policemen were martyred and two were injured in a suicide <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911459">attack</a> in Peshawar, while in a separate incident, two cops <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912410">lost</a> their lives as a result of an attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu.</p>
<p>Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.</p>
<p>On July 5, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP’s Tipu Gul group were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922269">killed</a> in a joint operation by the CTD.</p>
<p>Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924568/us-lawmakers-warn-pakistan-over-transnational-repression-hint-at-possible-sanctions' target='_blank'><strong>US lawmakers warn Pakistan over transnational repression, hint at possible sanctions</strong></a>
            <p><p>The US Congress may soon urge President Donald Trump’s administration to consider imposing sanctions on countries that suppress religious freedom and violate human rights, Republican Congressman Christopher H. Smith suggested during a congressional <a class="link--external" href="https://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=414868" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hearing</a> on Pakistan on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest disappointments — regardless of who is in the White House or at the State Department — is the absence of sanctions,” said Smith, who co-chairs the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission (<a class="link--external" href="http://humanrightscommission.house.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TLHRC</a>).</p>
<p>Smith recalled that the only individual ever sanctioned under US religious freedom laws was Indian Prime Minister <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1107011">Narendra Modi</a>, following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1265474">2002 Gujarat riots</a>. “We are going to call on the Irfa office to consider imposing [sanctions] — especially in light of the terrible acts committed against people of various faiths,” he said.</p>
<p>The Irfa office, based at the State Department, enforces the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/2021%20Legislation%20Factsheet%20-%20IRFA.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Religious Freedom Act</a>, which authorises the US government to designate and penalise countries that engage in or tolerate severe religious persecution.</p>
<p>“That’s it. We’ve got 18 sanctions here, and we are going to impose them on you,” Smith declared during the hearing on Pakistan’s current political and human rights situation.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Amnesty International’s advocacy director for Europe and Central Asia, Ben Linden; PTI leader Zulfi Bukhari; law firm Perseus Strategies’ Managing Director Jared Genser; and Afghanistan Impact Network founder Sadiq Amini provided their testimonies during the hearing.</p>
<p>Although the TLHRC does not directly recommend sanctions, Smith’s remarks were widely seen as a signal that such measures may be under consideration if current trends persist.</p>
<p>His Democratic counterpart, Congressman James McGovern, echoed the concern. “A vibrant Pakistani community in Massachusetts engages me all the time, and quite frankly, they are worried about the signals coming from our government right now,” he said.</p>
<p>Speaking about the political climate in Pakistan, McGovern added: “They need to know that people are watching. They need to know we don’t like what we are hearing.”</p>
<p>The bipartisan hearing focused on civil liberties and political freedoms in Pakistan, highlighting reports of repression, persecution of minorities, and efforts to silence dissidents abroad.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Amnesty’s Ben Linden opened his testimony by raising concerns over the situation in Balochistan.</p>
<p>“Dr Mahrang and other Baloch detainees should be freed,” he said, referring to the rights activist who has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922808/quetta-atc-sends-mahrang-other-byc-activists-on-10-day-physical-remand">in prison</a> for more than three months over cases on allegedly “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899608">attacking</a>” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”.</p>
<p>A day ago, a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa33/0109/2025/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">campaign letter</a> by Amnesty International <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924391">called upon</a> Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti to “release all detained Baloch activists”.</p>
<p>Linden warned that recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875102">crackdowns</a> on PTI supporters should be seen in the context of a broader assault on fundamental rights.</p>
<p>“Ahmadis and other religious minorities are being targeted while local authorities fail to protect them,” he said. “Vaguely worded blasphemy laws are being weaponised by majoritarian religious groups, while the accused have few means to defend themselves.”</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860220">2024 alone</a>, over 300 new blasphemy cases were registered — most against Muslims. “Several of the accused were killed extrajudicially,” Linden said, calling the trend “a tragedy”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He also condemned the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923067/hrcp-expresses-concern-as-govt-warns-criminal-action-against-27-youtube-channels-set-for-blocking">blocking</a> of US-based YouTube channels critical of Pakistan’s military, describing the move as “totally unacceptable”.</p>
<p>However, Jared Genser of Perseus Strategies stressed that Washington could not afford to disengage entirely.</p>
<p>“We don’t act that way with any regime. We have to engage. The key is for President Trump and Secretary [of State] Marco Rubio to say very clearly: we want a strong relationship with Pakistan, but this is what needs to be done to get there. And that includes releasing [ex-prime minister] <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885852">Imran Khan</a> and other political prisoners,” Genser said.</p>
<p>He noted: “We need to talk about the tragedy that Pakistan is today in terms of human rights. The Pakistani diaspora is a ray of hope.”</p>
<p>McGovern concurred: “We need to talk. We need to engage. And we need to be talking about political prisoners, the future of Imran Khan … but also how you do it.”</p>
<p>The hearing also addressed last week’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093">White House meeting</a> between Trump and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.</p>
<p>Bukhari, a former close aide to Imran, told the panel: “President Trump wanted to meet someone who is calling the shots. That’s why he met the army chief.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Bukhari claimed nearly 200 politically motivated cases had been filed against Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi. He alleged that “fundamental rights had been suspended” in Pakistan, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893958">media</a> silenced, and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893562">judicial independence</a> undermined through “coercive” <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866825">amendments</a>.</p>
<p>Sadiq Amini, founder of the Afghanistan Impact Network, focused on what he called Pakistan’s “duplicity” in its relationship with the United States, claiming that ex-prime minister Imran was “used” to mislead Trump during his first term.</p>
<p>“After the announcement of his South Asia strategy, [Imran] Khan rushed to Washington with a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1649709">message of peace</a> from the Taliban — a message that was actually a carefully crafted deception by his Russian counterparts. He convinced President Trump to pursue a peace deal with the Taliban, which only empowered them.”</p>
<p>He argued that the peace process ultimately failed, leading to the US withdrawal and the rise of a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907890">gender apartheid regime</a>” in Kabul.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Amini further alleged that Imran, as prime minister, acted as a spokesperson for the Taliban, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1674947">promoting</a> them as an indigenous movement serving Afghan interests.</p>
<p>He warned that Pakistan’s leadership could not win US trust by imprisoning a few individuals like Imran or former spy chief <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1877892">Faiz Hameed</a>. “Pakistani leaders, both military and civilian, complain about the Taliban threat. But even now, they say the Taliban is good for Afghanistan but <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892006">bad for Pakistan</a>. That’s a blatant display of duplicity.”</p>
<p>He also denounced Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902083">detention</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915407">deportation</a> of Afghan refugees as “shameful and inhumane”, and called on the US to reassess Islamabad’s commitment to democracy.</p>
<p>In earlier remarks, TLHRC Co-chair Smith warned that the US “cannot stand by” while military influence allegedly subverts civilian rule in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, US lawmakers also heard disturbing accounts of harassment faced by Pakistani dissidents in the US. Multiple speakers alleged that within 48 hours of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916434#:~:text=PTI%20plans%20protests%20on%2014th">protest</a> outside the Pakistani Embassy in Washington on June 14, “family members of critics were abducted in Pakistan.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers, including Democratic representatives Jimmy Panetta, Suhas Subramanyam and Greg Casar, expressed support for safeguarding the civil liberties of Pakistani Americans.</p>
<p>In March, Panetta and Republican Congressman Joe Wilson had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900312">introduced a bipartisan bill</a> in the US House of Representatives, calling for sanctions on Pakistani state functionaries over alleged human rights violations.</p>
<p>A month before that, US Congressmen Joe Wilson and August Pfluger had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894451">written to Rubio</a>, urging him to engage with Pakistan to secure Imran’s release.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>During the commission’s hearing, speakers also urged Congress to oversee foreign surveillance operations on US soil and to press technology companies to resist censorship demands from foreign military courts.</p>
<p>Established in 2008 and named after Holocaust survivor and former House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Tom Lantos, the TLHRC holds bipartisan hearings to guide US human rights policy.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s session underscored longstanding concerns about Pakistan’s democratic trajectory and signalled growing interest in potential policy responses — including targeted sanctions.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921746">deep concern</a> over the steadily shrinking space for human rights advocacy. Its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907651">annual report</a> for 2024 also highlighted a troubling dec­line in civic freedoms, deteriorating law and order, and a marked strain on federalism.</p>
<p>Rights tracker <a class="link--external" href="https://monitor.civicus.org/watchlist-march-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Civicus Monitor</a> has listed Pakistan’s status as “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896892">repressed</a>” and added the country to its human rights watchlist for 2025 due to a narrowing civil space.</p>
<p>Washington DC-based organisation Freedom House ranked Pakistan as “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894421">partly free</a>” in political rights and civil liberties in its latest annual report, with the country losing three points from the year prior.</p></p>
