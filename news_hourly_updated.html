                <h2>Tense phonecall on Pak-India ceasefire reason for deterioration in Trump-Modi relations: report</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A tense phone call on the ceasefire between Pakistan and India became the basis for the current breakdown in relations between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and United States President Donald Trump, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-08/trump-s-50-india-tariff-threats-upend-decades-of-us-policy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on Friday.</p>
<p>Trump on Wednesday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929119/trump-imposes-additional-25pc-tariff-on-indian-goods-relations-hit-new-low">imposed</a> an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, citing New Delhi‚Äôs continued imports of Russian oil in a move that sharply escalated tensions between the two nations after trade talks reached a deadlock. The new import tax, set to come into place in three weeks, will raise duties on some Indian exports to as high as 50pc ‚Äî among the highest levied on any US trading partner.</p>
<p>While the rupture in US-India ties was abrupt, there have been strains in the relationship. Delhi has repeatedly rebutted Trump‚Äôs repeated statements that the US brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after four days of fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Trump also hosted Pakistan‚Äôs army chief at the White House in the weeks following the conflict.</p>
<p>The two leaders <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917877">spoke</a> over the phone at the insistence of Trump on the sidelines of June‚Äôs G7 summit in Canada, which Modi attended as a guest. The call lasted 35 minutes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPM Modi told President Trump clearly that during this period, there was no talk at any stage on subjects like India-US trade deal or US mediation between India and Pakistan,‚Äù Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had said of the talk. ‚ÄúTalks for ceasing military action happened directly between India and Pakistan through existing military channels, and on the insistence of Pakistan. Prime Minister Modi emphasised that India has not accepted mediation in the past and will never do,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p><em>Bloomberg</em> reported today that ‚Äútensions came to a head‚Äù between the two leaders in the call with Trump‚Äôs repeated claiming of credit and India‚Äôs downplaying of the matter.</p>
<p>‚ÄúModi felt like he needed to set the record straight in the call after his aides discovered that Trump planned to host a lunch the following day at the White House for Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir,‚Äù the report cited officials in New Delhi familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to speak about confidential discussions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile India had no problem if Trump met Pakistan‚Äôs civilian leaders, hosting Munir was seen as giving legitimacy to a military that Modi‚Äôs government accuses of supporting militant groups, they said. Wary that Trump would look to orchestrate a meeting between Munir and Modi, the Indian leader turned down an invitation to stop by the White House on the way back from Canada, they said, adding that he was also committed to visiting Croatia,‚Äù the report said.</p>
<p>It added that since the phone call, ‚ÄúIndia saw a shift in tone from the White House after that phone call, according to the officials in New Delhi‚Äù despite the US not making a direct request for Modi to acknowledge Trump‚Äôs role.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOnce Trump began publicly attacking India, they added, it was clear the episode marked a turning point in the broader relationship,‚Äù the report said.</p>
<p>Modi said a day ago he would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929293">not compromise</a> on the agriculture sector.</p>
<p>For New Delhi, one of the main sticking points in trade negotiations has been Washington‚Äôs demand to access India‚Äôs vast agricultural and dairy market. India has remained steadfast about its labour-intensive agricultural sector, unwilling to risk angering farmers, a powerful voting bloc.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will not compromise with the interests of our farmers, our dairy sector, our fishermen,‚Äù Modi said during a speech at a conference in New Delhi, his remarks widely seen as his first public response to the tariffs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI know I will have to pay a personal price for this, but I am ready for it,‚Äù he added, without giving further details.</p>
<p>In February, Trump said that he found a ‚Äúspecial bond‚Äù with Modi when he visited Washington ‚Äî complimenting Modi as being a ‚Äúmuch tougher negotiator‚Äù than he was.</p>
<p>Successive US administrations have seen India ‚Äî the world‚Äôs most populous nation and fifth-largest economy ‚Äî as a key partner, with like-minded interests in the face of powerful China.</p>
<p>India and neighbouring China have long been intense rivals competing for strategic influence across South Asia.</p>
<p>Now, India is bracing for a bumpy ride, as the US is its largest trading partner, with New Delhi shipping goods worth $87.4 billion in 2024.</p></p>

                <h2>PM Shehbaz blasts Israeli cabinet‚Äôs Gaza takeover plan as ‚Äòdangerous escalation‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday blasted the Israeli cabinet‚Äôs approval of a plan to occupy Gaza City as a ‚Äúdangerous escalation‚Äù.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Israel‚Äôs political-security cabinet <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929467">approved</a> a plan to take control of Gaza City, nearly two years into its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1784085">invasion</a> of the Palestinian territory. The approval came hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel intended to take military control of the entire strip, American news agency <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe strongly condemn the Israeli cabinet‚Äôs approval of a plan to take illegal and illegitimate control of Gaza City. This tantamounts to a dangerous escalation in an already catastrophic war against the people of Palestine,‚Äù the prime minister said in a post on X.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>He added that the expansion of military operations will only worsen the already existing humanitarian crisis and derail any prospect for peace in the region.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe must not lose sight of the root cause of this ongoing tragedy: that is, Israel‚Äôs prolonged, illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. As long as this occupation endures, peace will remain elusive,‚Äù the premier added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan reiterates its unwavering support for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent and sovereign State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in line with relevant UN and OIC resolutions.‚Äù</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz called upon the international community to intervene urgently to bring an immediate halt to Israel‚Äôs unwarranted aggression, ensure the protection of innocent civilians, and ensure the direly needed delivery of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza.</p>
<p>Earlier, Foreign Office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan in his weekly briefing <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/transcript-of-the-weekly-press-briefing-by-the-spokesperson-friday-august-8-2025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that Federal Information Minister Attaullah Tarar officiated the send-off of the 18th humanitarian aid consignment to Gaza at a ceremony held at Islamabad International Airport today.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUnder the directives of the Prime Minister, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), in close coordination with relevant partners, facilitated the dispatch of this consignment, which is the 18th shipment from Pakistan,‚Äù the FO spokesperson said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

<p>The aid consignment comprised of essential supplies including dry ration packs, Meals Ready-to-Eat and medicines. The ceremony was attended by senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the NDMA, and the Ambassador of Palestine to Pakistan, he added.</p>
<p>This consignment brings Pakistan‚Äôs total humanitarian assistance to Gaza to 18 shipments, comprising 1,815 tons of vital relief supplies, he added, saying ‚ÄúThis sustained support reflects Pakistan‚Äôs resolute solidarity with the people of Gaza.‚Äù</p>
<p>Since October 7, 2023, Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed 61,258 and injured 152,045 Palestinians, per the Palestinian health ministry. Bombardments have also <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-has-destroyed-88-of-gaza-strip-since-oct-7-2023-gaza-media-office/3634914" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">destroyed</a> 88 per cent of the Gaza Strip, according to the Gaza Media Office, with Tel-Aviv facing accusations of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929014/south-africa-urges-more-countries-to-stand-up-to-israels-genocidal-activities">genocide</a>.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the World Health Organisation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929483/99-die-from-malnutrition-in-gaza-this-year-says-who">said</a> that 99 people were now known to have died from <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926555/unrwa-chief-says-mass-starvation-in-gaza-is-deliberate">malnutrition</a> in the Gaza Strip so far this year, with the figure likely an underestimate.</p>
<p>International outrage over the humanitarian situation in Gaza has ratcheted up pressure on Israel, with UN agencies warning of famine in the devastated Palestinian territory.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Israel‚Äôs military chief had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929206/israeli-military-chief-told-to-toe-the-line-after-opposing-reoccupation">pushed back</a> against Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs plans to seize areas of Gaza it doesn‚Äôt already control, three Israeli officials said, as the prime minister faced increasing pressure over the invasion both at home and abroad.</p>

<p>The Foreign Office, in a separate <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/pakistan-condemns-the-reported-israeli-plan-for-a-complete-military-takeover-of-gaza" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, condemned the Israeli plan for complete military takeover of Gaza.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan condemns in the strongest possible terms the reported Israeli plan for a complete military takeover of Gaza,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>This not only represents yet another flagrant violation of international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions, but also the occupying power‚Äôs intention to further expand its ongoing genocidal military campaign, the statement added.</p>
<p>This highly escalatory action will further aggravate the prevailing grave humanitarian situation and suffering of the civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in addition to undermining international efforts aimed at achieving peace and stability in the region, the FO said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan reiterates its call on the international community to ensure an immediate end to Israeli impunity and its genocidal military campaign‚Äù, the FO said, calling for concrete measures for the provision of unimpeded humanitarian supplies to millions of Palestinians in dire need, and to hold Israel accountable for its heinous crimes.</p></p>
