            <p><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Saturday said it would continue discussions over the next fiscal year’s federal budget in the upcoming days as its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912130">mission</a> concluded.</p>
<p>Pakistan and the Fund had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912130">opened</a> high-level policy talks in Islamabad on May 19 to discuss the FY2025-26 budget. As deliberations with the IMF remained inconclusive, the government has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912931/budget-put-off-to-june-10-as-talks-with-imf-continue">postponed</a> the budget announcement till June 10.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2025/05/23/pr-25160-imf-staff-concludes-visit-to-pakistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> issued today, the IMF’s Pakistan mission chief Nathan Porter termed the recent discussions “constructive” and said: “We will continue discussions towards agreeing over the authorities’ FY26 budget over the coming days.”</p>
<p>“Discussions focused on actions to enhance revenue — including by bolstering compliance and expanding the tax base — and prioritise expenditure,” Porter added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>“We held constructive discussions with the authorities on their FY2026 budget proposals and broader economic policy, and reform agenda supported by the 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860850">Extended Fund Facility</a> (EFF) and the 2025 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900322">Resilience and Sustainability Facility</a> (RSF),” Porter said, referring to the $7 billion loan programme and the climate fund deal, respectively.</p>
<p>“The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to fiscal consolidation while safeguarding social and priority expenditures, aiming for a primary surplus of 1.6 per cent of GDP in FY2026,” the IMF official added.</p>
<p>The Fund noted that the staff visit “focused on recent economic developments, programme implementation, and the budget strategy” for FY2025-26.</p>
<p>Shedding light on other matters reviewed, Porter said: “Discussions also covered ongoing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850153">energy sector reforms</a> aimed at improving financial viability and reducing the high-cost structure of Pakistan’s power sector as well as other structural reforms which will help foster sustainable growth and promote a more level playing field for business and investment.”</p>
<p>The government emphasised its commitment to “ensuring sound macroeconomic policy making and building buffers”, according to the statement.</p>
<p>“In this context, maintaining an appropriately tight and data-dependent monetary policy remains a priority to ensure inflation is anchored within the central bank’s medium-term target range of 5–7 per cent,” Porter stressed.</p>
<p>“At the same time, rebuilding foreign exchange (FX) reserve buffers, preserving a fully functioning FX market, and allowing for greater exchange rate flexibility are critical to strengthening resilience to external shocks.”</p>
<p>The IMF mission appreciated the federal and provincial authorities for their “hospitality, constructive discussions, and strong collaboration and commitment to sound policies”.</p>
<p>Affirming that it will continue its close dialogue with the authorities, the IMF said its next mission associated with the next EFF and RSF reviews was expected in the second half of 2025.</p>

<p>As the federal government gears up for the budget, incarcerated ex-prime minister Imran Khan, whose PTI rules Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has called on Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to meet him before the budget announcment.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ImranKhanPTI/status/1926165945266942295?t=5NTx7MRkD_uYdrNGbozeCw&amp;s=19" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on Imran’s X account quoted Imran’s purported conversation with lawyers at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where he is imprisoned. The former premier doesn’t have access to his X account and someone else posts on his behalf, but the PTI has never revealed the identity of the social media handler.</p>
<p>The post read: “As party chairman, it is necessary for the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to seek my guidance on budgetary and policy matters.</p>
<p>“The people have elected PTI to govern, and therefore, the responsibility for policymaking also rests with us. Consequently, it is essential that [KP Chief Minister] Ali Amin Gandapur and the finance minister meet with me before the budget is presented,” it added.</p>

<p>In his post, Imran again stressed the importance of national unity. “The economy is in shambles; investors and the youth are steadily leaving the country,” he claimed, stating it as one of his reasons to call for a dialogue.</p>
<p>The KP government has called upon its federal counterpart to immediately <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911817/saif-seeks-nfc-meeting-before-federal-budget">convene a meeting</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1822745">National Finance Commission</a> (NFC) and ensure the transfer of the constitutional share of funds allocated for the merged districts to the provincial government before the budget announcement.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#considerations-for-budget" id="considerations-for-budget" title="Permalink"></a>Considerations for budget</h2>
<p>During the staff visit, the IMF mission had multiple rounds of discussion yesterday, including a wrap-up session with Aurangzeb, informed sources <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912931/budget-put-off-to-june-10-as-talks-with-imf-continue">said</a>.</p>
<p>An IMF delegation led by the director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department, Jihad Azour, met with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912609">Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif</a> on Thursday and with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912931/budget-put-off-to-june-10-as-talks-with-imf-continue#:~:text=Zardari%20meets%20IMF%20delegation">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> the next day.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The defence allocations for next year had a reasonable budgetary impact, which could not be settled with the IMF staff before the meeting with Aurangzeb, although discussions between the Federal Board of Revenue’s top brass and the staff mission continued until evening.</p>
<p>Sources said the engagements with the IMF would now continue virtually over the next week till finalisation of the defence budget, and as a result, the revenue side of the equation and other estimates under the budget, including the federal public sector development programme that was now estimated at Rs1tr.</p>
<p>Sources said there is no plan to increase the rate of petroleum levy in the near future, except for a separate imposition of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1834001">carbon levy</a> on a number of items, starting with about Rs3 per litre and going up to Rs5 in the second year to meet a requirement of the RSF.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/3  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The sources said the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893953">relief measures</a> for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903395">salaried class</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906241">real estate</a>, and expenditure control measures had been discussed with the IMF staff, but this would remain subject to an alternative resource envelope to be presented by the authorities, as fiscal consolidation would remain one of the central themes of the next year’s budget.</p>
<p>The budget announcement would be immediately followed by a comprehensive debate in the house and enable standing committees on finance to read through budget proposals and give their input before its passage by the two houses, well before June 30.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912993/pakistan-gets-over-16bn-in-rollovers-new-loans' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan gets over $16bn in rollovers, new loans</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan received $16.08 billion in foreign loans and grants in the first 10 months of 2024-25, compared to an annual target of $19.2bn by June 30.</p>
<p>While half of this portfolio was legacy rollovers from China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, fresh loans and grant inflows amounted to $6.086bn in July-April, almost 15 per cent lower than the comparable period of last fiscal year.</p>
<p>In its monthly report on Foreign Economic Assistance (FEA) released on Friday, the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) said that against its annual target of $19.4bn, FEA in July-April amounted to $6.086bn compared to $7.142bn in the same period last year with an annual target of $17.6bn.</p>
<p>This does not include about $1bn disbursed by the IMF in October as an upfront payment under the $7bn ongoing Extended Fund Facility (EFF) that is accounted for separately by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). This also does not include the subsequent $1bn IMF inflow last week.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>With three rollovers and fresh disbursements, the total external assistance in 10MFY25 amounted to $16.08bn. This included $3bn rollovers by Saudi Arabia, $2bn by the UAE, and $3bn by China. Pakistan has a total annual rollover portfolio of about $12.7bn in safe deposits and loans from these three countries, leaving the country’s net international reserves (NIR) at around $3.3bn.</p>
<p>The foreign economic assistance recorded by the EAD showed inflows fell by about 15pc to about $6.086bn in July-April, apparently because of delayed IMF bailout and subsequent $1bn disbursements. Last year, these inflows, including IMF, amounted to $8.2bn during 10MFY24.</p>
<p>In April, the EAD reported monthly inflows at $576 million, compared to $555m in March, $237m in February and $830m in January.</p>
<p>The EAD said that out of $6.086bn, about $3.45bn was received for budgetary support or programme loans and the remaining $2.6bn for project financing. During the same period last year, the EAD secured about $2.3bn as project aid and $4.8bn as programme loans.</p>
<p>Of the total, inflows from multilaterals stood at $2.98bn in 10MFY25 compared to $2.86bn last year, while bilateral disbursements stood at $372m against $878m last year, down 58pc.</p>
<p>The EAD reported receiving about $706m in loans from foreign commercial lenders (UAE-based) in 10MFY25, showing a minor recovery from commercial banks that had stayed away from financing Pakistan last year. It may be noted that the government has budgeted $3.8bn in financing from foreign commercial banks for the current year, showing a poor outcome, again due to the delayed IMF umbrella and economic conditions.</p>
<p>The government has also targeted $1bn in international bonds for the current year. A projection for $9bn inflow from China and Saudi Arabia was targeted for FY25. These projections include a $5bn time deposit from Saudi Arabia and $4bn China’s SAFE deposit. These projections are critical for Pakistan to meet its external financing gap as part of the IMF programme.</p>
<p>In addition, Pakistan also received $1.61bn from overseas Pakistanis through Naya Pakistan Certificates compared to $8861m in the same period last year. The Asian Development Bank disbursed $1.253bn in 10MFY25 compared to $708m a year ago, and $1.07bn was received from the World Bank.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913039/ppp-leader-supports-inclusion-of-all-stakeholders-including-pti-in-diplomatic-delegation' target='_blank'><strong>PPP leader supports inclusion of all stakeholders including PTI in diplomatic delegation</strong></a>
            <p><p>PPP Secretary General Humayun Khan on Friday supported the inclusion of all stakeholders including the PTI in the diplomatic delegation set to represent the country in important world capitals following the rise in hostilities with India.</p>
<p>Last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911791">decided</a> to send a “high-level diplomatic delegation to important world capitals to expose Indian propaganda” in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>Speaking in the <em>DawnNewsTV</em> programme ‘Doosra Rukh’, when asked if PTI should also be included in the delegation, Khan said: “All stakeholders are welcome to get this country out of this crisis.”</p>
<p>“We need to be on one page and fight the country’s case. Prime Minister [Shehbaz] <em>sahib</em> has made the right choice by choosing Bilawal [Bhutto-Zardari] sahib to continue fighting Pakistan’s case in international forums,” Khan added.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between New Delhi and Islamabad came as tensions over last month’s Pahalgam attack continued to build up, as India — without evidence — blamed Pakistan for the attack. On the night of May 6-7, India launched a series of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting</a> drones sent by India and tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns and declare a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and offered talks.</p>
<p>In light of the situation, PM Shehbaz decided to send a high-level diplomatic delegation to important world capitals to counter Indian propaganda related to the escalation and the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>When the formation of the delegation was announced, “In a telephonic conversation with PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, the prime minister has entrusted the leadership of the delegation to him”, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>The delegation comprises Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Senator Sherry Rehman, Hina Rabbani Khar, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua and Jalil Abbas Jilani, it added.</p>
<p>“The delegation will visit London, Washington, Paris, and Brussels to highlight India’s disinformation campaign and its attempts to destabilise regional peace,” the report had added.</p>
<p>In a similar development, the Indian government also <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2129254" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, later this month to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.</p></p>
