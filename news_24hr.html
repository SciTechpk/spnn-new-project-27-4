            <p><p>President Asif Ali Zardari hosted Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian at the Presidency on Sunday, where they had a meeting during the latter’s two-day visit to Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Iran share close ties and have signed multiple <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1829340">agreements</a> across sectors such as energy and trade.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Presidency, both sides “reaffirmed their commitment to further broaden bilateral cooperation in diverse fields” and “emphasised the importance of enhancing bilateral ties in wide-ranging and mutually beneficial areas”.</p>
<p>President Zardari was quoted as saying that Pakistan and Iran enjoy brotherly relations rooted in shared religion, culture and mutual respect.</p>
<p>“The two leaders exchanged views on major regional and international developments and stressed the need for coordinated diplomatic efforts to prevent the escalation of conflicts and to promote peace, security, and stability in the region,” the statement added.</p>
<p>The president appreciated Iran’s positions on regional issues and acknowledged the Islamic republic’s consistent support for regional cooperation.</p>
<p>He expressed gratitude for Iran’s solidarity during critical moments, such as the war with India and reaffirmed Islamabad’s commitment to working closely with Tehran for a peaceful and prosperous future.</p>
<p>President Zardari also thanked Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for his consistent support for the people of Indian-occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>“President Zardari strongly condemned the unprovoked Israeli aggression against Iran and lauded the bravery and unity of the Iranian nation during the recent 12‑day war,” the statement added. “He expressed hope that President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian’s visit would further solidify the brotherly relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>“President Pezeshkian thanked the leadership and people of Pakistan for their support during the 12‑day war and appreciated Pakistan’s constructive role in advocating de‑escalation, dialogue, and diplomacy for the peaceful resolution of disputes,” the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that the Pakistani and Iranian leadership were eager to raise bilateral trade volume between the two countries to $10 billion at the earliest, according to a joint statement.</p>
<p>The announcement was made as the two countries signed 12 agreements and memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with PM Shehbaz and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian addressing a joint press briefing.</p>
<p>“Both countries signed a number of documents to transform them into agreements and to realise the potential of $10bn trade target, adding that the respective delegations from the two sides would further hold detailed meetings to move forward in this regard,” according to the state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/global/pakistan-iran-keen-to-boost-bilateral-trade-volume-to-10bn-pm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)</a></em>.</p>
<p>During the bilateral meeting, which took place before the joint press briefing, both sides discussed the broad aspects of their bilateral ties, brotherly relations, religious and cultural ties, and held comprehensive talks to further boost them.</p>
<p>Speaking during the joint press briefing, PM Sharif condemned how Israel, on June 13, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/israel-iran-conflict">attacked</a> Iran’s nuclear sites. According to the Iranian government, 610 people were killed during the war, while rights groups put the figure at 974.</p>
<p>“Israel, without any rhyme or reason, unleashed aggression against Iran, which was not only strongly condemned by the government of Pakistan but by the entire 240 million Pakistani people, as there was no reason for Israel to stoke war,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>According to the report, the prime minister also expressed his condolences on the martyrdom of Iranian generals, scientists and civilians during the conflict and prayed for the departed souls and the injured for their early recovery.</p>
<p>He also lauded the Iranian leadership for showing bravery and wisdom during the Israeli aggression and said the Iranian forces and the people faced the aggression and exposed the Israeli defence system with volleys of retaliatory missile attacks.</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s principled stance over Iran’s right to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925977/iran-rules-out-giving-up-its-nuclear-programme">nuclear programme</a> for peaceful purposes under the UN charter, saying that Pakistan would stand by its stance.</p>
<p>In the fight against terrorism, he said both sides shared views that it could not be tolerated at any cost. “If anyone in Iran was affected by terrorism, it was akin to a victim of terror in Pakistan,” he said.</p>
<p>The premier further said that the two brotherly countries would take effective measures to eliminate terrorism.</p>
<p>The prime minister, on behalf of the people and the government of Pakistan, welcomed the president on his maiden visit to Pakistan.</p>
<p>In his remarks, President Pezeshkian expressed gratitude for the position adopted by the parliament, government and the people of Pakistan for supporting Iran during the 10-day Israeli aggression.</p>
<p>He said the bonds of affinities and affection between the two countries and nations were deeply rooted in religion, culture and history, citing poetic verses of Allama Muhammad Iqbal, in which he stressed upon unity among the Muslim countries.</p>
<p>“Advancing the neighbourhood policy is among the priorities of Iran’s foreign policy, as Pakistan is not only our neighbour but also a brotherly country,” he added.</p>
<p>The president expressed his satisfaction that, fortunately, serious and sincere efforts were being initiated by both sides for cooperation in diverse fields, and to take their current trade volume of $3bn to the projected target of $10bn.</p>
<p>President Pezeshkian said that his government was determined to take steps to implement these agreements, while the development of land, sea and air routes would facilitate trade.</p>
<p>The two countries aslo convened a high-level business forum in Islamabad, attended by President Pezeshkian and other senior officials, aimed at bolstering bilateral trade ties and finalising a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), Iranian state-run <em>IRNA</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85904526/Iran-Pakistan-business-forum-held-in-Islamabad-during-President" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The event, hosted by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, brought together a large number of business leaders, chamber of commerce officials, and top investors from Pakistan.</p>
<p>Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, delivering the opening remarks, welcomed the progress towards finalising the FTA, saying both countries are working on resolving tariff issues and enhancing border infrastructure to facilitate trade.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, President Pezeshkian emphasised the necessity of unity and solidarity among Muslims worldwide.</p>
<p>“We must rely on our own capabilities and resources to overcome challenges and achieve development and progress,” he added.</p>
<p>Addressing the forum, Dar welcomed the positive momentum toward finalising the Pakistan-Iran FTA, according to the Foreign Office.</p>
<p>He emphasised that economic diplomacy is a cornerstone of Pakistan’s foreign policy.</p>
<p>“The Pak-Iran FTA and platforms like the Business Forum are vital for strengthening bilateral trade and promoting collaboration across key sectors, including energy, agriculture, manufacturing, and technology,” he said.</p>

<p>“Welcoming the Iranian president, the deputy prime minister/foreign minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s deep commitment to its historic and brotherly ties with Iran, emphasising their strong foundations in shared history, common cultural heritage, faith, and mutual respect,” the statement said.</p>
<p>President Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan’s support and reaffirmed Iran’s resolve to improve bilateral collaboration in various areas of shared interest. He also looked forward to meaningful discussions with Pakistani leaders to further reinforce the political and economic ties between the two friendly nations, the FO said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#strengthening-bilateral-trade" id="strengthening-bilateral-trade" title="Permalink"></a>Strengthening bilateral trade</h2>
<p>Separately, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal and the Iranian Minister for Industry, Mines and Trade, Mohammad Atabak, also had a high-level discussion on Sunday, where the two sides agreed to accelerate trade, remove border bottlenecks, and build trust-based partnerships across priority sectors, according to a statement from the commerce ministry.</p>
<p>Minister Kamal suggested organising targeted trade delegations that include representatives from federal and provincial chambers of commerce, enabling focused discussions on market access and regulatory facilitation, according to the statement.</p>
<p>“We’ve done this model successfully in Belarus and elsewhere,” he was quoted in the statement as saying. “Let’s do the same for Iran, starting with sectors that show the greatest potential for mutual benefit.”</p>
<p>The ministers also expressed a shared commitment to increasing the use of existing trade corridors and border facilities. Emphasis was placed on maximising the potential of neighbourhood trade, with Kamal highlighting how ASEAN countries have benefited enormously by trading within their region.</p>
<p>“Geography is an advantage. Pakistan and Iran must utilise this discount of distance. If we don’t, we lose both time and cost benefits,” he stated.</p>
<p>Atabak also highlighted ongoing discussions about increasing Pakistani exports to Iran and encouraged swift follow-up on newly signed agreements.</p>
<p>“Traders and industrialists in both countries are ready. They trust each other. What they need now is a clear and consistent facilitation mechanism from our side,” he noted.</p>
<p>Kamal said that beyond bilateral gains, such connectivity could expand to Turkey, Central Asia, Russia, and even parts of the Middle East, creating an economic bloc of substantial power and resilience.</p>
<p>Atabak supported the idea of holding a dedicated business-to-business (B2B) day during every high-level visit and offered to bring Iranian business groups to Pakistan for in-depth meetings, the statement said.</p>
<p>The two ministers acknowledged the historic depth of Pakistan-Iran relations, expressing that recent regional and global developments have pushed both nations closer together.</p>
<p>“Without the rapid engagement and determination from you and your team, we wouldn’t have reached this stage. The momentum we’ve built must now be translated into structured trade outcomes,” Minister Atabak said while praising the Pakistani government’s proactive role in facilitating bilateral trade progress.</p>
<p>Kamal echoed similar sentiments, noting that both governments, as well as the private sector, had shown strong will and passion to work together.</p>
<p>“There’s a moment in diplomacy when the iron is hot — and this is that moment. We must act swiftly. Delays only complicate things,” he said.</p>
<p>He emphasised that formalities follow passion and political will, and highlighted that Pakistan is ready to deepen its economic relationship with Iran through structured channels like the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/global/pakistan-iran-keen-to-boost-bilateral-trade-volume-to-10bn-pm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joint Economic Commission (JEC)</a>, regular B2B exchanges, and sector-focused delegations.</p>
<p>Both ministers agreed on the importance of identifying specific sectors such as agriculture, livestock, services, energy, and cross-border logistics for future collaboration.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the human element of bilateral ties, both sides underscored the cultural and linguistic commonalities between the people of Pakistan and Iran.</p>
<p>The ministers agreed to fast-track the next session of the JEC, ensure participation from both public and private stakeholders, and prioritise border facilitation and trade logistics.</p>
<p>“With high-level political alignment and mutual trust, Pakistan and Iran appear poised to enter a new phase of strategic economic partnership that could reshape regional trade dynamics,” the statement said.</p></p>

            <p><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Sunday dismissed rumours of PTI founder Imran Khan leaving the country under a deal, describing them as attempts to weaken the provincial government.</p>
<p>According to a statement issued today by his focal person for digital media Yar Muhammad Niyazi, Gandapur also rubbished <a class="link--external" href="https://www.geo.tv/latest/616992-imran-says-cm-gandapur-should-resign-if-he-cant-restore-peace-in-kp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">media reports</a> that Imran had asked him to resign from his post as chief minister if he was unable to keep the peace in KP.</p>
<p>The PTI founder said in a “clear message” to Gandapur a day prior that the federation should not be allowed to conduct another military operation in the province and its tribal areas.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, security forces, backed by gunship helicopters and artillery, launched ‘Operation Sarbakaf’ against terrorists in Lowi Mamund tehsil and imposed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927438/curfew-imposed-as-3-day-operation-against-militants-begins-in-bajaur-official">three-day curfew</a> in the region.</p>
<p>“Chief Minister Gandapur has said that the PTI founder Imran Khan will never leave Pakistan,” the statement read. “If he (Imran) had to make a deal, he would have done so by now.”</p>
<p>The focal person’s statement added that Imran never expressed any desire to leave the country.</p>
<p>“The assumptions that are being made that Imran Khan will go abroad are just an attempt to weaken the movement and damage Khan’s position,” it clarified.</p>
<p>The statement continued: “Ali Amin Khan Gandapur said, ’Imran Khan has made me the chief minister. His trust is with me.</p>
<p>“Khan <em>sahib</em> has the government, he has the command, and we are all trying our best to deal with the challenges of the province effectively according to his vision’,”.</p>
<p>The statement further read: “Along with our movement, there is also an administrative responsibility, which we are paying full attention to.”</p>
<p>Gandapur also claimed that rumours are being spread by political opponents to weaken the PTI government in KP and the party’s movement itself.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the CM held the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928287">first</a> in a series of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927600">jirgas</a> to decide on future steps on a wide array of concerns among the province’s residents.</p>
<p>A statement listed down the recommendations made by the jirga, such as ensuring unity against terrorism to restore peace, as well as declaring that displacement amid the ongoing military operation was “unacceptable under any circumstances”.</p>
<p>“Development is linked to peace and it will accelerate when peace is restored,” the statement said. “No one has asked for any resources of the province, including minerals, nor has it been given to anyone, nor will it be given to anyone.”</p>
<p>This development comes days before the PTI is due to launch a major <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922952/imran-shuns-dialogue-plans-nationwide-protest">protest movement</a> across the country, to mark the second year of Imran’s incarceration in multiple cases and demand his release.</p></p>

            <p><p>England had moved to within 35 runs of securing a famous victory over India when bad light and torrential rain ended an extraordinary fourth day of the final Test at The Oval on Sunday.</p>
<p>Harry Brook and Joe Root shared a superb fourth-wicket partnership of 195 to put England on the brink of completing a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928320/ton-up-jaiswal-leaves-england-needing-record-chase-to-beat-india">record run chase</a> that would have given them a 3-1 series win.</p>
<p>With India on the ropes, however, and England needing only another 73 runs, Brook played a wild stroke and skied a catch to depart for 111.</p>
<p>That gave India a chink of hope and they certainly made the most of it.
Jacob Bethell also fell to a rash shot for five and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926610/root-climbs-to-second-on-all-time-test-list-as-england-dominate-india">Root</a>, having completed a masterful 39th test century, nicked a catch to wicketkeeper Dhruv Jurel off Prasidh Krishna to spark wild Indian celebrations.</p>
<p>In mounting tension, Jamie Smith and Jamie Overton struggled to get bat on ball, surviving several frenzied appeals before the umpires decided it was too dark to continue.</p>
<p>The players left the field and shortly afterwards, a heavy rain shower made conditions unplayable, depriving the crowd of a tense finale to a day of unremitting drama.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#gripping-series" id="gripping-series" title="Permalink"></a>Gripping series</h2>
<p>England will resume on 339-6 on Monday, with Chris Woakes unlikely to bat due to a broken shoulder, and India still in with a chance of a victory that would earn them a share of a gripping five-match series.</p>
<p>India had the better of the morning session after England resumed on 50-1, dismissing Ben Duckett for 54 and Ollie Pope for 27 to leave the hosts wobbling on 106-3.</p>
<p>Brook, on 19, was lucky to survive when Mohammed Siraj caught him in the deep before stepping back on to the boundary cushion.</p>
<p>The prolific right-hander made him pay a heavy price for the error, striking two sixes and 12 fours all round the ground to reach his 10th test century off 91 balls.</p>
<p>Root provided the perfect foil, continuing his consistent form throughout the series, as the Indian bowlers struggled to get much movement under grey skies.</p>
<p>Once past three figures, Brook launched an all-out attack, hitting Akash Deep for two fours in an over before attempting a third and Siraj completed the catch on this occasion.</p>
<p>Brook’s bat flew out of his hands as he played the stroke and he had to retrieve it before returning to the pavilion to a standing ovation from the crowd.</p>
<p>He probably believed he had done enough to ensure victory for his team, but India had other ideas.</p>
<p>The highest successful run chase at The Oval was England’s 263-9 against Australia in 1902.</p></p>
