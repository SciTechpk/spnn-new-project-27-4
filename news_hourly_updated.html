                <h2>US hopes that India‚Äôs response to Pahalgam attack doesn‚Äôt lead to broader regional conflict: Vance</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday Washington hoped that India‚Äôs response to the recent attack in occupied Kashmir does not lead to a broader regional conflict.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">civilian</a> and military leadership have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">rejected</a> the accusation and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur hope here is that India responds to this terrorist attack in a way that doesn‚Äôt lead to a broader regional conflict,‚Äù Vance said in an <a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6372190741112" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> on <em>Fox News</em>‚Äô ‚ÄòSpecial Report with Bret Baier‚Äô show.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd we hope, frankly, that Pakistan, to the extent that they‚Äôre responsible, cooperates with India to make sure that the terrorists sometimes operating in their territory are hunted down and dealt with,‚Äù Vance added.</p>
<p>Top US leaders, including President Donald Trump, have condemned the attack, calling it ‚Äúterror‚Äù and ‚Äúunconscionable,‚Äù while expressing support for India without directly blaming Pakistan.</p>
<p>India is an important US partner as Washington aims to counter China‚Äôs rising influence. Pakistan remains Washington‚Äôs ally even as its importance diminished after the 2021 US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1643653">withdrawal</a> from neighbouring Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In recent days, Washington <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907094/us-in-touch-with-india-and-pakistan-urges-work-toward-responsible-solution">urged</a> India and Pakistan to work with each other to de-escalate tensions and arrive at a ‚Äúresponsible solution.‚Äù India has blamed Pakistan for the attack. Islamabad denies responsibility and is calling for a neutral probe.</p>
<p>The US State Department has said it was in touch with the nuclear-armed neighbours at multiple levels and Secretary of State Marco Rubio held calls on Wednesday with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis government is in constant communication,‚Äù State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters at her daily news briefing</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are asking for a responsible resolution from both parties.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs the President articulated to Prime Minister Modi last week, the US stands strong with India against terrorism, and Prime Minister Modi has our full support,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>Bruce said Secretary Rubio encouraged both countries to work toward a responsible solution that maintains long-term peace and regional stability in South Asia.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe continue to be in touch with the governments of both countries, as I mentioned, at multiple levels.‚Äù</p>
<p>Hindu nationalist Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1907470">vowed</a> to punish those responsible and Jaishankar has told Rubio that the perpetrators should be brought to justice. Pakistan says military action by India was imminent.</p>
<p>After the attack, India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274">suspended</a> the Indus Water Treaty, and both countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907663#:~:text=PAF%E2%80%99s%20prompt%20response.-,Airspace%20concerns,-With%20tensions%20running">closed airspace</a> to each other‚Äôs airlines.

<p>Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations, Asim Iftikhar Ahmad met UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday and discussed the latest developments in the region.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe discussion focused on the evolving security situation in South Asia as well as the imperative of de-escalation and the efforts being made to that effect,‚Äù a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PakistanUN_NY/status/1918037479095189670" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> issued by the Pakistan Mission to the UN said.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric was asked at a UN briefing whether Guterres planned on travelling to India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Dujarric replied that the UN chief had offered his good offices during his phone calls to PM Shehbaz and Jaishankar in the wake of the attack.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo I don‚Äôt think there would be any travel until there‚Äôs a clear message that, as in any instance where we have high tensions between two countries, that they‚Äôve both accepted his good offices,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday held a telephonic conversation with the Foreign Minister of Panama, Javier Eduardo Martinze-Acha Vasquez, the foreign ministry said in a post on X.</p>
<p>‚Äú[Dar] briefed him on the current regional situation, including India‚Äôs inflammatory propaganda, its illegal unilateral actions against Pakistan, including holding in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty ‚Äî a clear violation of international law.</p>
<p>‚Äú[Vasquez] emphasized both sides to exercise restraint,‚Äù the foreign ministry said. ‚ÄúBeing non-permanent members of UNSC, the two sides reaffirmed their commitment for international peace and security.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>Shares at PSX soar as investor confidence returns</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) bounced back on Friday after a steep <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907713/stock-market-takes-3545-point-dip-after-minister-claims-indian-attack-imminent">plunge</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index increased by 3,150 points, or 2.83 per cent, to stand at 114,476.98 from the last close of 113,954.55 at 12pm.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the market had plunged by more than 3,500 points.</p>
<p>Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, noted, ‚ÄúThe market is tracking India-Pakistan tensions, and some news flow has indicated de-escalation, prompting a rebound today.‚Äù</p>
<p>He continued that investors are now awaiting inflation data due later today and the monetary policy announcement on Monday, with expectations of a rate cut ranging from 50 to 100 basis points.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAdditionally, Pakistan‚Äôs IMF [International Monetary Fund] <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907317">board approval</a> is scheduled for the 9th. As a result, market participants are primarily focused on developments regarding regional tensions, interest rates, and the upcoming IMF decision.‚Äù</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, also attributed the increase to the lack of any military action from India.</p>
<p>‚Äú[This] has boosted investor confidence, prompting them to take positions in stocks that align well with Pakistan‚Äôs improving economic conditions.‚Äù</p>
<p>In recent days, Washington <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907094/us-in-touch-with-india-and-pakistan-urges-work-toward-responsible-solution">urged</a> India and Pakistan to work with each other to de-escalate tensions and arrive at a ‚Äúresponsible solution.‚Äù</p>
