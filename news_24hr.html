            <p><p>The Lahore Anti-Terrrorism Court (ATC) on Tuesday acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi while sentencing Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry and others to 10 years in prison over a May 9 riots case related to violence on Sherpao Bridge, Lahore.</p>
<p>Following the arrest of ex-premier Imran Khan on May 9, 2023, from the Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) premises, riots erupted across the country and went on for at least 24 hours. Protesters vandalised and torched government buildings and military installations, while also breaking into the residence of the Lahore corps commander. The state subsequently launched a crackdown against him and his party, filing several other cases against Imran and party leaders since the events of May 9.</p>
<p>Advocate Burhan Moazzam Malik, the lead defence counsel, confirmed today’s sentencing to <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>He said Rashid, former provincial minister Mian Mehmoodur Rashid, Senator Chaudhry and former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema were among those sentenced to 10 years in prison. The others were Khalid Qayyum, Riyaz Hussain, Ali Hassan and Afzal Azeem Pahat.</p>
<p>PTI leaders confirmed the development in a press conference soon after the court’s order came to light.</p>
<p>The ATC had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925804/atc-hears-final-arguments-in-sherpao-bridge-violence-case">heard the concluding arguments</a> of the prosecution and defence in the jail trial proceedings of the case a day ago.</p>
<p>Deputy Prosecutor General Abdul Jabbar Dogar had presented final arguments, saying the “May 9 conspiracy” was hatched on May 7 at Zaman Park. He said it had already been decided what actions were to be taken in case of the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan.</p>
<p>He alleged that on May 9, according to the plan, party leaders incited the workers. He said the witnesses to the conspiracy had recorded their statements before the court. He said these witnesses were present during the meeting of the PTI leaders held at Zaman Park, the residence of the former prime minister.</p>
<p>The prosecutor stated that 61 witnesses of the attacks and vandalism incidents had testified in the trial. Therefore, he said, in the light of the documents, evidence and the witness statements, the accused persons should be convicted.</p>
<p>The main accused in the case include PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Punjab President Dr Yasmin Rashid, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema and former provincial minister Mian Mehmoodur Rashid.</p>

            <p><p>The United Nations Security Council on Tuesday unanimously adopted a Pakistan-sponsored resolution that called for the peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar opened the UNSC session as he was presiding over the UNSC Open Debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes”.</p>
<p>This is the first of the two signature events of Pakistan in its capacity as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921308">president</a> of the UNSC for July.</p>
<p>The UNSC unanimously adopted the Pakistan-sponsored resolution urging all nations to utilise effectively mechanisms for peaceful settlement of disputes, such as negotiation, mediation, arbitration, judicial settlement or other peaceful means.</p>

<p>The Foreign Office (FO) said the adoption of the resolution on “Strengthening Mechanisms for Peaceful Settlement of Disputes” was a noteworthy development since it was an “important contribution to the promotion of international peace and security through the use of preventive diplomacy, conflict prevention measures and dispute resolution by peaceful means”.</p>
<p>It added that the resolution sought to strengthen mechanisms for peaceful settlement of disputes, as envisaged in Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter and urged member states to utilise peaceful means for settling disputes.</p>
<p>“The resolution called upon the member states to take necessary measures for the effective implementation of Security Council resolutions for peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>
<p>“Member states and the United Nations have been encouraged to explore ways and means to prevent disputes from escalating, including but not limited to timely diplomatic efforts, mediation, confidence-building and facilitation of dialogue at the international, regional and subregional levels. The resolution calls for enhancing efforts by all regional and subregional organisations for peaceful settlement of disputes and to strengthen cooperation between these organisations and the United Nations.”</p>
<p>The FO said that as an active UNSC member, Pakistan sought to contribute to the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security, including through peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>
<p>“The adoption of Pakistan-sponsored resolution would serve as an important instrument to achieve these goals for peace and security at the regional and global level.”</p>

<p>Earlier, the FO said the signature event reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering belief in multilateralism and the UN Charter principle of peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>
<p>It said FM Dar would also hold bilateral meetings with the Saudi minister of economy and planning, UK minister for Africa, the United Nations, Commonwealth and Multilateral, as well as Thailand’s foreign minister on the sidelines.</p>
<p>He would also give an interview to a foreign media outlet and attend a reception hosted by Pakistan Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad for selected UN ambassadors and senior UN officials.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#fm-dar-un-chief-call-attention-towards-gaza" id="fm-dar-un-chief-call-attention-towards-gaza" title="Permalink"></a>FM Dar, UN chief call attention towards Gaza</h2>
<p>Speaking at the UNSC session, FM Dar said, “We call for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.”</p>
<p>He added that Israel’s latest onslaught in Gaza had killed over 58,000 Palestinians — mostly women and children. “The humanitarian situation is dire, with civilians bearing the brunt of the violence and deprivation,” Dar said.</p>
<p>“Today’s debate is both timely and urgent. Multilateralism is not merely a diplomatic convenience; it is the need of the hour. Peaceful settlement of disputes is not just a principle; it is the lifeline of global stability,” Dar continued.</p>

</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>On the issue of Kashmir, Dar said that the final disposition of the dispute has to be made in line with the relevant UNSC resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>“No cosmetic measures can serve as a substitute for the fundamental and inalienable right to self-determination of the Kashmiris as guaranteed by the relevant UNSC resolutions,” Dar said.</p>
<p>Dar also spoke about India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, saying, “It is most unfortunate and regrettable that India has chosen to illegally and unilaterally hold this treaty in abeyance on baseless grounds, with the intention of withholding the flow of water to 240 million people of Pakistan, who rely on it for their livelihood and survival.”</p>
<p>The Deputy PM said, “Let this debate serve as a collective reaffirmation of our faith in multilateralism, a recommitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes, and a solemn promise to those who look to this Council not for words, but for action.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also addressed the council on this occasion, followed by statements of other member states.</p>
<p>Guterres said that the “horror” facing Palestinians in Gaza under Israeli military attack was unprecedented in recent years.</p>
<p>“We need look no further than the horror show in Gaza — with a level of death and destruction without parallel in recent times,” he said in a speech.</p>
<p>Guterres said ramped-up Israeli operations meant “devastation is being layered upon devastation” with the Gaza Strip’s humanitarian system in its “last gasp”.</p>
<p>He commended FM Dar for convening the debate and for utilising the council’s presidency to put forward a resolution urging all members to make full use of the tools in collective pursuit of global peace.</p>
<p>“This is needed now more than ever. The architects of the United Nations Charter recognised that the peaceful resolution of disputes is the lifeline when geopolitical tensions escalate, when unresolved disputes fuel the flames of conflict and when states lose trust in each other,” the UN chief said.</p>
<p>“Around the world, we see an utter disregard for, if not outright violations of, international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law, international humanitarian law, and the UN Charter itself, without any accountability.</p>
<p>“These failures to uphold international obligations are coming at a time of widening geopolitical divides and conflicts” with staggering costs measured in human lives, shattered communities, and lost futures, Guterres said.</p>
<p>Diplomacy, he said, may not have always succeeded in preventing conflicts, violence and instability, but it still held the power to stop them.</p>

            <p><p>A man allegedly shot dead his daughter and nephew in Quetta on Tuesday in the name of ‘honour’, just days after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925555">Degari</a> case, in which a couple was gunned down in broad daylight, drawing widespread condemnation, according to the police.</p>
<p>Shalkot Sub-Divisional Police Officer Athar Rashid told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “The daughter and the nephew died in the firing, while the suspect managed to escape after the incident.”</p>
<p>The bodies were taken to the hospital for medicolegal formalities, after which they were handed over to the heirs.</p>
<p>Rashid added that a team from Kechi Baig police station was conducting raids to arrest the suspect.</p>
<p>“The suspect will be arrested soon, while further investigation into the incident is underway,” he said.</p>
<p>The incident comes two days after the police  <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925718">arrested</a> at least 14 suspects for their involvement in the killing of a man and a woman in Quetta’s Degari area, who were shot dead on the orders of a tribal jirga ahead of Eidul Azha for so-called ‘honour’.</p>
<p>The arrests were made after a video of the killing went viral on social media, in which a group of people could be seen shooting the couple.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849480">continued</a> to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.</p>
<p>Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p>
<p>The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#balochistan-assembly-condemns-honour-killings" id="balochistan-assembly-condemns-honour-killings" title="Permalink"></a>Balochistan Assembly condemns ‘honour killings’</h2>
<p>The Balochistan Assembly, during its session today, strongly denounced ‘honour killings’, the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/domestic/balochistan-assembly-condemns-honor-killings-and-offers-prayer-for-shaheed-major-anwar-kakar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>Presided over by Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, the assembly passed a joint resolution denouncing the brutal killing of the man and woman in Degari.</p>
<p>Deputy Speaker Ghazala Gola presented the resolution, describing the act as inhumane, unlawful, and devoid of any cultural, religious, or legal justification. She reaffirmed that justice lies solely with the state, not individuals who take the law into their own hands, <em>APP</em> added.</p>
<p>The resolution urged the provincial government to ensure swift action against the culprits of the Degari incident and deliver appropriate punishment.</p>
<p>MPA Shahida Rauf decried the incident as barbaric and criticised unauthorised “Jirgas” for dispensing unlawful judgments, calling for tougher legislation and accountability.</p>
<p>Chief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti proposed forming a parliamentary committee to monitor the investigation and ensure transparency in the dual murder case.</p>
<p>Education Minister Rahila Hameed Durrani emphasised the psychological impact of the incident across society and noted that while it occurred before Eid, it only recently gained public attention after circulating online.</p>
<p>Advisor Meena Majeed Baloch condemned the deep-rooted customs leading to recurring violence against women. She called for the elimination of parallel laws, underscoring the contrast between women’s global achievements and their oppression at home.</p>
<p>Maulana Hidayat-ur-Rehman Baloch addressed the need for both moral upbringing and systemic reform while acknowledging cultural sensitivities around honour, he strongly opposed vigilante justice.</p>
<p>MPA Farah Azeem Shah argued that the incident reflects a societal regression, urging adherence to the Islamic principles of compassion and justice.</p>
<p>She criticised unequal enforcement of law and challenged patriarchal norms surrounding honour.</p>
<p>Minister Haji Noor Muhammad Dummar called for decisive actions to prevent future tragedies, stating no one has the right to claim lives in the name of tradition.
The resolution was adopted unanimously after a thorough and impassioned debate.</p></p>
