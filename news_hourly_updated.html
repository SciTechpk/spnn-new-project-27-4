                <h2>Netanyahu nominates Trump for Nobel Peace Prize as Gazans await ceasefire</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he has nominated Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, presenting the US president with a letter he sent to the prize committee.</p>
<p>The move comes as Israel continues its onslaught on Gaza, which has so far killed 57,523 Palestinians. Last year, the UN-backed International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1874034">issued</a> arrest warrants for Netanyahu, citing allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court said he, along with ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, ‚Äúintentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival‚Äù, including food, water, medicine, fuel, and electricity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs forging peace as we speak, in one country, in one region after the other,‚Äù Netanyahu said at a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922520">dinner</a> with Trump at the White House.</p>

<p>Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514">nominations</a> from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years and has made no secret of his irritation at missing out on the prestigious award.</p>
<p>The Republican has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514#:~:text=Trump%20complains%20about%20not%20getting%20Nobel%20prize%20for%20%E2%80%98stopping%E2%80%99%20multiple%20wars">complained</a> that he had been overlooked by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">mediating role</a> in conflicts between India and Pakistan, as well as Serbia and Kosovo.</p>
<p>In 2024, he <a class="link--external" href="https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/trump-grumbles-about-obama-s-nobel-peace-prize-and-claims-he-deserved-it-more/ar-AA1sVZiM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">insisted</a> that he was more deserving of a Nobel than ex-president Barack Obama, and complained how it was unfair that ‚Äúanybody else‚Äù but him would have been honoured with one.</p>
<p>In June, Pakistan had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514/govt-to-recommend-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize-for-decisive-diplomatic-intervention-in-india-pakistan-crisis">decided</a> to formally recommend Trump for the coveted prize, given his role in de-escalating the India-Pakistan conflict when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">US mediation</a>.</p>
<p>However, as the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">joined</a> Israel‚Äôs war with Iran and launched attacks on three Iranian nuclear facilities, Pakistani lawmakers, activists, authors and ex-diplomats <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919128/fazl-others-urge-govt-to-review-decision-to-nominate-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize">criticised the move</a>. A resolution was also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919467#:~:text=In%20the%20resolution,in%20the%20region.%E2%80%9D">submitted</a> in the Senate by the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl to rescind the decision but led to no tangible outcome as Pakistan had not officially submitted the nomination.</p>

<p>Trump has also demanded credit for ‚Äúkeeping peace‚Äù between Egypt and Ethiopia and brokering the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements aiming to normalise relations between Israel and several Arab nations.</p>
<p>He campaigned for office as a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20what%20I%20want%20to%20be%3A%20a%20peacemaker%20and%20unifier.">peacemaker</a>‚Äù who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging more than five months into his presidency.</p></p>

                <h2>4 dead, two injured in Peshawar house fire: rescue officials</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Four people were killed and two others were injured after a fire broke out in a house located in Peshawar‚Äôs Kochi Bazar on Tuesday morning, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>Spokesperson for Rescue 1122 Bilal Ahmed Faizi said in a statement, ‚ÄúSix people were rescued from the fire in critical condition and taken to the hospital.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, four of them succumbed to their injuries. They have been identified as Rafiq, Shehnaz, Riaz and his wife.‚Äù</p>
<p>Faizi added that the firefighters and ambulances reached the site of the incident soon after receiving information and started rescue operations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe firefighters initially rescued three people trapped in a house adjacent to a market and transported them to the hospital for medical assistance,‚Äù Faizi detailed in the statement.</p>
<p>During the rescue efforts, two firefighters fainted due to the blazing flames. They were taken to the Lady Reading Hospital for treatment, where their condition became stable, he said.</p>
<p>Six fire vehicles and 40 personnel participated in the firefighting efforts, the rescue official continued.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFirefighters faced extreme difficulty as the house was located in a congested area with narrow alleyways. After hectic efforts, the rescue official confirmed that the flames had been brought under control and the cooling process was underway.‚Äù</p>
<p>Fire incidents usually occur due to a combination of human negligence, faulty infrastructure, poor safety standards, and environmental factors. Peshawar has faced frequent residential and commercial fires and periodic industrial infernos.</p>
<p>In October 2024, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867860">fire</a> at a tissue paper factory in the Hayatabad area was doused after more than 26 hours in an operation involving 130 fighters and 31 fire tenders.</p>
<p>The rescue team said the fire erupted as a huge quantity of polythene was stashed inside the factory, which melted due to the fire, and the blaze was difficult to douse.</p>
<p>In June 2024, a fire broke out]<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1842781">2</a> in the Nauthia Phattak area of Peshawar, destroying at least 80 shops mostly selling used goods and injuring three people.</p>
<p>The officials said the fire erupted at one of the makeshift structures before engulfing the adjacent shops, which mostly dealt in secondhand clothes, shoes and curtains, and a power transformer.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 workers and firefighters from Peshawar, Nowshera, Khyber and Charsadda districts controlled the fire in six hours with around 80,000 litres of water and foam.</p>
<p>Around 110 personnel took part in the operation. Rescue officials said the wooden cabins caught fire due to strong winds and fire engulfed three markets before being brought under control.</p></p>
