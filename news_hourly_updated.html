                <h2>PM tasks Bilawal with presenting Pakistan‚Äôs case ‚Äòfor peace‚Äô on global arena</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday tasked PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to present Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúcase for peace‚Äù on the global arena in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as tensions over last month‚Äôs Pahalgam attack continued to build up. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting drones</a> sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, for both sides to finally drop their guns as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> was reached. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911473/islamabad-delhi-gained-nothing-but-miseries-from-wars-pm-shehbaz">offered talks</a>.</p>

<p>The military flare-up saw China expressing solid diplomatic support to Pakistan, but there wasn‚Äôt a country other than Israel to stand with India without hyphenating it with Pakistan. Reports said a day ago that finding itself friendless in the conflict, India has started taking revenge on countries who helped Islamabad in the recent military flare-up.</p>
<p>Amid the current situation, Bilawal posted on X that he was contacted earlier today by the prime minister who requested that the former top diplomat ‚Äúlead a delegation to present Pakistan‚Äôs case for peace on the international stage‚Äù.</p>
<p>Bilawal said he was honoured to accept the responsibility and remained committed to serving the country in ‚Äúthese challenging times‚Äù.</p>

<p>The government has yet to share more details on who else would be included in the delegation and which specific countries would be engaged.</p>
<p>In a similar development, the Indian government announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, later this month to present the country‚Äôs stance on terrorism and ‚Äúproject India‚Äôs national consensus‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMembers of parliament from different parties, prominent political personalities and distinguished diplomats will be part of each delegation,‚Äù said a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2129254" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> from India‚Äôs Press Information Bureau.</p>
<p>It said the following Indian lawmakers would lead the seven delegations: Indian National Congress‚Äô Shashi Tharoor; Bharatiya Janata Party‚Äôs Shankar Prasad and Baijayant Panda; Dravid Munnetra Kazhagam‚Äôs Kanimozhi Karunanidhi; Janata Dal-United‚Äôs Sanjay Kumar Jha; Nationalist Congress Party‚Äôs Supriya Sule and Shiv Sena‚Äôs Shrikant Eknath Shinde.</p>
<p>Pakistan has said Britain and other countries, in addition to the United States, played a major role in de-escalating the fighting. Diplomats and analysts say the ceasefire <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911472">remains fragile</a>.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump said after the ceasefire was struck that talks should take place in a third-country venue but no dates or location for the talks have been announced.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#pm-shehbazs-peace-offer" id="pm-shehbazs-peace-offer" title="Permalink"></a>PM Shehbaz‚Äôs peace offer</h2>
<p>A day ago, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered India to sit for a comprehensive dialogue to settle contentious issues, including Kashmir and joi¬≠ntly fight terrorism, remi¬≠nding New Delhi that the neighbouring countries fought three wars in the past and gained nothing but miseries of the people.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter settling disputes like Kashmir and water distribution, we can talk on trade and counter-terrorism as Pakistan is the worst affected country by terrorism which lost 90,000 lives and over $150 billion economic losses,‚Äù PM Shehbaz said while addressing a ceremony marking Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanks¬≠giving Day) at Pakistan Monument.</p>
<p>Addressing the ceremony, PM Shehbaz had said, ‚ÄúWe have won the war but we want peace. We have taught our enemy a lesson but we condemn aggression. We want this part of the world to be as prosperous and progressive as others through hard work, undying efforts and living like peaceful neighbours.‚Äù</p>

<p>Just two days after India, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">without</a> any evidence, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack">blamed</a> Pakistan over last month‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam, Iran had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">offered to mediate</a> between the two as tensions escalated.</p>
