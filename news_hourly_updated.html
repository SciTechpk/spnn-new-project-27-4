                <h2>PTI shows willingness to talk but demands ‚Äòaccountability‚Äô from institutions</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Saturday called on state institutions to engage in dialogue with the PTI, but demanded that they hold themselves accountable.</p>
<p>Gandapur and the PTI‚Äôs top leadership are on a visit to Lahore to formally launch a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923856/pti-brass-gathers-in-lahore-to-kick-start-aug-5-movement">movement</a> to seek the release of party founder Imran Khan and devise a strategy for its nationwide protest, which will reach its crescendo on August 5 ‚Äî marking two years since the ex-premier was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a>.</p>
<p>Since Imran‚Äôs incarceration in several cases, which he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1890696#:~:text=He%20claimed%20that%20four%20convictions%20against%20him%20were%20politically%20motivated">claims</a> are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1843176">politically motivated</a>, his party‚Äôs relationship with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880551">government</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832432">establishment</a> has turned exceedingly sour. The PTI has held several protests over the last year, most of which escalated into <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1857709">violence</a> after facing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875003/day-of-clashes-in-islamabad-ends-in-pti-protesters-retreat">state repression</a>.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference flanked by PTI‚Äôs Punjab leadership, CM Gandapur said: ‚ÄúWe have to correct our institutions ourselves. Come, sit together, own your mistakes and move forward.‚Äù</p>
<p>He recalled that Imran, despite his wife also being imprisoned in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831">graft case</a>, had repeatedly said he was ready to talk for the sake of the country.</p>

<p>Imran was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">jailed</a> on Aug 5, 2023 in a case related to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878307/imran-khan-bushra-bibi-indicted-in-new-toshakhana-case">state gifts</a>, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831">¬£190 million graft case</a> and faces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845818">pending trials</a> related to the May 9, 2023 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">riots</a>.</p>
<p>In the wake of the nationwide May 9 protests, which saw important <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">military installations</a> come under attack, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753589">thousands</a> of PTI workers and almost the entire <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1774736">top-tier leadership</a> were rounded up, with many still facing court proceedings under serious <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891122/five-pti-leaders-16-activists-indicted-in-another-may-9-case">charges</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCome and talk, acknowledge and correct your mistakes,‚Äù Gandapur reiterated today, noting that it was everyone‚Äôs collective responsibility to think about Pakistan‚Äôs future.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe state institutions have ignored their duties which are stated in the Constitution and are instead doing other work, due to which terrorism has [risen] in the country,‚Äù he said, adding that the security situation in KP and Balochistan had worsened because ‚Äúthose responsible for guarding the borders were chasing the PTI instead‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe state institutions, whose duty is not to engage in politics, are playing every role in forming, running and overthrowing governments,‚Äù the PTI leader alleged. ‚ÄúAnd when you ask, they reply with delight that ‚Äòwe are non-political‚Äô.‚Äù</p>
<p>Gandapur, stressing that he was a soldier‚Äôs son and brother, said: ‚ÄúMy military is being defamed due to a few wrong people and their decisions.‚Äù</p>
<p>The KP CM quipped: ‚ÄúWhere are those who imposed martial laws? They are not in Pakistan today. Who is suffering? My Pakistanis.‚Äù</p>
<p>The chief minister called for a dialogue ‚Äúbased on reasons‚Äù, saying he was ready to be punished severely if it was proven that he ‚Äúconspired‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhoever‚Äôs mistake there is, they will admit it [‚Ä¶] we are ready if they punish us, but if the matter comes to punishment, then every person [responsible] will be punished.‚Äù</p>
<p>The PTI leader urged ‚Äúthose who are the beneficiaries of this system and those who have hijacked it‚Äù to hold talks, stressing that they are ‚Äúanswerable‚Äù and ‚Äúmust bear the burden‚Äù for the country‚Äôs economic situation and heightened terrorism.</p>
<p>Gandapur also assailed the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866652/president-zardari-gives-assent-to-26th-constitutional-amendment">26th Amendment</a> passed in October last year, saying the judiciary had been ‚Äúhandcuffed‚Äù through it.</p>
<p>Gandapur called on the political parties in the ruling coalition to go into the public, which he said had ‚Äúrejected‚Äù them. He cautioned that those parties will then face the consequences later on of the ‚Äúculture‚Äù they had developed. Addressing their supporters, he said, ‚ÄúThey (leaders of other political parties) will flee abroad. You have to stay here.‚Äù</p>
<p>He asked if it was ‚Äúright as a human and a Muslim‚Äù if a PTI leader‚Äôs home was raided and their privacy was violated. ‚ÄúIf you are silent on this, then if this happens with you tomorrow, then no one will raise a voice for you either.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thanking PTI workers, leaders, its lawmakers and overseas supporters, Gandapur vowed to organise a grassroots movement upwards from the streets, towns, and cities.</p>
<p>A caravan of KP lawmakers led by CM Gandapur, as well as Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923856/pti-brass-gathers-in-lahore-to-kick-start-aug-5-movement">reached Lahore</a> via G.T. Road yesterday evening. During a layover in Jhelum, the KP CM said that the protest had been launched, and the parliamentary meeting in Lahore would mull the final protest strategy to step up the campaign seeking Imran‚Äôs release.</p>

                <h2>People downstream Tarbela Dam warned of water release as spillways to be opened</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Provincial Disaster Management Authority ((PDMA) on Sunday issued a warning for people downstream to stay away from the banks of the Indus River ahead of the Tarbela Dam‚Äôs spillways being opened.</p>
<p>A PDMA alert issued today said the spillways would be opened at 2:30pm on Sunday, with the water level likely to reach 160,000 to 260,000 cusecs due to the release of water from the dam.</p>
<p>It cautioned that flooding is likely in the Indus River and its tributaries and canals.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe PDMA directs the district administration to keep the local population alert,‚Äù the notification said, urging the public to avoid going near rivers and canals.</p>
<p>It also cautioned parents that children should not go near canals.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFishermen and livestock keepers should move to safer places,‚Äù the advisory said. Tourists and locals were urged to heed the advisory.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúIn case of any untoward situation, the public should call 1700,‚Äù the PDMA said.</p>
<p>A similar warning was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921686/people-downstream-tarbela-dam-warned-of-water-release">issued</a> earlier this month, with sources telling Dawn that the spillways of the Tarbela Dam were likely to be put into operation for the first time in the flood season 2025.</p>
<p>On Friday, the National Emer¬≠gencies Operation Centre (NEOC) of the National Disa¬≠ster Management Authority (NDMA) issued a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923519">weather alert</a> warning that moderate to heavy monsoon rains are expected to affect multiple regions of the country for a three-day period commencing from July 13 (Sunday).</p>
<p>The forecast indicates moderate to heavy monsoon rainfall across various regions of Pakistan, as a result of which substantial rises in river flows were expected ‚Äî most notably in the Indus, Kabul, Jhelum (upstream of Mangla), and Chenab rivers.</p>
<p>The advisory stated that Tarbela, Taunsa, and Guddu barrages were currently at low flood levels, while Kalabagh and Chashma were at medium flood levels.</p></p>
