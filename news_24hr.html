            <p><p>Shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) climbed by 1,300 points on Wednesday ahead of the budget announcement on June 10.</p>
<p>The KSE-100 index climbed 923.71, or 0.77 per cent, to stand at 121,374.58 from the last close of 120,450.87 at 1:31pm. The index closed at 121,798.86, with a gain of 1347.99 points or 1.12pc.</p>
<p>Sana Tawfik, head of research at Arif Habib Limited, attributed the bullish momentum to the news of the approval of a new financial package between Pakistan and Asian Development Bank (ADB).</p>
<p>The ADB <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915179/adb-approves-800m-to-boost-pakistans-public-finance">approved</a> an $800 million programme to strengthen fiscal sustainability and improve public financial management in Pakistan, according to a statement issued by the Philippines-based lender.</p>
<p>The statement read that subprogramme 2 of the “Improved Resource Mobilisation and Utilisation Reform Programme” includes a policy-based loan of $300m, and ADB’s “first ever policy-based guarantee” of up to $500m, which is expected to mobilise financing of up to $1 billion from commercial banks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Tawfik noted that stock valuations were trading at an “attractive level” due to the correction phase witnessed at the stock market earlier this week.</p>
<p>“Lastly, there is also some institutional buying which has increased liquidity,” she added.</p>
<p>Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, said, “The market has hit an all-time high as participants brush off any negative budget-related news flow.”</p>
<p>He explained that expectations were building that economic stability would persist and interest rates will gradually trend downward, allowing stock market price-to-earning (PE)  ratios to rerate upwards.</p>
<p>“We believe the market is gradually entering the second phase of the bull run — transitioning from the accumulation phase to the public participation or momentum phase — marked by increasing public involvement, rising stock market volumes, gradual PE multiple expansion, and clearer signs of economic recovery,” he stated, adding that investor confidence, media attention, and new IPO activity were expected to grow.</p>
<p>“Measures such as reduced taxation that boost corporate earnings, along with adherence to IMF guidelines, will further reinforce confidence,” Farooq highlighted, noting that steps towards mass digitisation would also propel stock market sentiment.</p></p>

            <p><p>The high-powered delegation, led by former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, has reached Washington after concluding its two-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow">visit</a> to the United Nations Headquarters in New York on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pakis­tan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">launched</a> a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence here.</p>
<p>The delegation comprises Senator Rehman, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt and Jalil Abbas Jilani.</p>
<p>In New York, the delegation “drew attention to India’s illegal use of force and violations of international law, including the UN Charter and International Humanitarian Law, particularly targeting of civilian areas and killing of innocent civilians, including women and children”, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Office.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>It added that the delegation rejected India’s allegations regarding the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909746">attack</a> in India-occupied Kashmir “without a shred of evidence, and warned against India’s weaponisation of water through its unilateral hold on the IWT [Indus Waters Treaty] in violation of international law and treaty obligations”.</p>
<p>According to the statement, the delegation met with the UN secretary-general, the president of the General Assembly, the president of the Security Council, the representatives of the Security Council’s permanent and non-permanent members, ambassadors of the OIC Group, representatives of the media, civil society, and think tanks, and the Pakistani community.</p>

</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Furthermore, the delegation highlighted the country’s role and commitment to combating terrorism in all forms, while also “drawing attention of the international community towards Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan, and its transnational assassination campaign”.</p>
<p>“Cooperation, not politicisation, was required to effectively combat the menace of terrorism, it was underlined,” the statement said.</p>
<p>The delegation also emphasised the country’s responsible and lawful response to Indian aggression and provocations, adding that Pakistan “seeks peace but will always defend its sovereignty with resolve”.</p>
<p>It warned that Indian attempts to create a “new normal” that implied arbitrary and unilateral strikes could lead to disastrous consequences in South Asia’s nuclear environment, reiterating that peace in the region hinged on a just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in line with the UN Security Council resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>“The international community was urged to uphold international law and the sanctity of treaties, push for the revival and normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty, and support the initiation of a comprehensive dialogue to resolve all outstanding issues between India and Pakistan, including the core dispute of Jammu and Kashmir,” the statement read.</p>
<p>Speaking at a press conference at UN Headquarters, Bilawal said coope­ration between Pakistan and India’s intelligence agencies could significantly reduce terrorism in South Asia.</p>
<p>“I am completely confident that if ISI and RAW were ready to sit down and work together to fight these forces, we would see a significant decrease in terrorism in both India and Pakistan,” he added.</p>
<p>He also urged the global community to remain engaged in South Asia, warning that the risk of conflict between nuclear-armed neighbours had grown, not diminished, after the recent ceasefire.</p>
<p>“With the intervention of the international community — and I would like to mention particularly the role played by the US President Donald Trump and his team led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio — we did manage to achieve a ceasefire between India and Pakistan,” said Bilawal. “This is a welcome first step, but it’s only a first step.”</p>

<p>Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, detailing PM Shehbaz’s recent multi-state <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow">visit</a>, said the international community was lauding Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts.</p>
<p>“We are being praised for our kinetic actions”, he said, adding that Pakistan’s narrative was clear to the international community from the beginning and remained so until the resolution of the conflict.</p>
<p>While addressing a press conference, FM Dar said the delegation led by PM Shehbaz expressed gratitude for the support of countries to Pakistan throughout the period of tension, particularly Turkiye and Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>“People in Turkiye and Azerbaijan took to the streets to celebrate the resolution,” he said, noting that Pakistan’s victory was a victory for the entire Muslim community.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Appreciating Turkiye’s role in de-escalation efforts, he recalled that on the night of May 6, when India attacked, his Turkish counterpart was “the first one to call and ask if there is anything they can do for Pakistan”.</p>
<p>He further said that in the wake of the recent events, India’s “hegemony has been destroyed” and its supremacy “blown in the air”, adding that Indians were now blaming each other while Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts were being globally acknowledged.</p></p>

            <p><p>Tump Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Hanif Noorzai was abducted from Balochistan’s Kech district on Wednesday, an official told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>According to Kech Deputy Commissioner Bashir Ahmed Barich, unidentified militants kidnapped the AC, who was posted at Tump, near the Iranian border.</p>
<p>He said Noorzai was on his way from Quetta to Tump on Wednesday morning, but did not provide further details.</p>
<p>Noorzai is from Quetta and has previously served as AC in different areas of the province.</p>
<p>In September 2016, Asad Khan Tareen, son of then-Balochistan’s Minister for Local Government Sardar Mustafa Tareen — who had been kidnapped in May that year — was recovered from an area of Qila Abdulla district close to the Pak-Afghan border.</p>
<p>Armed men kidnapped Asad Tareen in Pishin town on May 21 when he was returning from Cadet College Pishin, where he worked as a warden. He was reportedly taken across the border in Afghanistan.</p>
