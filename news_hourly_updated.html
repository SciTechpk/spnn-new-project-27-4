                <h2>Pakistan-India ceasefire extended until May 18, says FM Dar</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday said that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910113/world-community-hails-ceasefire-decision-between-pakistan-and-india">ceasefire</a> between India and Pakistan was extended until May 18, adding that the matter will ‚Äúultimately go to dialogue‚Äù between the civilian leadership of the two nations.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">American intervention</a> for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>On Monday, the director general of military operations for both sides <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910567">held</a> the first round of talks via hotline after the ceasefire.</p>
<p>Speaking in the Senate today, FM Dar said that a military-to-military conversation took place between the two countries today, where they decided to extend the ceasefire until May 18.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUltimately, the matter will go to dialogue between the civilian leadership of the countries,‚Äù FM Dar said. ‚ÄúRight now, these are military-to-military communications.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that a political dialogue would take place between the two countries and that a ‚Äúresolution for all the problems will be discussed‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have told the world that we will carry out a composite dialogue,‚Äù Dar said.</p>
<p>A day prior, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911132">invited</a> India to a comprehensive dialogue to address all contentious issues, including the Kashmir dispute and the water distribution, between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)</em>, Dar said that Pakistan did not request a ceasefire during the recent escalation with India.</p>
<p>Instead, it [ceasefire] was initiated following a call from the US Secretary of State, who conveyed that India was willing to halt hostilities, Dar said.</p>
<p>Dar emphasised that Pakistan had exercised restraint and communicated this to all friendly nations even before the outbreak of hostilities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe told our friends we would not initiate an attack, but we would certainly respond if provoked,‚Äù he said, adding that Pakistan‚Äôs response was measured, decisive, and in line with international norms.</p>

<p>Paying tribute to the bravery and proficiency of Pakistan Air Force (PAF) falcons for inflicting a crushing defeat on the enemy during the operation, the premier said the success has also strengthened the belief of our friends and supporters in us.</p>
<p>Addressing the PAF falcons during his visit to Kamra Airbase today, PM Shehbaz said the PAF falcons ‚Äúblew away the enemy‚Äôs pride into dust in a matter of just a few hours‚Äù.</p>
<p>He said, ‚ÄúOur daring eagles have taught a lesson to the enemy that if it ever tries to engage in any misadventure again, it will be served a destructive blow.‚Äù</p>
<p>The prime minister vowed that the nation will never forget the sacrifices of those martyred during this unprovoked aggression of the enemy.</p>
<p>He said we will uphold the dignity of our martyrs‚Äô sacrifices and will build a prosperous and great country.</p>
<p>Directing his address to India, the premier said while India‚Äôs war-fever is over, we are ready to talk with it for peace.</p>
<p>He said let us remind India of the conditions for peace foremost among which is ensuring the right to self-determination for Kashmiri people under UNSC resolutions.</p>
<p>The prime minister said India mocked itself globally by unjustifiably blaming Pakistan for the Pahalgam incident, while there are irrefutable pieces of evidence of India‚Äôs involvement in terrorist activities inside Pakistan.</p>

<p>Separately, the Senate passed a resolution paying tribute to the armed forces for demonstrating ‚Äúunwavering resolve, unparalleled Professionalism, and steadfast dedication in the successful execution of Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos.‚Äù</p>
<p>The resolution, presented by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, said the operation was carried out with exceptional restraint and maturity, reflecting the conduct of a responsible nuclear state.</p>
<p>It congratulated the people of Pakistan for rising above all political, ethnic, and ideological divides and differences, demonstrating unity in support of national leadership across the political spectrum and speaking with one voice and one purpose to defend the people, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and dignity of the country.</p>
<p>It honoured the sacrifices of the valiant martyrs who laid down their lives in the defence of the sovereignty and national honour of the country.</p>
<p>It condemned ‚Äúthe brutal and unprovoked Indian attacks on innocent civilians, including women, children and mosques‚Äù.</p>
<p>It urged the government to proactively engage the international community for a peaceful, just and lasting resolution of the Indian-held Kashmir, stressing the critical importance of strict adherence to the Indus water treaty.</p></p>

                <h2>DG ISPR warns of ‚Äòswift and assured response‚Äô in case India breaks ceasefire</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Thursday warned in an interview with British broadcaster <em><a class="link--external" href="https://news.sky.com/story/pakistan-vows-swift-response-if-india-violates-ceasefire-13368060" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sky News</a></em> that any Indian ceasefire violation would be met with a ‚Äúswift and assured response‚Äù by Pakistan, cautioning that serious escalation could result in mutual destruction.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties.

It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>On May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">announced</a> that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan. According to the government, forty civilians ‚Äî including seven women and 15 children ‚Äî <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910733">lost</a> their lives in the Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Sky News</em>, DG ISPR warned that by rooting for war, India was carving out a ‚Äúrecipe for mutual destruction,‚Äù adding that the world now recognised the extent of the nuclear threat.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAny sane player like the USA understands this absurdity and what the Indians are trying to do here,‚Äù Lt Gen Chaudhry told the publications.</p>

<p>Talking about India‚Äôs actions in Kashmir, he accused the country of trying to ‚Äúinternalise the issue and harassing‚Äù Kashmiri people with a heavy troop presence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is a problem that has to be resolved by the people of Kashmir as per the United Nations Security Council resolution,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He continued: ‚ÄúAnyone who tries to violate our territory and integrity and sovereignty, our response will be brutal.‚Äù</p>
<p>DG ISPR warned that a ‚Äúserious escalation between India and Pakistan would destroy both sides‚Äù under the concept of mutually assured destruction ‚Äî a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy which posits that a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by an attacker on a nuclear-armed defender with second-strike capabilities would result in the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender.</p>
<p>In a press conference <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910381">held</a> last week after the ceasefire was brokered, DG ISPR had cautioned that a conflict between Islamabad and New Delhi ‚Äúcan lead to peril of more than 1.6 billion people.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn reality, there is no space for war between India and Pakistan,‚Äù he added.</p></p>
