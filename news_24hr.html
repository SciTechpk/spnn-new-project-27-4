            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday reiterated Pakistan’s willingness for a “meaningful dialogue” with India on all outstanding issues, state media <a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/23-07-2025/pakistan-ready-for-meaningful-dialogue-with-india-pm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Radio Pakistan</em></a> reported.</p>

<p>Pakistan previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911132">invited</a> India to a comprehensive dialogue to address all contentious issues, including the Kashmir dispute and the water distribution.</p>
<p>During a meeting with British High Commissioner Jane Marriott today, PM Shehbaz appreciated the UK’s role in de-escalating tensions during the Pakistan-India standoff and reiterated that Pakistan was ready for a meaningful dialogue with India on all outstanding issues.</p>
<p>He welcomed the British government’s decision to resume <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924570/uk-lifts-ban-on-pakistani-airlines-removes-country-from-air-safety-list">PIA flights</a> to the UK. He said, “This [decision] would go a long way in alleviating the hardships faced by the British-Pakistani community as well as enhancing people-to-people exchanges,” while appreciating the role of the high commissioner.</p>
<p>Both sides discussed the “positive trajectory” of bilateral relations. The prime minister said that the recently held <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924280/pakistan-uk-ink-accord-to-boost-economic-cooperation">trade talks</a> between the two countries would lead to mutually beneficial opportunities for both sides. “Pakistan is also cooperating closely with the UK at the UN Security Council, where Pakistan currently holds the monthly Presidency,” he said.</p>
<p>Marriott briefed PM Shehbaz about her recent visit to London, where she had extensive consultations on enhancing bilateral ties.</p>
<p>She lauded the Pakistani government’s recent economic performance which brought about a significant improvement in key macroeconomic indicators. She also discussed the UK’s perspective on regional developments in South Asia and the Middle East.</p>

<p>Last week, UK’s government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924354">launched</a> e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an “enhanced” border and immigration system.</p>
<p>The announcement came just a day after the two countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924280/pakistan-uk-ink-accord-to-boost-economic-cooperation">formally signed</a> the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#un-envoy-hits-back-at-india-for-cross-border-terrorism-claims" id="un-envoy-hits-back-at-india-for-cross-border-terrorism-claims" title="Permalink"></a>UN envoy hits back at India for cross-border terrorism claims</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Pakistan’s envoy to the UNSC, Ambassador Usman Jadoon, rejected Indian allegations of cross-border terrorism and asked India to change its behaviour, instead of resorting to its “tired narrative of victimhood and blame-shifting”, during the UNSC debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes” on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Indian envoy was reacting to Deputy PM Dar’s speech in New York during the reception hosted for Pakistan’s presidency of the UNSC, where the latter underscored the need for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute.</p>
<p>“It is India which actively sponsors, aids and abets terrorism in my country and beyond,” Ambassador Jadoon, deputy permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, told the 15-member body on Tuesday evening, while responding to allegations made by India’s UN Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish.</p>
<p>“Rather than being blinded by hubris and a misplaced sense of impunity, and instead of resorting to its tired narrative of victimhood and blame-shifting, India must introspect seriously, change its behaviour and comply with its international legal obligations on all counts,” he said, in the debate convened by Pakistan to promote pacific settlement of disputes between nations.</p>
<p>Ambassador Jadoon said that it was especially regrettable that the Indian ambassador targeted Pakistan yesterday, when earlier in the day, the council “spoke with a unanimous voice to reaffirm the purposes and principles of the UN charter and the imperative of peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for international law and effective implementation of the resolution of the security council”.</p>
<p>The Pakistani envoy pointed out that firstly, India was in illegal occupation of the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>“While claiming to abide by the UN charter, and purportedly the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes, India has been in violation of security council resolutions on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, and has refused to implement those resolutions, thereby denying the Kashmiri people the exercise of their inalienable right to self-determination,” he said.</p>
<p>“India’s egregious violations of human rights which extend beyond the occupied territory of Jammu and Kashmir and encompass its appalling treatment of minorities has been widely reported by international human rights organisations,” Jadoon added.</p>
<p>He also said that India had “stooped to a new low” of unilaterally and illegally holding in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">abeyance</a> the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, with the stated aim of depriving the people of Pakistan of water from the Indus river system.</p>
<p>“In gross violation of international law, India resorted to blatant aggression against my country between 7-10 May, targeting civilians, including women and children,” the ambassador said.</p>
<p>He highlighted Pakistan’s “befitting but measured response” in accordance with its right to self-defence, aimed exclusively at military targets, that resulted in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">downing</a> of six Indian aircraft that took part in the aggression, among other significant military losses.</p>
<p>“The hostilities came to an end owing to Pakistan’s position of strength and responsible approach, and facilitation of the US, as also highlighted in the statement of the US this morning, “ Jadoon told the delegates.</p>
<p>“It is ironic that India, which itself brought the Jammu and Kashmir dispute to the security council, refuses to implement the resolutions adopted by the council to peacefully resolve this dispute,” he added.</p>

<p>Obviously stung by the success of Pakistan’s signature event at the council, the Indian envoy had claimed that Pakistan was “steeped in fanaticism and terrorism”, and a “serial borrower from the International Monetary Fund”.</p>
<p>The debate will resume on July 24 to listen to the remaining speakers, after listening to scores of high-level representatives.</p></p>

            <p><p>The tribes of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lower Kurram and Sadda regions signed a peace agreement on Wednesday for a year in a jirga held at the Sadda Frontier Corps Fort that was attended by many local notables.</p>
<p>In March, tribal leaders in Kurram district <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901115">came</a> to terms on an eight-month peace agreement ahead of Eidul Fitr. Violence stemming from decades-old land disputes had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878429/officials-hold-out-hope-for-kurram-accord#:~:text=At%20least%20130%20people%20have%20been%20killed">claimed</a> at least 130 lives in the fragile district, with multiple efforts to establish peace between tribes. A ceasefire agreement was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1882460">reached</a> following months of conflict in January.</p>
<p>Kurram Deputy Commissioner (DC) Ashfaq Khan, who chaired the jirga, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that after a long law and order situation in the district, the efforts of the administration, security forces, police and tribal leaders brought positive results and “a peace agreement was signed between the local tribes of Lower Kurram and Sadda for a year.”</p>
<p>The jirga was held at Sadda FC Fort between prominent tribal chiefs of the Ahle Sunnat and Tori Bangash tribes, including the participation of the additional DC, officers of the Security Forces Police and assistant commissioners.</p>
<p>DC Khan said the tribal elders inked the agreement in the light of the Kohat agreement, and all conditions of that agreement were to be considered.</p>
<p>He said the tribal leaders declared the move a “milestone for regional stability” and hoped for progress and long-standing peace. They also applauded the security forces, police and administration’s role and acknowledged their efforts, he added.</p>
<p>The residents of Topki, Sameer, Gosar, Amal Kot, Gharbena, Sangena, Kandezar, Mengak, Tangay, Manda, Marokhel and the suburbs of Lower Kurram and from Sadda, Kochi, Sateen, Shasho, Darani, Per Qayum, Sakhi Ahmad Shah, Mala Kaly, Chakai Kaly, Jan Haji Kaly, Malak Mulajan Kaly, Arawaly, Marokhel, Lower Mandori and adjacent areas signed the agreement unanimously.</p>
<p>On the occasion, DC Khan said the establishment of peace in the Hussain and Jamil valleys of Kurram district was possible only with the cooperation of regional elders, and the immense sacrifices of the security forces for peace in the region were highly commendable. He added that more steps would be taken for peace.</p>
<p>At least 10,000 personnel of the army, police and other agencies <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919962">performed</a> security duty during Muharram in Kohat division, with the restive Kurram district handed over to the army due to a slew of sectarian killings in the past.</p></p>

            <p><p>Incarcerated PTI Founder Imran Khan’s sons met with United States President Donald Trump’s key aide <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881184">Richard Grenell</a> on Tuesday as they kicked off a campaign calling for their father’s release from prison.</p>
<p>Imran’s sons — Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim Khan, 26 — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910789">called attention</a> to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Earlier this month, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922952/imran-shuns-dialogue-plans-nationwide-protest#:~:text=Ms%20Khan%20said%20that%20Imran%E2%80%99s%20sons%2C%20Qasim%20and%20Suleiman%2C%20will%20go%20to%20the%20US">said</a> Sulaiman and Kasim will go to the US before coming to Pakistan as part of a movement calling for the ex-premier’s release.</p>
<p>Imran, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a> since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831">£190 million</a> corruption case and also faces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845818">pending</a> trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.</p>
<p>Grenell, US special presidential envoy for special missions — known for publicly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881124">calling</a> for Imran’s release — posted on X that he had met with Sulaiman and Kasim in California, urging them to “stay strong”.</p>
<p>“There are millions of people around the world who are sick of political prosecutions. You are not alone.”</p>

<p>Imran’s sons also met with Dr Asif Mahmood, a Pakistani American physician who has been playing a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1747390#:~:text=Dr%20Asif%20Mahmood%2C%20a%20Pakistani%20American%20physician%20who%20is%20playing%20a%20key%20role%20in%20the%20campaign%20to%20win%20over%20Americans">key role</a> in the PTI’s campaign to win over Americans.</p>
<p>Dr Mahmood, vice chairman of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), shared a picture showing he also met with Grenell, along with the ex-premier’s sons.</p>
<p>“Immense pride for [Kasim] and Sulaiman Khan for their bravery in fighting for their father, former prime minister Imran Khan’s freedom,” he said.</p>
<p>He also praised Grenell for “standing for justice and principle” and called for unity to free the PTI founder.</p>

<p>In December 2024, after Trump won the presidential elections, Grenell had made a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881124">series of statements</a> and tweets over a few weeks, including a viral “Free Imran Khan!” post on X.</p>
<p>He sharply criticised the policies of ex-president Joe Biden’s administration toward Pakistan, particularly its handling of the country’s missile programme and Imran’s imprisonment. Subsequently, Pakistan’s political and diplomatic machinery in the US had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885206">ramped up</a> efforts to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900569">engage</a> with the new Congress.</p>
<p>“Getting the ear and voice of Richard Grenell, a key Trump insider, was crucial,” Shuja Nawaz, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council, had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885206#:~:text=Shuja%20Nawaz%2C%20a%20distinguished%20fellow%20at%20the%20Atlantic%20Council%2C">said in January</a>.</p>

<p>Last week, during a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924568">congressional hearing</a> on Pakistan, Republican Congressman Christopher H. Smith suggested that the US Congress may soon urge Trump’s administration to consider imposing sanctions on countries that suppress religious freedom and violate human rights.</p>
<p>Speakers at the hearing, also attended by PTI’s Zulfi Bukhari, discussed the rights situation in Pakistan. Democratic Congressman James McGovern stressed the need to engage and talk “about political prisoners, the future of Imran Khan … but also how you do it”.</p>
<p>Notably, there have been increased positive engagements between Washington and Islamabad, with an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093/trump-coas-munir-talk-counterterrorism-and-trade-in-cordial-meeting-ispr">unprecedented meeting</a> between Trump and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir in June and the US hailing the country as a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524">phenomenal partner</a>” in counterterrorism.</p>

<p>Although the government has not officially commented on the matter of Imran’s son, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said today while speaking on <em>Geo News</em> show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ that the meeting would “practically have no result” even though it might net symbolic gains for the party.</p>
<p>He questioned what, if any, role Imran’s sons would be able to play, adding that they were welcome to visit Pakistan and there would be no obstacle for them and visas would be issued “in less than 24 hours”, provided they stayed within the law.</p>
<p>Previously, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan">told</a> <em>Dawn.com</em> that Article 16 of the Constitution, which grants the right to gather, was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Malik also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923089">said</a> that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals, and that if they “violate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled”.</p>
<p>There were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan">conflicting</a> statements from PML-N leaders as well on whether the duo would be allowed entry into Pakistan, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they should be allowed to come and “carry out their activities”, but within the limitations of the law.</p></p>
