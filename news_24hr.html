            <p><p>Israel launched widescale strikes against Iran on Friday, saying it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders and that this was start of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.</p>
<p>Iranian media and witnesses <a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85860885/Israel-strikes-Tehran-and-other-cities" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> explosions including at the country’s main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, while Israel declared a state of emergency in anticipation of retaliatory missile and drone strikes.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Key developments so far:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Iran says top commander, Hossein Salami, killed</li>
<li>Israel says military has begun intercepting drones fired from Iran</li>
<li>US says it has no part in the operation</li>
<li>Civilians, six nuclear scientists among killed, says Iran</li>
<li>Attack comes ahead of US and Iranian officials’ talks on Sunday</li>

<p>“The (Israeli military) has begun intercepting UAVs fired from Iran, outside of Israeli territory,” the military official said in a statement.</p>
<p>Israel’s army had earlier said Iran launched about 100 drones toward Israel following a wave of Israeli air strikes across the Islamic republic.</p>
<p>Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards corps said its top commander, Hossein Salami, was <a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85860936/IRGC-s-Chief-Commander-Maj-Gen-Hossein-Salami-assassinated" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">killed</a> and state media reported the unit’s headquarters in Tehran had been hit.</p>
<p>Several children had been killed in a strike on a residential area in the capital, it said.</p>
<p>“We are at a decisive moment in Israel’s history,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a recorded video message.</p>
<p>“Moments ago Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival. This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.”</p>

<p>Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a statement that Israel had “unleashed its wicked and bloody” hand in a crime against Iran and that it would receive “a bitter fate for itself”.</p>
<p>An Israeli military official said Israel was striking “dozens” of nuclear and military targets including the facility at Natanz in central Iran. The official said Iran had enough material to make 15 nuclear bombs within days.</p>

<p>The United States said it had no part in the operation, which raises the risk of a fresh escalation in tensions in the Middle East, a major oil producing region.</p>
<p>Alongside extensive air strikes, Israel’s Mossad spy agency led a series of covert sabotage operations inside Iran, <em>Axios</em> reported, citing a senior Israeli official. These operations were aimed at damaging Irans strategic missile sites and its air defence capabilities.</p>
<p>At least six nuclear scientists were killed in Israel’s attacks, media outlets in the Islamic republic reported.</p>
<p><em>Tasnim</em> news agency named the six scientists including Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, who was the president of the Islamic Azad University of Iran. Fereydoun Abbasi, a former head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, was also among the scientists killed, it added.</p>
<p>The UN nuclear watchdog said that Iranian authorities told it that no increase in radiation levels have been observed at the Natanz uranium enrichment site following Israeli strikes.</p>
<p>“Iranian authorities have informed the IAEA… that no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a post on X, after earlier confirming that the facility was “among targets” of the strikes.</p>
<p>It added that Iran’s only nuclear power plant in the southern port city of Bushehr had not been targeted.</p>

<p>Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport was closed until further notice, and Israel’s air defence units stood at high alert for possible retaliatory strikes from Iran.</p>
<p>“Following the pre-emptive strike by the State of Israel against Iran, a missile and UAV (drone) attack against the State of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate time frame,” Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.</p>
<p>Israeli military Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir said tens of thousands of soldiers had been called up and “prepared across all borders”.</p>
<p>“We are amidst a historic campaign unlike any other. This is a critical operation to prevent an existential threat, by an enemy who is intent on destroying us,” he said.</p>
<p>Israeli Minister Gideon Saar was holding “marathon of calls” with counterparts around the world regarding Israel’s attack on Iran, the foreign ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Pakistan was among several countries and international actors which condemned Israel’s strikes, with the Foreign Office calling it “unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel.”</p>
<p>Jordan and Iraq announced the closure of their airspace and grounded all flights, with Amman vowing it would not allow any violations of its airspace.</p>
<p>“The kingdom’s airspace is temporarily closed, and air traffic suspended for all aircraft – incoming, outgoing and in transit, as a precaution against any risks resulting from the regional escalation,” the Jordanian civil aviation authority said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Jordan has not and will not allow any violation of its airspace, reaffirming that the Kingdom will not be a battleground for any conflict,” government spokesperson Mohammad Momani told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Iraq, which borders Iran, also closed its airspace on Friday. “The ministry of transport closes Iraqi airspace and suspends air traffic at all Iraqi airports,” the <em>Iraq News Agency</em> reported.</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump said that Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb and that the US was hoping to get back to the negotiating table, in an interview with <em>Fox News</em> after the start of the Israeli air strikes on Iran.</p>
<p>“We will see,” <em>Fox News</em> reporter Jennifer Griffin quoted Trump as saying in a post on X.</p>
<p>Trump would convene a meeting of the National Security Council on Friday morning, the White House said. He had said on Thursday an Israeli strike on Iran “could very well happen” but reiterated his hopes for a peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>The US military is planning for the full range of contingencies in the Middle East, including the possibility that it might have to help evacuate American civilians, a US official told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>Iran’s armed forces spokesperson said Israel and its chief ally the United States would pay a “heavy price” for the attack, accusing Washington of providing support for the operation.</p>
<p>While the US tried to distance itself from Israel’s military operation, an Israeli
official told public broadcaster Kan that Israel had coordinated with Washington on Iran.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States was not involved in the strikes and Tel Aviv had acted unilaterally for self-defence.</p>
<p>“We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” Rubio said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Let me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel,” he added.</p>

<p>The State Department issued an advisory saying that all US government employees in Israel and their family members should “shelter in place until further notice”.</p>
<p>The attacks triggered sharp falls in stock prices in Asian trade on Friday, led by a selloff in US futures, while oil prices jumped as investors scurried to safe havens such as gold and the Swiss franc.</p>
<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned any military escalation in the Middle East, said deputy UN spokesperson Farhan Haq.</p>
<p>“The Secretary-General asks both sides to show maximum restraint, avoiding at all costs a descent into deeper conflict, a situation that the region can hardly afford,” Haq said.</p>

<p>A US official said those talks were still scheduled to proceed despite the Israeli attack.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said on Friday that it was forced to act based on new intelligence information showing that Iran was “approaching the point of no return” in the development of a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>“In recent months, this program has accelerated significantly, bringing the regime significantly closer to obtaining a nuclear weapon,” it said in a statement, without disclosing the purported evidence.</p>
<p>A source familiar with US intelligence reports said there had been no recent change in the US intelligence assessment that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and that Khamenei had not authorised the restarting of the nuclear weapons programme that was shuttered in 2003.</p>

<p>AHMEDABAD: More than 200 people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916728/1-survivor-over-200-killed-as-air-india-plane-crashes-after-take-off-in-ahmedabad">killed</a> when an Air India plane bound for London with 242 people on board crashed shortly after takeoff, authorities said on Thursday, in what is said to be the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.</p>
<p>Only one person is known to have survived, as the plane came down in a residential area, crashing onto a medical college hostel just outside the airport at lunchtime.</p>
<p>The passengers included 169 Indian nationals, 53 British, seven Portuguese, and a Canadian. Two pilots and 10 cabin crew were also aboard, according to <em>AFP</em>.</p>

<p>According to air traffic control at Ahmedabad Airport, Air India’s flight 171 — bound for London Gatwick airport — departed at 1:39 pm local time (0809 GMT) from runway 23. It gave a Mayday call, signalling an emergency, but thereafter there was no response from the aircraft.</p>
<p>Footage of the crash showed the plane taking off over a residential area and then disappearing from view, before a huge ball of fire and smoke is seen rising into the sky from beyond the houses.</p>
<p>Another video circulating on social media showed an aircraft rapidly losing altitude — with its nose up — before it hit a building and exploded into an orange ball of fire.</p>
<p>India’s <em>CNN News-18</em> said the plane crashed on top of the dining area of state-run B.J. Medical College hostel, killing many medical students as well.</p>
<p><strong>‘Sole survivor’</strong></p>
<p>City police chief G.S. Malik told <em>Reuters</em> that 204 bodies had been recovered from the crash site. Vidhi Chaudhary, another senior police officer, said they had found one survivor, who was in seat 11A.</p>
<p>Indian media identified the fortunate man as UK resident Ramesh Viswashkumar.</p>
<p>“Thirty seconds after takeoff, there was a loud noise and then the plane crashed,” the 40-year-old told the <em>Hindustan Times.</em></p>

<p>“Someone grabbed hold of me and put me in an ambulance and brought me to the hospital.”</p>
<p>He said that his brother Ajay was seated in a different row on the plane. “He was travelling with me and I cant find him anymore. Please help me find him, he said.</p>
<p>According to the <em>BBC</em>, Vishwash has a wife and child and has lived in the UK for many years. His relatives, who had gathered at the family home in Leicester, said they were awaiting more information.</p>
<p>Federal minister C.R. Patil said the dead included Vijay Rupani, a former chief minister of Gujarat state.</p>
<p>The Indian aviation minister’s office said PM Narendra Modi, whose home state is Gujarat, had told it to ensure all support was extended to the rescue efforts.</p>
<p>Ahmedabad Airport, which suspended all flight operations after the crash, said it was operational again but with limited flights. The airport is operated by India’s Adani Group conglomerate.</p>
<p>The last fatal plane crash in India, the world’s third largest aviation market and its fastest growing, was in 2020 and involved Air India Express, the airline’s low-cost arm.</p>

<p><strong>First Dreamliner crash</strong></p>
<p>Aviation tracking site <em>Flightradar24</em> said the plane was a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, one of the most modern passenger aircraft in service.</p>
<p>It was the first crash for the Dreamliner, which began flying commercially in 2011, according to the Aviation Safety Network database. The plane that crashed on Thursday flew for the first time in 2013 and was delivered to Air India in January 2014, <em>Flightradar24</em> said.</p>
<p>Investigators with the US National Transportation Safety Board will travel to assist Indian counterparts probing the brutal Air India crash, the agency announced Thursday.</p>
<p>“The NTSB will be leading a team of US investigators travelling to India to assist… with (the) investigation into the crash of an Air India Boeing 787 in Ahmedabad, India,” the agency said on X, adding that under international protocols, “all information on the investigation will be provided by the Government of India.”</p>

            <p><p>• Officers to get 50pc of salary, soldiers 20pc; ministry stays mum on financial impact<br />
• Minister expects policy rate to come down before next year, seems hopeful about privatisation<br />
• Finance secretary says current year’s uplift budget reduced to Rs967bn, hints at further drop<br />
• Lawmakers concerned over tax-to-GDP ratio, revenue shortfall, taxes on solar panels, among other things</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Amid a downward revision in federal development spending, which may fall further by the end of this month, the Ministry of Finance told a parliamentary panel on Thursday that armed forces officers had been granted a special relief allowance at 50 per cent of their basic salary, while junior commissioned officers and soldiers would get 20pc allowance in the upcoming fiscal year.</p>
<p>Testifying before the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, Secretary Finance Imdadullah Bosal highlighted relief measures proposed in the budget, saying that “special relief allowance at the rate of 50pc to officers and 20pc to JCOs/soldiers” of their basic salary had been granted. The meeting was presided over by MNA Syed Naveed Qamar.</p>
<p>The ministry did not disclose the financial impact and the reason for the higher allowance for officers in response to members’ questions about the financial impact of these allowances. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb promised to get back with a detailed response, besides few other things, later saying he had noted down the points raised by Omar Ayub, the leader of the opposition.</p>
<p>Mr Bosal disclosed that the current year’s public sector development programme had been revised to Rs967bn from Rs1.1 trillion and conceded even this amount may not be fully utilised by June 30, given the fact that Rs662bn had so far been actually spent.</p>
<p>At this, the members pointed out that a reduction in development expenditure would not only change the current year’s growth <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906217">estimates</a> (2.7pc of GDP) based on Rs1.1tr investment but also many other economic indicators as well.</p>
<p>The minister expected the central bank’s policy rate decline to single digits before the close of the current calendar year, as inflation had been a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916059/finance-minister-aurangzeb-unveils-pakistan-economic-survey-2024-25">‘fantastic story’</a> and both fiscal and current accounts improved significantly. He said the monetary policy committee was set to meet next week and there was a cushion to do more. He did not comment further, saying it was the State Bank of Pakistan’s domain.</p>
<p>The minister said Pakistan would be receiving about $1bn foreign inflows before the close of the current fiscal year through a syndicated arrangement from banks, with about $500 million guarantee from the Asian Development Bank, to be doubled next year. Therefore, the foreign exchange reserves currently at over $11bn would touch $14bn by June-end.</p>
<p>The minister said Pakistan would double commercial and capital market borrowing next year as credit ratings improved further, pointing out that about $500 million foreign bond maturing in September and another $1.2bn in April next year would be repaid in time.</p>
<p>The finance secretary said the major source of non-tax revenue – SBP profit – that stood at Rs2.6tr during the current year and projected at Rs2.4tr next year was mainly because of windfall from the higher policy rate. Normally, it remains around Rs1tr or so, he said.</p>
<p><strong>Petroleum levy</strong></p>
<p>He said the petroleum levy, another major source of non-tax revenue, stood at Rs78 per litre on diesel and Rs77 per litre on petrol and would be increased by Rs2.5/litre carbon levy under the next year’s budget, taking its size on average to Rs80/litre on these two products.</p>
<p>With an additional levy on furnace oil, the PDL was targeted to generate Rs1.468tr next year from Rs1.161tr during the current year. He confirmed that the upper cap on the petroleum development levy had been removed as the government increased its rate by Rs10/litre for the power sector subsidy and another Rs8 per litre for the Quetta-Karachi (N25) highway. The government had no plan to further increase it, he added.</p>
<p>Mr Bosal said the BISP allocation for next year had been increased by 21pc to Rs716bn from Rs592bn, while Azad Kashmir’s grant had been jacked up by 33pc to Rs140bn next year from Rs105bn. The allocation for Gilgit-Baltistan had also been raised by 18pc to Rs80bn from Rs68bn, which was in addition to another Rs20bn wheat subsidy to the region. Likewise, another special area of tribal merged districts had also been increased by 21pc to Rs80bn from Rs66bn.</p>
<p>The minister acknowledged members’ concern about Rs87bn revenue projections next year from privatisation deals. He said this was an area where the government could not complete any transaction, but many corrections had been made, including certain incentives allowed by the IMF. This would not only take the PIA to the finish line but also the Roosevelt Hotel, three power distribution companies and a couple of financial sector transactions, both through strategic sale and listings on the capital market, he added.</p>
<p>The finance minister thanked the four provinces for delivering over Rs1tr cash surplus this year and hoped to secure another Rs1.464tr next year. Their support helped the overall fiscal deficit reach 5.6pc of GDP against the federal deficit of 6.8pc envisaged in the budget last year. With their support, the consolidated fiscal deficit was estimated at 3.9pc of GDP for next year.</p>
<p>The committee members expressed concerns over the tax-to-GDP ratio, revenue shortfall, taxes on solar panels, hybrid vehicles, carbon levy, petroleum levy, private sector lending and debt, SMEs, industrial and agricultural growth and targets, withholding tax (WHT) on ATMs and bank deposits, pensions, gender-specific allocations, health-specific allocations, electric vehicles, structural reforms, sales tax on cotton, public sector expenditure, defence spending, the widening current account deficit, and the negative growth rates observed in both the manufacturing and agricultural sectors.</p>
<p>The discussion also highlighted the challenges of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908581">climate change</a> and the need for social protection. The members expressed serious concerns regarding the inefficiency of Customs Intelligence and smuggling at the borders.</p>
