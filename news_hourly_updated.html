                <h2>Curfew imposed as 3-day operation against militants begins in Bajaur: official</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Bajaur administration imposed a three-day curfew at 16 places of the district on Tuesday and initiated an operation against militants in the areas.</p>
<p>Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafiq confirmed the development to <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>A notification in this regard issued by Bajaur Deputy Commissioner (DC) Shahid Ali Khan said there was a need to impose restrictions on all kinds of movement on the main roads and outside houses at Badi Siah, Tarkho, Irab, Gat, Agra, Khurchai, Dawagai, Kalan, Legharai, Kitkot, Gillai, Nakhtar, Zarai, Dambarai, Amanata and Zagai area of Tehsil Loe Mamund to prevent any untoward incidents as recommended by the Bajaur District Intelligence Coordination Committee to ensure public safety during targeted actions against militants.</p>
<p>The DC imposed a ban on all kinds of movement of individuals outside houses, on roads, vehicles and all forms of traffic on all roads at the above villages with effect from 5am today till 5pm on July 31 (Thursday) under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>
<p>It instructed all individuals to comply with the order and restrict all movement on the roads and outside houses, warning that anyone found violating the order would be liable for legal action under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p>

<p>The decision came following the police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927214/bajaur-police-repulse-terrorist-attack-on-checkpost">repulsing an attack</a> by terrorists on Thangi checkpost on Sunday night. Officials had told <em>Dawn</em> that terrorists attacked the joint police and FC post in Thangi area of Salarzai tehsil on Sunday night around 9:42 pm.

<p>They said that no casualties were reported in the attack. No group claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>

                <h2>PTI rubbishes reports of Imran disallowing sons from visiting Pakistan, says ‚Äòno doubt‚Äô they will come</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The PTI on Tuesday swiftly rubbished media reports that said party founder Imran Khan had barred his two sons from coming to Pakistan and participating in any activity for his release.</p>
<p>Imran‚Äôs sons ‚Äî Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim Khan, 26 ‚Äî <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910789">called attention</a> to their father‚Äôs incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Earlier this month, Imran‚Äôs sister Aleema Khan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">said</a> Sulaiman and Kasim will go to the US before coming to Pakistan as part of a movement calling for the ex-premier‚Äôs release.</p>
<p>Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a ¬£190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, media reports said that the incarcerated former prime minister told reporters at Adiala Jail that his sons would not be coming to Pakistan and taking part in or leading any protest.</p>
<p>Responding swiftly to the reports, PTI Central Information Secretary Waqas Akram said: ‚ÄúThe news circulating in the media regarding Imran Khan Sahib‚Äôs children is completely false. Imran Khan <em>sahib</em> has absolutely not stopped his children from coming to Pakistan. I would request those media friends who report from Adiala to only broadcast exactly what Khan <em>sahib</em> says. It is inappropriate to take things out of context, selectively, or to present conversations according to their own wishes.‚Äù</p>

<p>In a follow-up post, he said: ‚ÄúThere should be no doubt in anyone‚Äôs mind that Imran Khan‚Äôs children will come to Pakistan. So far, only the date for this has yet to be determined. And everyone should remember that when they decided to come, they clearly told their father that we are not seeking your permission but informing you. So, avoid these propagandas because they are of no use.‚Äù</p>

<p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif termed the entire matter ‚Äúone drama among many dramas‚Äù, adding that ‚Äúthe purpose was not the meeting of father and child but political gain. No move by the founder happens without political or financial gain.‚Äù</p>

<p>Although the government has not officially commented on the matter of Imran‚Äôs son, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926052/imrans-sons-meet-trump-aide-to-kick-off-us-campaign-to-free-father">questioned</a> what, if any, role they would be able to play, adding that they were welcome to visit Pakistan and there would be no obstacle for them and visas would be issued ‚Äúin less than 24 hours‚Äù, provided they stayed within the law.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan">told</a> <em>Dawn.com</em> that Article 16 of the Constitution, which grants the right to gather, was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Malik also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923089">said</a> that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals, and that if they ‚Äúviolate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled‚Äù.</p>
<p>There were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan">conflicting</a> statements from PML-N leaders as well on whether the duo would be allowed entry into Pakistan, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they should be allowed to come and ‚Äúcarry out their activities‚Äù, but within the limitations of the law.</p></p>
