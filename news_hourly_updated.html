<p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have extended heartfelt congratulations to the entire Pakistani nation and the Muslim Ummah around the world on the occasion of Eidul Azha.</p>
<p>They emphasised the importance of promoting values of sacrifice, love, brotherhood, and unity in our behaviour.</p>
<p>In his message, the president said that the day revives in people the spirit of faith, sacrifice, selflessness, and brotherhood.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe called for drawing lessons from the spirit of sacrifice and selflessness shown by Prophet Ibrahim (AS) and integrating them into our lives,‚Äù <em>Radio Pakistan</em> said.</p>
<p>He said there was a pressing need to support the underprivileged and marginalised segments of our society. ‚ÄúAlong with the act of animal sacrifice, Eid calls upon us to make a solemn pledge to always care for those in need.‚Äù</p>
<p>Zardari said as a nation, we must support each other, share in each other‚Äôs sorrows, and work together to build a prosperous and great Pakistan.</p>
<p>In his message, the prime minister said, ‚ÄúThe message of Eidul Azha is not limited to the sacrifice of animals alone, it also teaches us to sacrifice our ego, desires, and personal interests for higher purposes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs our beloved homeland, Pakistan, moves forward on the path of development, we must embrace the spirit of unity, sacrifice, and selflessness.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said this Eid teaches us not only the importance of sacrificing life and wealth but also that nations achieve greatness when they work for collective welfare and selflessness alongside individual development.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz continued, ‚ÄúToday, we must especially remember our Palestinian brothers and sisters who are enduring ruthless and inhumane oppression and hunger.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added: ‚ÄúLikewise, we reaffirm our unwavering solidarity with the brave people of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, who have been engaged in a just and courageous struggle for their right to self-determination for decades.‚Äù</p>
<p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Chief of Air Staff  Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu extended their profound felicitations to the people of Pakistan, according to <em>Radio Pakistan</em>.</p>

<p>Starting at dawn, the pilgrims threw seven stones at each of three concrete walls symbolising the devil in the Mina valley, on the outskirts of Makkah.</p>
<p>This year‚Äôs Haj saw noticeably thinner crowds as authorities implemented a wide-ranging crackdown on illicit pilgrims with a heavy security presence at holy sites in Makkah and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The measures, including heat mitigation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915198">efforts</a>, were aimed at preventing a repeat of last year‚Äôs Haj that saw 1,301 people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1840835">die</a> in temperatures that hit 51.8 degrees Celsius.</p>
