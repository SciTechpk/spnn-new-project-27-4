            <p><p>A state of emergency has been declared in several districts of Punjab as heavy rains triggered flooding, the spokesperson Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924232">issued</a> a warning of torrential rains with wind-thundershowers that will last throughout the country till July 17.</p>
<p>Wasa Director General Tayyab Farid said that “rivers have overflowed due to heavy rains in Rawalpindi, Chakwal and surrounding areas,” leading to a flood situation.</p>
<p>According to the Punjab Rescue spokesperson Farooq Ahmed, heavy rains have left 33 dead across the province in the past 24 hours, while another 176 people have been injured.</p>
<p>“At least 13 people have died in Lahore, eight in Faisalabad, four in Pakpattan, three in Sheikhupura and Okara and one person each in Nankana Sahib and Sahiwal,” said the Punjab Rescue spokesperson.</p>
<p>Citizens have been advised to avoid unnecessary travel, stay away from power lines and open manholes, said Wasa DG.</p>
<p>Rescue teams are on alert in the field to deal with the emergency, he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PMD issued a flood alert for the Gawalmandi and Kattarian bridges in Rawalpindi as the water level in the Leh Nullah continues to rise.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Director General Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Irfan Ali Kathia urged residents of low-lying areas near Leh Nullah to “cooperate with the administration if evacuation becomes necessary”.</p>
<p>In a statement, the PDMA warned that strict action will be taken against those gathering or bathing near Leh Nullah. It also announced a local holiday in Rawalpindi in light of the emergency.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Jhelum, rescue operations were underway to evacuate citizens trapped in floodwaters in Dhok Badar village of the district.</p>
<p>“Over 40 people have been rescued so far”, said PDMA DG, adding that rescue operations will continue until all citizens are safely evacuated.</p>
<p>“Pakistan army personnel and rescue teams are currently rushing the citizens to safe locations,” he added.</p>

<p>Punjab’s Chakwal district recorded 400 millimetres of rain overnight due to a cloudburst, triggering flash floods across the city, a statement from Punjab PDMA on Thursday.</p>
<p>According to PDMA, “Chawkwal recorded 400mm of rain in 10 hours, which left many areas flooded.”</p>
<p>PDMA DG said water has begun to recede with the cessation of the downpour, and evacuation efforts are underway to rescue the trapped citizens.</p>
<p>The district administration has been alerted, while the relevant rescue departments, including Wasa, Rescue 1122, and other civil personnel, have been summoned to the field to oversee rescue efforts, according to District Commissioner Chakwal, Quratul Ain Malik.</p>
<p>In light of the situation, relief arrangements have been made in hospitals and public buildings, Malik said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the PDMA spokesperson Kathia added that the district administration was in contact with the military as well in case of additional support.</p>
<p>“The PDMA assured the district administration of support in rescue and relief efforts and is personally overseeing the rescue operation until all citizens are safely evacuated,” Kathia said. “The district administration is continuing to monitor the situation, particularly in low-lying areas.”</p>
<p>District Emergency Operation Centre, including the PDMA Control Room, are on high alert, he said, adding that “helicopters and other rescue resources are also on standby.”</p>

<p>Heavy downpour in Mandi Bahauddin left one dead and injured 11 people on Wednesday, as the city recorded 210mm of rainfall.</p>
<p>Shah Hussain, 10, drowned while bathing in the rainwater, while in another incident, two boys — Qasim, 08, and Huzaifa, 06— were electrocuted during the rain.</p>
<p>Nine people were injured after the roofs of three dilapidated houses collapsed at separate locations. Areas in the city, such as College Chowk, Pindi Purani, and Jail Chowk, remained submerged under two to four feet of water.</p>

<p>Amid heavy rains and flooding in the province, authorities in the capital were directed to remain on high alert on the instructions of the chairman Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Chief Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa.</p>
<p>“Field teams should provide all possible assistance to citizens in case of an emergency,” he said.</p>
<p>The CDA chairman directed that strict monitoring of all highways, drains and waterways of Islamabad should be ensured.</p>
<p>In case of any emergency, citizens are advised to contact the CDA and district administration on 16 and 1334, respectively.</p>
<p>Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday continued its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924716/psx-rebounds-on-hopes-of-ratings-upgrade">renewed</a> bullish momentum as it crossed the 138,000 points during intraday trade.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,785.25 points, or 1.31 per cent, to stand at 138,165.21 points at 11:57am, from the previous close of 136,379.96 points.</p>
<p>The PSX had staged a modest recovery yesterday as investors resumed buying, encouraged by the formation of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924499">high-level committee</a> to address the business community’s concerns over the recently introduced taxation measures.</p>

<p>The development has helped the KSE-100 index gain momentum despite the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924723/businesses-gear-up-for-nationwide-strike">July 19 strike call</a> by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry to protest against the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917240">powers</a> to arrest and prosecute businessmen introduced in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292">federal budget</a>.</p>

            <p><p>Three “wanted terrorists” were killed during a joint operation between the regional police and the Counter Terrorism Department in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Wednesday night, police said.</p>
<p>The spokesperson for the Bannu police, Khanzala Quraishi, told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “The three terrorists, belonging to the Zarar group, had been eliminated in an intelligence-based joint operation conducted in the Bannu city outskirts at midnight.”</p>
<p>He said that the “terrorists were wanted for attacks on security forces and the target killing of police personnel”.</p>

<p>Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents, with a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series</a> of attacks across Peshawar, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, and Bajaur in the last few months.</p>
<p>Yesterday, two policemen were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924569">gunned down</a> in a terrorist attack in Kulachi area of KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district, police said.</p>
<p>In early July, at least five people, including an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921636">assistant commissioner</a>, were killed and 11 others injured in an explosion targeting a government vehicle in Bajaur.</p>

<p>Separately, six people were killed as a result of a clash between two parties over personal enmity in the Panyala area of KP’s Dera Ismail Khan early on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>According to the DI Khan police spokesperson, Yaqoob Khan, “the two parties were close relatives, and the clash took place due to a long-standing family dispute.”</p>
<p>The bodies and the injured parties were transported to Panyala Hospital. The police have cordoned off the area and started an investigation, but no arrests have been made yet, he added.</p></p>
