            <p><p>The Bajaur administration imposed a three-day curfew at 16 places of the district on Tuesday and initiated an operation against militants in the areas.</p>
<p>Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafiq confirmed the development to <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>A notification in this regard issued by Bajaur Deputy Commissioner (DC) Shahid Ali Khan said there was a need to impose restrictions on all kinds of movement on the main roads and outside houses at Badi Siah, Tarkho, Irab, Gat, Agra, Khurchai, Dawagai, Kalan, Legharai, Kitkot, Gillai, Nakhtar, Zarai, Dambarai, Amanata and Zagai area of Tehsil Loe Mamund to prevent any untoward incidents as recommended by the Bajaur District Intelligence Coordination Committee to ensure public safety during targeted actions against militants.</p>
<p>The DC imposed a ban on all kinds of movement of individuals outside houses, on roads, vehicles and all forms of traffic on all roads at the above villages with effect from 5am today till 5pm on July 31 (Thursday) under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>
<p>It instructed all individuals to comply with the order and restrict all movement on the roads and outside houses, warning that anyone found violating the order would be liable for legal action under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p>
<p>Awami National Party President Aimal Wali Khan <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/AimalWali/status/1950188861088551133" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">alleged</a> that innocent people were injured in the operation and called on the violence to stop.</p>
<p>The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl also <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/juipakofficial/status/1950216959502549070" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that it could not support the operation.</p>
<p>The decision came following the police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927214/bajaur-police-repulse-terrorist-attack-on-checkpost">repulsing an attack</a> by terrorists on Thangi checkpost on Sunday night. Officials had told <em>Dawn</em> that terrorists attacked the joint police and FC post in Thangi area of Salarzai tehsil on Sunday night around 9:42 pm. They said that police and security forces personnel at the post responded effectively to the attack.</p>
<p>They said that no casualties were reported in the attack. No group claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
<p>Police on Monday started checking suspicious vehicles and people to thwart terrorist activities in the district. Several police officials took part in the exercise, searching vehicles and people on roads and exit and entry points, said a statement.</p>
<p>On July 10, Awami National Party politician Maulana Khan Zeb and a policeman were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923308/anp-leader-maulana-khan-zeb-cop-gunned-down-in-kps-bajaur-police">shot dead</a> by unidentified suspects in the district.</p>
<p>An assistant commissioner and a tehsildar were among <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921762/assistant-commissioner-among-five-martyred-in-bajaur-blast">five people martyred</a>, while 17 others, including several police personnel, sustained injuries when a roadside bomb explosion struck an official vehicle in the district’s Sadiqabad area on July 2.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927421/pti-rubbishes-reports-of-imran-disallowing-sons-from-visiting-pakistan-says-no-doubt-they-will-come' target='_blank'><strong>PTI rubbishes reports of Imran disallowing sons from visiting Pakistan, says ‘no doubt’ they will come</strong></a>
            <p><p>The PTI on Tuesday swiftly rubbished media reports that said party founder Imran Khan had barred his two sons from coming to Pakistan and participating in any activity for his release.</p>
<p>Imran’s sons — Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim Khan, 26 — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910789">called attention</a> to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Earlier this month, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">said</a> Sulaiman and Kasim will go to the US before coming to Pakistan as part of a movement calling for the ex-premier’s release.</p>
<p>Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, media reports said that the incarcerated former prime minister told reporters at Adiala Jail that his sons would not be coming to Pakistan and taking part in or leading any protest.</p>
<p>Responding swiftly to the reports, PTI Central Information Secretary Waqas Akram said: “The news circulating in the media regarding Imran Khan Sahib’s children is completely false. Imran Khan <em>sahib</em> has absolutely not stopped his children from coming to Pakistan. I would request those media friends who report from Adiala to only broadcast exactly what Khan <em>sahib</em> says. It is inappropriate to take things out of context, selectively, or to present conversations according to their own wishes.”</p>

<p>In a follow-up post, he said: “There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that Imran Khan’s children will come to Pakistan. So far, only the date for this has yet to be determined. And everyone should remember that when they decided to come, they clearly told their father that we are not seeking your permission but informing you. So, avoid these propagandas because they are of no use.”</p>

<p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif termed the entire matter “one drama among many dramas”, adding that “the purpose was not the meeting of father and child but political gain. No move by the founder happens without political or financial gain.”</p>

<p>Although the government has not officially commented on the matter of Imran’s son, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926052/imrans-sons-meet-trump-aide-to-kick-off-us-campaign-to-free-father">questioned</a> what, if any, role they would be able to play, adding that they were welcome to visit Pakistan and there would be no obstacle for them and visas would be issued “in less than 24 hours”, provided they stayed within the law.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan">told</a> <em>Dawn.com</em> that Article 16 of the Constitution, which grants the right to gather, was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Malik also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923089">said</a> that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals, and that if they “violate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled”.</p>
<p>There were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan">conflicting</a> statements from PML-N leaders as well on whether the duo would be allowed entry into Pakistan, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they should be allowed to come and “carry out their activities”, but within the limitations of the law.</p></p>

            <p><p>Indian opposition parties on Tuesday assailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for failures in the Pakistan-India four-day conflict earlier this year.</p>
<p>As New Delhi launched deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>, which Islamabad denied, PAF <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">downed</a> six Indian jets in its response. After tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking in the monsoon session of the Indian lower house of parliament, Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi said Modi’s government “lacked the political will to fight Pakistan and, because of that, asked the armed forces to attack with their hands tied behind their backs,” according to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/government-showed-we-dont-have-political-will-to-fight-rahul-gandhi-8975245" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NDTV</a></em>.</p>
<p>“If Modi <em>ji</em> has even 50 per cent of the courage that Indira Gandhi had, then clearly say in parliament — Donald Trump is lying,” Gandhi, who is a member of the opposition Congress party, said.</p>
<p>He added that the Indian prime minister should state that neither did Trump broker a ceasefire, nor have any of India’s planes had been shot down.</p>
<p>“Don’t make the army a means to save your image, Modi <em>ji</em>,” Gandhi said.</p>
<p>“The defence minister said the most shocking thing. He said that, at 1:35 am, we called Pakistan and told them we had hit non-military targets and didn’t want an escalation,” he added.</p>
<p>The Indian leader of the opposition said the Indian defence minister did not understand what he revealed, adding, “The Director General of Military Operations was told by the government to ask for a ceasefire at 1:35am that very night.”</p>
<p>“You told the Pakistanis exactly what you would do, that you would not hit military targets. You told them directly that you don’t have the political will to fight. It’s like you are telling them, ‘We have slapped you, but we won’t slap you further’,” Gandhi said.</p>
<p>Referring to the Indian Chief of Defence Staff’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914500/indian-military-confirms-fighter-jets-shot-down-by-pakistan">admission</a> that Indian jets had been shot down by Pakistan, he said, “CDS Gen Chauhan should have the guts to say that my hands were tied behind my back by my own government.”</p>
<p>He added that not a single country has condemned Pakistan.</p>
<p>Deputy Leader of the Congress party in the lower house, Gaurav Gogoi, said, “You think 35 Rafale jets are enough — we don’t think so. Even losing one would be a big loss,” according to Indian news outlet <a class="link--external" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/newsblogs/india-news-live-updates-weather-today-rains-flood-warning-in-odisha-pm-modi-congress-parliament-session-air-india-plane-crash-india-us-trade-talks-eu-us-deal-donald-trump-india-pakistan-ukraine-russia-plane-crash-thailand-cambodia-conflict-ceasefire-july-28-2025/liveblog/122943025.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>the Economic Times</em></a>.</p>
<p>“The media, which gets its information from you, made it seem like we would wake up in Karachi the next day — but you stopped short,” Gogoi added.</p>
<p>Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi said, “ Agencies failed. This falls under the home minister — did he resign? Did he even take responsibility?“</p>
<p>She also questioned why PM Modi agreed to stop the war.</p>
<p>Leader of the Opposition of the Upper House Mallikarjun Kharge questioned if the Indian government had prior notice of the Pahalgam attack, saying, “PM [Modi] cancelled his schedule three days before the Pahalgam attack — was the govt aware in advance?”</p>
<p>“Trump says five jets were shot down. If he’s your friend and you campaign for him, why are you silent on this?” Kharge asked PM Modi.</p>
<p>Pakistani security sources <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927163/india-plans-to-use-detained-pakistanis-in-fake-encounters-state-media">said</a> on Monday that India has once again begun “fake encounters” under the guise of countering terrorism, with an alleged plan to “use” detained Pakistanis in them, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927163/india-plans-to-use-detained-pakistanis-in-fake-encounters-state-media#:~:text=India%E2%80%99s%20defence%20minister%20denies%20bowing%20to%20pressure%20to%20end%20fighting">denied</a> bowing to pressure to end fighting while speaking at the opening of a discussion in parliament on the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>“India halted its operation because all the political and military objectives studied before and during the conflict had been fully achieved,” Singh said. “To suggest that the operation was called off under pressure is baseless and entirely incorrect.”</p>

<p>Indian Home Minister Amit Shah claimed that security forces have killed three “Pakistanis” involved in the Pahalgam attack, <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>
<p>“I want to tell … the entire nation that these were the three terrorists who killed our citizens … and now all three have been killed,” Shah told parliament during a discussion on the Pakistan-India conflict.</p>
<p>The three were killed in an intense gun battle in a Kashmir forest on Monday, the Indian army said.</p>
<p>Shah said that India had a “lot of proof” that the dead “terrorists” were Pakistanis, as security forces had recovered “Pakistani voter identity cards of two of them and chocolates made in Pakistan”.</p>
<p>Forensic tests showed that the rifles they had with them were used in the April attack, he added.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a <em>Reuters</em> request for comment on Shah’s remarks.</p></p>
