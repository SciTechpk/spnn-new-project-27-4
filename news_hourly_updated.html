                <h2>Federal cabinet approves National AI Policy 2025</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The federal cabinet on Wednesday marked major reforms after key decisions in strategic areas, including the approval of the National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Policy 2025.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif chaired a meeting of the federal cabinet today, which unanimously approved the National AI Policy 2025, designed to create a complete AI ecosystem in the country. The policy aims to democratise access to artificial intelligence, enhance public services and open up new employment and innovation avenues.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur youth are Pakistan‚Äôs greatest asset. Providing them with education, skills, and equal opportunities in AI is a top priority,‚Äù PM Shehbaz said.</p>
<p>The AI policy outlined training a million AI professionals by 2030, establishing an AI Innovation Fund and AI Venture Fund to boost private sector involvement, creating 50,000 AI-driven civic projects and 1,000 local AI products in the next five years.</p>
<p>It also called for the distribution of 3,000 annual AI scholarships and facilitation of 1,000 research projects, inclusion of women and individuals with disabilities through accessible education and financing, strengthening cybersecurity and national data security protocols, promoting global partnerships and compliance with international AI regulations.</p>
<p>An AI Council and a comprehensive master plan and action matrix will oversee the policy‚Äôs implementation.</p>

<p>The prime minister applauded the Ministry of IT and allied institutions for their timely efforts, saying, ‚ÄúAI will not only modernise our economy but also enhance productivity across agriculture, public services, and governance.‚Äù</p>

<p>The cabinet also ratified decisions made in earlier sessions of the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation and the Committee on Legislative Business held on July 8, 17, and 25, respectively.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Pakistani AI platform SOCByte <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922579">launched</a> the country‚Äôs first AI-powered cybersecurity programme designed to provide critical information to professionals.</p>
<p>In May, the Ministry of Finance <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913342">announced</a> the allocation of 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bit¬≠coin mining and AI data centres to ‚Äútransform Pak¬≠is¬≠tan into a global leader in digital innovation‚Äù.</p>
<p>In April, in a landmark judgement, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903685">emphasised</a> the potential of AI to streamline the judicial system, reduce delays, improve case management systems and expand legal knowledge ‚Äî particularly at the district level ‚Äî but urged a cautious and ethically grounded approach to its integration.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="http://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#cabinet-approves-haj-policy-2026" id="cabinet-approves-haj-policy-2026" title="Permalink"></a>Cabinet approves Haj Policy 2026</h2>
<p>The cabinet also approved next year‚Äôs Haj policy, with the prime minister also directing complete digitisation of the Haj operation beginning in 2026, ensuring transparency, efficiency and world-class services for pilgrims.</p>
<p>He emphasised that no compromise would be tolerated in providing top-tier facilities to Pakistani pilgrims. ‚ÄúEnsuring comfort, transparency, and timely support for every pilgrim is our foremost duty,‚Äù PM Shehbaz said.</p>
<p>The new Haj policy allocates 70 per cent quota to the government and 30pc to private operators. Notably, private companies that failed to fulfil their responsibilities in the previous year would now be required to accommodate affected individuals in 2026.</p>
<p>Moreover, the federal cabinet approved third-party validation for all Hajj operations, real-time monitoring of payments and application processes under private operators, a mandatory minimum of 2,000 pilgrims per private company, 1,000 seats reserved for hardship cases,</p>
<p>It also approved the use of enhanced digital tools, including the Pak Hajj mobile app, digital wristbands and mobile SIMs for better tracking and service delivery, transparent selection of assistants through competitive testing, emergency compensation mechanisms and upgraded lodging and food arrangements.</p>
<p>The prime minister also directed the Ministry of Information Technology to collaborate with the Ministry of Religious Affairs to ensure seamless digital transformation of the entire Hajj process.</p></p>

                <h2>Imran being kept in ‚Äòreally poor, worsening conditions‚Äô, his son Kasim says</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan‚Äôs son Kasim Khan has highlighted that his father was jailed in ‚Äúreally poor conditions‚Äù that were ‚Äúgetting worse by the moment‚Äù.</p>
<p>Imran‚Äôs sons ‚Äî Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim, 26 ‚Äî <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910789">called attention</a> to their father‚Äôs incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Earlier this month, Imran‚Äôs sister Aleema Khan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">said</a> Sulaiman and Kasim will go to the United States before coming to Pakistan as part of a movement calling for the ex-premier‚Äôs release. The siblings visited the US and engaged US lawmakers on the issue of their father‚Äôs incarceration.</p>
<p>Imran, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a> since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a ¬£190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.</p>
<p>In an interview on US media outlet <em>Real America‚Äôs Voice</em> shared today, Kasim said, ‚ÄúRight now he‚Äôs in really, really poor conditions and it looks like they‚Äôre getting worse and worse by the moment. So we‚Äôre looking for any way out possible.‚Äù</p>
<p>While emphasising that Imran was ‚Äúincarcerated in a solitary confinement cell‚Äù, he said, ‚ÄúThe state of the cell he‚Äôs in is awful, quite frankly.‚Äù</p>
<p>He continued, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs showering in muddy water.  I don‚Äôt mean unfiltered water. It‚Äôs muddy, dirty water,‚Äù alleging that 10 people who were incarcerated had died from filthy conditions.</p>
<p>Kasim expressed worry over not being able to see his father and said, ‚ÄúThere were moments ‚Ä¶ he went 10 days without any light in his cell,‚Äù calling it a ‚Äútorture tactic‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe gets only two hours a day in daylight. We‚Äôre not able to speak to him at all,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>Kasim said that he and his brother were ‚Äúlooking to America at the moment‚Äù for support, stating, ‚ÄúA lot of the people here have expressed concern. It seems like it might be the only route out at the moment.‚Äù</p>
<p>Speaking about meeting US President Donald Trump‚Äôs key aide Richard Grenell, he said, ‚ÄúGrennell was very kind to spend some time with us.‚Äù</p>
<p>He continued, ‚ÄúWe spoke at length and I don‚Äôt want to get into details but I‚Äôm very, very hopeful from that.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that Imran from a prison cell won the Feb 2024 elections, which went through ‚Äúvicious rigging‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚Äú[Despite] the amount of underhand tactics they used before the election to rig it against his favour, [he] still he managed to win.‚Äù</p>
<p>Separately, Imran Khan‚Äôs sister Aleema Khan said today that the sons would ‚Äúdefinitely‚Äù come to Pakistan as they had a National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (Nicop) and they were ‚Äúcitizens of Pakistan‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf anything were to happen to Imran‚Äôs sons, it would become an international matter,‚Äù she told reporters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif remarked, ‚ÄúWhy would the government stop Imran‚Äôs sons from coming to Pakistan?‚Äù</p>
<p>He told reporters in Islamabad that the government did not want PTI to ‚Äúresort to any violence‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe PTI will not be allowed to pull off another May 9 or Nov 26.‚Äù</p>
<p>A day earlier, PTI swiftly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927421">rubbished</a> media reports claiming that the incarcerated leader told reporters at Adiala Jail that his sons would not be coming to Pakistan and taking part in or leading any protest.</p>
<p>PTI Central Information Secretary Waqas Akram had stated: ‚ÄúThe news circulating in the media regarding Imran Khan Sahib‚Äôs children is completely false. Imran Khan sahib has absolutely not stopped his children from coming to Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI would request those media friends who report from Adiala to only broadcast exactly what Khan sahib says. It is inappropriate to take things out of context, selectively, or to present conversations according to their own wishes.‚Äù</p></p>
