                <h2>Imran decries lack of ‚Äòmeaningful momentum‚Äô for Aug 5 protest, orders PTI to shun all differences</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Incarcerated PTI founder and ex-prime minister Imran Khan has decried the lack of any ‚Äúmeaningful momentum‚Äù for the party‚Äôs planned <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922952/imran-shuns-dialogue-plans-nationwide-protest">August 5 protest</a> and ordered its members to immediately shun all their differences.</p>
<p>Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a ¬£190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. He has issued a nationwide protest call, which will reach its ‚Äúpeak‚Äù on Aug 5 to mark the second year of his incarceration in multiple cases.</p>
<p>However, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur appeared to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924027">disrupt</a> the nationwide protest plans and sow confusion by introducing a new 90-day timeline for what he described as ‚Äòa final push‚Äô. PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik later voiced her reservations about his announcement.</p>
<p>The resulting discord in the party leadership and ranks had prompted Imran to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924606/imran-prohibits-pti-members-from-going-public-with-partys-internal-matters">prohibit</a> his party members from publicly discussing the party‚Äôs internal matters.</p>
<p>In a post today on his X account ‚Äî which is not operated by Imran himself ‚Äî a message said to be sent on his behalf stated: ‚ÄúLet me make this absolutely clear: every member of the party must immediately set aside all internal differences and focus solely on the movement planned for August 5th. I do not see any meaningful momentum building behind this initiative at present. I am waging a battle against a 78-year-old system, and my greatest success is that despite unprecedented oppression, the public stands firmly with me.‚Äù</p>
<p>The message said the people had expressed their trust in the PTI by voting for it in the general elections, even in the absence of an electoral symbol.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter such a clear mandate, it is the moral and political responsibility of every party member to become the voice of the people. It will be nothing short of disgraceful and condemnable if PTI leaders waste time on internal conflicts at this critical juncture.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnyone found engaging in factionalism within the party will be expelled. I am fighting for the future of our generations and every sacrifice I make is for that cause. To create rifts within the party at this time would be a direct betrayal of my mission and vision,‚Äù the message warned.</p>

<p>Lashing out at the government, the message said it had ‚Äúcrippled the judiciary‚Äù through the 26th Constitutional Amendment.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe way biased judges are now delivering blatantly unjust verdicts under these courts is visible to the entire nation. We must launch a robust campaign to liberate the judiciary, for no nation can survive, let alone progress, without judicial independence.‚Äù</p>
<p>The message claimed ‚Äúinhumane conditions‚Äù were being imposed upon Imran‚Äôs spouse and former first lady Bushra Bibi while the PTI founder‚Äôs conditions were themselves not good.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am enduring the harshest prison term in the country‚Äôs history solely for the supremacy of the Constitution and in service of my nation. The level of oppression and authoritarianism is such that even the water I have for ablution is filthy and contaminated with dirt, unfit for any human being.‚Äù</p>
<p>Separately, a post from PTI‚Äôs central deputy information secretary said the nationwide protest would be led under the banner of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP).</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll provincial organisations will follow their respective plans of action based on their circumstances.‚Äù</p>

<p>Addressing a press conference with other TTAP leaders, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said the first step of the protest movement would be an all-party conference in Islamabad on July 31 and the decisions taken then would shape the future plan of action.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Imran‚Äôs sons continued their engagements in the United States, where they currently are before visiting Pakistan for their father.</p>
<p>They met Republican Congressman Joe Wilson of South Carolina who had introduced a bipartisan bill in the US House of Representatives in March, calling for sanctions on Pakistani state functionaries over alleged human rights violations, including the ‚Äúpersecution‚Äù of their father.</p>

<p>They also met US Congressman Brad Sherman.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am concerned to hear that Khan remains isolated from his family, friends, attorneys and doctors. His sons also shared that his physical health may be deteriorating.

                <h2>Deaths from GB flash floods rise to 6 as search for missing tourists continues: official</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The death toll from flash floods in Gilgit-Baltistan‚Äôs Diamer district rose to six on Thursday as a search for missing visitors was underway after heavy rains battered the region, an official said.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudburst-induced</a> floods wreaked havoc across the region. The flood-related <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829">death toll</a> in the region rose to five on Tuesday, after four lost their lives and 15 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719">went missing</a> on Monday.</p>
<p>GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that rescue teams recovered another body in Babusar valley, taking the total number of deaths to six. ‚ÄúThe search operation to locate the remaining tourists at Babusar is underway,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>According to Rescue 1122, GB‚Äôs Ghanche district experienced floods in various areas. Flash floods in Kandos villages damaged a dozen homes, a dispensary, mosques, agricultural land and crops, it said.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 also stated that flash floods in Sikarkoi damaged several houses and other infrastructure in Dass Mohallah and the surrounding areas in Gilgit.</p>

<p>Separately, rescue teams on Thursday recovered the body of a retired colonel who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/pmd-issues-glof-alert-for-gb-kp-as-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-from-diamer-amid-floods#:~:text=Two%20swept%20away%20in%20Rawalpindi%E2%80%99s%20DHA'">went missing</a> after his car was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925919">swept away</a> by floodwaters and slipped into a drain in Rawalpindi last week, while a search for his daughter continues, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>Rescue efforts have been underway since Tuesday, when Retired Colonel Ishaq Qazi, aged approximately 62‚Äì64 years, and his 25-year-old daughter went missing after the car they were in was swept away by rainwater.</p>
<p>District Emergency Officer (DEO) Sibghatullah said, ‚ÄúThe body of Ishaq had been found near the Soan River bridge, while rescue operations are underway to look for his daughter.‚Äù</p>
<p>Earlier today, Sibghatullah had said that rescue operations had entered a third day to search for the duo, while parts of their car had been found.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRescue 1122 found the bonnet and a door of the car under the Soan River bridge,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>According to a statement by Islamabad‚Äôs Sihala police station on Tuesday, the duo were in a grey Honda vehicle and were residents of Defence Housing Authority‚Äôs Phase 5.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDue to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain,‚Äù the police statement had said.</p>
<p>Pakistan experiences <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925461">monsoon rainfall</a> from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>Last week, Section 144 was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924761">imposed</a> across Punjab along with a state of emergency in several districts as heavy rains triggered flooding and claimed over 60 lives across the province in 24 hours.</p>

<p>On the other hand, residents of a housing society blocked Rawalpindi‚Äôs Grand Trunk Road after the rescue teams could not recover the body of a teenager who had drowned a day earlier.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, a 17-year-old boy drowned while crossing a nullah near the Metro City Housing Society. He was walking on a small passage when high-speed torrents swept him away in deep waters.</p>
<p>Two of his relatives jumped in the water to rescue him, but they told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the water was moving at high speed and the boy could not be saved.</p>
<p>Gujar Khan assistant superintendent of police and assistant commissioner also reached the spot and called the Rescue 1122 team, who were unable to retrieve the body as of the filing of this report. The residents of the area blocked the GT Road, citing the ‚Äúinaction and incapacity of Rescue 1122 in recovering the victim‚Äôs body after many hours‚Äù.</p>
