            <p><p>New Israeli strikes were reported in Iran on Saturday as Tel Aviv warned “Tehran will burn” after the Islamic Republic continued its barrage of overnight missiles in response to Israeli <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/tel-aviv-in-smoke-as-iran-launches-missiles-under-operation-true-promise-3-after-day-long-israeli-attacks">onslaught</a> on its nuclear facilities that killed its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916918/who-was-hossein-salami-the-revolutionary-guards-chief-killed-in-israeli-attacks">top generals</a>.</p>
<p>The missile exchange comes a day after nearly 80 people, including top army officers, were killed while civilians were among over 300 wounded in Iran as a result of Israel’s strikes on military sites and private residences, according to the country’s UN envoy Amir Saeid Iravani.</p>

<p>Iranian media reported new Israeli strikes today in cities in the west and northwest, which house key defences and military bases.</p>
<p>The <em>Fars</em> and <em>Mehr</em> news agencies said the strikes hit the northwestern city of <a class="link--external" href="https://www.mehrnews.com/news/6498987/%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%BA%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%B8-%D8%A7%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tabriz</a> as well as parts of the western provinces of Lorestan, Hamedan, and Kermanshah.</p>
<p>The Tabriz Oil Refinery Company, however, <a class="link--external" href="https://www.mehrnews.com/news/6499724/%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D9%BE%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B4%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B2-%D8%B5%D8%AD%D8%AA-%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D8%AC%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denied</a> reports of any attack or damage to its facilities and said its operational activities are being carried out as usual.</p>
<p><em>Fars</em> said two projectiles hit Tehran’s Mehrabad airport, and Iranian media said flames were reported there. Close to key Iranian leadership sites, the airport hosts an air force base with fighter jets and transport aircraft.</p>
<p>Blasts were heard across the capital as Iran activated its air defences against the incoming fire.</p>
<p>Iran’s ambassador to the UN said on Friday that 78 people had been killed and 320 wounded in the first wave of strikes by Israel.</p>

<p>After his country claimed to have struck multiple targets in Iran, Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened that “Tehran will burn” if Iran fired more missiles at Israel.</p>
<p>“The Iranian dictator is turning the citizens of Iran into hostages and bringing about a reality in which they — especially the residents of Tehran — will pay a heavy price because of the criminal harm to Israeli civilians,” Katz was quoted as saying in a statement.</p>
<p>“If [Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei continues to fire missiles toward the Israeli home front — Tehran will burn.”</p>
<p>Israel’s military also said its fighter jets were set to resume striking targets in Tehran, after announcing it had hit air defences in the area of the Iranian capital overnight.</p>
<p>“The way to Iran has been paved,” the military’s chief of staff and air force chief were quoted as saying in an army statement.</p>
<p>The military “is proceeding according to its operational plans, and [Israeli air force] fighter jets are set to resume striking targets in Tehran”, it added.</p>

<p>Israel <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/idfonline/status/1933764330454913407" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed</a> it struck dozens of targets in Tehran overnight, which included “surface-to-air missile infrastructures as part of an effort to dismantle” air defence capabilities around Iran’s capital, <em>Al Jazeera</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://aje.io/auoxkc?update=3773777" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The Israeli army claimed: “For the first time since the beginning of the war, over 1,500km from Israeli territory, the [Israeli air force] struck defence arrays in the area of Tehran.”</p>
<p>“We damaged — and will continue to damage — strategic sites and enemy sources of knowledge,” the commanding officer of the Israeli air force, MG Tomer Bar, was quoted as saying in a military statement.</p>
<p>Iranian forces shot down Israeli drones on a reconnaissance mission over the northwest, state media reported, as exchanges of fire between the two sides continued.</p>
<p>“Islamic fighters (Iranian forces) in the Salmas border region successfully shot down Israeli drones that had violated the country’s airspace,” state television said, adding that the “drones had entered Iranian airspace on espionage and reconnaissance missions”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em>IRINN</em> reported that the closure of the strategic Strait of Hormuz was being seriously reviewed by Iran, citing statements by Esmail Kosari, a member of the parliament’s security commission.</p>
<p>The Strait of Hormuz, which lies between Oman and Iran, is the world’s most important gateway for oil shipping.</p>

<p>In the morning, Iran launched a fresh wave of attacks, state media said, after Israel’s military reported it detected inbound missiles from Tehran. This followed an initial salvo of over 100 missiles late on Friday night under “Operation True Promise 3”.</p>
<p><em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/514307/Iran-penetrates-Israel-with-drones-after-five-waves-of-missile" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tehran Times</a></em> stated there were “at least five rounds of ballistic missile attacks”.</p>
<p>It further said several of the army’s Arash kamikaze drones “successfully penetrated the occupied territories and struck their targets”, referring to Israel.</p>
<p>A senior Iranian military official, General Ahmad Vahidi, said the operation would continue for “as long as necessary”, according to Iranian state media <em>IRNA</em>.</p>

<p>Air raid sirens and explosions rang out across Israel overnight, with its military calling on residents to take refuge in bomb shelters in the morning.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said dozens of missiles — some intercepted — had been fired in the latest salvos from Iran</p>
<p>An Israeli military official said Iran fired hundreds of drones and missiles towards Israel, claiming most of which were intercepted. <em>AFP</em> images of the city of Ramat Gan near Tel Aviv showed blown-out buildings, destroyed vehicles and streets strewn with debris.</p>
<p>A man and a woman were killed in Israel and dozens were wounded by a missile that landed near their homes, Israel’s ambulance service <a class="link--external" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/death-toll-in-direct-iranian-missile-hit-rises-to-two/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>
<p>Rescue teams were searching the rubble of apartment buildings that were destroyed in Rishon Lezion, a city outside of Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Israel’s Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter said “some 40 people”, besides the woman, were injured by the Iranian strikes.</p>
<p>“We faced three salvos of ballistic missiles fired from Iran today, about 150 in total,” Leiter <a class="link--external" href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-news-06-12-25-hnk-intl#cmbviaw2v00003b6wvywxa11k" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>CNN</em>’s Kaitlan Collins.</p>

<p>“We expect that the Iranians, who have a considerable volume of ballistic missiles, somewhere in the neighbourhood of 2,000, will continue to fire them,” he said.</p>
<p>“Israel is in war, not with the people of Iran … we are in a war against a regime that is intent on achieving nuclear power,” Leiter said.</p>
<p>He added that Israel wouldn’t know “precisely how much” damage it could inflict on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure until its forces “continue and complete the campaign”. “Ask me that question in four or five days,” the envoy added.</p>
<p>Brigadier General Ahmadi Vahidi, a top advisor to the commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, claimed his country hit three Israeli airbases that were used as launch sites for attacks on Iran, the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/06/14/3334994/israel-s-nevatim-ovda-tel-nof-airbases-struck-by-iran-general" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tasnim</a></em> news agency reported.</p>
<p>Gen Vahidi said the sites included the Nevatim and Ovda airbases, in which the Israeli regime’s command and control, as well as the electronic warfare centre, were located. Other sites, he added, included the Tel Nof airbase near Tel Aviv, Israel’s defence ministry, as well as its industrial and military centres in the capital.</p>

<p>It added that other targets included “military-industrial facilities instrumental in producing missiles and other weaponry for the Zionist regime’s army to commit crimes against the resistant nations of the region — particularly the oppressed people of Palestine and Gaza”.</p>
<p>“Field reports, satellite imagery and intelligence intercepts confirm the effective impact of dozens of ballistic missiles on strategic targets in occupied Palestine. Despite the enemy’s claims of interception, they failed to counter the waves of missile attacks launched by the Islamic Republic of Iran,” the statement added.</p>

<p>Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz took shelter inside a bunker, conducting a situation assessment after Iran’s retaliatory strikes, an Israeli official <a class="link--external" href="https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-news-06-12-25-hnk-intl#cmbvc0ru000113b766n6zew28" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>CNN</em></a>.</p>
<p>Katz said the Iranian leadership had crossed a red line by firing at “civilians” and would “pay a heavy price for it”.</p>
<p>Smoke was billowing above skyscrapers in downtown Tel Aviv, an <em>AFP</em> journalist reported, as Iran’s Revolutionary Guard said it had attacked dozens of targets in Israel.</p>
<p>Israel’s firefighting service said its teams were responding to the aftermath of Iranian missile strikes, including working to rescue people trapped in a high-rise building.</p>
<p>Resident Chen Gabizon told <em>AFP</em> he ran to an underground shelter after receiving an alert notification.</p>
<p>“After a few minutes, we just heard a very big explosion, everything was shaking, smoke, dust, everything was all over the place,” he said.</p>

<p>Iran had confirmed that above-ground sections of the Natanz enrichment plant had been destroyed, but the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said radiation levels outside the site “remained unchanged”.</p>
<p>“Most of the damage is on the surface level,” said Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI) spokesperson Behrouz Kamalvandi.</p>
<p>There was only limited damage to the Fordow and Isfahan nuclear sites, Iran said.</p>
<p>It said that its Fordow nuclear facility sustained limited damage following recent attacks, the semi-official <em>ISNA</em> news agency reported today, citing a spokesperson for the country’s atomic energy organisation.</p>
<p>“There has been limited damage to some areas at the Fordow enrichment site,” Kamalvandi said.</p>
<p>“We had already moved a significant part of the equipment and materials out, and there was no extensive damage and there are no contamination concerns.”</p>
<p>However, an Israeli military official claimed the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites were significantly damaged due to Israeli strikes, according to <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>The official said that it would take more than a few weeks for Iran to repair damage at the two sites.</p>
<p>Dozens of people took to the streets of Tehran overnight to cheer their country’s military response, with some waving national flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <em>IRNA</em> said the country’s forces downed two Israeli fighter jets during a massive Israeli air raid, although Israel denied this.</p>
<p>Iranian outlets <em><a class="link--external" href="https://en.mehrnews.com/news/233090/Iran-detains-Israeli-female-fighter-jet-pilot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mehr</a></em> and <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/06/13/3334885/iran-s-air-defenses-down-2-israeli-warplanes-female-pilot-captured" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tasnim</a></em> also reported that a female Israeli pilot was captured.

<p>“No flights will be operated at any airports in the country in order to protect the safety of passengers… until further notice,” the news agency said.</p>
<p>Israel’s Ben Gurion International Airport was also closed until further notice, a spokeswoman said. “There is no date or day set to reopen the airport,” airport spokeswoman Lisa Diver told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s attacks prompted several countries in the region to temporarily ground air traffic, though on Saturday morning, Jordan reopened its airspace.</p>

<p>After a day of back-and-forth bombardments, Pope Leo appealed on Saturday for authorities in Iran and Israel to act with “reason” after recent airstrikes and to pursue dialogue.</p>
<p>He told an audience in St. Peter’s Basilica he was following the situation with “great concern”. “In such a delicate moment, I strongly wish to renew an appeal to responsibility and to reason,” said the pope.</p>
<p>“The commitment to building a safer world free from the nuclear threat must be pursued through respectful encounters and sincere dialogue to build a lasting peace, founded on justice, fraternity, and the common good,” he said.</p>
<p>“No one should ever threaten the existence of another,” said Leo. “It is the duty of all countries to support the cause of peace, initiating paths of reconciliation and promoting solutions that guarantee security and dignity for all.”</p>
<p>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also called for the two nations to cease fire.</p>
<p>“Enough escalation. Time to stop. Peace and diplomacy must prevail,” he <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/antonioguterres/status/1933663677619519743" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X earlier today.</p>

<p>US officials said they were helping Israel defend against the missile attacks, even as Washington insisted it had nothing to do with Israel’s strikes on Iran.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump agreed on a call with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer that “dialogue and diplomacy” were needed to calm the crisis, Starmer’s office said.</p>
<p>Trump also spoke with Netanyahu on Friday, US officials said, without elaborating.</p>
<p>Iran’s missile salvo came hours after Israel said its widespread air raids had killed several top Iranian generals, including most of the senior leadership of the IRGC’ air force.</p>
<p>It had launched several rounds of strikes that hit about 200 targets, including nuclear facilities and air bases.</p>
<p>Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to bring Israel “to ruin” during a televised address.</p>

<p>In Israel, Netanyahu issued a statement calling on the Iranian public to unite against their own government. But he also warned more attacks were coming.</p>
<p>“In the past 24 hours, we have taken out top military commanders, senior nuclear scientists, the Islamic regime’s most significant enrichment facility and a large portion of its ballistic missile arsenal,” Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Iran said the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906722">dialogue</a> with the US over Tehran’s nuclear programme is “meaningless” after Israel’s biggest-ever military strike against its longstanding enemy, but said it is yet to decide on whether to attend <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">planned talks</a> on Sunday.</p>
<p>“The other side (the US) acted in a way that makes dialogue meaningless. You cannot claim to negotiate and at the same time divide work by allowing the Zionist regime (Israel) to target Iran’s territory,” state media quoted foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei as saying on Saturday.</p>
<p>“It is still unclear what decision we will make on Sunday in this regard,” Baghaei was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>He said Israel “succeeded in influencing” the diplomatic process and the Israeli attack would not have happened without Washington’s permission, accusing Washington of supporting the attack.</p>

<p>Iran earlier accused the US of being complicit in Israel’s attacks, but Washington denied the allegation and told Tehran at the United Nations Security Council that it would be “wise” to negotiate over its nuclear programme.</p>
<p>Tehran said Washington would be “responsible for consequences” as the US warned Iran not to attack its personnel or interests, stressing that it was not involved in the Israeli attacks.</p>
<p>The conflict raised questions as to whether Sunday’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">sixth round of talks</a> planned between the US and Iran to seek a deal on Iran’s nuclear programme would go ahead in Oman.</p>
<p>Iran has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a> that its uranium enrichment programme is for anything other than civilian purposes, rejecting allegations from the US and Israel that it is secretly developing nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Netanyahu claimed Israeli intelligence had concluded that Iran was approaching the “point of no return” on its nuclear programme. Israel had called for global action after the IAEA accused Iran on Thursday of non-compliance with its obligations.</p>
<p>Iran currently enriches uranium to 60 per cent, far above the 3.67pc limit set by a largely moribund <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1194411">2015 agreement</a> with major powers, but still short of the 90pc threshold needed for a nuclear warhead.</p>

<p>After months of urging Israel not to strike Iran while he worked toward a nuclear deal, Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-tells-reuters-its-unclear-if-iran-still-has-nuclear-program-2025-06-13/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Reuters</em></a> in a phone interview on Friday that he and his team had known the attacks were coming — and still saw room for an accord.</p>
<p>“We knew everything, and I tried to save Iran [from] humiliation and death. I tried to save them very hard because I would have loved to have seen a deal worked out,” Trump said.</p>
<p>“They can still work out a deal, however, it’s not too late,” he added.</p>
<p>Trump’s shifting stance around the Israeli strikes, which he called “<a class="link--external" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-tells-abc-israel-strikes-iran-excellent-warns/story?id=122807155" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">excellent</a>” and “<a class="link--external" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/12/politics/trump-israel-iran-strike#:~:text=called%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20strikes%20on%20Iran%20overnight%20%E2%80%9Ca%20very%20successful%20attack" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">very successful</a>” in a series of media interviews on Friday, offered one of the most striking examples yet of how he conducts high-stakes negotiations through both frank public rhetoric and behind-the-scenes maneuovers.</p>

            <p><p>India’s government is urgently inspecting all Boeing 787s after a devastating Air India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916728/air-india-flight-with-242-onboard-crashes-near-ahmedabad-airport">crash</a> that claimed at least 279 lives this week, the country’s aviation minister said on Saturday, adding that the authorities were investigating all possible causes.</p>
<p>The aviation regulator on Friday ordered Air India to conduct additional maintenance checks on its Boeing 787-8/9 aircraft equipped with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917018">GEnx engines</a>, including assessments of certain take-off parameters, electronic engine control tests and engine fuel-related checks.</p>
<p>“We have also given the order to do the extended surveillance of the 787 planes. There are 34 in our Indian fleet,” aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu told a media briefing in New Delhi, without saying if the checks will apply to all Indian airlines.</p>
<p>“Eight have already been inspected and with immediate urgency, all of them are going to be done.” Air India operates 33 Boeing 787s, while rival airline IndiGo has one, according to data from Flightradar24.</p>
<p>The planes, however, have not been grounded, but a source on Friday told <em>Reuters</em> the Indian government was considering that as an option.</p>
<p>Naidu also said the government will look at all possible theories of what led to the crash.</p>
<p>Air India and the Indian government were looking at several aspects of the crash, including issues linked to its engine thrust, flaps, and why the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916797/did-wing-flaps-or-landing-gear-play-a-role-in-crash">landing gear</a> remained open as the plane took off and then came down, <em>Reuters</em> has reported.</p>
<p>Forensic teams are still looking for the second black box as they probe why the plane lost height and crashed straight after takeoff.</p>
<p>The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner with 242 people on board bound for Britain’s Gatwick Airport began losing height seconds after take-off on Thursday and erupted in a fireball as it hit buildings below, in what has been the world’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916894">worst aviation disaster</a> in a decade.</p>
<p>At least 270 bodies have been recovered from the site of the plane crash, Dhaval Gameti, president of the Junior Doctors Association at B.J. Medical College, told reporters.</p>
<p>Only one of the 242 passengers and crew onboard survived while others were killed as the plane struck the medical college’s hostel as it came down.</p>
<p>The crisis has cast a shadow on Air India, which has for years struggled to rebuild its reputation and revamp its fleet after the Tata Group took over the airline from the Indian government in 2022. Tata’s chairman said on Friday the group wants to understand what happened, but “we don’t know right now”.</p>
<p>Dozens of anxious family members have been waiting outside an Ahmedabad hospital to collect bodies of loved ones killed in the crash, as doctors were working overtime to gather dental samples from the deceased to run identification checks and DNA profiling.</p>

<p>Another father was upset about not being able to get the body of his son, Harshad Patel, saying he was told by authorities it would take 72 hours for DNA profiling. “The authorities are trying to help, but our patience is running out,” he said.</p>
<p>Most bodies in the crash were badly charred, and authorities are using dental samples to run identification checks.</p>
<p>Jaishankar Pillai, a forensic dentist, told reporters on Friday they had the dental records of 135 charred victims, which can then be matched through reference to victims’ prior dental charts, radiographs or other records.</p></p>
