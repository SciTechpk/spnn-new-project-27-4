            <p><p>A Balochistan Constabulary acting deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and a constable were martyred and two others suffered injuries on Friday when unidentified gunmen opened fire on their vehicle on National Highway in the Mastung district, provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind said.</p>
<p>There has been an increase in the frequency of attacks against security forces in Balochistan in recent times. In April, three policemen were martyred and at least 16 others were injured in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904388">blast</a> that targeted a vehicle of the Balochistan Constabulary on Mastung’s Dasht Road.</p>
<p>According to Rind’s statement, “A police convoy coming from Kalat to Quetta was targeted by terrorists.”</p>
<p>“Acting DSP Inspector Abdul Razzaq and Constable Raza Muhammad Jam were martyred in the attack, while Constable Taj Muhammad and Constable Khursheed Ahmed were injured,” he said.</p>
<p>Rind further said that the dead bodies and injured personnel were transferred to Quetta by helicopter.</p>
<p>He continued, “Terrorist incidents are a manifestation of the despair of the enemies of peace. The morale of the people of Balochistan and the security forces cannot be diminished.”</p>
<p>“A formal investigation into the attack has been launched, and the elements involved will be brought to justice,” he added.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MOIofficialGoP/status/1946184457519612385" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from his office, extending his condolences and assailing <em>Fitna-Al-Hindustan</em> — a term the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525#:~:text=Govt%20designates%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20for%20terrorist%20groups%20in%20Balochistan">uses</a> for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan.</p>

<p>Earlier today, the spokesperson said that one Balochistan Constabulary officer was martyred and three others were injured in the incident.</p>
<p>“According to initial reports, the acting DSP’s vehicle was targeted,” Rind said in a statement.</p>
<p>The assailants opened fire on the vehicle near the Choto area of Mastung on the National Highway, the statement elaborated.</p>
<p>Rind stated that “a search operation is underway to apprehend the assailants, and security forces have been dispatched to the site of the attack”.</p>
<p>The injured officers were immediately rushed to Shaheed Nawab Ghaus Bakhsh Hospital in Quetta, he added.</p>
<p>On July 16, three people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924597">killed</a> and seven others were injured as a passenger bus was fired upon in Balochistan’s Kalat. Earlier this month, three cops were injured in an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922575/3-cops-injured-in-blast-on-highway-police-vehicle-in-balochistans-nasirabad">attack</a> on a highway police vehicle in Balochistan’s Nasirabad District.</p>
<p>In a separate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923165">incident</a> on July 9, unknown attackers hurled a grenade at a police checkpoint at the Sibi-Harnai railway crossing gate. The grenade exploded at the post, but no injuries were reported.</p>
<p>On June 21, two personnel of the Frontier Corps were martyred and four were injured in a bomb attack in Kalat’s Mongochar area.</p></p>

            <p><p>Security forces have foiled an infiltration attempt by terrorists along the Pak-Afghan border and arrested five “alleged suicide bombers”, state-run <em>PTV News</em> reported on Friday.</p>
<p>Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">witnessed</a> an uptick in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>“Pakistani security forces have foiled an infiltration attempt by <em>Khawarij</em> along the Pak-Afghan border,” <em>PTV News</em> reported, citing security sources.</p>
<p><em>Khawarij</em> is a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna">term</a> the state uses to refer to terrorists.</p>
<p><em>PTV</em> said, quoting security sources, that on July 17, at around 5pm, <em>Khawarij</em> tried to cross the border and enter Pakistan, but the forces, on receiving immediate information, set up checkpoints at various places and prevented them from proceeding ahead with their attempt.</p>
<p>“The <em>Khawarij</em> advanced towards Azizkhel and Mandikhel, but due to the heavy presence of security forces, they were forced to take refuge in the mosque in Besikhel, where the forces immediately surrounded them and forced them to surrender,” the state broadcaster said.</p>
<p>All five suspects arrested are Afghan citizens aged between 15 and 18. Three of them also have Afghan identity cards. They have been shifted to an undisclosed location for further interrogation.</p>
<p>Security authorities have issued an alert in the border areas and are continuing search operations to stop potential terrorists, <em>PTV</em> added.</p>
<p>“Security sources say that India is giving full support to the <em>Khawarij</em> separatist movement to fuel terrorism in Pakistan,” <em>PTV News</em> said.</p>

<p>A police assistant sub-inspector (ASI) and a constable were injured when the Meryan police station in KP’s Bannu area was struck by terrorists with a quadcopter drone today.</p>
<p>Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told <em>Dawn.com</em> that this was the sixth time the police station was attacked by quadcopters, resulting in injuries to two police officials.</p>
<p>“The injured ASI and police constable were moved to the district headquarters hospital for medical assistance,” DPO Kulachi said, adding that Meryan police station was “crucial for combating terrorists in the district”.</p>
<p>The DPO said that terrorists had started using quadcopters to target police infrastructure and personnel.</p>
<p>“National unity and support are significantly needed to fight collectively against the terrorists and eliminate them,” the DPO said “Police alone cannot handle them without the cooperation of the public.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month, security forces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922232/30-terrorists-killed-as-forces-thwart-border-breach">foiled</a> an infiltration attempt from Afghanistan by an “Indian proxy”, killing at least 30 terrorists in North Waziristan district, ISPR had said.</p>
<p>On July 9, security forces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908178">killed</a> eight militants attempting to infiltrate from Afghanistan into Bajaur district.</p>
<p>Official sources said the militants were killed in Lowi Mamund tehsil after they tried to cross into the district from Afghanistan’s Kunar province.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921445">witnessed</a> a slight overall decline in militant violence during June 2025 despite several high-profile attacks, according to data released by an Islamabad-based think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss).</p>
<p>The monthly security assessment shows there were a total of 78 militant attacks across the country in June, resulting in at least 100 fatalities, including 53 security personnel, 39 civilians, six militants, and two members of peace committees, the organisation said in a press statement.</p></p>

            <p><p>Flooding at Punjab’s Kalabagh and Chashma on the Indus river reached a “medium” level on Friday, prompting the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) to issue a high-level flood warning for the two points, as water flows surged due to heavy monsoon rains.</p>
<p>Rescue operations continued in Punjab after recent deadly rains wreaked havoc and claimed at least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924761/section-144-imposed-across-punjab-emergency-in-parts-as-rains-claim-dozens-of-lives-in-past-24-hours">63 lives</a> across the province. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has forecasted that five more such spells of rain are expected in the coming days, leading to rising water levels, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-directs-ndma-ministers-for-climate-planning-to-prepare-comprehensive-disaster-management-plans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The next spell is expected to begin from July 21 and last till July 28, while the fifth is expected in the first week of August, the sixth in the second week of August and the seventh in its third week.</p>
<p>“The flow of water in rivers is increasing due to monsoon rains and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660">glacial melting</a>,” a statement issued by the PDMA spokesperson said.</p>
<p>According to the data released by the Met Office’s <a class="link--external" href="https://ffd.pmd.gov.pk/home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Flood Forecasting Division</a> at 4pm, there was a medium-level flood at Kalabagh and Chashma Barrage with falling water inflow and outflow at the former, and rising flows at the latter.</p>
<p>There was a low-level flood at Tarbela Dam, as well as at Guddu and Sukkur barrages in Sindh, as of 12pm. While the water inflows and outflows were falling at Tarbela and Guddu, they were rising steady at Sukkur.</p>

<p>In view of the situation, the PDMA issued a warning for an expected high-level flood at Kalabagh and Chashma during the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>“Activate flood monitoring and early warning systems,” the advisory said. It also ordered authorities to strengthen embankments, establish relief and medical camps, as well as stockpile essential medicines and food.</p>
<p>In a statement, the PDMA urged residents living alongside the rivers to evacuate the areas with their cattle. “The Punjab government will fully take care of you and your livestock,” PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Alerts had been issued to the Sargodha and Dera Ghazi Khan commissioners as well as the deputy commissioners of Mianwali, Layyah, Bhakkar, Kot Addu, Rajanpur and Muzaffargarh.</p>
<p>It directed the local administration, the agricultural, health, wildlife, livestock and transport departments, and Rescue 1122 to remain alert and be fully prepared. The PDMA stressed to ensure ample fuel stock for rescue operations.</p>

<p>Flood level at Kalabagh has been moderate since at least 6am, according to data issued by the PDMA earlier today.</p>
<p>In a statement, the authority said that the water levels at the Ravi, Chenab, and Sutlej rivers were normal, as well as those at Dera Ghazi Khan’s irrigation system.</p>
<p>“The water level in Mangla Dam is 47 per cent and 79pc in Tarbela, whereas the water levels in Indian dams on Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi are up to 36pc,” said the statement.</p>
<p>According to the NDMA’s <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndma.gov.pk/sitrepm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>, monsoon rains since June 26 have killed 181 people across the country and injured 491 people.</p>
<p>The majority of casualties were recorded in Punjab, the country’s most populous province, with 103 deaths and 385 injuries. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 40 fatalities, Sindh 20, Balochistan 16 and one death each in Azad Kashmir and Islamabad.</p>

<p>Detailing the PDMA’s rescue efforts in a statement, he said that “more than 1,000 people were rescued along the Potohar plateau, including 398 citizens in Jhelum, 209 in Chakwal, and 450 in Rawalpindi”.</p>
<p>“No loss of life has been reported yet due to anyone getting caught in the floodwater,” Kathia claimed.</p>

<p>DG PDMA stressed that “monsoon rains are predicted to be more than usual this year”, vowing that all resources would be utilised to protect citizens.</p>
<p>Separately, in a statement issued by its spokesperson, Farooq Ahmad, Punjab Rescue 1122 detailed the casualties and damages that occurred due to the recent monsoon rains since June 25.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 stated that most of the casualties occurred in house collapse incidents  — 351 since June 25 — due to dilapidated buildings. It recorded 61 traffic accidents, 22 electrocutions and four lightning incidents, among others.</p>
<p>According to the statement, 15,000 rescue personnel were on high alert across Punjab with 800 boats.</p>
<p>Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the NDMA and the climate and planning ministers to engage the provinces for a comprehensive disaster management plan based on the lessons learnt from this year’s devastating rains and cloudburst events.</p></p>
