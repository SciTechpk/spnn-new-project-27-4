            <p><p>Six Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel were injured in a “terrorist attack” at a checkpoint in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Wednesday, a police spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Bannu Police spokesperson Aamir Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “Terrorists attacked a Frontier Constabulary checkpoint situated in the border area of Takhti Khel Wazir in Bannu.</p>
<p>“As a result of the attack, six personnel of the FC were injured, but the immediate response of the constabulary forced the terrorists to flee.”</p>

<p>Aamir added that the injured constables have been taken to the Combined Military Hospital in Bannu for treatment.</p>
<p>“Police teams have been sent to the area and have begun a search operation to track down the terrorists,” he said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">surge</a> in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces.</p>
<p>Attacks increased after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">broke</a> a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a>, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773/3-terrorists-killed-during-joint-operation-in-kps-bannu-police">this month</a>.</p>
<p>A day ago, a police official identified as Constable Hayatullah was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925895/police-constable-martyred-in-bannu-terrorist-attack">martyred</a> when terrorists attacked him in the district while he was returning home from duty.</p>
<p>On July 21, over a dozen terrorists <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1925535">attacked</a> a police station in the Bakkakhel town of Bannu. However, the cops responded effectively and thwarted their nefarious plan to take over the building. The police also thwarted a sabotage bid by defusing explosives in the Ghoriwala town of Bannu. An official said the explosives were seized during an intelligence-based operation in the area.</p>
<p>On July 19, two police officials, including an officer, were injured when terrorists carried out a quadcopter <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925051">attack</a> on Bannu’s Miryan police station.</p></p>

            <p><p>A 19-year-old girl in Karachi’s Lyari succumbed to her injuries after allegedly enduring sexual abuse at the hands of her husband, police said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the newlywed girl was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922609/newlywed-19-year-old-girl-in-coma-after-alleged-brutal-sexual-violence-by-husband">admitted</a> to Civil Hospital Karachi in critical condition after allegedly enduring “brutal sexual violence” from her husband, who was arrested by the police.</p>
<p>The victim was in a coma and her physical examination findings were “consistent with sexual violence”, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed had stated.</p>
<p>“Ms Shanti, 19, rape victim, passed away at the trauma centre of the Civil Hospital Karachi at 10:45am today,” Syed said today.</p>
<p>She was admitted to the trauma centre in a “critical condition”, having undergone a surgical procedure at another hospital, she added.</p>
<p>“Her initial findings were positive for sexual violence,” she said.</p>
<p>The police surgeon told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the hospital informed police and family to conduct a post-mortem examination of the body and was waiting for their response.</p>
<p>Baghdadi police Station House Officer Majid Alvi also confirmed her death to <em>Dawn.com.</em></p>
<p>He said that the girl got married on June 15. “Two days later, the husband subjected her to sodomy and installed a metal pipe into her body, leading to deterioration of her health condition.”</p>
<p>The brother of the victim had registered a first information report (FIR) at the Baghdadi Police Station on July 5 under Sections 324 (attempt to commit murder) and 376-B (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p>
<p>“On the third day of her marriage, my sister was subjected to brutal sexual violence allegedly by her husband. She remained admitted at a private hospital in the city and was later taken to Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre of Civil Hospital Karachi in a critical condition the other day,” the FIR read.</p>
<p>In the FIR, the complainant said his 19-year-old sister married the suspect on June 15. Her health condition deteriorated on June 30, compelling the family to bring her back home. She informed the parents that on July 17, her husband subjected her to an “unnatural sexual act”.</p>
<p>He said that the husband also sexually assaulted her with a foreign object. Subsequently, the husband subjected her to sexual violence, leading to bleeding. As per the FIR, the suspect threatened his wife with “dire consequences” if she disclosed anything to anyone.</p>

<p>Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1761373">death penalty</a> or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899694/two-arrested-for-kidnap-gang-rape-of-minor-girl-in-bahawalnagar">prevail</a> in the country.</p>
<p>In May, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913717/two-sisters-raped-tortured-in-north-karachi-home">two sisters</a> were subjected to a sexual assault in their home in North Karachi, police and doctors had said.</p>
<p>In April, in a rare verdict, an additional district and sessions judge in Gujranwala handed down <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903932">10-year rigorous imprisonment</a> to a man for subjecting his wife to an unnatural sexual offence.</p></p>

            <p><p>Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry on Wednesday warned the public of a terrorist group using WhatsApp channels to “disseminate hateful content and harmful narratives”, urging the platform and the global community to help Pakistan combat terrorism.</p>
<p>In a post on X, the state minister said the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — designated as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations and the United States — was operating its WhatsApp channels and sending bulk messages to “proliferate its violent/hateful ideology, to spread its harmful narratives, and for glorification of its terror activities”.</p>
<p>The state minister requested the international community and WhatsApp to “cooperate to help us fight this menace”.</p>
<p>“These accounts must be blocked and necessary algorithms created to auto-detect and auto-suspend such handles/numbers,” he added.</p>

<p>On Sept 1, 2010, the US designated the group as a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations#:~:text=September%201%2C%202010,Taliban%20Pakistan%20(TTP)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Foreign Terrorist Organisation</a>, while the UN imposed <a class="link--external" href="https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/en/sanctions/1267/aq_sanctions_list/summaries/entity/tehrik-e-taliban-pakistan-%28ttp%29" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sanctions</a> on the entity on July 29, 2011 due to its affiliation with al-Qaeda. The sanctions include asset freezes, travel bans, and arms embargoes.</p>
<p>Founded in 2007, the TTP has staged a large number of attacks across Pakistan, leading to a ban on the group on August 24, 2008. It remains on the National Counter Terrorism Authority’s (Nacta) <a class="link--external" href="https://www.nacta.gov.pk/functions/counter-terrorism-wing/counter-terrorism/proscribed-organizations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">list</a> of proscribed organisations.</p>
<p>According to <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakpips.com/web/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Overview_PIPS-SR_2021.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data</a> from the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), during the height of its insurgency in 2009, the group carried out 2,586 terrorist attacks and 3,021 fatalities.  A large-scale <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1112909">military offensive</a> launched in 2014 dealt a massive blow to the command and control structure of the group, dramatically reducing insurgent violence throughout Pakistan. Sporadic attacks targeting security forces, however, continued.</p>
<p>After holding several rounds of talks with the group, former prime minister Imran Khan’s government announced on November 8, 2022, that the group had agreed to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1656804">complete ceasefire</a>. In November that year, however, the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">called off</a> the ceasefire, vowing to increase attacks on police and security personnel.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>With the resurgence of the group, the country has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925209">witnessed</a> an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, mainly conducted by the TTP.</p>
<p>In July last year, the government designated the group as <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em>, while mandating all institutions to use the term <em>khariji</em> (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan. In Islamic history, the term <a class="link--external" href="https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/document/obo-9780195390155/obo-9780195390155-0047.xml#:~:text=The%20Kharijites%20believed%20it%20was,those%20who%20disagreed%20with%20their" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">refers</a> to the period of conflict and discord caused by the <em>Khawarij</em>, an early Islamic sect known for their extreme interpretations of Islam and their rebellion against established authority.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075">ranks second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>
<p>In December last year, the Pakistan Army said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881429#:~:text=Record%2Dhigh%20terrorists,fight%20against%20terrorism.">conducted</a> 59,775 operations against terrorists.</p></p>
