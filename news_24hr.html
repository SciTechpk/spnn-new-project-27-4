            <p><p>• Leaders say millions of farmers are ready to court arrest, but will not pay the tax<br />
• Sindh Chamber of Agriculture vows to move court or go for some other crops</p>
<p>HYDERABAD: Sindh Chamber of Agriculture (SCA) has announced that it will challenge the 45pc <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889589">agricultural income tax</a> in court. It described the tax as ‘unconstitutional, illegal and unethical’, and asked its members and farmers across Sindh to boycott wheat cultivation this year.</p>
<p>The decision was taken at meeting of the chamber held here on Tuesday under the chairmanship of its patron-in-chief, Dr Syed Nadeem Qamar.</p>
<p>The meeting rejected the tax and claimed that it was imposed under directives of the Inter­national Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>The farmers who attended the meeting argued that they were not receiving fair prices for their produce and, as such, there was no justification for the imposition of such a tax.</p>
<p>The meeting asked farmers across Sindh not to pay the tax, and warned that if government resorted to arrest them for on this disobedience, millions of other farmers would also court arrest. “We are ready to face imprisonment, but will not pay the agricultural income tax,” farmers’ leaders at the meeting declared.</p>
<p>The participants announced a complete boycott of agricultural income tax and asked the government for the exemptions similar to those given to industrialists.</p>
<p>The SCA told farmers to boycott wheat cultivation for the 2025-26 season on the ground that they were not getting adequate support prices.</p>
<p>The farmers vowed to go for growing alternative crops, such as mustard, nigella (kalonji), sunflower and other oilseeds instead. They said that due to very low wheat prices, they could not even recover the cost of production, and this year will be marked as a ‘boycott year’ for wheat cultivation.</p>
<p><strong>Decline in cotton production</strong></p>
<p>The chamber expressed its deep concern over 40pc decline in cotton production, estimating that the yield would not exceed four million bales. It said farmers were receiving only Rs6,500 per maund for cotton although the Sindh agriculture minister had promised Rs11,000 per ma­und which did not materialise.</p>
<p>SCA demanded withdrawal of the 18pc local <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902837">tax</a> on cotton and imposition of a 25pc tax on imported cotton to discourage imports this promoting local production. It expressed its concern over rising cost of agricultural inputs, citing a Rs22 per liter increase in diesel prices and Rs600 per bag increase in DAP fertiliser over the last 15 days.</p>
<p>It said that skyrocketing prices of essential agricultural inputs were crippling farmers, especially since they were not receiving fair prices for their produce. These developments, it warned, indicated a deliberate destruction of agricultural sector. It demanded immediate rollback of increased prices of diesel, fertilisers, seeds, pesticides and other agricultural inputs.</p>
<p>The chamber urged farmers to contact their respective mukhtiarkars (administrative officers) and related officials to get themselves registered for the Benazir Hari Card. It demanded that the subsidy of Rs10,000 per acre, currently available to sunflower and canola crops, be extended to mustard and rapeseed crops as well.</p>
<p>The meeting was attended by Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority Chairman Kabool Khatian, general secretary Zahid Bhurgari, Nabi Bux Sathio, Shahnawaz Khan Jamali, Asghar Khan Noonari, Murad Ali Khan Nizamani, Sikander Ali Sariwal, Bilal Khan Laghari, Abdul Karim Talpur and others.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925963/trade-gap-with-neighbours-widens-29pc-in-fy25' target='_blank'><strong>Trade gap with neighbours widens 29pc in FY25</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s trade deficit with nine neighbouring countries expanded by 29.42 per cent in FY25, rising to $12.297 billion compared to $9.502bn in the preceding year.</p>
<p>Exports registered notable growth to Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Sri Lanka, largely attributed to recent shifts in the regional political landscape. However, trade relations with these countries have remained strained in recent years, primarily due to challenges stemming from restrictive government policies.</p>
<p>Despite the uptick in exports, the overall trade gap with regional partners widened, driven predominantly by increased imports from China, India, and Bangladesh during the months under review.</p>
<p>In FY24, the trade deficit with these countries was $9.506bn, up 49pc from $6.382bn in the preceding year.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw a hefty growth in July-June FY25. Still, exports to other countries, especially China, continued to decline during the period, according to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.</p>
<p>The value of Pakistan’s exports to nine countries — Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives — rose 1.49pc to $4.401bn in July-June FY25 from $4.336bn over the same period last year.</p>
<p>Contrary to this, imports surged 20.66pc to $16.698bn in FY25 from $13.838bn over the same period of the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>Further analysis showed that imports from China grew by 20.79pc to $16.312bn in FY25 from $13.504bn over the same period last year. In FY24, imports from China totalled $13.506bn, up by 39.78pc from $9.662bn over the previous year. The bulk of imports in the region are sourced from China, with partial contributions from India and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s exports to China dipped 8.6pc to $2.476bn in FY25 from $2.709bn over the same months in the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<p>Imports from India increased pc to $220.58m in FY25 from $206.89m over the last year. In FY24, imports from India rose 6.62pc to $206.89m — up from $190.04m in the same period last year. Meanwhile, exports to India remained at $1.43m in FY25. Exports to India totalled $3.669m in FY24 against $0.329m in the same period the previous year.</p>
<p>Exports to Afghanistan increased 38.68pc to $773.89m in FY25 from $558.03m last year. Imports stood at $25.89m against $11.96 in FY24, a growth of 116.47pc. Pakistan’s main exports to Afghanistan include sugar in the current fiscal year. In the past four months, Pakistan has exported more than 700,000 tonnes of sugar, mostly to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>No data is available as most trade with Iran is conducted via informal channels. However, Pakistan has opted for barter trade amid the thriving <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893038">smuggling</a> of Iranian petroleum products and LPG via a porous border of Balochistan.</p>
<p>Exports to Bangladesh increased by 19.08pc to $787.35m in FY25 from $661.19m. Imports grew 38.47pc to $78.31m in FY from $56.55m over the last year. The increase resulted after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245">toppling</a> of the Hasina government in Dhaka. Pakistan has started exporting rice to Bangladesh in the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>Exports to Sri Lanka dropped 4.14pc to $376.61m in FY25 from $392.89m over the last year. This decline in exports to Sri Lanka occurred following the recession in economic activity.</p>

            <p><p>LAHORE: An important meeting of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) is being held on Thursday in Dhaka where Pakistan’s participation in this year’s Asia Cup in India will come under discussion.</p>
<p>Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi as the head of the ACC was expected to leave for Dhaka on Tuesday night to head the said meeting.</p>
<p>The ACC meeting is considered important, particularly in the backdrop of the the Asia Cup, scheduled to be held in India in the month of September.</p>
<p>According to reports, no official of the BCCI will visit Bangladesh to attend the ACC meeting. There are also media reports that Sri Lanka, Oman and Afghanistan may also not attend.</p>
<p>Though the Asia Cup is an impo­rtant continental event, due to strained political relations between India and Pakis­tan, particularly after the military encounter between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May this year, the fate of the said competition is hanging in the balance.</p>
<p>On its part, the BCCI has said that the political relations between India and Bangladesh are not normal. Therefore, the ACC meeting should be shifted from there to any other venue. But the ACC did not change the venue.</p>
<p>Whether Pakistan visit India for the Asia Cup or a hybrid model will be followed — which was adopted for the ICC events — is yet to be decided.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879734">hybrid model</a>, both India and Pakistan agreed to play their respective matches of ICC events — like the World Cups and the Champions Trophy — on neutral venues.</p>
