            <p><p>Incarcerated PTI founder and ex-prime minister Imran Khan has decried the lack of any “meaningful momentum” for the party’s planned <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922952/imran-shuns-dialogue-plans-nationwide-protest">August 5 protest</a> and ordered its members to immediately shun all their differences.</p>
<p>Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. He has issued a nationwide protest call, which will reach its “peak” on Aug 5 to mark the second year of his incarceration in multiple cases.</p>
<p>However, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur appeared to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924027">disrupt</a> the nationwide protest plans and sow confusion by introducing a new 90-day timeline for what he described as ‘a final push’. PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik later voiced her reservations about his announcement.</p>
<p>The resulting discord in the party leadership and ranks had prompted Imran to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924606/imran-prohibits-pti-members-from-going-public-with-partys-internal-matters">prohibit</a> his party members from publicly discussing the party’s internal matters.</p>
<p>In a post today on his X account — which is not operated by Imran himself — a message said to be sent on his behalf stated: “Let me make this absolutely clear: every member of the party must immediately set aside all internal differences and focus solely on the movement planned for August 5th. I do not see any meaningful momentum building behind this initiative at present. I am waging a battle against a 78-year-old system, and my greatest success is that despite unprecedented oppression, the public stands firmly with me.”</p>
<p>The message said the people had expressed their trust in the PTI by voting for it in the general elections, even in the absence of an electoral symbol.</p>
<p>“After such a clear mandate, it is the moral and political responsibility of every party member to become the voice of the people. It will be nothing short of disgraceful and condemnable if PTI leaders waste time on internal conflicts at this critical juncture.</p>
<p>“Anyone found engaging in factionalism within the party will be expelled. I am fighting for the future of our generations and every sacrifice I make is for that cause. To create rifts within the party at this time would be a direct betrayal of my mission and vision,” the message warned.</p>

<p>Lashing out at the government, the message said it had “crippled the judiciary” through the 26th Constitutional Amendment.</p>

<p>“The way biased judges are now delivering blatantly unjust verdicts under these courts is visible to the entire nation. We must launch a robust campaign to liberate the judiciary, for no nation can survive, let alone progress, without judicial independence.”</p>
<p>The message claimed “inhumane conditions” were being imposed upon Imran’s spouse and former first lady Bushra Bibi while the PTI founder’s conditions were themselves not good.</p>
<p>“I am enduring the harshest prison term in the country’s history solely for the supremacy of the Constitution and in service of my nation. The level of oppression and authoritarianism is such that even the water I have for ablution is filthy and contaminated with dirt, unfit for any human being.”</p>
<p>Separately, a post from PTI’s central deputy information secretary said the nationwide protest would be led under the banner of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP).</p>
<p>“All provincial organisations will follow their respective plans of action based on their circumstances.”</p>

<p>Addressing a press conference with other TTAP leaders, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said the first step of the protest movement would be an all-party conference in Islamabad on July 31 and the decisions taken then would shape the future plan of action.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Imran’s sons continued their engagements in the United States, where they currently are before visiting Pakistan for their father.</p>
<p>They met Republican Congressman Joe Wilson of South Carolina who had introduced a bipartisan bill in the US House of Representatives in March, calling for sanctions on Pakistani state functionaries over alleged human rights violations, including the “persecution” of their father.</p>

<p>They also met US Congressman Brad Sherman.</p>
<p>“I am concerned to hear that Khan remains isolated from his family, friends, attorneys and doctors. His sons also shared that his physical health may be deteriorating.

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday appreciated the World Bank’s (WB) support for Pakistan’s position in light of India’s suspension of the <a class="link--external" href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTs/Volume%20419/volume-419-I-6032-English.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Indus Waters Treaty</a> (IWT).</p>
<p>In April, India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">held</a> the IWT in abeyance following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">“act of war”</a>, noting that the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension.</p>
<p>In a meeting with the WB’s regional vice president for the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan (MENAAP), Ousmane Dione, in Islamabad, the premier acknowledged the institution’s principled support for Pakistan’s legitimate position on India’s “unilateral and unlawful actions”, which undermined “important international agreements” such as the IWT.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to upholding international law, achieving prosperity, maintaining regional peace and reiterated the country’s resolve to resolve all issues through dialogue.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The prime minister further thanked the WB for its timely and generous assistance during the devastating floods of 2022, which helped Pakistan initiate immediate relief efforts and begin reconstruction and rehabilitation activities.</p>
<p>He especially thanked World Bank President Ajay Banga and former country director for Pakistan Najy Benhassine for their pivotal role in advancing the new country partnership framework (CPF) for Pakistan.</p>
<p>In January, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885518">became</a> the first country to launch a longer-term CPF with the WB, after the bank’s board of directors approved the 10-year programme and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885337">pledged</a> to provide $20 billion to Pakistan.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>PM Shehbaz appreciated the strategic role of the CPF in supporting Pakistan’s development priorities, particularly in the areas of energy, human capital, climate change, and governance reforms.</p>
<p>Dione expressed gratitude to the premier for the warm hospitality extended during his visit to Pakistan.</p>

<p>He reaffirmed the WB’s commitment to deepening and expanding its longstanding partnership with Pakistan and enhancing collaboration in key sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>Dione appreciated Pakistan’s ongoing macroeconomic recovery and praised the prime minister’s government for steering the country toward financial stability and sustainable growth.</p>
<p>He particularly commended the current administration’s reform agenda, noting the premier’s strong leadership in advancing institutional reforms, restoring investor confidence, and promoting inclusive economic development.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz and Dione expressed a shared commitment to further strengthening cooperation in the coming years, to achieve long-term development goals and build a prosperous future for the people of Pakistan.</p></p>

            <p><p>Ratings agency S&amp;P Global raised Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating to ‘B-’ from ‘CCC+’ and placed it on a ‘stable’ outlook on Thursday, saying the country’s finances and reserves had been stabilised by International Monetary Fund (IMF) support.</p>
<p>“The stable outlook reflects our expectations that continued economic recovery and government efforts to enhance revenue will stabilise fiscal and debt metrics,” S&amp;P said in a statement on the move.</p>
<p>“We also expect that sustained official financing will support Pakistan in meeting its external obligations, and that the country will continue to roll over its commercial credit lines over the next 12 months.”</p>
<p>Pakistan’s longer-dated international bonds rallied after the upgrade, with the 2051 maturity gaining 1.6 cents to be bid at 84.85 cents on the dollar, according to Tradeweb data.</p>
<p>The 2031 and 2036 maturities also gained around 1 cent, while shorter-dated maturities posted smaller gains.</p>
<p>Last week, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924444">urged</a> the leading US rating agency — Moody’s — to improve Pakistan’s credit rating and help its return to international capital markets at favourable conditions.</p>
<p>Moody’s had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855270">upgraded</a> Paki­stan’s credit rating by one notch in August 2024 to Caa2 from Caa3 (<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1739609">downgraded</a> in February 2023 due to suspension of the IMF programme) and changed its outlook to positive from stable for improving macroeconomic conditions, including liquidity and external position from very weak levels.</p>
<p>Global ratings agency Fitch had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904417">upgraded</a> Pakistan’s foreign currency credit rating to ‘B-’ from ‘CCC+’ in April, citing increased confidence in the country’s progress on narrowing its budget deficits.</p></p>
