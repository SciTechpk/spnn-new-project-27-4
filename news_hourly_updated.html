                <h2>Reports of several people drowning in Swat River flash flood, 3 bodies recovered: rescue officials</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>There were reports of several people drowning in the Swat River in a flash flood on Friday morning, with two bodies recovered so far, according to rescue officials.</p>
<p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Disaster Management Authority on Thursday had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920530/kp-pdma-warns-of-glofs-in-five-districts">warned</a> of glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in five districts, including Upper and Lower Chitral, Upper Dir, Swat and Upper Kohistan.</p>
<p>KP Rescue 1122 Director General Shah Fahad said that the bodies of three people have been recovered so far.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe rescue operation is being conducted at five different locations and 80 personnel of Rescue 1122 are participating in the search operation,‚Äù Fahad was quoted as having said in a press release.</p>
<p>Earlier, Swat Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Niaz Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em> that there are reports of several people drowning in the river Swat as massive flooding could be seen.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTwo dead bodies so far recovered and the operation continues for others, but high-level flood is hampering the operation,‚Äù Khan had said.</p>

                <h2>SC‚Äôs Justice Panhwar recuses himself from hearing reserved seats case</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>As the Supreme Court‚Äôs Constitutional Bench resumed hearing review petitions in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914188">reserved seats case</a>, Justice Salahuddin Panhwar recused himself from the bench following an objection from senior counsel Hamid Khan.</p>
<p>In its July 12, 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">short order</a>, eight out of 13 judges ruled that 39 out of a list of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621#:~:text=the%20verdict%20stated.-,List%20of%2080%20MNAs,-The%20verdict%20listed">80 MNAs</a> were and are the returned candidates of the PTI, setting it to emerge as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845532">single largest party</a> in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>However, the ruling had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1868333">not been implemented</a> by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860119">National Assembly</a>, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had raised some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859716">objections</a>. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1846084">PML-N</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847508/ppp-takes-cue-from-pml-n-files-review-petition-on-sc-reserved-seats-verdict">PPP</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850678#:~:text=ECP%20files%20review%20plea">ECP</a>.</p>

<p>An 11-member bench headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan resumed the hearing today.</p>
<p>Justice Panhwar noted that Hamid Khan, counsel for the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), had yesterday raised an objection to the bench.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHamid Khan raised an objection to the inclusion of judges in the bench who came to the Supreme Court after the 26th Amendment in the bench,‚Äù Justice Panhwar said, noting that he is one of the judges included in the objection.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPublic trust in the judiciary is essential,‚Äù Panhwar stated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is essential that no party has any objection to the bench,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is because of these objections that I cannot sit on this bench.‚Äù</p>
<p>The judge told Khan that although he was hurt by his remarks ‚Äî having worked together since 2010 ‚Äî this was not a personal matter.</p>
<p>Khan said he appreciated Panhwar‚Äôs decision.</p>
<p>However, Justice Aminuddin Khan told him that this was not a matter to eb appreciated. ‚ÄúThis is a result of your conduct,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe gave you respect, that‚Äôs why we are listening to you, otherwise we were not under any obligation to hear you,‚Äù Justice Khan said. ‚ÄúWe gave you this opportunity, don‚Äôt misuse it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Following Justice Panhwar‚Äôs recusal, the SIC‚Äôs counsel also objected to a 10-memebr bench taking up the hearing.</p>
<p>To this, Justice Mandokhail questioned under which law the counsel was making this argument.</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail added that the 10-member bench will continue hearing cases.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGiving respect is what gets you respect,‚Äù he told Khan. ‚ÄúWhatever respect you have today is because of the Supreme Court.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúToday we are here, tomorrow we will not be here, you will not be here,‚Äù Justice Mandokhail said.</p>
<p>The SIC counsel told Justice Mandokhail not to use the case if he was angry.</p>
<p>Justice Aminuddin interjected here, asking the SIC counsel what objection he had.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy objection is that a twelve-member bench cannot hear the review of the decision of a thirteen-member bench,‚Äù Khan said.</p>
<p>Justice Aminuddin rejected this objection and asked him to proceed with his arguments.</p>
<p>Here, the debate between Khan and the judges became heated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe SIC lawyer had given his arguments, you had no right to speak,‚Äù Justice Mandokhail said. ‚ÄúWe gave you respect.‚Äù</p>
<p>The SIC counsel responded saying: ‚Äúyou are not authorised to tell me not to speak.‚Äù</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail told Khan that the SIC had appointed Faisal Siddiqui as its lawyer, not him. ‚ÄúYou have 10 minutes to make your argument, otherwise sit down.‚Äù</p>
<p>Khan said: ‚ÄúYou are angry, do not hear the case just now.‚Äù</p>
<p>The conversation continued in a confrontational manner, with Justice Mandokhail telling him to sit down if he does not want to present his arguments.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI know how to do my job, you be careful with your words,‚Äù Justice Mandokhail said. ‚ÄúI have skipped my mother‚Äôs funeral to be here and you are joking.‚Äù</p>
<p><em>More to follow</em></p></p>
