                <h2>PM Shehbaz briefed on country‚Äôs preparations for India ‚Äòthreat‚Äô during visit to ISI HQ</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the headquarters of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) on Tuesday, where he was briefed on the country‚Äôs preparation for a ‚Äúconventional threat‚Äù amid the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586">ongoing tensions</a> with India.</p>
<p>The high-level visit comes nearly a week after Pakistan said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected a military action</a> by India in the wake of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam. India, without investigation or evidence, implied ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack%20were%20brought%20out">cross-border linkages</a>‚Äù of the att¬≠a¬≠¬≠¬≠c¬≠kers. Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">firmly</a> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315/pahalgam-attack-fm-dar-throws-down-gauntlet-to-india-asks-for-evidence-of-allegations-against-pakistan">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe visit entailed a detailed briefing on the prevailing security environment, with a particular focus on preparedness for [a] conventional threat in the light of India‚Äôs increasingly aggressive and provocative posture along Pakistan‚Äôs eastern border,‚Äù a statement from the PM Office (PMO) said.</p>

</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúThe leadership was apprised of regional security developments and the evolving threat matrix, including conventional military options, hybrid warfare tactics and terrorist proxies,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The premier was accompanied by Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and the services chiefs, the PMO said.</p>
<p>The services chiefs ‚Äî Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar ‚Äî were part of the visiting team, according to a group photo released on the occasion.</p>
<p>The picture also showed ISI Director General Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik ‚Äî who was recently appointed as the country‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907660">national security adviser</a> ‚Äî and the military‚Äôs media spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, present there.</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz and the accompanying dignitaries ‚Äúunderscored the imperative of heightened national vigilance, seamless inter-agency coordination, and reinforced operational readiness to deter and decisively respond to any violation of Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity‚Äù, the PMO said.</p>
<p>Commending the ISI‚Äôs ‚Äúprofessionalism and strategic acumen‚Äù, the prime minister lauded its ‚Äúcritical role in safeguarding national interests and enabling informed national security decision-making under complex and dynamic conditions‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan Army is one of the most professional and disciplined force in the world,‚Äù the premier was quoted as saying. He reaffirmed that the entire nation was standing with ‚Äúour brave armed forces‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe leadership reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs unambiguous resolve to defend the homeland against all threats ‚Äî conventional or otherwise,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>The leaders reiterated that with the nation‚Äôs full support, the armed forces, supported by all other elements of national power and state institutions, remained ‚Äúfully prepared to uphold Pakistan‚Äôs security, prestige, and honour under all circumstances‚Äù.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also visited the newly established National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre (NIFTAC) and formally inaugurated its state-of-the-art headquarters, ‚Äúwhich will serve as the central node for coordinating Pakistan‚Äôs national counterterrorism strategy‚Äù, the PMO said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNIFTAC, a federal institution, integrates over 50 relevant federal and provincial departments and agencies into a unified intelligence and threat management architecture supported by a centralised national database.‚Äù</p>
<p>The statement added that at the subnational level, NIFTAC is linked to six Provincial Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centres (PIFTACs), including those in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, ensuring seamless coordination from the federation to the provinces.</p>
<p>Commending the efforts of all stakeholders involved in operationalising this vital capability, the prime minister described NIFTAC as a quintessential national platform for collaborative threat assessment and response. He underscored that ‚Äúdismantling the nexus between terrorism, illicit networks, and external sponsorship requires robust and efficient institutional mechanisms.‚Äù</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said NIFTAC would play a pivotal role in uprooting terrorism and its support structures from the country.</p>
<p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have spiked since the former‚Äôs aggressive measures following the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforced its forces</a> and has conducted two <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908595/pakistan-tests-launch-of-120km-range-fatah-missile-ispr">missile tests</a> in a short span of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908176/pakistan-successfully-tests-launch-of-short-range-abdali-ballistic-missile">three days</a>. On the other hand, India‚Äôs premier has granted ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>‚Äù to his military.</p>

<p>As temperatures remain high, with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war">military</a> warning of a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907785/any-military-misadventure-by-india-will-be-met-with-swift-resolute-notch-up-response-coas">swift</a>‚Äù response to any misadventure by New Delhi, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907930/us-hopes-that-indias-response-to-pahalgam-attack-doesnt-lead-to-broader-regional-conflict-vance">diplomatic channels</a> have remained engaged to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>Pakistan has also taken the matter to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586">United Nations Security Council</a>, which was briefed on the country‚Äôs stance on the Pahalgam attack and India‚Äôs ‚Äúunsubstantiated‚Äù allegations.</p>

<p>Separately, the Foreign Office said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar held a telephonic conversation with Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan Amir Khan Muttaqi who ‚Äúappreciated Pakistan‚Äôs proactive steps to ease trade and facilitate travel‚Äù, amid rising tensions with India.</p>
<p>It added that Muttaqi extended an invitation to Dar to visit Afghanistan again. ‚ÄúHe conveyed prayers and best wishes for the government and people of Pakistan,‚Äù the FO said.</p>
<p>Dar also briefed his Afghan counterpart on recent provocation and ‚Äúillegal and unilateral measures‚Äù by India against Pakistan, reiterating Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to peace and safeguarding its sovereignty.</p>
<p>Both leaders expressed satisfaction with the pace of progress made by the two sides in bilateral relations since the deputy PM‚Äôs visit to Afghanistan on April 19, with a focus on trade, connectivity, economic cooperation, people-to-people contacts and reactivating political consultative mechanisms.</p>
<p>The two sides also agreed on the importance of maintaining high-level contacts for fostering long-term cooperation to promote peace and security in the region and beyond, the statement concluded.</p>

                <h2>7 soldiers martyred in IED blast by ‚ÄòIndian proxy‚Äô terrorists in Balochistan‚Äôs Mach: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Seven soldiers were martyred in a blast from an improvised explosive device planted by ‚ÄúIndian proxy‚Äù terrorists in Balochistan‚Äôs Kacchi district, the military‚Äôs media wing said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7280" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said: ‚ÄúOn May 6, 2025, terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, so-called ‚ÄòBaloch Liberation Army‚Äô, targeted security forces‚Äô vehicle with an improvised explosive device in general area Mach.‚Äù</p>
<p>It said the following seven soldiers were subsequently martyred in the attack: Subedar Umar Farooq, 42, resident of Karachi; Naik Asif Khan, 28, resident of Karak district; Naik Mashkoor Ali, 28, resident of Orakzai district; Sepoy Tariq Nawaz, 26, resident of Lakki Marwat district; Sepoy Wajid Ahmed Faiz, 28, resident of Bagh district; Sepoy Muhammad Asim, 22, resident of Karak district and Sepoy Muhammad Kashif Khan, 28, resident of Kohat district.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNefarious designs of India and its proxies operating on Pakistani soil will be defeated by the valiant security forces, LEAs (law enforcement agencies) and the brave nation of Pakistan,‚Äù the ISPR said.</p>
<p>It added that sanitisation of the area was being carried out to eliminate any terrorists present in the area and the perpetrators of the ‚Äúheinous and cowardly act‚Äù would be brought to justice.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecurity forces of Pakistan, in step with the nation, remain determined to thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan, and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve.‚Äù</p>
<p>Two Pakistan Coast Guards personnel were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908760">injured</a> on Monday when a remote-controlled bomb targeted their patrol vehicle in the Jiwani area, while a Levies official escaped unharmed when his private vehicle was destroyed by a separate roadside bomb in Pishin district.</p>
<p>Last week, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">accused</a> India of activating its ‚Äúassets‚Äù to inte¬≠nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting ‚Äúirr¬≠e¬≠futable evidence‚Äù of Ind¬≠ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind¬≠ian military personnel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPost-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and the independent terrorist cells ‚Ä¶ to increase their activity,‚Äù he had said, using the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Militant violence and security operations intensified in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901722/militant-attacks-in-march-surged-to-highest-level-since-2014">report</a> by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">ranked second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p></p>
