<p>Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards corps said its top commander, Hossein Salami, was <a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85860936/IRGC-s-Chief-Commander-Maj-Gen-Hossein-Salami-assassinated" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">killed</a> and state media reported the unit’s headquarters in Tehran had been hit.</p>

<p>The United States said it had no part in the operation, which raises the risk of a fresh escalation in tensions in the Middle East, a major oil producing region.</p>
<p>Alongside extensive air strikes, Israel’s Mossad spy agency led a series of covert sabotage operations inside Iran, <em>Axios</em> reported, citing a senior Israeli official. These operations were aimed at damaging Irans strategic missile sites and its air defence capabilities.</p>
<p>At least six nuclear scientists were killed in Israel’s attacks, media outlets in the Islamic republic reported.</p>
<p><em>Tasnim</em> news agency named the six scientists including Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, who was the president of the Islamic Azad University of Iran. Fereydoun Abbasi, a former head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, was also among the scientists killed, it added.</p>
<p>The UN nuclear watchdog said that Iranian authorities told it that no increase in radiation levels have been observed at the Natanz uranium enrichment site following Israeli strikes.</p>
<p>“Iranian authorities have informed the IAEA… that no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a post on X, after earlier confirming that the facility was “among targets” of the strikes.</p>
<p>It added that Iran’s only nuclear power plant in the southern port city of Bushehr had not been targeted.</p>

<p>Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport was closed until further notice, and Israel’s air defence units stood at high alert for possible retaliatory strikes from Iran.</p>
<p>“Following the pre-emptive strike by the State of Israel against Iran, a missile and UAV (drone) attack against the State of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate time frame,” Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.</p>
<p>Israeli military Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir said tens of thousands of soldiers had been called up and “prepared across all borders”.</p>
<p>“We are amidst a historic campaign unlike any other. This is a critical operation to prevent an existential threat, by an enemy who is intent on destroying us,” he said.</p>
<p>Israeli Minister Gideon Saar was holding “marathon of calls” with counterparts around the world regarding Israel’s attack on Iran, the foreign ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Pakistan was among several countries and international actors which condemned Israel’s strikes, with the Foreign Office calling it “unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel.”</p>
<p>Jordan and Iraq announced the closure of their airspace and grounded all flights, with Amman vowing it would not allow any violations of its airspace.</p>
<p>“The kingdom’s airspace is temporarily closed, and air traffic suspended for all aircraft – incoming, outgoing and in transit, as a precaution against any risks resulting from the regional escalation,” the Jordanian civil aviation authority said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Jordan has not and will not allow any violation of its airspace, reaffirming that the Kingdom will not be a battleground for any conflict,” government spokesperson Mohammad Momani told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Iraq, which borders Iran, also closed its airspace on Friday. “The ministry of transport closes Iraqi airspace and suspends air traffic at all Iraqi airports,” the <em>Iraq News Agency</em> reported.</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump said that Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb and that the US was hoping to get back to the negotiating table, in an interview with <em>Fox News</em> after the start of the Israeli air strikes on Iran.</p>
<p>“We will see,” <em>Fox News</em> reporter Jennifer Griffin quoted Trump as saying in a post on X.</p>
<p>Trump would convene a meeting of the National Security Council on Friday morning, the White House said. He had said on Thursday an Israeli strike on Iran “could very well happen” but reiterated his hopes for a peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>The US military is planning for the full range of contingencies in the Middle East, including the possibility that it might have to help evacuate American civilians, a US official told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>Iran’s armed forces spokesperson said Israel and its chief ally the United States would pay a “heavy price” for the attack, accusing Washington of providing support for the operation.</p>
<p>While the US tried to distance itself from Israel’s military operation, an Israeli
official told public broadcaster Kan that Israel had coordinated with Washington on Iran.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States was not involved in the strikes and Tel Aviv had acted unilaterally for self-defence.</p>
<p>“We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” Rubio said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Let me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel,” he added.</p>

<p>The State Department issued an advisory saying that all US government employees in Israel and their family members should “shelter in place until further notice”.</p>
<p>The attacks triggered sharp falls in stock prices in Asian trade on Friday, led by a selloff in US futures, while oil prices jumped as investors scurried to safe havens such as gold and the Swiss franc.</p>
<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned any military escalation in the Middle East, said deputy UN spokesperson Farhan Haq.</p>
<p>“The Secretary-General asks both sides to show maximum restraint, avoiding at all costs a descent into deeper conflict, a situation that the region can hardly afford,” Haq said.</p>

<p>A US official said those talks were still scheduled to proceed despite the Israeli attack.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said on Friday that it was forced to act based on new intelligence information showing that Iran was “approaching the point of no return” in the development of a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>“In recent months, this program has accelerated significantly, bringing the regime significantly closer to obtaining a nuclear weapon,” it said in a statement, without disclosing the purported evidence.</p>
<p>A source familiar with US intelligence reports said there had been no recent change in the US intelligence assessment that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and that Khamenei had not authorised the restarting of the nuclear weapons programme that was shuttered in 2003.</p>

                <h2>Air India flight faces ‘worst aviation disaster in a decade’</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>• Over 200 killed as London-bound plane crashes in Ahmedabad seconds after takeoff<br />
• Scores dead and injured on the ground as debris falls on medical college hostel<br />
• UK resident Ramesh Viswashkumar said to be sole survivor<br />
• Britain, US sending investigation teams; Boeing shares tumble</p>
<p>AHMEDABAD: More than 200 people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916728/1-survivor-over-200-killed-as-air-india-plane-crashes-after-take-off-in-ahmedabad">killed</a> when an Air India plane bound for London with 242 people on board crashed shortly after takeoff, authorities said on Thursday, in what is said to be the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.</p>
<p>Only one person is known to have survived, as the plane came down in a residential area, crashing onto a medical college hostel just outside the airport at lunchtime.</p>
<p>The passengers included 169 Indian nationals, 53 British, seven Portuguese, and a Canadian. Two pilots and 10 cabin crew were also aboard, according to <em>AFP</em>.</p>

<p>According to air traffic control at Ahmedabad Airport, Air India’s flight 171 — bound for London Gatwick airport — departed at 1:39 pm local time (0809 GMT) from runway 23. It gave a Mayday call, signalling an emergency, but thereafter there was no response from the aircraft.</p>
<p>Footage of the crash showed the plane taking off over a residential area and then disappearing from view, before a huge ball of fire and smoke is seen rising into the sky from beyond the houses.</p>
<p>Another video circulating on social media showed an aircraft rapidly losing altitude — with its nose up — before it hit a building and exploded into an orange ball of fire.</p>
<p>India’s <em>CNN News-18</em> said the plane crashed on top of the dining area of state-run B.J. Medical College hostel, killing many medical students as well.</p>
<p><strong>‘Sole survivor’</strong></p>
<p>City police chief G.S. Malik told <em>Reuters</em> that 204 bodies had been recovered from the crash site. Vidhi Chaudhary, another senior police officer, said they had found one survivor, who was in seat 11A.</p>
<p>Indian media identified the fortunate man as UK resident Ramesh Viswashkumar.</p>
<p>“Thirty seconds after takeoff, there was a loud noise and then the plane crashed,” the 40-year-old told the <em>Hindustan Times.</em></p>

<p>“It all happened so quickly,” he told the paper from his hospital bed.</p>
<p>Police chief Malik said the bodies recovered could include both passengers and people killed on the ground.</p>
<p>“When I got up, there were bodies all around me. I was scared. I stood up and ran. There were pieces of the plane all around me,” he said.</p>
<p>“Someone grabbed hold of me and put me in an ambulance and brought me to the hospital.”</p>
<p>He said that his brother Ajay was seated in a different row on the plane. “He was travelling with me and I cant find him anymore. Please help me find him, he said.</p>
<p>According to the <em>BBC</em>, Vishwash has a wife and child and has lived in the UK for many years. His relatives, who had gathered at the family home in Leicester, said they were awaiting more information.</p>
<p>Federal minister C.R. Patil said the dead included Vijay Rupani, a former chief minister of Gujarat state.</p>
<p>The Indian aviation minister’s office said PM Narendra Modi, whose home state is Gujarat, had told it to ensure all support was extended to the rescue efforts.</p>
<p>Ahmedabad Airport, which suspended all flight operations after the crash, said it was operational again but with limited flights. The airport is operated by India’s Adani Group conglomerate.</p>
<p>The last fatal plane crash in India, the world’s third largest aviation market and its fastest growing, was in 2020 and involved Air India Express, the airline’s low-cost arm.</p>
<p>Tata will provide Rs10 million ($117,000) to the families of each of the dead, cover all medical expenses of those injured and help rebuild the hostel of the medical college, chairman N. Chandrasekaran said.</p>
<p><strong>First Dreamliner crash</strong></p>
<p>Aviation tracking site <em>Flightradar24</em> said the plane was a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, one of the most modern passenger aircraft in service.</p>
<p>It was the first crash for the Dreamliner, which began flying commercially in 2011, according to the Aviation Safety Network database. The plane that crashed on Thursday flew for the first time in 2013 and was delivered to Air India in January 2014, <em>Flightradar24</em> said.</p>
<p>Investigators with the US National Transportation Safety Board will travel to assist Indian counterparts probing the brutal Air India crash, the agency announced Thursday.</p>
<p>“The NTSB will be leading a team of US investigators travelling to India to assist… with (the) investigation into the crash of an Air India Boeing 787 in Ahmedabad, India,” the agency said on X, adding that under international protocols, “all information on the investigation will be provided by the Government of India.”</p>

<p>The UK’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) says it has “formally offered its assistance” to the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau in India.</p>
<p>It adds that the UK AAIB will have expert status in the Indian investigation because UK citizens were on board the plane.</p>
<p>Boeing said it was aware of initial reports and was working to gather more information. Boeing shares fell 5pc as the crash posed a major setback for the planemaker as its new CEO looks to rebuild trust following a series of safety and production challenges.</p>
<p>Aircraft engine-maker GE Aerospace said that it would put a team together to go to India and analyse cockpit data, <em>CNBC TV18</em> reported.</p>
