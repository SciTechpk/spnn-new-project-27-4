<p>After months of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917469/fact-check-trump-netanyahu-viral-comments-about-pakistan-on-iran-israel-clash-are-fake">attacking</a> Gaza ‚Äî flattening homes, targeting hospitals, and starving a besieged population ‚Äî Israel expanded its assault by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">launching</a> wide-scale air strikes against Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences on June 13, killing top commanders, scientists and civilians. A day earlier, President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">said</a> US air strikes  ‚Äútotally obliterated‚Äù Iran‚Äôs main nuclear sites, as Washington joined <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919362/we-will-end-this-war-iran-warns-gambler-trump">Israel‚Äôs war</a> with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.</p>
<p>The strikes on Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities, which came four days after Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917868">meeting</a> with Trump and a day after the government said it decided to formally recommend Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize for his role during the recent conflict with India, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919259/pakistan-backed-security-council-resolution-seeks-immediate-de-escalation">condemned</a> by Pakistan. A meeting of the NSC,  the highest forum for security deliberations comprising the civil and military top brass, was subsequently convened.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif chaired the meeting, with Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir also attending the important moot, and reviewed the evolving regional situation following the Israeli aggression against Iran.</p>

<p>Sources in the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office had told <em>Dawn</em> that Field Marshal Munir would brief the committee on the details of his meeting with Trump.</p>
<p>A press release from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office said: ‚ÄúThe committee strongly condemned Israel‚Äôs acts of aggression and expressed regret that these military attacks coincided with a constructive negotiation process between Iran and the US. These reckless actions have escalated tensions, threatening to ignite a wider conflict and diminishing the opportunities for dialogue and diplomacy. The NSC reaffirmed Iran‚Äôs right to self-defence as enshrined in the UN Charter.‚Äù</p>
<p>The committee members also conveyed their condolences to the Iranian government and people on the loss of innocent lives and offered prayers for the recovery of those injured.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile reiterating Pakistan‚Äôs stated position, the NSC expressed grave concern over the potential for further escalation after the attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan on June 22 which violated the resolutions of the International Atomic Energy Agency, relevant international law and the UN Charter.‚Äù</p>
<p>The committee members also reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs close engagement with relevant parties in the situation and endorsed the government‚Äôs readiness to continue efforts and initiatives aimed at promoting regional peace and stability.</p>
<p>The NSC called on all relevant parties to resolve the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy in line with the UN Charter, underscoring the need to adhere to international human rights and humanitarian laws.</p>

<p>The US president had stepped up his rhetoric against Iran since Israel first struck the country, repeating his insistence that it could never have a nuclear weapon. Tehran has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a> the claim, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p>
<p>Condemning the US attacks as a violation of international law, Iran said it was ‚Äúresolved to defend Iran‚Äôs territory, sovereignty, security and people by all force‚Äù. It also responded with a volley of missiles at Israel that wounded scores of people in Tel Aviv.</p></p>

                <h2>JUI senator submits resolution against govt‚Äôs Trump Nobel nomination</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) Senator Kamran Murtaza on Monday submitted a resolution in the Senate against the government‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514/govt-to-recommend-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize-for-decisive-diplomatic-intervention-in-india-pakistan-crisis">decision</a> to nominate US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, as Washington <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">joined</a> Israel‚Äôs war with Iran.</p>
<p>The government had decided to nominate Trump for the prestigious award to hail his ‚Äúdecisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership‚Äù during last month‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">Pak-India conflict</a>, when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">US mediation</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/GovtofPakistan/status/1936159807326900577" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, it had highlighted that Trump ‚Äúdemonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi‚Äù, which ultimately secured a ceasefire.</p>
<p>However, after the US bombed Iran‚Äôs Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites, with Trump saying they were ‚Äútotally obliterated‚Äù, leaders across the political spectrum joined <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193760/can-you-believe-pakistan-nominated-trump-for-a-nobel-peace-prize-the-internet-cant-either">citizens</a> in voicing their reservations.</p>
<p>In the resolution dated today, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, Senator Murtaza said, ‚ÄúThe Senate of Pakistan urges the Federal Government to rescind and withdraw its decision recommending US President ‚Ä¶ after bombing Iran by the USA on the orders of its President in violation of international law, interfering in the sovereignty of Iran, resulting several casualties also, as one of the concern of human rights, disturbing the peace in the region.‚Äù</p>
<p>The JUI-F leader also submitted a motion under Rule 218. It said that the House may discuss the government‚Äôs recommendation for his ‚Äúdecisive diplomatic role‚Äù during the conflict ‚Äúagainst the will of people of Pakistan without taking into confidence any House of Parliament‚Äù.</p>
<p>Earlier today, an emergency meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919377/national-security-committee-reaffirms-irans-right-to-self-defence-after-us-attacks-on-nuclear-sites">reaffirmed</a> Iran‚Äôs right to self-defence following the US airstrikes.</p>
<p>A press release from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office said: ‚ÄúThe committee strongly condemned Israel‚Äôs acts of aggression and expressed regret that these military attacks coincided with a constructive negotiation process between Iran and the US.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese reckless actions have escalated tensions, threatening to ignite a wider conflict and diminishing the opportunities for dialogue and diplomacy. The NSC reaffirmed Iran‚Äôs right to self-defence as enshrined in the UN Charter.‚Äù</p>
<p>On Sunday, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919128">demanded</a> that the government rescind its decision.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äôs claim of peace has proven to be false, the proposal for the Nobel Prize should be withdrawn,‚Äù Fazl told workers at a party meeting in Murree.</p></p>
