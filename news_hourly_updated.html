                <h2>May 9 riots: Faisalabad ATC sentences Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz and other PTI leaders to 10 years in jail</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Faisalabad on Thursday sentenced PTI leaders, including Omar Ayub Khan, Shibli Faraz, Hamid Raza, and Zartaj Gul, to 10 years of imprisonment for their involvement in the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1752003">PTI supporters</a>, protesting the party founder Imran Khan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">arrest</a>, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">attacking</a> the Lahore corps commander‚Äôs residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.</p>
<p>Out of 185 PTI workers accused, 108 have been sentenced by the court today.  PTI‚Äôs Member of the Provincial Assembly (MPA), Junaid Afzal Sahi, was sentenced to three years in prison. Meanwhile, MPA Khayal Ahmad Kastro, Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Zain Qureshi, and former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry have been acquitted in the cases.</p>
<p>Reacting to the development, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the party will challenge the decision in the high courts.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media in Islamabad today, Gohar said: ‚ÄúWe will raise the issue with PTI Founder Imran Khan on the future course of action regarding whether we should return to the parliament or launch a movement.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that the ‚Äúpolitical cases against PTI members were baseless‚Äù, adding that the PTI believed in running the system instead of believing in extremism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe do not believe in violence or incitement in politics. Those who have been convicted today do not believe in politics of violence.‚Äù</p>
<p>The PTI, in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTIofficial/status/1950860481490543099" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a>, also decried the decision, saying the party‚Äôs leaders have been ‚Äúunjustly targeted in the false flag operation of 9th May.‚Äù</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914290">May</a>, an ATC in Islamabad sentenced PTI members, including MNA Abdul Latif, to 27 years of imprisonment for attacking a police station during the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>In December 2024, <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7126" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">military courts</a> had sentenced 85 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their involvement in violent attacks on military installations during the riots on May 9.</p>

                <h2>Pakistan says deal concluded with US on tariffs; Trump cites oil reserves agreement</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan and the US finalised a trade deal on Wednesday night, expected to lower tariffs ‚Äî although no figure was announced ‚Äî while US President Donald Trump cited a pact aimed at helping <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927725/us-makes-deal-to-tap-pakistans-oil-reserves">develop Pakistan‚Äôs oil reserves</a>.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927252/aurangzeb-to-arrive-in-us-for-final-round-of-tariff-talks">currently</a> in Washington for negotiations on a tariff deal and also began meetings with senior US officials on Wednesday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn a landmark development, Pakistan and the United States finalised a trade agreement today aimed at boosting bilateral trade, expanding market access, attracting investment, and fostering cooperation in areas of mutual interest,‚Äù the Pakistani embassy in the US posted on X on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114943927434273211" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> the deal on his platform Truth Social early Thursday morning.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have just concluded a deal with the country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves,‚Äù Trump wrote.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are in the process of choosing the oil company that will lead this partnership. Who knows, maybe they‚Äôll be selling oil to India some day!‚Äù</p>
<p>There was no formal announcement from either side on what tariff rate was agreed upon, but the Pakistani embassy said the agreement ‚Äúwill result in reduction of reciprocal tariff especially on Pakistani exports to the United States.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis deal marks the beginning of a new era of economic collaboration especially in energy, mines and mineral, IT, cryptocurrency and other sectors,‚Äù the embassy said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe deal complements Pakistan‚Äôs existing efforts of broadening the scope of Pak-US economic ties and to include partnerships at the US states level. The agreement enhances Pakistan‚Äôs access to the US market and vice versa.‚Äù</p>
<p>The deal was reached during a meeting of Aurangzeb, US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer. Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul and Pakistan‚Äôs Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh were also present during the meeting.</p>
<p>The Pakistan embassy said the deal is expected to spur increased US investment in Pakistan‚Äôs infrastructure and development projects.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis trade agreement underscores the commitment of both nations to deepen their bilateral relationship and explore all avenues for strengthening trade and investment ties.‚Äù</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked Trump for his leadership role in finalising the ‚Äúhistoric US-Pakistan trade agreement‚Äù, saying in a post on X that  ‚Äúthis landmark deal will enhance our growing cooperation so as to expand the frontiers of our enduring partnership in days to come.‚Äù</p>

<p>Aurangzeb called the deal a ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù for both countries.</p>
<p>‚ÄúToday marks the culmination of the journey we started a few months back,‚Äù he said in a video message released by the Ministry of Finance on Thursday.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb reflected on the progress made since the talks related to the tariffs began, highlighting efforts to address non-tariff barriers, correct the trade imbalance, and review tariff lines on both sides.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe had a very constructive final round of discussion which then lead to finalising the trade deal, which was later on announced by President Trump.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFrom our perspective, it was always going beyond the immediate trade imperative. The whole point of this is that trade and investment have to go hand in hand,‚Äù the finance minister said.</p>
<p>He expressed his gratitude to several people and entities for their involvement in the process.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe role of the private sector is prominent, because when we were trying to figure out how to reduce or end the trade imbalance, the private sector was the first constituent who came up and said they will help,‚Äù Aurangzeb said.</p>
<p>He thanked the commerce secretary and Ambassador Sheikh, and their respective teams, saying, ‚ÄúWhere we stand today is because of our teamwork.‚Äù</p>
<p>While reiterating Trump‚Äôs message in his post, Aurangzeb called it a ‚Äúreal win-win situation for Pakistan and the United States‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are in a good place today in Pakistan in terms of where we have arrived before August 1, and for that, I congratulate everyone.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think we have come a long way from where we were to where we are today in terms of our overall strategic partnership between Pakistan and the US. It will, God willing, go from strength to strength as we go forward.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pakistan, which Washington has designated a ‚Äúmajor non-NATO ally‚Äù in its effort to counter China‚Äôs influence in the region, faced a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810/trumps-tariffs-stoke-global-trade-war-as-china-eu-hit-back">potential tariff</a> of 29 per cent declared in April that was later suspended for 90 days to allow trade talks.</p>
<p>Last week, Dar said both nations were ‚Äúvery close‚Äù to a trade deal that could come within days, after he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926640">met</a> US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday.</p>
<p>They discussed expanding trade and ties in critical minerals and mining, the two sides said afterwards. Other Pakistani officials have also visited for talks in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Under Trump, Washington has sought to renegotiate trade deals with many countries, which he threatened with tariffs for trade relations he calls unfair, a characterisation many economists dispute.</p>
<p>US total goods trade with Pakistan was an estimated $7.3 billion in 2024, the office of the US trade representative says on its website, up from about $6.9bn in 2023.</p>
<p>In 2024, its goods trade deficit with Pakistan was $3bn, up 5.2pc from 2023.</p></p>
