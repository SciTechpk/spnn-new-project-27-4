            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Friday rejected claims by Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval that India had successfully hit all nine identified targets on May 7, calling the remarks “replete with distortions and misrepresentations”.</p>
<p>Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan, addressing a weekly press briefing, said Doval’s statements reflected “a deliberate attempt to mislead the public” and violated “the norms of responsible statecraft”.</p>
<p>“Boasting of military aggression against a sovereign nation is a grave breach of the United Nations Charter and established principles of international law,” Mr Khan said.</p>
<p>“Rather than resorting to fictitious narratives, India should accept the downing of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">six fighter jets</a> and severe damages to other military targets.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Mr Khan also said it was public knowledge that the so-called terrorist targets attacked by India resulted in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">deaths of civilians</a>.</p>
<p>To a question, Mr Khan said: “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907327">Indian involvement</a> in sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan is very clear, and the international community is now becoming more aware of it.”</p>
<p>He added: “Initially, the Indian state-sponsored terrorism was targeting Pakistan, but we have seen that in the recent past, it has gone global. If this Indian malign approach is not checked, we have seen the consequences of that.”</p>
<p>Mr Khan accused India of orchestrating a global <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1882451">assassination campaign</a>, targeting individuals in Canada, the United States, and other countries.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to questions about declassified US documents that revealed the US spent billions of dollars in Afghanistan to defeat the Soviet Union, with facilitation by Pakistan, Mr Khan said: “What is in the past is in the past and we look at the past to guide us to a better future, rather than to become its prisoners.”</p>
<p>Mr Khan declined to comment on US President Donald Trump’s <a class="link--external" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/07/08/politics/video/trump-fundraiser-threats-moscow-beijing-src-digvid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported threat</a> to bomb Beijing if China invaded Taiwan, saying he would not speculate.</p>
<p>However, he reiterated Pakistan’s close ties with China, describing the country as a “close friend” and “iron brother,” and emphasised strategic cooperation and relations.</p>
<p>“We historically have very strong relations with the US and we are keen to continue these relations,” Mr Khan said. He also expressed hope that a trade agreement with the US would be signed soon.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923666/govt-looks-to-invite-several-satellite-based-internet-firms' target='_blank'><strong>Govt looks to invite several satellite-based internet firms</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The launch of satellite-based internet services in the country has been delayed as authorities look to invite more players into the field and formulate stricter regulations for foreign satellite operators, following the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">India-Pakistan</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/israel-iran-conflict">Iran-Israel conflicts</a>.</p>
<p>Following the expiration of the temporary no-objection certificate (NOC) for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899475/musks-starlink-gets-licence-to-operate-in-pakistan">Starlink</a> in March, all foreign satellite operators are now required to submit new applications under the newly drafted Satellite Communications Regula­tions.</p>
<p>These regulations are being finalised by the Pak­is­tan Space Activities Reg­ulatory Board (PSARB), based on industry feedback gathered during a recent roundtable discussion.</p>
<p>In addition to Starlink, two other Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operators, OneWeb and Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology (SSST), have expressed interest in starting operations in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Once registered under the new regulations, satellite internet providers will need to obtain operational licences from the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>A PTA official said that all companies, including Starlink, can launch their services by the end of this year. Meanwhile, sources told <em>Dawn</em> that Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, is also likely to attend the launch ceremony.</p>
<p>Starlink was the first company to submit a formal application for registration, but delays in licensing have occurred due to the absence of regulations. The company has already been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923085/musks-starlink-receives-indias-final-regulatory-nod-for-launch">granted approval</a> to provide satellite internet services in India.</p>
<p>A senior official from the Ministry of IT and Telecom emphasised the need for stringent regulations to ensure security, particularly in light of recent conflicts.</p>
<p>“The new regulations will include important security clauses that may have been overlooked if the recent wars had not occurred,” the official said. “Besides, Pakistan needs more than one satellite internet provider, and two more companies have expressed interest.”</p>
<p>The LEO satellite network operates at an altitude of less than 2,000km from the Earth’s surface, offering high-speed data connectivity in all weather conditions at a relatively low cost, with a latency delay of only 25 milliseconds.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s state-owned company, PakSat, a subsidiary of Suparco, currently provides satellite internet through Satellite Multi-Mission-1 (MM-1), the country’s second telecommunication satellite, launched in August 2024.</p>
<p>Unlike LEO satellites, the MM-1 is a geostationary satellite positioned at an altitude of around 37,500km above the Earth’s surface, with a latency delay of about 600 milliseconds.</p>
<p>PakSat currently serves around 300 clients, with a capacity to accommodate up to 5,000 users. The service is primarily sold to the corporate sector, armed forces and telecom providers for remote regions.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923650/soes-profit-falls-as-power-sector-losses-hit-rs59tr' target='_blank'><strong>SOEs’ profit falls as power sector losses hit Rs5.9tr</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs) continue to pose serious <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893133">fiscal</a> and operational challenges due to entrenched inefficiencies, poor governance, and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866381">delayed reforms</a>, as aggregate revenues and profits declined by 8 per cent and 10pc, respectively, during the first half of FY25, the Ministry of Finance said on Friday.</p>
<p>In its biannual performance report (July-December FY25), the Ministry’s Central Monitoring Unit (CMU) highlighted the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878034">power sector</a> as the biggest drag, with accumulated losses reaching Rs5.9tr. The sector alone accounts for Rs2.4tr of the Rs4.9tr circular debt across all SOEs.</p>
<p>“Distribution companies (Discos) reflect unsustainable losses when stripped of subsidies, further compounded by outdated infrastructure and unaccounted energy losses,” the report stated. Transmission constraints due to delayed NTDC upgrades and inefficient generation companies further eroded system efficiency.</p>
<p>The findings came a day after Power Minister Awais Leghari <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923412/power-minister-renews-push-to-slash-solar-net-metering">claimed a Rs191bn cut</a> in FY25 losses via better recoveries and theft control.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>State-run firms’ total debt climbs to Rs8.831 trillion</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the CMU, power Discos posted a core operational loss of Rs283.7bn in six months. Expanding circular debt in the oil, gas, and power sectors is distorting asset valuations and weakening cash flows. Meanwhile, persistent government financial support through grants, subsidies, and equity injections continues to strain public finances.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The report also flagged large unfunded pension liabilities in entities like railways and Discos, with contingent liabilities from government guarantees standing at Rs2.245tr. Rollover costs remain high due to refinancing risks from foreign relent loans (FRLs) and cash development loans (CDLs).</p>
<p>Total outstanding SOE debt reached Rs8.831tr, including accrued interest and rollover costs.</p>
<p>Gross revenues of federal SOEs stood at Rs6.459tr in July–December 2024, down 7.9pc from the same period last year. Lower global oil prices and reduced domestic interest rates dampened earnings in oil-related firms and financial institutions.</p>
<p>Aggregate profits declined to Rs457bn, while loss-making SOEs posted a combined loss of Rs343bn. After adjustments, net profits totalled Rs114bn, up 12pc from Rs101bn a year earlier.</p>
<p>The financial position of SOEs showed modest improvement. Total liabilities rose 1.03pc to Rs31.092tr, while asset value increased by 3.75pc to Rs37.72tr. Net equity rose by 18.8pc to Rs6.629tr.</p>
<p>The National Highway Authority reported the highest net loss of Rs153.3bn, pushing its accumulated deficit to Rs1.953tr. Quetta Electric Supply Company and Sukkur Electric Power Company followed with six-month losses of Rs58.1bn and Rs29.6bn, and cumulative losses of Rs770.6bn and Rs473bn, respectively.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Other major contributors to the fiscal drain included Pakistan Railways (Rs26.5bn loss), Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Rs19.7bn; Rs684.9bn accumulated), Pakistan Steel Mills (Rs15.6bn; Rs255.8bn accumulated), PTCL (Rs7.2bn; Rs43.6bn accumulated), and Pakistan Post (Rs6.3bn; Rs93.1bn accumulated).</p>
<p>The report estimated technical and commercial electricity losses at 20pc. “These structural flaws push the 6-month average sectoral loss close to Rs300bn — or Rs600bn annually — underscoring an urgent imperative for transformational reforms,” it stated.</p>
<p>Without sweeping reforms — including governance restructuring, technology upgrades, privatisation or concession models, and tariff realignment — the report warned that the fiscal burden would persist and stall energy sector recovery.</p>
<p>On a positive note, profit-making SOEs earned a combined Rs457.2bn in the six months. OGDCL led with Rs82.5bn, followed by Faisalabad Electric Supply Company at Rs53.5bn, significantly supported by Rs38.9bn in subsidies and Rs5.8bn in other income.</p>
<p>Pakistan Petroleum Ltd earned Rs49.9bn, National Power Parks Management Company Rs37.4bn, Government Holdings Rs25.3bn, and Gujranwala Electric Power Company Rs24.6bn — including Rs13.6bn in subsidies. Wapda and Port Qasim also posted profits of Rs18.5bn and Rs18.3bn, respectively.</p>
<p>To support loss-making SOEs, the government provided Rs616bn in fiscal assistance during July–December FY25, including Rs113bn in grants, Rs333bn in subsidies (mostly for power), Rs92bn in loans, and Rs77.5bn in equity injections.</p>
