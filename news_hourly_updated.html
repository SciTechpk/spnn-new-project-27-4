                <h2>PHC halts appointments of new NA, Senate opposition leaders</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Tuesday issued a stay order for the appointments of new opposition leaders in the National Assembly and the Senate following the disqualification and removal of PTI‚Äôs Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz from their respective roles.</p>
<p>On August 5, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928901">disqualified</a> Ayub and Faraz, along with other opposition MNAs and MPAs, following their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">convictions</a> in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927964/pti-opposition-leaders-over-100-others-sentenced-for-may-9-riots#:~:text=judgements%20in%20three%20separate%20cases">three</a> cases related to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9, 2023 riots</a>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, on August 8, both leaders were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929551">removed</a> from their posts in notifications issued by the NA and Senate secretariats.</p>
<p>A division bench comprising Justices Arshad Ali and Dr Khurshid Iqbal took up their separate petitions filed earlier today by Ayub and Faraz against the denotification of their parliamentary roles.</p>
<p>PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan appeared as the counsel for both petitioners.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The bench issued notices to the ECP and other respondents, directing them to halt the appointments for the opposition leader in both houses of the parliament, which are currently vacant.</p>
<p>The court adjourned the hearing till August 15 (Friday), seeking replies from the respondents.</p>
<p>During the hearing, Gohar informed the bench of the details of recent developments. ‚ÄúWhen an MNA becomes the opposition leader, then the ECP‚Äôs role does not remain anymore,‚Äù he asserted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMay 9 was an unfortunate incident, which should not have happened,‚Äù the PTI leader said. He contended that the ECP recently also disqualified <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927477/haste-raises-eyebrows-as-ecp-disqualifies-another-pti-lawmaker">MNA Abdul Latif</a> from the NA-1 by ‚Äúciting the wrong reference of the [2012] <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1013436/sc-says-it-cannot-order-musharrafs-trial-for-treason#:~:text=2012%20Azhar%20Siddiq%20case">Azhar Siddique case</a>‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe won 180 seats, entered the parliament with 90 seats, and are now left with 23,‚Äù the PTI lawyer lamented.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNow the government wants to bring another party‚Äôs opposition leader,‚Äù Gohar claimed, requesting the court to issue directives to stop any further action against Ayub and Faraz.</p>
<p>A PHC bench comprising Justice Ali and Justice Farah Jamshed had also barred the ECP from taking any action against Ayub and Faraz on August 6, but to no avail since the order came a day after their disqualification.</p>
<p>The court had also granted the two leaders, as well as Zartaj Gul, protective bail till August 20.</p>

<p>Speaking to the media outside the PHC, Gohar called for the ‚Äúseason of disqualifications‚Äù to come to an end.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese disqualifications are not the solution to any issue,‚Äù the PTI leader emphasised. ‚ÄúI will request everyone to come to your senses now.‚Äù</p>
<p>Refuting reports of friction within the party leadership, he asserted: ‚ÄúThere is no weakness in our team; we are being oppressed.‚Äù</p>
<p>Gohar also reaffirmed the PTI‚Äôs intention to stage gatherings across the country on August 14 to ‚Äúcelebrate Independence Day and raise voice‚Äù for ex-premier Imran Khan‚Äôs release, despite the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930003">government‚Äôs call</a> to reschedule the protests.</p>

<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTIofficial/status/1953459018187354362" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> issued by the PTI and attributed to Imran has termed August 14 as the ‚Äúnext important day‚Äù of the party‚Äôs fresh <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928760/pti-to-kick-off-free-imran-movement-today">protest movement</a>.</p>
<p>However, Gohar also acknowledged the need for a dialogue to solve the ongoing political crisis.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media outside the PHC, Ayub highlighted ‚Äúrising‚Äù inflation in the country. ‚ÄúThese people (government) are enjoying themselves by burdening the people of Pakistan,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He alleged: ‚ÄúThere has been a scandal of more than Rs500 billion in the petroleum sector. There was another scandal worth Rs2,000bn which has come to light.‚Äù</p>

<p>On <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9, 2023</a>, PTI supporters, protesting party founder Imran Khan‚Äôs arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, following which thousands were arrested.</p>
<p>PTI parliamentarians convicted in May 9 cases would face automatic disqualification under Article 63(1)(g) of the Constitution, which bars members convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude or corrupt practices.</p>
<p>A Faisalabad anti-terrorism court on July 31 had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">senten¬≠ced</a> over PTI 100 leaders and workers to jail terms of up to 10 years in connection with the riots. Ayub, Faraz, PTI‚Äôs Zartaj Gul and Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza were among the key opposition leaders handed rigorous imprisonment.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>They were convicted under sections 109 (punishment for abetment) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) in a case registered at Ghulam Muhammadabad police station.</p>
<p>In another case registered at the same police station, 60 out of 67 accused were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927964/pti-opposition-leaders-over-100-others-sentenced-for-may-9-riots">convicted</a>, while seven were acquitted.</p>
<p>In the case filed at the Civil Lines police station, 107 out of 108 accused were sentenced to 10 years in prison and one person was handed a three-year jail term, while 77 were acquitted.</p>
<p>Former information minister Fawad Chaudhry, MNA Zain Qureshi (son of PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi), MPA Khayal Ahmad Kastro and Faizullah Kamuka were acquitted in all three cases.</p>
<p>The judge had issued arrest warrants for those convicted who were not present in court and had directed the police to arrest all convicts and bring them before the court for imprisonment.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Separately, on July 23, a Lahore ATC had handed Yasmin Rashid, Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed and other PTI leaders 10-year rigorous imprisonment in a case related to vandalism at <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925804/atc-hears-final-arguments-in-sherpao-bridge-violence-case">Sherpao Bridge</a>. However, Qureshi and five others were acquitted.</p>
<p>The same day, a Sargodha ATC had sentenced dozens of PTI leaders, including then-Punjab Assembly opposition leader Malik Ahmed Khan Bhachar, in another May 9 riots case registered at the Musakhel police station.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880141">December 21</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881338">Dec 26</a> last year, a military court sentenced 85 civilians, including ex-premier Imran Khan‚Äôs nephew Hassaan Niazi, to up to 10 years for their involvement in the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>However, days later, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884089">mercy petitions</a> of 19 accused were later accepted on humanitarian grounds, while 48 other pleas had been processed to Courts of Appeal.</p></p>

                <h2>Bilawal blows off ‚Äòbaseless rumours‚Äô about legislation on 27th amendment</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Tuesday dismissed talk of any potential legislation regarding a 27th constitutional amendment as ‚Äúbaseless rumours‚Äù.</p>
<p>Even though the 26th Amendment is still mired in controversy, the power corridors in Islamabad are abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment, which, according to the insiders, will further ‚Äúfine-tune‚Äù the structure and the functioning of the superior judiciary.</p>
<p>With the 26th Amendment, the government introduced sweeping changes to the judicial framework. Sources had said certain contentious matters, such as a separate constitutional court, left unresolved in the 26th Amendment, would now be taken up in the new amendment.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters in Hyderabad about the matter, Bilawal addressed the ‚Äúbaseless rumours‚Äù, stating: ‚ÄúSo far, no federal minister, prime minister or party member has approached me regarding any amendments.‚Äù</p>
<p>He also highlighted that the 26th Amendment was passed after reaching a consensus with compromise from political parties. ‚ÄúPPP wanted constitutional courts, but we compromised,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MediaCellPPP/status/1955195709377954135" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the PPP quoted him as saying, ‚ÄúThe 26th Constitutional Amendment is an eternal success. Judicial reforms and constitutional courts were a demand of the Charter of Democracy, but we prioritised a constitutional bench over a constitutional court for the sake of consensus.‚Äù</p>
<p>Though the speculations are rife, there has been no official word regarding the 27th Constitutional Amendment. At present, the proposal to further reform the judiciary is at a very initial stage, but consultations are reportedly underway within the ruling PML-N and some legal circles. Despite these purported consultations, any draft for this proposed bill has yet to see the light of day.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>On Sunday, PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929988">said</a> that the party would approach the legal fraternity following ‚Äúnew drama‚Äù surrounding the legislation. ‚ÄúIn this case, we will approach the lawyers‚Äô community regarding this legislation,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúWe will begin by meeting with the Islamabad Bar this month.‚Äù</p>
<p>In June, amid speculation in legal circles about the government planning to bring in the 27th Amendment, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915322">endorsed</a> the amendment while calling for broad-based judicial reforms, including the nationwide rotation of judges.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com:443/feeds/home#nfc-award" id="nfc-award" title="Permalink"></a>NFC award</h2>
<p>While responding to a question about amending the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, Bilawal said, ‚ÄúAbsolutely. Further changes must come in NFC.‚Äù</p>
<p>He continued, ‚ÄúThe previous NFC award was given before passing the 18th Amendment, which was before 2010.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that various responsibilities of the federal government were handed to the provinces, adding, ‚ÄúBut the NFC is the same as it was prior to the 18th Amendment.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The PPP chairman continued, ‚ÄúThe Constitution says that the NFC award must be regularly given after five years. It is already mentioned that the shares of provincial governments cannot be reduced in new NFC awards.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll provinces must be given more resources as per the increased responsibilities after the 18th Amendment.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added, ‚ÄúWe must immediately call NFC and give new awards. All provinces must be given resources according to the 18th Amendment.‚Äù</p></p>
