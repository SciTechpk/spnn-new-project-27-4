            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913266/nine-terrorists-killed-in-separate-operations-across-kp-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Nine terrorists killed in separate operations across KP: ISPR</strong></a>
            <p><p>Security forces killed nine terrorists “sponsored” by India during a series of operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday, according to the military’s media wing.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), nine “Indian-sponsored <em>khawarij</em>” were killed in three separate engagements.</p>
<p>“An intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted by the security forces in Dera Ismail Khan district, on [the] reported presence of Indian sponsored <em>khwarij</em>,” the military’s media wing said, using the term designating terrorists affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.</p>
<p>During the engagement, security forces “effectively engaged the <em>khawarij</em> location and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian-sponsored <em>khawarij</em> were sent to hell”.</p>
<p>According to the statement, another IBO was conducted in Tank District and two more Indian-sponsored <em>khawarij</em> were “sent to hell” by the security forces.</p>
<p>In the third operation in Khyber district’s Bagh area, “own troops successfully neutralised three more Indian-sponsored khawarij”, the ISPR said.</p>
<p>The statement added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the dead terrorists, who were involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas.</p>
<p>“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other <em>kharji</em> found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005">12 terrorists</a> belonging to “Indian proxy” outfits were killed by security forces while two personnel were martyred in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the ISPR had said on Monday.</p>
<p>It added that intelligence-based operations (IBOs) were conducted on Saturday and Sunday against the TTP in KP and the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Front in Balochistan.</p>
<p>An IBO was conducted in Lakki Marwat district during which troops engaged the enemy at its location and sent “five Indian sponsored” terrorists to “hell”, it said. In a second IBO in the Bannu district, two “Indian-sponsored” terrorists were “successfully neutralised” by the security forces.</p>
<p>It further said that terrorists ambushed a security forces convoy in another incident in North Waziristan district’s general area of Mir Ali, adding that two “Indian sponsored” terrorists were “sent to hell” after the effective response of troops.</p>
<p>“However, during the intense fire exchange, two brave sons of the soil, Sepoy Farhad Ali Turi (age: 29 years, resident of Kurram district) and Lance Naik Sabir Afridi (age: 32 years, resident of Kohat district) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced martyrdom.”</p>
<p>Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">accused</a> India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.</p>
<p>“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the <em>Fitnah-al-Khawarij</em> and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said, using the state-designated term for the banned TTP.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>A significant improvement was seen in Pakistan’s internal security landscape in April 2025, “as both militant attacks and resultant casualties dropped sharply compared to March”, according to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907799">data</a> released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS).</p>
<p>Pakistan ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p></p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday arrived in Istanbul on a two-day visit to Turkiye, the first leg of his four-nation tour to friendly countries, to express his gratitude for supporting Pakistan during the recent conflict with India.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, upon arrival at the Istanbul Airport, the prime minister was received by Turkish Minister for National Defence Yasar Guler, Governor Istanbul Davut Gul, President of Pakistan-Turkiye Cultural Association Burhan Kayaturk, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Turkiye Yousaf Junaid, Consul General Istanbul Nouman Aslam, senior officials of the Turkish government and Pakistani diplomats posted in Turkiye.</p>

<p>“PM Shehbaz Sharif will meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan today,” the statement said. “The two leaders will discuss further expanding cooperation between Turkiye and Pakistan in diverse fields, including defence, economy, tourism and culture.”</p>
<p>The statement added that the purpose of the prime minister’s visit was to “thank the people of Turkiye, particularly President Erdogan, for supporting Pakistan’s principled stand in the recent Pakistan-India tension.”</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Minister of Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant Tariq Fatemi also accompanied the premier.</p>
<p>This is the first leg of the premier’s four-nation visit aimed at strengthening ties with the friendly countries. Apart from Turkiye, he will also visit Iran, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan from May 25-30, according to the <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/curtain-raiser-prime-ministers-visit-to-turkiye-iran-azerbaijan-and-tajikistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Foreign Office</a>.</p>
<p>The tour follows diplomatic support voiced by three of these countries for Pakistan during the recent military confrontation with India.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>During the visit, PM Shehbaz will have “wide-ranging discussions with the leaders of these countries on an entire range of issues covering bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance,” the Foreign Office said.</p>
<p>“He will also have the opportunity to express the deepest appreciation and acknowledgement for the support extended to Pakistan by the friendly countries during the recent crisis with India,” it noted.</p>
<p>Fahrettin Altun, Erdogan’s head of communications <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/fahrettinaltun/status/1926561438107107658" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on X</a> said, “During the meeting, bilateral relations, regional and international issues, including the fight against terrorism, will be discussed.”</p>
<p>Altun said “various aspects of bilateral relations between Turkiye and Pakistan will be evaluated”, according to a Google translation of his post.</p>
<p>Joint steps taken within the scope of the Pakistan-Turkiye High Level Strategic Cooperation Council as per the two leaders’ <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891812">last meeting</a> in February will be reviewed, the Turkish official said.</p>
<p>While in Tajikistan — likely the last leg of his tour — the premier will also attend the International Conference on Glaciers being held in its capital, Dushanbe, on May 29 and 30.</p>
<p>As tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi escalated, with India launching deadly strikes on Pakistan on May 6, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909193/erdogan-conveys-turkiyes-solidarity-to-pm-shehbaz-amid-india-escalation">conveyed his solidarity</a> to the prime minister and said it supported Pakistan’s “calm and restrained policies”.</p>
<p>Following the tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">airbase attacks</a> and a US-brokered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> between the two neighbours, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev had “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911194/azerbaijan-hails-pakistans-remarkable-success-during-recent-military-strife-with-india-pmo">warmly congratulated</a> PM Shehbaz upon Pakistan’s remarkable success”, according to the PM Office.</p>
<p>Iran had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">offered to mediate</a> during the escalation and paid a visit to both <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">Islamabad</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909355/irans-foreign-minister-repeats-call-for-restraint-in-india-pakistan-standoff">New Delhi</a> in peace efforts, which were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911597">appreciated</a> by PM Shehbaz and the military’s spokesperson.</p>

<p>The diplomatic support voiced by Turkiye and Azerbaijan stoked anger in India as people <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cancelled their holidays</a> in popular resorts in the two countries.</p>
<p>The moves <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911469">intensified</a> as Adani group-operated Mumbai and Ahmedabad airports ended the ground handling concession agreements with Çelebi, an Istanbul-headquartered airport.</p>
<p>Small Indian grocery shops and major online fashion retailers also began a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912015">boycott of Turkish products</a> ranging from chocolates, coffee, jams and cosmetics to clothing.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz’s tour adds to Pakistan’s spree of diplomatic engagement amid tensions with New Delhi.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Dar held a telephonic conversation with Uzbekistan Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov, where views were “exchanged on current regional situation”.</p>
<p>The two leaders discussed existing bilateral relations, particularly the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894417/pakistan-and-uzbekistan-agree-to-expand-bilateral-trade-to-2bn#:~:text=%E2%80%98Detailed%20negotiations%E2%80%99%20held%20on%20joint%20railway%20project">Railway Line Project</a>, the FO <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1926519844997927089" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913262/mir-ali-protest-continues-locals-say-will-march-towards-islamabad-if-demands-not-met' target='_blank'><strong>Mir Ali protest continues, locals say will march towards Islamabad if demands not met</strong></a>
            <p><p>Locals in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali district continued their sit-in on Sunday for the seventh day, protesting against a suspected drone strike in the district — that they say is responsible for the death of four children — vowing to launch a long march to Islamabad if their demands were not met.</p>
<p>The suspected strike took place in Mir Ali’s Hurmuz village on May 19 during the daytime, leaving <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912113/four-kids-killed-in-north-waziristan-strike">four children</a> of the same family dead and injuring five others, including a woman. The police have held <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912175">talks</a> with tribal elders, which have so far remained inconclusive.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the military’s media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912393">clarified that</a> security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>According to the local elders, the sit-in near the Mir Ali cantonment area continued for the seventh day as authorities allegedly blocked all network and internet systems in the district.</p>
<p>The local elders threatened to cut internet cables providing connectivity to the cantonment area if the internet system and mobile signals were not restored in the rest of the district by Sunday evening.</p>
<p>The organisers of the sit-in issued a statement, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>,  seeking justice for the children who lost their lives in the incident.</p>
<p>“The people of Waziristan will not remain silent and will launch a long march towards Islamabad on May 26, 2025 (tomorrow), if our demands are not fulfilled,” the statement, issued by the Mir Ali sit-in committee, said.</p>
<p>“The long march will commence from the venue of the protest sit-in in Mir Ali, pass through Bannu Bazaar and Township Chowk, and reach Domel Highway Chowk where locals will join them. It will then march toward Karak and Kohat and others will join the procession,” the statement said.</p>
<p>It added that the long march will reach Peshawar where the protesters will stay the night and will be joined by people from other districts.</p>
<p>“The next morning, the participants will march toward Islamabad, after passing through Charsadda, Nowshera, Mardan and Swabi where other processions will join them,” it said.</p>
<p>The protests also laid out their demands, including “a judicial inquiry into the Mir Ali incident and punishment of the culprits; justice, protection, and state assistance to the families of the victims; and a complete end to drone attacks”, among other stipulations, according to the statement.</p>
<p>The statement further said that after reaching Islamabad, protesters will hold a peaceful demonstration for their demands in front of government offices and state institutions.</p>
<p>“We believe in peaceful protests and this long march will mark a milestone in the struggle against oppression, injustice, and silence and awaken the nation’s conscience,” the statement said.</p>
<p>In its statement on Wednesday, the ISPR said initial findings had established that this “heinous act has been orchestrated and executed by Indian-sponsored <em>Fitnah Al Khwarij</em>,” using the term the state uses to refer to the TTP.</p>
<p>“Following a tragic incident on May 19, 2025, in the general area of Mir Ali, North Waziristan district, which regrettably resulted in civilian casualties, unfounded and misleading allegations have been circulated by certain quarters, falsely implicating Pakistan’s security forces,” it added.</p>
<p>“These claims are entirely baseless and are part of a coordinated disinformation campaign aimed at discrediting the security forces’ steadfast efforts in the ongoing counterterrorism operations.”</p>
<p>It said that a “comprehensive investigation was promptly initiated” in response to the accusations.</p>
<p>“It is evident that these elements — acting at the behest of their Indian masters — continue to exploit civilian areas and vulnerable populations as shields to conduct their reprehensible acts of terrorism. Such tactics aim to unsuccessfully sow discord between the local population and the security forces, who together remain resolute to uproot the menace of terrorism.”</p>
<p>It further said that security forces reaffirmed “their commitment to ensuring that the perpetrators of this inhuman act are brought to justice.”</p></p>
