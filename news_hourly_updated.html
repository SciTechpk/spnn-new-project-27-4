                <h2>At least 2 killed, cops among 15 injured in Wana blast: Waziristan police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least two people were killed while 15 others were injured in a bomb blast targeting a police vehicle in the Wana tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Lower South Waziristan district on Thursday, police said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">surge</a> in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies‚Äô personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">broke</a> a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe blast was caused by a remote-controlled explosive device planted near a police vehicle [in the Rustam Bazaar],‚Äù Deputy Superintendent of Police Imranullah was quoted as saying by the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/domestic/blast-in-wana-bazaar-claims-two-lives-injures-14-including-cops/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em></a>.</p>
<p>According to a list of casualties issued by South Waziristan police spokesperson Anayat Khan, two men lost their lives, while 15 others, including two police constables, were injured in the blast today.</p>
<p>The wounded policemen were identified as Zubair Salaam Khan from the district‚Äôs Dabkot area and Fareedun Zubair from Birmal tehsil. An unknown person was listed as seriously injured out of those hurt.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Lower South Waziristan‚Äôs District Police Officer (DPO) Tahir Khan had earlier told <em>Dawn.com</em>: ‚ÄúThe wounded were immediately taken to the Wana District Headquarters Hospital.‚Äù</p>
<p>Security forces cordoned off the area after the blast and initiated a search operation to trace the perpetrators, DPO Khan added.</p>
<p>Investigation was also underway to determine the nature of the bomb used, the officer noted.</p>
<p>The incident follows residents‚Äô complaints of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929167/action-sought-against-armed-men-roaming-wana-bazaar">open display of firearms</a> and the free movement of armed men in Wana‚Äôs Rustam Bazaar, an important commercial hub of Lower South Waziristan.</p>
<p>Sources said no one was allowed to roam Rustam Bazaar openly carrying weapons, and that strict measures would be implemented soon to curb the practice.</p>
<p>Pakistan witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928076/militant-attacks-see-slight-rise-in-july-says-think-tank">slight uptick</a> in militant violence in July, according to a report released by the think tank Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss). KP, including its tribal districts, remained the epicentre of militancy, accounting for 53 of the 82 attacks recorded nationwide.</p>
<p>A day ago, a police constable was among <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929116/2-injured-as-upper-south-waziristan-dcs-vehicle-comes-under-attack">two people injured</a> when Upper South Waziristan Deputy Commissioner Asmatullah Wazir‚Äôs vehicle came under attack in the district‚Äôs Ladha tehsil.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, four security personnel and a policeman were among <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929080">seven people martyred</a> in two separate firing incidents in KP‚Äôs Karak and Peshawar districts.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, unidentified attackers fired a rocket targeting a Scout camp in Wana. Although there were no reports of casualties or property damage, the explosion caused widespread fear and concern among residents.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, two militant commanders and the brother of a tribal elder were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928528/two-terrorists-elders-brother-killed-in-waziristan-clash">killed in a clash</a> between the banned TTP (Gul Bahadar group) and family members of elder Malik Ashiq Noor in the Dana area of Lower South Waziristan‚Äôs Birmal tehsil.</p>

<p>Separately, a cop was injured as police and civilians repulsed a late-night terrorist attack on the Khuni Khel police post in KP‚Äôs Bannu district.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPolice personnel responded strongly to the terrorist attack while showing bravery and determination,‚Äù Bannu DPO Saleem Abbas Kulachi said in a statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA policeman got injured by the terrorists‚Äô firing and was taken to a hospital,‚Äù the officer added, noting that residents also joined the police and took up positions against the attackers.</p>
<p>DPO Kulachi stressed that the residents‚Äô courage further heightened the police‚Äôs courage. ‚ÄúThe net around the terrorists is being tightened,‚Äù he asserted.</p>
<p>According to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/domestic/bravery-and-unity-police-civilians-repel-terrorist-attack-on-khuni-khel-checkpost/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">APP</a></em>, the assault was carried out using both light and heavy weaponry by terrorists from the outlawed TTP and Tehreek-i-Jihad Afghanistan (TTG), operating under the combined name Al-Ittihad al-Mujahideen.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP ‚Äî including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur ‚Äî have seen a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a>, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773/3-terrorists-killed-during-joint-operation-in-kps-bannu-police">in July</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, a fire exchange following a terrorist attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu left a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928472">constable and three terrorists dead</a>, while three cops were injured.</p>
<p>Bannu has also seen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923850">multiple</a> quadcopter <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927953">attacks</a> over the past month, which the military says are carried out by the TTP.</p></p>

                <h2>Khawaja Asif dismisses rumours of him resigning as defence minister</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Thursday refuted rumours circulating on social media that he had stepped down from his position following a controversy.</p>
<p>Asif clarified the matter after an X user named Zubair Ali Khan, in a series of posts on the platform late Wednesday night, alleged that the defence minister had handed in his resignation over a controversy but had withdrawn it and was now unreachable.</p>
<p>Replying to the post that levelled the allegations against him, Asif wrote:
‚ÄúWith apologies, this gentleman has written his wishes in this tweet. Not reality.‚Äù</p>
<p>He shared a screenshot of the post thread, edited with a red stamp marking it as ‚ÄúFAKE‚Äù.</p>

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The X user, a former journalist, had alleged that the minister resigned due to ‚Äúintensified controversy regarding the arrest of the additional deputy commissioner revenue (ADCR) of Sialkot a few days ago on charges of alleged financial corruption‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the resignation sent to Dr Tauqeer Shah, advisor to the prime minister‚Äôs office, Khawaja Asif stated that either the ADCR should be released or his resignation should be accepted,‚Äù the post alleged.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Khan also suggested that an ‚Äúinfluential person‚Äù was behind the arrest, who was a subordinate of the defence minister‚Äôs department.</p>
<p>Later, he posted an update, further alleging that Asif and former premier Nawaz Sharif had held a meeting in Murree, during which the defence minister was persuaded to withdraw his resignation on the PML-N president‚Äôs advice.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter the meeting, Khawaja Asif is out of reach to everyone; neither any minister nor any journalist can contact him. Khawaja Asif has turned off all his numbers and has moved to an unknown location!‚Äù he alleged.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The rumours spread after Asif said that a large portion of Pakistan‚Äôs bureaucracy was seeking shelter and citizenship in Portugal with billions in hand.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMore than half of the bureaucracy of our dear homeland has already acquired property in Portugal and is preparing to obtain citizenship,‚Äù Asif said in a post on Tuesday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese are well-known bureaucrats. Yet, after devouring billions of rupees, they are comfortably living a retired life.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that politicians ‚Äúeat the leftovers and beat their chests, with neither plots nor foreign citizenship because they have to fight elections‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe largest role in providing shelter to bureaucracy and other elites in Portugal is being played by Mr Virk‚Äù, he said.</p>
