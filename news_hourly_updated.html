                <h2>Govt hikes petrol price by Rs5.36, high-speed diesel by Rs11.37</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The federal government on Tuesday hiked the price of petrol by Rs5.36 per litre and that of high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs11.37 for the next fortnight.</p>
<p>A press release from the Finance Division said the revised prices were based on recommendations by Ogra and concerned ministries.</p>
<p>The new petrol price is Rs272.15 per litre and Rs284.35 for HSD.</p>
<p>The press release did not mention any changes in the prices of kerosene and light diesel oil.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924258/fuel-prices-set-for-fresh-hike-amid-global-trends">informed sources</a>, the ex-depot price of petrol was projected to rise by about two per cent to Rs272.04 per litre, while HSD was likely to see a 2.5pc increase to approximately Rs279.48 per litre.</p>
<p>Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws, and private vehicles, petrol has a direct impact on the budgets of middle- and lower-income households.</p>
<p>Diesel fuels heavy transport, agricultural machinery, and trains. Its price is considered highly inflationary, influencing the cost of food and other essential goods. Transporters had already begun adjusting fares in anticipation of the expected increase.</p>
<p>Despite zero general sales tax (GST) on petroleum products, the government is currently collecting close to Rs98 per litre in total levies on both petrol and diesel. This includes a petroleum development levy (PDL) of Rs78.02 on petrol and Rs77.01 on diesel and HOBC, along with a Rs2.25 per litre climate support levy (CSL). Additionally, a customs duty of Rs20-21 per litre is levied on both fuels, whether imported or locally refined.</p>
<p>Oil marketing companies and dealers are earning around Rs17 per litre as combined distribution and retail margins.</p>
<p>Petrol and diesel remain the primary drivers of fuel consumption, with monthly sales between 700,000 and 800,000 tonnes, compared to just 10,000 tonnes of kerosene.</p>
<p>In FY24, the government collected Rs1.161 trillion through the petroleum levy and aims to increase this by 27pc to Rs1.470tr in FY25. Despite zero GST, petroleum products continue to serve as a significant source of revenue.</p></p>

            </a>
            <p><p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday reiterated their commitment to working together with each other for the country‚Äôs sake.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the Presidency said the two held a meeting today at the President House.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe meeting involved discussions on the country‚Äôs political, economic, and security situation. The state of law and order in the country and measures against terrorism were also discussed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prime minister briefed the president on the government‚Äôs measures to improve the economy. Both leaders reiterated their commitment to work together for the country‚Äôs stability, development, and prosperity,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>The meeting was also attended by Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Law  Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Interior  Minister Mohsin Naqvi and PM‚Äôs Adviser on Political and Public Affairs Rana Sanaullah.</p>

<p>The meeting comes in the wake of growing speculation about the upcoming 27th constitutional amendment and it being claimed that President Zardari may soon step down, potentially paving the way for the army chief to assume the country‚Äôs presidency.</p>
<p>The reports on social media claim that work is underway to replace the current parliamentary system with a presidential form of government. Some reports also claim that President Zardari has set one condition for his exit ‚Äî a key role for his son Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in the new dispensation.</p>
<p>Naqvi said earlier this month that there were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922412/dar-naqvi-allay-fears-over-breach-in-coalition">no plans</a> to remove President Zardari and dismissed the reports about any such move.</p>

<p>He had to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923413/mohsin-naqvi-rubbishes-reports-about-presidential-system">dismiss the reports again</a> last week, claiming that the country was shifting to a presidential system and that Field Marshal Asim Munir would replace Zardari as head of state.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are fully aware of who is behind the malicious campaign targeting President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the chief of army staff (COAS). I have categorically stated that there has been no discussion ‚Äî nor does any such idea exist ‚Äî about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency,‚Äù Naqvi had posted on X.</p>
<p>He said the president enjoyed a strong and respe¬≠ctful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces. ‚ÄúI know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.‚Äù</p>
