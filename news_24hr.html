            <p><p>Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian landed in Islamabad on Saturday for a two-day visit, eyeing to reaffirm his commitment to elevate annual bilateral trade with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan has recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924349/dar-slams-israel-us-attacks-against-fellow-sco-member-iran-as-unacceptable">expressed solidarity</a> and a desire for cooperation with Iran, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927716/closer-pak-iran-cooperation-vital-to-securing-shared-interests-say-experts">experts say</a> is vital to securing shared interests in a shifting geopolitical environment.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian is paying a two-day official visit to Pakistan over the weekend, making it his first trip to Islamabad in his current role, the Foreign Office <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928047/iranian-president-to-visit-pakistan-on-saturday-fo">said</a>. Ahead of his trip, Pakistan yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919380/the-history-of-us-iran-tensions">pledged</a> to help defuse <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919380/the-history-of-us-iran-tensions">tensions</a> between Iran and the United States.</p>
<p>Dr Pezeshkian arrived at Nur Khan Air Base, where Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar received him.</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz said he was honoured to welcome the Iranian president and looked forward to “substantive engagements during this important visit that will pave the way forward for stronger Pakistan-Iran ties”.</p>

<p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi visited the Foreign Office where he met FM Dar and the two held discussions.</p>
<p>“The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening Pakistan-Iran ties, with a focus on expanding cooperation in regional stability, trade, and economic collaboration. They also discussed enhancing bilateral engagement across key areas of mutual interest,” the FO said.</p>

<p>He visited the mausoleum of Allama Iqbal to pay tribute to his legacy with CM Maryam, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb and Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari accompanying him.</p>
<p>President Pezeshkian laid a wreath at the grave and offered prayers, led by Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee Chairman Maulana Abdul Khabir Azad.</p>
<p>The Iranian president also penned remarks in the visitors’ book, expressing admiration for Allama Iqbal’s contributions to Islamic philosophy and the Pakistan Movement.</p>
<p>Tight security arrangements were in place to ensure the safety of him and his delegation throughout the visit.</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz had met with Pezeshkian during his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913442/ready-to-talk-with-india-pm-shehbaz-says-during-meeting-with-iranian-president-in-tehran">visit to Iran</a> in late May, which was part of his regional tour to friendly countries aimed at expre­ssing gratitude for their support during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">conflict with India</a>.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian is the second Iranian president to visit Pakistan in as many years. Late Ebrahim Raisi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1828957">visited</a> the country in April last year, just a month before he died in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1834463">helicopter crash</a>.</p>
<p>According to Iran’s state media <em><a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85903178/Pezeshkian-Iran-aims-to-expand-trade-with-Pakistan-to-10-billion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IRNA</a></em>, before departing for Pakistan, Pezeshkian emphasised the plan to elevate their annual trade exchanges to $10 billion. The two countries had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1829136">agreed</a> in April last year to boost trade over the next five years.</p>
<p>The president termed the trade relations between Tehran and Islamabad as “good” and identified boosting trade with Pakistan via land, air and sea as priorities for this trip, the report added.</p>
<p>“Through Pakistan, Iran can connect to the Silk Road linking China and Pakistan, and the route can then extend through Iran to Europe,” he said.</p>
<p>Emphasising that security and border issues were of great importance to both Iran and Pakistan, he stressed that regional security must be achieved through cooperation, according to <em>IRNA</em>.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Pezeshkian noted that the two neighbours have “enjoyed good, friendly, and deep-rooted relations” since Pakistan’s independence. “The two countries cooperate in economic, scientific, cultural, and border areas, and a deep bond exists between the people of both sides,” he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian highlighted that during the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919798/ceasefire-brokered-with-iran-after-washington-request-for-liaison-qatars-pm-says">Israel-Iran war</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">United States’ strikes</a> against its nuclear facilities, “Pakistan was among the countries that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924349/dar-slams-israel-us-attacks-against-fellow-sco-member-iran-as-unacceptable">strongly condemned</a> this aggression and declared its readiness to provide any necessary support for Iran’s territorial integrity, as well as for the government and people of Iran”.</p>
<p>According to <em>IRNA</em>, the president also noted that “the enemy plans to create division among Muslims, but Iran will thwart the enemies’ plots”, adding that Tehran aims to maintain unity and solidarity between Iran and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian had left for Pakistan earlier today, accompanied by a high-level delegation.</p>

            <p><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Saturday hosted the first of several jirgas on restoring law and order in the province.</p>
<p>KP has been gripped by a deteriorating security situation amid terrorist attacks that have left residents demanding peace while opposing military operations due to collateral damage. CM Gandapur <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927600">announced</a> earlier this week that a series of jirgas would be convened to decide on future steps on a wide array of concerns among the province’s residents.</p>
<p>In a post on X, a statement from the CM Office said that the regional jirgas began today and were attended by tribal elders and elected public representatives from the Khyber and Orakzai districts, as well as representatives from the tribal subdivisions of Darra Adam Khel and Hassan Khel.</p>
<p>It added that 150 tribal elders from the aforementioned areas, six MPAs, three MNAs and one senator participated in the jirga.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The statement added that the CM’s adviser on information, the KP chief secretary, inspector general of police and commissioners and deputy commissioners were also present in the jirga.</p>
<p>The statement listed down the recommendations made by the jirga, such as ensuring unity against terrorism to restore peace, as well as declaring that displacement amid the ongoing military operation was “unacceptable under any circumstances”.</p>
<p>“Development is linked to peace and it will accelerate when peace is restored,” the statement said. “No one has asked for any resources of the province, including minerals, nor has it been given to anyone, nor will it be given to anyone.</p>
<p>“Tribal elders have recommended to the federal government that arrangements should be made to send a jirga of the provincial government and tribal elders for negotiations with Afghanistan,” the statement added.</p>
<p>The statement said that the jirga should receive resources and cooperation to achieve this, adding that the next regional jirga would be held in the Mohmand and Bajaur districts. A third jirga would be held in North and South Waziristan, while the fourth would be convened in Kurram district.</p>
<p>No dates were given for the jirgas in this statement.</p>
<p>“Immediately after the regional jirgas, a grand jirga will be held under the chairmanship of the Chief Minister,” the statement added.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan group <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, security forces, backed by gunship helicopters and artillery, launched ‘Operation Sarbakaf’ against terrorists in Lowi Mamund tehsil and imposed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927438/curfew-imposed-as-3-day-operation-against-militants-begins-in-bajaur-official">three-day curfew</a> in the region.</p>
<p>According to a notification, the administration imposed restrictions on all kinds of movement in 16 areas of Lowi Mamund on the recommendation of the district intelligence coordination committee.</p>
<p>The provincial government has opposed the newly launched <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927454/curfew-imposed-as-forces-launch-operation-sarbakaf-in-bajaur">military operation</a> in Bajaur unless it is taken into confidence by the Centre and has vowed to lift the curfew.</p>
<p>Although not confirmed officially by security forces, sources said that at least four terrorists were killed, around 12 were wounded, and about 10 were captured alive in different areas of the Lowi Mamund tehsil. Locals also claimed that a child was among two civilians who died, and eight others, including two minors and a woman, were wounded in clashes between security forces and terrorists.</p></p>

            <p><p>PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khanum, clarified on Saturday that his sons have applied for National Identity Cards for Overseas Pakistanis (Nicops) as well as visas to visit Pakistan.</p>
<p>Imran, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a> since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. His sons, Sulaiman Khan and Kasim Khan, have been protesting his incarceration, but uncertainty remains as to whether they will be visiting Pakistan.</p>
<p>A day ago, Aleema said they had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928066/kasim-says-trump-can-make-a-difference-on-imrans-situation">applied for visas</a> and were waiting for approval from the interior ministry. That had prompted Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry to ask why they would need visas if they had the Nicop, as she had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927618/imran-in-really-poor-conditions-and-getting-worse-his-son-kasim-says">previously said</a>.</p>
<p>Clarifying the matter today while speaking to reporters at Adiala Jail, she said: “The Nicop of one [of the brothers] is missing and the other can’t find his card so they’ve submitted two applications: one to issue their Nicop, which is valid for the next six to seven years … and they have also applied for the visa which can be issued within an hour.</p>
<p>“It’s their choice. They have Nicop, they have British passports. So what issue do they (the interior ministry) have in issuing a visa?”</p>
<p>She stated that she had access to tracking numbers for the applications, challenging claims that the applications were not received.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chaudhry said the siblings would be treated as dual nationals if they arrived on the basis of the Nicop. “If they choose to seek consular assistance as British citizens, they are still entitled to do so regardless of whether they entered on a Visa or Nicop.”</p>

<p>Sulaiman, 28, and Kasim, 26, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910789">called attention</a> to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Last month, Aleema said they would go to the United States before coming to Pakistan as part of a movement calling for the ex-premier’s release. The siblings visited the US and engaged <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926052/imrans-sons-meet-trump-aide-to-kick-off-us-campaign-to-free-father">US lawmakers</a> on the issue of their father’s incarceration.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the PTI <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927421">swiftly rubbished</a> media reports claiming that the incarcerated leader told reporters at Adiala Jail that his sons would not be coming to Pakistan and taking part in or leading any protest.</p>
<p>Although the government has not officially commented on the matter of Imran’s sons, Chaudhry previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926052/imrans-sons-meet-trump-aide-to-kick-off-us-campaign-to-free-father">questioned</a> what, if any, role they would be able to play, adding that they were welcome to visit Pakistan and there would be no obstacle for them. He continued that visas would be issued to them “in less than 24 hours”, provided they stayed within the law.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan">told</a> <em>Dawn.com</em> that Article 16 of the Constitution, which grants the right to gather, was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Malik also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923089">said</a> that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals, and that if they “violate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled”.</p>
<p>There were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan">conflicting statements</a> from PML-N leaders as well on whether the duo would be allowed entry into Pakistan, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they should be allowed to come and “carry out their activities”, but within the limitations of the law.</p></p>
