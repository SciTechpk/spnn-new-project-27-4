            <p><p>The Pakistan Army has inducted Z-10ME attack helicopters to reinforce its “integrated battlefield response”, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Aviation Industry Corporation of China had displayed its Z-10 attack helicopter for the first time outside its home country at the Singapore Airshow in February 2024, according to <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reuters</a>. It also noted that as of then, the model had Pakistan as the only known export customer, but no sales had been announced at the air show.</p>
<p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir presided over the induction ceremony and later witnessed a firepower demonstration by the “newly inducted Z-10ME helicopters” at the Muzaffargarh Field Firing Ranges, the ISPR said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7375" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>, without specifying the number of the craft acquired.</p>
<p>“The induction of this potent system marks a major leap in the modernisation of Army Aviation, reinforcing its integrated battlefield response and capacity to deliver decisive effects against potential adversaries,” the military’s media affairs wing noted.</p>

<p>In 2021, <em>Defense News</em> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1612986#:~:text=The%20report%20noted%20that%20before%20the%20T129%20was%20chosen%2C%20China%20sent%20three%20of%20its%20CAIC%20Z%2D10%20helicopter">reported</a> that China sent three of its Z-10 helicopter gunships for trials in Pakistan, but they failed to sufficiently impress officials and were returned.</p>
<p>However, former Australian defence attaché to Islamabad, Brian Cloughley, had said it was “likely that the Pakistan Army will evaluate the Chinese Z-10ME attack helicopter”.</p>
<p>The ISPR highlighted: “This state-of-the-art, all-weather platform is capable of precision strike operations day and night.</p>
<p>“Equipped with advanced radar systems and cutting-edge electronic warfare suites, the Z-10ME significantly enhances the army’s capability to engage diverse aerial and ground threats.”</p>
<p>Interacting with troops at the Muzaffargarh firing ranges, COAS Munir lauded their exceptional morale, professionalism, and combat proficiency.</p>
<p>He appreciated the “successful demonstration of combined arms tactics, reflecting the army’s firm resolve to maintain a decisive edge in the evolving character of warfare”.</p>
<p>Separately, Field Marshal Munir stressed the importance of national unity and civil-military synergy in countering “hybrid threats”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>He made the remarks as he engaged with members of academia and civil society during an interactive session, following his visit to Multan Garrison.</p>
<p>“He underscored the significance of national unity, civil-military synergy and a whole-of-nation approach in countering hybrid threats and fostering societal cohesion,” the ISPR statement read.</p>
<p>At the garrison, COAS Munir was briefed on the formation’s operational preparedness and ongoing training activities, the report added. He reaffirmed the army’s “unwavering commitment to safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity”.</p>
<p>The army chief expressed satisfaction over the high standards of readiness.</p></p>

            <p><p>Several vehicles were recovered from wreckage in the flood-affected Ghizer and Hunza districts of Gilgit-Baltistan, the government’s spokesperson said on Saturday, adding that rescue teams have been so far unable to locate the people who went missing in the floods.</p>
<p>Floods <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> across GB last week, causing landslides, leaving many stranded, and damaging more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure. More cloudburst-induced floods <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927955/cloudburst-causes-floods-in-ghizer-hunza">hit</a> the Ghizer and Hunza districts on Tuesday in which 10 people, mostly tourists, reportedly lost their lives, with between 10 and 15 tourists still missing.</p>
<p>GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said today that a search operation on Babusar Highway is under way during which many vehicles that were swept away by the floods have been recovered.</p>
<p>“The vehicles were found but we found no clue as to the missing persons,” he added.</p>
<p>Faraq continued that rehabilitation work has been accelerated in the flood-affected areas.</p>
<p>He said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would be visiting GB for two or three days,  “Hopefully, the prime minister’s visit will provide relief to the injured victims.”</p>
<p>The prime minister on Friday had expressed his aim to visit GB in solidarity with the affected people. He <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928144/pm-shehbaz-vows-support-as-monsoon-batters-gb-ajk">reaffirmed</a> the federal government’s full support for relief and recovery efforts in the flood-hit areas in a high-level meeting that focused on immediate relief efforts, future disaster preparedness and federal assistance to the affected regions.</p>

<p>“Water and electricity has been restored in many areas of the region,” the spokesperson  said, adding that communication systems on Babusar Highway and other places have also restored.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">heat­­waves</a>, erratic weat­her patterns and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928021">glacial melting</a> have triggered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a> and intense floods across the region.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928021">glacier burst</a> in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Bagrot Valley caused the death of one person when a father and son fell into a ravine and were buried under the debris of the glacier.</p>
<p>Last week, at least four tourists were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719">killed</a>, two others injured and 15 went missing after floods triggered by heavy rain swept through GB’s Babusar area in Diamer district.</p></p>

<p>This was the second such honour killing incident in the Tangir district within a week</p>
<p>According to FIR registered with Jaglot Police Station, Javed Iqbal, his wife and children were washing clothes on a river near their home when two men, Afsar Khan and Dar Khan, reached there and allegedly shot Javed Iqbal dead.</p>
<p>The two accused, after killing Javed Iqbal, also killed a married woman in the name of honour.</p>

<p>“We demand an immediate and transparent investigation, swift prosecution of the perpetrators and urgent action to dismantle the culture of impunity surrounding honour-based violence in Gilgit-Baltistan,” the HRCP said.</p>
