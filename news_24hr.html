            <p><p>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Wednesday said that the party was standing together and presenting a “message of unity” amid rumours of rifts while warning the federal government against toppling the party’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa administration.</p>
<p>Background briefings revealed a complete <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920889/lack-of-trust-sparks-fissures-within-pti#:~:text=Background%20briefings%20revealed%20a%20complete%20lack%20of%20trust%20among%20PTI%20leaders,%20with%20doubts%20about%20each%20other%E2%80%99s%20sincerity%20and%20intentions,%20particularly%20regarding%20Imran%20Khan%E2%80%99s%20messages.">lack of trust</a> among PTI leaders, with doubts about each other’s sincerity and intentions, particularly regarding messages from party founder Imran Khan, who has been behind bars since August 2023.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Islamabad and flanked by senior PTI leaders, the party chairman outlined the issues discussed in a high-level meeting and maintained that the PTI would continue efforts to try and free Imran.</p>

<p>“We discussed the aftermath of the reserved seat ruling, which was the first time that the party formed a strategy together,” Gohar said. “It is our decision that we will stand up together for Imran Khan. We have no personal conflict, we are and will remain united and a message of unity needed to be sent in today’s meeting.”</p>
<p>Gohar added that the meeting discussed Imran’s plan for the party to launch a protest movement, stating: “Whatever Khan <em>sahib</em> decides, we will execute it.”</p>

<p>Gohar said that PTI MNAs, MPAs and senators all attended today’s meeting, which discussed a wide range of issues from the reserved seats verdict and the party’s direction to addressing dialogue with the government.</p>
<p>“Whatever direction will be announced, you will see it in due course.”</p>
<p>Discussing the letter from jailed PTI leaders suggesting dialogue with the government, Gohar noted that the media would often infer that the government extended offers for talks, which were rejected by the PTI.</p>
<p>“This is incorrect, from the beginning, Khan <em>sahib</em> said that there should be dialogue,” Gohar said. “Even after our mandate was stolen, he said that. You have taken our seats, but you have registered cases against three of our MNAs, yet Khan <em>sahib</em> says that dialogue needs to be meaningful,” the party chairman added.</p>
<p>Gohar said that there was no delay on the PTI’s part, but said that the government was “not sincere” since it refused to grant the party access to Imran.</p>
<p>Talking about the reserved seats, he noted that there were 25 seats from KP. “Even if these seats go to the opposition … then they are 35 members short. We will protect the KP government at all costs,” Gohar stated. “Those who want to bring a no-confidence motion do not have the required numbers to move even a resolution.”</p>
<p>PTI KP President Junaid Akbar said that all of the provincial political leadership was also present at the meeting and stressed that within the party, decisions by the founder were respected by all members, with “discord set to one side”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur challenged other parties and institutions to topple the PTI’s government in KP.</p>
<p>“If you have it in you, I challenge your strength and I challenge the state … if you are able to topple our government, then I will leave politics,” he stated.</p>

<p>He criticised the government, saying that it was a “disgraceful stain on the state and its institutions” within the country’s political history, but “they are not ashamed”.</p>
<p>“We are time-tested people who have given sacrifices … So this is a challenge to your powers to try anything only without any conspiracies or unconstitutional ways. But you cannot do it. You cannot topple Khan’s people.”</p>

<p>Speaking on the Feb 8 elections, PTI Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja said that they would always be remembered as the most “democratic day” in history, along with the “attack on Pakistani people”, referring to the election results.</p>
<p>“We will continue to struggle for the public. We will succeed. Do not think that by stealing seats, suppressing the judiciary, the people will step back. We are with the people.”</p>
<p>He further said, “We stand with Imran’s struggle for the public. We will continue to struggle for the public.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, party spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram said the assembled leadership passed a unanimous resolution against the Constitutional Bench’s verdict on reserved seats and stated that the party would work to ensure the release of Imran and other jailed PTI leaders.</p>
<p>“Legal action, peaceful protest and negotiation are steps we are willing to take,” Akram said, quoting the resolution. He too said the party was united under Imran’s leadership and would remain so.</p></p>

            <p><p>The ruling coalition was handed its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly on Wednesday with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) distributing the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621">reserved seats</a> to the PML-N, PPP and the opposition Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) following the Supreme Court’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920721/ptis-hopes-dashed-as-rivals-set-to-receive-reserved-seats">verdict</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, the Constit­utional Bench overturned the Supreme Court’s earlier judgement in the reserved seats case — effectively taking away reserved seats from the PTI and handing them to their rival parties in the national and provincial legislatures. The decision, handed down by a majority of seven judges, supersedes the July 12, 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">majority judgement</a> by eight judges, which had declared the PTI eligible for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the assemblies.</p>
<p>The Constitutional Bench’s decision effectively meant the PTI was no longer a parliamentary party.</p>
<p>Acting on the court’s verdict, the ECP issued an order today withdrawing its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1848065">July 24</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1848903">29 notifications</a> from last year that had declared returned candidates against general seats of the National Assembly and the Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies as returned candidates of the PTI.</p>
<p>In another order today, the ECP notified the names of the returned candidates under various categories of reserved seats with immediate effect, distributing 13 seats to the PML-N in the National Assembly, four to the PPP and two to the opposition JUI-F.</p>
<p>After this process, the ruling coalition ach­ieves a two-thirds majority; in a house of 336, the mag­ic number required to at­­tain a two-thirds majority is 224.</p>

<p>The National Assembly Secretariat’s Legislation Branch later issued the National Assembly composition reflecting the actual party position after the apex court’s verdict and ECP’s distribution. It showed the treasury benches as now having 235 seats to the opposition’s 98 seats, for a total of 333 seats with one MNA suspended and two reserved seats being vacant.</p>
<p>The ECP also distributed reserved seats in the provincial assemblies. In the KP Assembly, 10 seats were given to the JUI-F, seven to the PML-N, six to the PPP and one each to the PTI-Parliamentarians and Awami National Party.</p>
<p>The PML-N was given 23 seats in the Punjab Assembly, two for the PPP and one each to the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid and Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party.</p>
<p>In the Sindh Assembly, two seats were given to the PPP and one to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#reserved-seats-case" id="reserved-seats-case" title="Permalink"></a>Reserved seats case</h2>
<p>Through its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1821427">March 25, 2024</a> order, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) had deprived the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — the party <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1816169">joined</a> by PTI-backed independents after the Feb 8, 2024, polls — of reserved seats.</p>
<p>In a 4-1 verdict, the electoral watchdog ruled that the SIC was not entitled to claim quota for reserved seats “due to having non-curable legal defects and violation of a mandatory provision of submission of party list for reserved seats, which is the requirement of law”.</p>
<p>The SIC — joined by PTI-backed independents who won the elections sans their electoral symbol — had filed the petition through its chairman, Sahibzada Muhammad Hamid Raza, seeking directives of the court for the ECP to allocate reserved seats to the council based on their strength in the national and provincial assemblies.</p>
<p>The commission had also decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the PML-N and the PPP becoming major beneficiaries. The decision was challenged by the PTI in the top court.</p>
<p>On July 13, the apex court, in a unique majority verdict, declared the PTI eligible to receive reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the national and provincial assemblies, giving it a new lease of life in the legislature by declaring it to be a parliamentary party.</p>
<p>However, the ruling was not implemented by the National Assembly, while the ECP had raised some objections. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the PML-N, the PPP and the ECP.</p>
<p>On the date of the first hearing of this case, Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908809/two-judges-object-as-sc-accepts-review-pleas-on-reserved-seats-for-hearing">rejected</a> outright the review petitions filed by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1846084">PML-N</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850678#:~:text=ECP%20files%20review%20plea">ECP</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847508/ppp-takes-cue-from-pml-n-files-review-petition-on-sc-reserved-seats-verdict">PPP</a>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, their names were excluded from the strength of the Constitutional Bench, even though they were considered part of the bench.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail had partly allowed the review petitions and maintained his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531#:~:text=Chief%20Justice%20Qazi%20Faez%20Isa%20read%20out%20the%20minority%20judgement%2C%20written%20by%20Justice%20Jamal%20Khan%20Mandokhail">original order</a> of giving 39 seats to PTI, but reviewed the majority judgment to the extent of 41 seats.</p>
<p>In his July 12 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866985#:~:text=Justice%20Jamal%20Khan%20Mandokhail%2C%20in%20his%20dissenting%20note">dissenting order</a>, Justice Mandokhail had declared PTI a parliamentary party consisting of 39 members, and thus entitled to reserved seats. Therefore, the ECP should recalculate and reallocate the reserved seats amongst the political parties, including PTI, he held.</p>
<p>The July 12 majority judgement had asked the rest of the 41 independent candidates to file signed and notarised statements before the commission within 15 days — explaining that they contested the Feb 8 general elections as a candidate of a particular political party. Consequently, the ECP had notified them as PTI members, in light of the judgment.</p>
<p>Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, who were part of the earlier majority judgement, also reviewed their positions and allowed the review petitions.</p>
<p>However, they posited that since the controversy at hand could not be resolved, either by the PHC or the Supreme Court, the ECP should examine and consider afresh the nomination papers/declaration and other relevant documents of all <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621#:~:text=the%20verdict%20stated.-,List%20of%2080%20MNAs,-The%20verdict%20listed">80 returned candidates</a>, with regard to their affiliation, and take a decision on the allocation of reserved seats within 15 days from receiving a copy of their short order.</p></p>

            <p><p>At least five people, including an assistant commissioner, were killed and 11 others injured on Wednesday as a government vehicle was targeted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The country <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">ranked second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025.</p>
<p>Bajaur District Police Officer (DPO) Waqas Rafique told <em>Dawn.com</em> that five people, including two policemen and a civilian, were killed in an explosion targeting the vehicle on Nawagai Road in Khar tehsil’s Sadiqabad area.</p>
<p>The deceased include Nawagai Assistant Commissioner (AC) Faisal Ismail, Tehsildar Abdul Wakil, Subedar Noor Hakim, and police constable Rashid, according to the DPO.</p>
<p>“The blast was so intense that the vehicle targeted was completely destroyed,” he said, adding that 11 people were injured in the blast and immediately transported to Khar District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>DPO Rafique said security was heightened in the area and relief activities were underway.</p>
<p>The TTP claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>

<p>The incident report from the hospital’s medical superintendent to provincial health authorities said the bomb blast occurred at 2pm, adding that four bodies and 18 injured were brought to the facility.</p>
<p>KP Health Adviser Ihtisham Ali contacted Khar DHQ’s district health officer and the medical superintendent to enquire about the well-being of those injured in the attack.</p>
<p>“An emergency has been imposed in Bajaur hospitals and health department staff have been alerted for first aid,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The health adviser strongly condemned the blast and expressed grief over the demise of AC Ismail and others in the incident. He assured the public that medical assistance would be provided to the injured.</p>
<p>KP Inspector General of Police (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed sought a report on the blast from the Malakand regional police officer (RPO).</p>
<p>He also ordered to speed up intelligence-based operations against the TTP and directed the Counter-Terrorism Department’s additional inspector general of police to send a special team to Bajaur.</p>
<p>“A special branch is obtaining intelligence related to the incident,” Hameed said, adding that according to initial information, the TTP targeted the assistant commissioner’s vehicle.</p>
<p>Hameed said that teams were formed “to arrest the elements involved in the incident while all necessary evidence is being collected from the spot”, adding that bomb disposal teams were present on site.</p>
<p>Those elements disturbing the country and province’s peace will be strictly dealt with, the KP police chief said.</p>
<p>KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur ordered an inquiry into the incident and directed that medical facilities be provided to the injured, according to KP government spokesperson Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif.</p>
