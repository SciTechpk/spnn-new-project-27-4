            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan on Monday conducted a successful training launch of a Fatah Series surface-to-surface missile with a range of 120 kilometres as part of ongoing ‚ÄúEx INDUS‚Äù, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.</p>
<p>The test launch comes amid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908387">heightened tensions</a> between nuclear powers Pakistan and India in the wake of New Delhi‚Äôs aggressive measures in the wake of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile‚Äôs advanced navigation system and enhanced accuracy,‚Äù ISPR said.</p>

<p>The training launch was witnessed by senior officers of the army , as well as officers, scientists and engineers from Pakistan‚Äôs strategic organisations, the military‚Äôs media wing said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúChairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, and the Chief of Army Staff extended their congratulations to the participating troops, scientists, and engineers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey expressed complete confidence in the operational preparedness and technical proficiency of Pakistan Army to thwart any aggression against the territorial integrity of Pakistan,‚Äù ISPR said.</p>
<p>On Saturday, ISPR said that Pakistan had conducted a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908176">successful training launch</a> of the Abdali Weapon System, a surface-to-surface missile with a range of 450km.</p>
<p>In May last year, the army <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1833760">conducted a test-launch</a> of Fatah-II guided rocket system which had a range of 400 kilometres.</p>
<p>The guidance system makes this rocket a precision weapon enhancing its lethality and efficacy, while the trajectory mode and terminal guidance technology enables it to evade the enemy‚Äôs anti-ballistic missile systems.</p>

<p>A day ago, Islamabad decided to seek an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908460">immediate session</a> of the United Nations Security Council to apprise world powers about the recent tensions with India.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Foreign Office said FM Dar has issued directions to Pakistan‚Äôs permanent representative to United Nations Ambassador Asim Iftikhar to take immediate steps for the UNSC session.</p>
<p>The instructions came two days after Ambassador Iftikhar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908062">said</a> Pakistan was closely following the situation stemming from India‚Äôs aggressive moves in the wake of the Pahalgam attack and would seek a UNSC meeting at an appropriate time.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis important diplomatic move is part of Pakistan‚Äôs efforts to present true facts before the international community,‚Äù the statement said, adding that Pakistan decided to formally brief the UNSC on the latest situation in the region as well as India‚Äôs aggressive steps and provocative statements.</p>
<p>It said Pakistan would specifically highlight the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty by India.</p></p>
