            <p><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday unveiled Pakistan’s annual federal budget in a charged National Assembly session, outlining ambitious plans to drive 4.2 per cent growth while slashing overall spending and tightening tax measures.</p>

<p>As the session — chaired by NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq — commenced, opposition lawmakers erupted into anti-government slogans. Starting his speech, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the budget was being presented at a “historic moment” marked by national unity and resolve, referencing the recent Pakistan-India conflict.</p>
<p>“The spirit with which we protected our national sovereignty, we need to ensure our financial security in the same way,” he maintained, continuing his speech through the noisy session.</p>
<p>“Pakistan has now achieved economic stability and is moving towards a Pakistan that is prosperous.”</p>
<p>The minister highlighted the current account surplus, remittances, and the stability of the rupee while also mentioning the positive reports from international credit rating agencies <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897569">Moody’s</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904417">Fitch</a> that upgraded Pakistan’s rating.</p>

<p>The federal budget for fiscal year 2026 has a total outlay — the sum of expenditures and net lending of funds — of Rs17.573 trillion, representing a 6.9 per cent decrease from the previous year’s budget.</p>

<p>The government has proposed Rs16,286bn for current expenditure in the FY26 budget, a 5.33pc decrease from the previous year.</p>

<p>Interest payments, or debt servicing, have contracted by 16 per cent to Rs8,207bn, yet continue to consume almost half of the total budget outlay and becoming, like in the last few years, the government’s single largest expense.</p>

<p>Aurangzeb said that it was unavoidable to aim for a 14pc tax-to-GDP ratio and added that achieving the national targets was “impossible without the transformation of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).”</p>
<p>The government has set an ambitious tax collection target for the FBR at Rs14,131 billion, an 8.95pc increase from last year’s goal.</p>

<p>Detailing that transformation, the minister listed B2B e-voicing, AI-based audit selection systems for sales and income tax, e-billing and faceless audits, and a new central control unit to centralise data collection, among other steps.</p>

<p>Expanding upon the results, he said 390,000 high-value non-filers of tax were identified through data integration, with Rs300m recovered. The minister further highlighted that there was a 100pc increase in the number of tax filers, taking the revenues to Rs105bn.</p>
<p>“For the first time, the IMF (International Monetary Fund) has acknowledged Rs389bn revenues through law enforcement,” he said.</p>
<p>Speaking on tax revenues, he said the tax-to-GDP ratio was only 8.8pc in June 2024, which was raised to 10.3pc in the first nine months of FY2025, and would reach 10.4pc by the end of June.</p>
<p>The government’s revenue was now at 11.6pc, including the provinces’ 0.8pc contributions.</p>
<p>“The FBR has increased tax-to-GDP ratio by 1.6pc, which is historic not just in Pakistan but the world,” he asserted.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb also announced tax relief measures for the salaried class, stating that the government planned to reduce the tax slabs, “balancing inflation and take-home [income]”.</p>
<p>Those earning between Rs0.6m and Rs1.2m would pay a 2.5pc tax, those with income greater than Rs1.2m and less than Rs2.5m would pay an 11pc tax, with those earning above that and till Rs3.2m would need to pay a 23pc tax.</p>
<p>For the corporate sector, the minister said it was being proposed to reduce the super tax rate for corporations earning between Rs200m-Rs500m annually to 5pc.</p>
<p>The finance minister proposed that Balochistan and the merged districts in KP, which “had a leeway with taxes for the past seven years”, were now to pay sales tax starting from 10pc for five years.</p>
<p>He said an 18pc tax would be applied on imported solar panels, while online businesses and digital marketplaces would also come under the tax net.</p>
<p>However, noting that the agriculture sector was the economy’s engine of growth, Aurangzeb said no further tax on fertiliser and pesticides was being mulled.</p>
<p>He warned that those committing theft in sales tax would face strict punishments, with the right to appeal. An automated risk-based income tax adjustment would be introduced to prevent the misuse of the income tax system.</p>
<p>He further said that foreign vendors from countries having no bilateral tax agreements with Pakistan could be taxed. “A 5pc tax on items from foreign vendors has been proposed.”</p>
<p>Petrol, diesel and hybrid cars that were excluded from an 18pc sales tax would now be hit with the same tax as well, the minister said.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb said that the federal government’s non-tax revenue target would be Rs5.15tr, with pure earnings of Rs11.08tr.</p>
<p>He added that the total expenditure is aimed at Rs17.58tr, out of which Rs8.21 would be for payments of mark up.</p>
<p>For the defence sector, for which Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said the budget share would be increased, Rs2.55tr would be allocated.</p>
<p>Expanding on the defence budget later during his speech, Aurangzeb stated that officers and junior commissioned officers would get a special relief allowance from the budget “in light of the contribution of the armed forces to defending our borders”.</p>
<p>Civil administration expenditure would be Rs0.97tr, pension expenditure Rs1.06bn, power and other sectors Rs1.19bn, according to Aurangzeb.</p>
<p>The minister detailed Rs1.93tr worth of grants allocated for AJK, GB and KP’s merged districts, including for BISP and education.</p>
<p>He also took a jibe at those “who were raising alarm about a mini-budget”, adding that no such move had been taken by the government.</p>
<p>The finance czar said that there was a 31pc <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903338">reduction in electricity prices</a>, as well as 50pc reduction in prices for protected consumers.</p>
<p>Mentioning the privatisation of distribution companies, he said: “Professional boards have been cleared of political corruption.”</p>
<p>The minister went on to announce that the government had made plans to “procure cheap energy”.  Noting the closure of costly power plants and reforms in the oil and gas sector, he said Turkish and other international companies were willing to invest in Pakistan.</p>

<p>He mentioned the $5bn investment pledge by Reko Diq and pointed out fuel price deregulation aimed to promote competition.</p>
<p>“Gold mines in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904563">Reko Diq</a> are a key part of our future. The plan’s feasibility study was completed in January,” he noted.</p>
<p>“We expect $71bn in cash flows [as well as] $7bn in tax and $8bn in royalties,” he said, terming the project a “game changer”.</p>
<p>Detailing the steps to be taken under the National Tariff Policy, Aurangzeb said additional customs duties will come to an end in four years, regulatory duties will end in five years, Customs Act’s Schedule 5 will also be eliminated in five years, and customs duty will be structured in slabs, with the maximum being 15pc.</p>
<p>“Tariff reforms will be applied step by step so that businesses can adjust and challenges are reduced. This will apply to all economic areas, including pharma, IT, telecom, textile and engineering.”</p>
<p>Quoting the World Bank, Aurangzeb informed the NA that these instruments would lower the tariffs, bringing them to the same level as Vietnam and Indonesia.</p>
<p>He then spoke about improving debt management and said: “Our economy has been stuck in debt for two decades, paying back loans. Our debt-to-GDP ratio was 74pc two years ago. But now, it is below 70pc. We will lower it further.</p>
<p>“We are diversifying debt products, the Sukuk bond has been started and launching products is being considered.”</p>
<p>The minister stressed that reforms in loss-making state-owned enterprises were underway, along with steps being taken to reduce fiscal strain and invite investment.</p>
<p>“We will complete PIA (Pakistan International Airlines) and Roosevelt Hotel transactions this year,” he asserted.</p>
<p>On pension reforms, the minister highlighted that the increase in pensions had been “linked” to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).</p>
<p>Pointing out that Pakistan was one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, the minister underscored the need for foreign assistance in mitigation, noting the IMF’s $1.3bn <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893900">climate fund</a>.</p>
<p>On social protection, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to helping the underprivileged, stating that Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) helped over 11m children go to school.</p>
<p>He added that 1.5m pregnant mothers and children were given funds, while 250,000 were granted training on financial literacy.</p>
<p>Speaking about the digital sector, Aurangzeb noted that Pakistan’s cybersecurity ranking was rising. “There has been $3.1bn in IT exports in the year’s 10 months, which is 21.2pc more than the previous year,” he said.</p>
<p>The minister proposed raising <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916213/pakistan-becoming-regional-it-hub">IT exports</a> to $25bn in the next five years.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb informed the parliament that the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority had launched a three-year plan for financing small and medium enterprises.</p>
<p>He said that under the SME risk coverage scheme, 95,000 SMEs had received Rs300bn in funding till May 2025.</p>
<p>Announcing measures for the construction sector, Aurangzeb said withholding tax slabs for property buying would be reduced from 4pc to 2.5pc, from 3.5pc to 2pc, and from 3pc to 1.5pc.</p>
<p>He further said that construction loans and mortgage financing for low-cost housing, as well as a tax credit on 10-marla houses and 2,000 flats, would be introduced.</p>
<p>“To promote mortgage financing we want to get on with it, guaranteer system will be introduced,” he said.</p>
<p>The minister added that e-commerce platforms and courier services would also be taxed. “Digital economy should contribute to revenues,” he stressed.</p>
<p>He noted that pensioners below the age of 70 were getting over Rs100m collectively in pensions, so a 5pc tax would be applied to their income.</p>
<p>However, there would be no tax on low-to-medium income pension-earners.</p>
<p>The minister also detailed relief for federal government employees of Grades 1-20, saying they would get a 10pc pay raise. Retired government workers would get a 7pc pension hike, while disabled employees would receive a Rs6,000 convenience allowance.</p>
<p>Expanding on the new classification system for income tax, Aurangzeb said the difference between filers and non-filers would end. Only those who file their tax returns would be able to carry out huge transactions, including sale and buy of cars, and bank accounts.</p>
<p>On the topic of overseas Pakistanis, he noted $31.2bn were remitted to Pakistan, recording a 31pc increase of $10bn.</p>
<p>He affirmed that the government was taking steps for overseas Pakistanis, including an online system, civil procedure laws to prevent fraud, a quota in chartered medical schools, and civil awards for the top 15 senders.</p>
<p>Speaking about the agricultural sector, which comprises 34pc of the economy, Aurangzeb said Rs2.64bn were earned in FY24-25, adding that the National Seed Policy 2025 and the National Agri Technology Policy 2025 had been “nearly approved”.</p>
<p>Announcing the government’s plan to create a “competitive economy”, Aurangzeb said that economic growth in the upcoming fiscal year was expected to remain 4.2pc.</p>

<p>Regarding the fiscal deficit, the government aims for a lower target of 3.9pc of the GDP — or Rs5,037bn — from last fiscal year’s target of 5.9pc. The primary surplus would be targeted at 2.4pc of the GDP.</p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; padding: 89.43% 0px 0px; overflow: hidden;"></div>
<p>The government has set an inflation target of 7.5pc for the next fiscal year.</p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; padding: 81% 0px 0px; overflow: hidden;"></div>
<p>Pakistan’s total revenue for fiscal year 2025 is budgeted at Rs19,278 billion.</p>
<p>After accounting for provincial transfers of Rs8,206 billion, the net revenue stands at Rs11,702bn, representing a 6.7pc increase from the previous year.</p>

<p>The minister also praised the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1887185">Strategic Investment and Facilitation Council (SIFC)</a> for taking forward “strategic brownfield and greenfield projects”.</p>
<p>“Interprovincial and interfederal connection improved,” he added.</p>
<p>Referring again to the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916097/pakistan-agreed-to-ceasefire-despite-having-upper-hand-on-condition-of-more-talks-with-india-bilawal">Pakistan-India conflict</a>, Aurangzeb stressed the need for the country to increase its water reservoirs and ensure water security.</p>
<p>Under the 2018 National Water Policy, he mentioned the goals of 10m-acre increase in water storage, 35pc reduction in water waste and 30pc increase in water-use efficiency.</p>

<p>“Genetic improvement and post-harvest processes will be focused on,” he said, adding that a total of 1,000 agriculture graduates had been sent to China on government-funded programmes. He also announced five new livestock schemes.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb said the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909828/hec-wb-start-review-of-higher-education-development-project">Higher Education Commission (HEC)</a> would be receiving Rs39.5bn for 170 projects, of which Rs38.5bn would be set aside for the provinces.</p>
<p>He added that electric wheelchairs, laptops and other audiovisual aids would be distributed under the programme.</p>
<p>For the IT sector, he said the government had proposed Rs4.8bn for ongoing projects under the Uraan Pakistan plan. The schemes included TV modules, a Pakistan-Korea testing facility, and a printed circuit board facility.</p>
<p>To bridge the illiteracy gap, the minister said Rs9.8bn will be allocated for 11 new Daanish Schools — four in Balochistan, three in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, three in GB and one in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Speaking about the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910377">Public Sector Development Programmes (PSDP</a>), the minister said a total of Rs18.5bn had been earmarked for those, of which Rs3bn were for the prime minister’s scheme to rebuild flood-damaged schools in Sindh.</p>
<p>“A total of Rs4.3bn [have been allocated] for the PM’s Youth Skill Development programme, under which 165,100 young people receive skills training,” he added.</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#what-have-the-elite-done" id="what-have-the-elite-done" title="Permalink"></a>‘What have the elite done?’</h2>
<p>Before the session, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, following a meeting of the federal cabinet, questioned the contributions made to the national exchequer by the country’s elite economic group, ahead of the presentation of the budget for FY26.</p>
<p>“Today, the federal cabinet will discuss the budget and give its approval. In the previous quarter year, the entire nation has faced these challenges. This is in no way an ordinary achievement.</p>
<p>“The sacrifices the common man has made, the burden the salaried class has borne in the previous budget. They say ‘we are salaried [class] but still gave Rs400bn to the treasury […] what have the elite and the wealthy groups contributed compared to us?’,” he added.</p>
<p>“This is a question that the elite, including me, have to answer,” the premier noted.</p>
<p>He further said, “Pakistan is standing at a point where we have to take off,” adding that the country’s stability indicators were satisfactory.</p>
<p>“Be it the inflation rate, be it the policy rate, your exports increased, your remittances have seen a quantum jump, your IT exports have increased, and they have a lot of potential to increase.”</p></p>

            <p><p>The provincial government on Tuesday said it has decided to implement strict rules to improve traffic flow and prohibit parking on Karachi’s I.I. Chundrigarh Road — often known as the city’s ‘Wall Street’ — to tighten traffic regulation enforcement and improve road safety.</p>
<p>Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah issued the instructions after receiving a briefing on traffic management in the metropolis, a statement issued by his spokesperson, Abdur Rasheed Channa, said.</p>
<p>According to the statement, parking will be prohibited on I.I. Chundrigar Road, beginning from Shaheen Complex to the Merewether Tower. CM Shah also directed the authorities concerned to ban parking for all types of vehicles from Muhammad Bin Qasim Road to Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road up to the S.M. Law College.</p>
<p>I.I. Chundrigar Road, a major road in the city’s central business district, is often referred to as Karachi’s “Wall Street”. The road is a significant financial hub, serving as the location for the Pakistan Stock Exchange, major banks, and other financial institutions.</p>
<p>The chief minister was informed by traffic police authorities that parking on pavements and main roads will be banned alike, but motorists will be allowed to park their vehicles on Railway Ground.</p>
<p>Murad said that action should be taken against traffic rules violations and illegal parking, and vehicles with fancy or illegal number plates should be confiscated.</p>
<p>CM Sindh was informed that a crackdown is underway against vehicles with unregistered or non-standard number plates, and only official number plates will be acceptable. Deputy Inspector General of Police (Traffic) Pir Muhammad Shah assured the chief minister that police were taking action to ensure the implementation of traffic rules.</p>
<p>The Sindh government had recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915821">approved</a> a set of changes, including a ban on four-seater rickshaws, mandatory third-party vehicle fitness checks, and sharp increases in traffic violation fines.</p>
<p>The government made it mandatory to acquire fitness certification for both commercial and non-commercial vehicles, and outsourcing vehicle fitness evaluations to third parties. It also decided to ban the sale of tinted windows, fancy lights, and sirens, whether online or at physical shops.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915847">Fine</a> were also imposed. For wrong-way driving, the approved fines were set at Rs200,000 for government vehicles, Rs100,000 for other four-wheelers and Rs25,000 for motorcycles.</p>
<p>Driving a vehicle without a valid licence will cost a fine of Rs25,000 for motorcyclists and Rs50,000 for car drivers. One-wheeling or drifting will result in a Rs100,000 fine for a first-time offence, going up to Rs200,000 and Rs300,000 for repeated violations, the government said.</p>
<p>These decisions were taken in the backdrop of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895007">surge</a> in traffic accidents, particularly involving <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903332">dumpers</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908095">water tankers</a> that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312/iran-says-new-round-of-us-talks-planned-for-sunday' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says new round of US talks planned for Sunday</strong></a>
            <p><p>The sixth round of Iran-US nuclear talks is planned for Sunday, Tehran said as the two sides appear locked in a standoff over uranium enrichment nearly two months into the high-stakes negotiations.</p>
<p>Iran has said it would present a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916072">counter-proposal</a> to the latest draft from Washington, criticised by Tehran for failing to offer sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.</p>
<p>“The next round of Iran-US indirect talks is being planned for next Sunday in Muscat,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from mediator Oman, which has hosted some of the previous rounds, while Washington has said the talks could be held as early as Thursday.</p>
<p>The longtime foes have held five <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912795">rounds</a> of negotiations since April, the highest level contact since President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from a 2015 nuclear accord during his first term.</p>
<p>Trump has said the next meeting was expected on Thursday, although a source familiar with preparations said it would more likely be on Friday or Saturday.</p>
<p>Iran’s top negotiator, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, will be attending the annual Oslo Forum in Norway on Thursday, his office said.</p>
<p>On May 31, after the fifth round of talks, Iran said it had received “elements” of a US proposal for an agreement, which Araghchi has criticised for its “ambiguities”.</p>
<p>Tehran has said the offer failed to include issues raised in previous negotiations including the lifting of sanctions — a key demand for Tehran, which has been reeling under their weight for years.</p>
<p>On Monday, foreign ministry spokesperson Baqaei said Iran would present a “reasonable, logical and balanced” counter-proposal.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#national-interests" id="national-interests" title="Permalink"></a>‘National interests’</h2>
<p>Trump said that the next round of talks could make it clear if a nuclear deal is possible to avoid military action.</p>
<p>In a key sticking point, Tehran has defended its right to enrich uranium as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915388">“non-negotiable”</a>, while Washington called any Iranian enrichment a “red line”.</p>
<p>Iran currently enriches uranium to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1817418">60 per cent</a>, far above the 3.67pc limit set in the 2015 deal and close though still short of the 90pc needed for a nuclear warhead.</p>
<p>Western countries, including the United States and its ally Israel, have long <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1404894">accused</a> Iran of seeking to acquire atomic weapons, while Tehran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes.</p>
<p>In an interview published on Tuesday, Iranian deputy foreign minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said there was no “deadlock” in the talks, and that the next round would be the first in which the parties discuss “any written material”.</p>
<p>“Any negotiations with an international dimension come with their own sensitivities and require a great deal of patience for them to reach a result,” he told the official <em>IRNA</em> news agency.</p>
<p>“What matters to us is that we can safeguard the national interests of the country through these talks, and that is how we proceed.” In a statement issued on Tuesday, a group of Iranian lawmakers accused the United States of turning the negotiations into a “strategic trap” in coordination with Israel.</p>
<p>They said Washington’s “aim is to impose demands through coercion, adopting positions that are insulting and entirely incompatible with the legitimate rights of the Iranian people.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#less-than-satisfactory" id="less-than-satisfactory" title="Permalink"></a>‘Less than satisfactory’</h2>
<p>On Monday, the United Nations nuclear watchdog began a Board of Governors meeting in Vienna that will last until Friday to discuss Iran’s atomic activities and other issues.</p>
<p>The International Atomic Energy Agency meeting followed a report issued by it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914610">criticising</a> “less than satisfactory” cooperation from Tehran, particularly in explaining past cases of nuclear material found at undeclared sites.</p>
<p>Iran has criticised the IAEA report as unbalanced, saying it relied on “forged documents” provided by its arch foe Israel.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Araghchi reiterated criticism of a plan by European powers and the United States to adopt a resolution at the IAEA meeting that would accuse Tehran of non-compliance with nuclear obligations.</p>
<p>“Any ill-considered and destructive decision in the Board of Governors against Iran will be met with an appropriate response,” Araghchi said during a phone call with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya.</p>
<p>Iran has said it would reduce cooperation with the IAEA if the resolution passed.
On Saturday, Tehran announced it had obtained a trove of Israeli intelligence in a covert operation, including files related to Israel’s undeclared nuclear facilities and defence plans.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>It said the information would enable Iranian forces to launch counterattacks should Israel strike the Islamic republic.</p>
<p>Israel — an undeclared nuclear power — has repeatedly threatened that it could attack Iranian nuclear sites in warnings that have escalated since Tehran and Washington began talks.</p></p>

            <p><p>Florence in Italy could hit 39C as hot weather sweeps continent, while parts of South Africa brace for snow</p><p>The severe thunderstorms that have been lashing parts of Europe over recent days are expected to give way to high temperatures this week. Several regions could climb to 10C (50F) above seasonal norms, with Italy braced for the full force of the heat. Florence in Tuscany is forecast to soar to a sweltering 39C on Thursday and across the weekend.</p><p>Germany, France and Belgium will also face hot weather from Wednesday, with widespread highs at least 9C above the June average. Many other parts of Europe are forecast to experience temperatures 5-7C above normal. This is the result of a high-pressure system creating a heat dome over the region, whereby sinking air compresses and warms as it descends, trapping heat near the surface.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/09/weather-tracker-storms-summer-heat-europe-south-africa">Continue reading...</a></p>
