            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911211/dg-ispr-warns-of-swift-and-assured-response-in-case-india-breaks-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>DG ISPR warns of ‘swift and assured response’ in case India breaks ceasefire</strong></a>
            <p><p>Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Thursday warned in an interview with British broadcaster <em><a class="link--external" href="https://news.sky.com/story/pakistan-vows-swift-response-if-india-violates-ceasefire-13368060" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sky News</a></em> that any Indian ceasefire violation would be met with a “swift and assured response” by Pakistan, cautioning that serious escalation could result in mutual destruction.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>On May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">announced</a> that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan. According to the government, forty civilians — including seven women and 15 children — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910733">lost</a> their lives in the Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Sky News</em>, DG ISPR warned that by rooting for war, India was carving out a “recipe for mutual destruction,” adding that the world now recognised the extent of the nuclear threat.</p>
<p>“Any sane player like the USA understands this absurdity and what the Indians are trying to do here,” Lt Gen Chaudhry told the publications.</p>

<p>Talking about India’s actions in Kashmir, he accused the country of trying to “internalise the issue and harassing” Kashmiri people with a heavy troop presence.</p>
<p>“It is a problem that has to be resolved by the people of Kashmir as per the United Nations Security Council resolution,” he said.</p>
<p>He continued: “Anyone who tries to violate our territory and integrity and sovereignty, our response will be brutal.”</p>
<p>DG ISPR warned that a “serious escalation between India and Pakistan would destroy both sides” under the concept of mutually assured destruction — a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy which posits that a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by an attacker on a nuclear-armed defender with second-strike capabilities would result in the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender.</p>
<p>In a press conference <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910381">held</a> last week after the ceasefire was brokered, DG ISPR had cautioned that a conflict between Islamabad and New Delhi “can lead to peril of more than 1.6 billion people.”</p>
<p>“In reality, there is no space for war between India and Pakistan,” he added.</p></p>

            <p><p>US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook and told him not to expand his production facilities in India, but to do so in America.</p>
<p>“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump said during his visit to Qatar.</p>
<p>“I said to him, Tim, you’re my friend, I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now you’re building all over India,” he said, referring to Apple’s plan announced in February to invest $500bn in the US over the next four years.</p>

<p>Trump said he informed Cook that he does not want him to build production facilities in India, and that Apple will be “upping their production in the United States”.</p>
<p>The US president claimed that selling American goods in the world’s most populous country is “very difficult” because India has one of the highest tariff barriers in the world.</p>
<p>However, he noted that while the Asian country looks for a deal on import duties, India has offered them a “no-tariff” deal.</p>

<p>Trump’s remarks came after Tim Cook said earlier this month that the majority of Apple’s products to be sold in the US in the coming months will be sourced from India and Vietnam rather than China, which has been the target of US President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911203/india-has-offered-us-a-trade-deal-with-no-tariffs-trump">highest tariffs</a>.</p>
<p>“We do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin,” Cook said.</p>
<p>The primary production location “for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods products sold in the US” will be Vietnam in the meantime.</p>
<p>Cook noted that the great bulk of all products sold outside the US will continue to be manufactured in China.</p>
<p>Apple is among the most impacted tech firms in the US, with its shares falling by around 5.1 per cent since the tariffs were announced.</p>
<p>Due to low production costs, the majority of Apple products are now manufactured in China.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has repeatedly stated that it wants Apple to move production to the US.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the US and China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910528">agreed</a> to a sweeping rollback of punitive tariffs for an initial 90-day period, signalling a rare moment of relief in their protracted trade conflict and raising hopes for longer-term economic stability.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911219/pm-directs-comprehensive-regulatory-framework-for-agriculture-sector' target='_blank'><strong>PM directs comprehensive regulatory framework for agriculture sector</strong></a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said the agriculture sector was being developed on modern lines to achieve self-reliance and directed the development of a comprehensive regulatory framework for the sector.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900589">second quarter of FY25</a>, the agriculture sector experienced a significantly declined growth rate of 1.10pc compared to 5.80pc the previous year. The prime minister has previously stated his government’s determination to transform the sector on modern lines to achieve self-sufficiency, emphasising its vast potential for rapid economic development.</p>
<p>Chairing a meeting on agricultural sector reforms today, the prime minister stressed that government’s priority for the promotion of modern technology in the agricultural sector. He also directed the relevant department to present a National Agri-Innovation Plan for the agricultural sector.</p>
<p>The prime minister instructed the formulation of a coordinated strategy to develop the agriculture sector in consultation with provinces and relevant stakeholders. He instructed authorities concerned to formulate a sustainable and long-term policy for agro-industrial development to promote agriculture and forestry and help counter the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz directed the provision of agricultural loans to farmers on easy terms and stressed a focus on agricultural research to enhance production. He also called for accelerating ongoing reforms in the certification system for agricultural seed and developing an effective action plan to promote high-quality seeds.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#agriculture-sector-decline" id="agriculture-sector-decline" title="Permalink"></a>Agriculture sector decline</h2>
<p>The deceleration in the agriculture sector can be attributed mainly to negative growth in key crops such as cotton, rice, and maize. Cotton ginning and miscellaneous components showed growth in FY24 due to excellent cotton output but declined in FY25 due to poor cotton production.</p>
<p>Cotton production saw a substantial <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1882981">decline</a> of 30.7pc, with this year’s output recorded at 7.084 million bales, compared to 10.22m bales the previous year. Rice production dropped by 1.4pc, totalling 9.72m tonnes, down from 9.86m tonnes the previous year. Similarly, maize production decreased by 15.4pc, with output falling to 8.24m tonnes from 9.74m tonnes the previous year.</p>
<p>The latest revised estimates indicate a 2.3pc decrease in sugarcane production, totalling 85.62m tonnes, down from 87.64m tonnes last year. The wheat area dropped by 6.8pc from last year, despite having no impact in Q1. Potatoes saw a 14.2pc increase, while other crops grew by 0.73pc.</p>
<p>During a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905396/pm-vows-to-revive-agriculture-through-innovation">high-level consultative meeting</a> on the agriculture sector in April, the prime minister reaffirmed his government’s commitment to revitalising the country’s agriculture sector by promoting innovation, sustainable development, and the active involvement of young experts and key stakeholders to revive the agricultural economy.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz called for tapping into the talent of young professionals and researchers while leveraging the wisdom of experienced experts to guide the process. He expressed concern that cotton production had fallen so low that Pakistan had become an importer while neighbouring countries like India and China had progressed in crop yield.</p>
<p>Referring to Pakistan’s 65 per cent rural population, the prime minister stressed the need to provide meaningful opportunities to rural youth, particularly in agri-tech and entrepreneurship. He noted the absence of patronage for local agri-machinery manufacturers and service companies supporting small farmers, urging that these be brought into a systematic framework.</p>
<p>He directed the formation of working committees on five critical sectors. The meeting highlighted the need to increase domestic and foreign investment in the agriculture sector, while also strengthening the role of financial institutions and facilitating agricultural loans.</p></p>
