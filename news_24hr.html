            <p><p>• Overflowing Indus and Chenab destroy houses, farmland in several districts; stagnant rainwater in Hafizabad yet to be drained<br />
• Authorities asked to prepare for another monsoon spell starting today<br />
• Babusar Road ‘partially reopened’ as search continues for tourists swept away by torrents</p>
<p>LAHORE: Floods in the Indus and Chenab rivers have inundated over a dozen villages in several districts of Punjab, prompting the authorities to evacuate thousands of people to safer locations, while the government has asked rescue departments to brace for urban and riverine floods as well as landslides in light of the new monsoon <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926631">spell</a> starting today.</p>
<p>In the southern districts of Punjab, district administrations issued emergency alerts across different villages as floods in the Indus and Chenab destroyed houses and crops. In Rajanpur, standing crops were destroyed by the Indus, which also impacted Taunsa and D.G. Khan districts.</p>

<p>In Layyah and Taunsa, panic spread after a crack emerged in a ‘guide embankment’ built by the National Highway Authority (NHA) to protect the Layyah-Taunsa bridge. Though the bridge remained intact, the breach submerged Taunsa’s several villages, including Basti Kumharan, Basti Mangotha, and Basti Sohbewala, forcing the residents to flee. The floods in Taunsa also left entire settl­e­ments and agricultural zones submerged, with the rescue and relief operations underway to save lives and property.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people from Bait Ashraf and Jarh Leghari villages in Taunsa displaced by floods, meanwhile, awaited the government’s help, as their houses and the roads came under water, which forced them to relocate to higher grounds.</p>
<p>In Jhang, the raging Chenab River inundated more than 10 villages and destroyed crops and residential areas, besides destroying key road networks.</p>
<p>In central Punjab’s Hafizabad district, rapid erosion along the Chenab’s banks washed away hundreds of acres of farmland. Hafizabad and Sukheke were also affected by stagnant rainwater, which has not been drained for more than 10 days.</p>
<p>According to the PMD, low to medium-level flows are expected in the rivers Jhelum and Chenab due to the expected rainfall from July 29 to 31. It also said flash flooding was expected in the tributaries of the River Kabul and hill torrents of DG Khan from July 29 to 31. The PMD also forecasted a medium-level flood at Taunsa and Guddu in the Indus, while Tarbela, Kalabagh, Chashma and Sukkur are experiencing low floods.</p>
<p>A report by the Punjab Disaster Management Authority on Monday said that 152 citizens have been killed and 539 have been injured in accidents during the monsoon rains this year. 210 houses were affected, and 121 livestock were killed. The deaths were due to lightning, collapse of damaged buildings, drowning while bathing in rivers and electrocution, the report added.</p>
<p><strong>Another rain spell</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Nati­onal Disaster Manag­ement Authority (NDMA) stated that widespread rainfall was anticipated in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir (AJK), with heightened risks of flooding, landslides, and urban flooding in vulnerable districts. The spell, which will start today, will end on July 31.</p>
<p>The NDMA instructed all relevant departments to remain on high alert, pre-deploy flood response teams and equipment, and ensure the immediate clearance of drainage systems.</p>
<p>In Punjab, significant rainfall is anticipated in Sargodha, Hafizabad, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sialkot, Faisalabad, Lahore, Narowal, and adjoining areas. Southern districts, including Dera Ghazi Khan, Rajanpur, and Rahim Yar Khan may receive moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>Torrents in D.G. Khan and Rajanpur could be reactivated with medium flows, while nullahs originating from the Pir Panjal range may also see a rise in water levels.</p>
<p>In KP, moderate rainfall and localised thunderstorms are expected to affect central and lower districts, such as Kohistan, Swat, Malakand, Dir and Buner.</p>
<p>Tributaries like River Swat, Panjkora, Bara, and Kalpani Nullah may swell and contribute to rising flows in River Kabul at Nowshera.</p>
<p>River Chitral and its tributaries may also surge due to a combination of glacial melting and rainfall in Booni, Reshun, and adjacent parts of Chitral Valley. Urban flooding is also anticipated in Peshawar, Mardan, Nowshera, and Abbottabad.</p>
<p>The authority has also issued flood alerts for various areas of GB and AJK, as rainfall is expected in Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, and Shigar, as well as in AJK’s Muzaffarabad, Neelum Valley, and Bagh.</p>
<p><strong>Babusar Road partially reopened</strong></p>
<p>In GB, the Babusar Road was partially <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927139">reop­ened</a> on Monday as a search operation to locate the people swept away by torrents after heavy rains continued.</p>
<p>GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that the Babusar-Naran Highway had “been reopened for one-way traffic”.</p>
<p>He further said, “Several families…have contacted the government about the missing people and appealed for help in their search.” The TV anchor, who was reported to be among those swept away by floods, could not be traced on Monday, but her wrecked vehicle was found by the rescuers.</p>
<p>The Ghanche district administration also made arrangements for the displaced villagers from Kundus valley and Haldi, and provided them tents, food packs, and installed kitchens for them. The government also mobilised machinery to clear roads to the Kundus and Saltoro valleys.</p>
<p>Officials said a tent village with running water and electricity had been set up for the displaced people and damage assessments were underway which would be submitted for compensation. A mobile veterinary dispensary has been set up at the flood site, and a temporary power supply has been restored and all roads in the affected areas are currently open.</p>
<p>The Baltistan Division commissioner arranged 4,500 feet of pipe for the permanent restoration of the drinking water supply to the Kundus affectees and work on the same was in progress, which would be completed in two to three days.</p>
<p>GB Disaster Mana­gement Authority DG Zakir Hussain told <em>Dawn</em> that teams of GBDMA provide relief to affected areas round the clock and machinery had been mobilised to restore roads, irrigation and water channels.</p>

            <p><p>Four people, including a police officer, were killed on Monday after a gunman walked into a skyscraper in central Manhattan and opened fire in broad daylight, officials said.</p>
<p>A fifth victim was also in critical condition after being shot, while the gunman apparently took his own life, Mayor Eric Adams told a late-night briefing at a hospital near the scene of the shooting.</p>
<p>The gunman was caught on camera exiting a black BMW carrying an M-4 rifle, then entering the building, immediately opening fire on a police officer before “spraying the lobby” with bullets, police commissioner Jessica Tisch told the press conference.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He then took an elevator to the 33rd floor of Rudin Management, which owns the building, where the man continued his spree before apparently shooting himself. He was later discovered by officers next to his weapon.</p>
<p>The office tower block at 345 Park Avenue is also home to hedge fund giant Blackstone, auditor KPMG and the National Football League.</p>
<p>Tisch told the briefing that the suspect was believed to have acted alone, but inquiries were ongoing, with the FBI assisting in the investigation.</p>
<p>She identified the shooter as Shane Tamura of Las Vegas and said a revolver, ammunition and magazines were found in his vehicle along with medication bearing his name.</p>
<p>The man had a history of mental health issues, according to Las Vegas law enforcement — but did appear to possess a valid firearms permit for Nevada, Tisch said.</p>
<p>He drove cross-country from the southwestern state in recent days and arrived in New York on Monday, she said.</p>
<p>The incident began around 6pm (3am PKT) when reports of gunfire prompted hundreds of police to swarm a busy office district on the storied Park Avenue, an area popular with tourists and visiting businesspeople.</p>
<p>A worker from a nearby office building wept as she left the area after a local lockdown was lifted, while another described a gunman going floor to floor as staff prepared to leave for the day.</p>
<p>Adams said the fallen police officer, an immigrant from Bangladesh who was 36 years old, was among the dead.</p>
<p>Two other males and a female died, and another man remained in a critical condition, officials said without giving any preliminary motive for the shootings.</p>

<p>Office worker Shad Sakib told <em>AFP</em> that he was packing his things to leave work when a public address announcement warned him and his colleagues to shelter in place.</p>
<p>“Everyone was confused with like, ‘wait, what’s going on?’ And then someone finally realised that it’s online, that someone walked in with a machine gun,” said the witness who wore a grey suit jacket.</p>

<p>“He walked right into a building right next door. We saw the photo of him walking through the same area that I walked through to get lunch here.</p>
<p>“You would think it won’t happen to you, and then it does.” Mass shootings are common in the United States, where a constitutional right to bear arms outweighs demands for stricter rules.</p>
<p>There have been 254 mass shootings in the United States this year, including Monday’s incident in New York, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as four or more people shot.</p>
<p>Police officers deployed a drone near Park Avenue at the height of the evening rush hour as dozens of officers swarmed the area, some carrying long guns and others wearing ballistic vests.</p>
<p>The area is home to several five-star business hotels, as well as a number of corporate headquarters. The United Nations headquarters is nearby.</p>
<p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she has been briefed on the shooting.</p>
<p>The frontrunner in the race for mayor, Zohran Mamdani, wrote on X that he was “heartbroken to learn of the horrific shooting in midtown and I am holding the victims, their families, and the NYPD officer… in my thoughts.”</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927305/officials-grilled-for-letting-tourists-go-to-flood-hit-areas' target='_blank'><strong>Officials grilled for letting tourists go to flood-hit areas</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Communications on Monday grilled the National Highway Authority (NHA) and Motorway Police for not taking preventive measures and allowing a gush of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719/four-tourists-killed-15-missing-as-rains-lash-gilgit-baltistan">tourists</a> to reach hilly areas during torrential rains and flash floods where many tourists <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926918/10-dead-in-gb-floods-as-rescue-operations-continue-need-for-aid-mounts">lost their lives</a> recently.</p>
<p>The committee, headed by Senator Pervaiz Rashid, was briefed by NHA regarding the flood-affected portion of the Indus Highway, damaged during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1708371">Manchar Lake Floods of 2022</a>. It was informed that the segment has been restored as two-lane road.</p>
<p>The committee’s members also referred to the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927139">Babusar Top incident</a>, questioning why the NHA did not take preventive measures to stop tourists from entering the area despite being aware of the risks.</p>
<p>Members pointed out that on the Motorways, if a vehicle is found over-speeding, the driver is detained immediately, his family is left behind, and in some cases, rude behaviour is adopted by Motorway Police officials.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Torrential rains, flash floods recently claimed life of several tourists</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Why similar strict actions were not taken to stop tourists from heading towards hazardous areas like Babusar Top,” a committee member asked.</p>
<p>The committee directed that Motor­way Police officials should be instructed to avoid misconduct with the public. In response, the chairman of the committee recommended summoning the Inspector General of Motorway Police for a detailed briefing on the matter.</p>
<p>The meeting was attended by Senators Zamir Hussain Ghumro, Jam Saifullah Khan, Saifullah Abro, Dost Ali Jessar, Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan, Kamil Ali Agha, Abdul Wasay and other officials from Ministry of Communications and relevant departments.</p>
<p><strong>Deputations in NHA</strong></p>
<p>The committee sought a comprehensive list of 43 officials of (BS-16 &amp; above) serving with the NHA on deputation with details such as names, designations, qualifications, parent departments, duration of deputation, and number of extensions granted.</p>
<p>The NHA chairman informed the committee that out of 20,900 employees, 43 were initially on deputation in the authority, but now the number has been reduced to 39.</p>
<p>A member of the committee termed the situation alarming and said that as per court directives, deputation should not exceed three years, but several officers in NHA have exceeded this limit.</p>
<p>Hyderabad-Sukkar Motorway</p>
<p>A comprehensive briefing was given to committee meeting on the current status of Hyderabad-Sukkar Motorway (M-6) by the NHA chairman.</p>
<p>The NHA chairman told the committee that Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) has indicated to give $475 million for two sections of M-6 (4 &amp; 5) while sections 1 &amp; 2 will be built under PPP mode.</p>
<p><strong>CAREC project</strong></p>
<p>The committee was apprised of the possibility of funds availability for the construction of the Sehwan Bypass under the CAREC Tranche-1 project.</p>
<p>The committee was informed that Sehwan Bypass could not be included in the ADB-funded CAREC Tranche-1 project, which was at the closing stage.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the chairman of Senate standing committee on economic affairs, Saifullah Abro, called its meeting on Aug 1 for deliberations on the communications sector, with a particular focus on the CAREC-Tranche III project.</p>
<p>The committee questioned how all four lots of tranche-III were being given to the same joint venture of — NXCC, Rustam Associates and Dynamic Constructors.</p>
<p>Talking to <em>Dawn</em>, Mr Abro, who is also a member of the Senate committee on communications, said that serious concern was expressed over repeated absence of the secretary of communications from the meeting. He said the committee felt that secretary should have attended the meetings and briefed members on actions taken by the ministry so far on alleged irregularities in the biding process of CAREC-Tranche III project.</p>
<p>Mr Abro said that despite repeated directives, the NHA has failed to provide relevant documents to the committee that could prove innocence of the authority.</p>
