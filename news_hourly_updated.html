                <h2>Security forces kill 33 terrorists in Balochistan‚Äôs Zhob district: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Security forces killed 33 terrorists attempting to infiltrate across the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on Friday, the military‚Äôs media wing said in a statement.</p>
<p>According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), a large group of terrorists belonging to the ‚ÄúIndian proxy <em>Fitna al Khwaraj</em>‚Äù, were trying to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border when they were detected by the security forces in the Sambaza area of Balochistan‚Äôs Zhob district on the night of August 7 and 8.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna"><em>Fitna al Khawarij</em></a> is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>The statement added that the troops effectively engaged and thwarted their attempt to infiltrate, adding, ‚ÄúAs a result of precise, bold and skilful engagement, thirty three Indian sponsored <em>khwarij</em> were sent to hell.‚Äù</p>
<p>A large cache of weapons, ammunition &amp; explosives was also recovered, it added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe security forces of Pakistan remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation‚Äôs frontiers and to eradicate the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,‚Äù the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The country ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025.</p>
<p>Last month, 30 terrorists of an ‚ÄúIndian proxy‚Äù outfit were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922039/30-terrorists-killed-in-north-waziristan-as-bid-to-infiltrate-via-pak-afghan-border-thwarted-ispr">killed</a> as they attempted to infiltrate through the Pak-Afghan border in Hassan Khel tehsil of KP‚Äôs North Waziristan district.</p></p>

                <h2>Workers remittances for July 2025 up by 7.4pc on yearly basis</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Remittances from overseas Pakistani workers went up by 7.4 per cent on year-on-year basis for the month of July, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Friday.</p>
<p>Every month, millions of overseas Pakistanis send money home. These remittances are now a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920470">cornerstone</a> of Pakistan‚Äôs balance-of-payments, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904169">hitting</a> a record $4.1 billion during March alone.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWorkers‚Äô remittances recorded an inflow of $3.2bn during July 2025,‚Äù a press release by the SBP read.</p>
<p>According to the data released by the bank, the inflows were mainly sourced from Saudi Arabia ($823.7 million), United Arab Emirates ($665.2m), United Kingdom ($450.4m) and the US ($269.6m).</p>
<p>Last month, SBP‚Äôs data showed that workers‚Äô remittances <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923069/pm-pleased-as-remittances-rise-by-266pc-to-hit-record-383bn-in-fy25">increased</a> by 26.6pc to hit a record $38.3bn during the fiscal year 2025 as compared to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844949">corresponding period</a> of last year.</p>
<p>It added that the workers‚Äô remittances went up by 7.9pc to $3.406bn in June 2025, compared to $3.158bn during the same month last year.</p>
<p>FY25 proved to be a relatively <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923214">successful year</a> for the government on the external front, with expectations of a current account surplus and the SBP exceeding its foreign exchange reserves target of $14bn by closing at $14.5bn.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Remittances played a crucial role in maintaining exchange rate stability, enabling the central bank to accumulate reserves and make partial repayments of its external debt. While official figures have not been disclosed, interbank currency dealers estimate the SBP purchased over $8bn from the banking market during the year.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854778">study</a> by the Asian Development Bank last year <a class="link--external" href="https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/979881/ewp-733-understanding-drivers-remittances-pakistan.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> that Pakistani migrants tend to remit more when economic conditions are improving back home and when there is a positive association between remittances and domestic economic activity.</p>
<p>The study‚Äôs findings indicate that domestic and abroad economic activity is positively associated with remittances to Pakistan.</p></p>
