                <h2>Aurangzeb in US to advance economic cooperation: finance ministry</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Friday met with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and United States Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer in an effort to strengthen trade ties, according to a statement from the finance ministry.</p>
<p>Pakistan and the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922229/pakistan-us-reach-accord-on-trade-and-tariffs">concluded</a> a critical round of trade negotiations earlier this month, reaching an understanding on a deal that could shape the future of the country‚Äôs key export sectors.</p>
<p>While both sides reached an understanding, a formal announcement is expected only after the US concludes similar ongoing negotiations with other trade partners.</p>
<p>According to the finance ministry, Aurangzeb had a ‚Äúproductive meeting‚Äù with Lutnick and Greer in Washington DC, with both sides satisfied with progress made in enhancing trade ties.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey (Pakistan and the US) reaffirmed their commitment to exploring opportunities to strengthen these ties in all possible areas of mutual benefit,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFinance Minister Aurangzeb emphasised that the US remains Pakistan‚Äôs largest trading partner and underscored Pakistan‚Äôs interest in expanding cooperation in both traditional and non-traditional sectors, including IT and tech sector, minerals, and agriculture, to foster a mutually beneficial relationship.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the finance ministry, both parties ‚Äúexpressed optimism‚Äù that ongoing trade talks would yield positive outcomes and economic benefits for Islamabad and Washington.</p>
<p>US-Pakistan relations saw a major boost when Trump hosted Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House last month in an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093">unprecedented meeting</a>.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Trump ‚Äúlauded Pakistan‚Äôs ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counterterrorism cooperation between the two states‚Äù, a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations said.</p>
<p>In April, the Pakistan Crypto Council <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906732">partnered</a> with World Liberty Financial, a decentralised finance platform backed by United States President Donald Trump, to advance cryptocurrency applications and boost blockchain adoption.</p></p>

                <h2>FO says Pakistan has ‚Äòdismantled‚Äô terrorist outfits amid US designation of group blamed for Pahalgam attack</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs stance against terrorism, saying that the country has ‚Äúeffectively and comprehensively dismantled‚Äù terrorist outfits.</p>
<p>The statement follows the US State Department‚Äôs decision on Thursday to <a class="link--external" href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/07/terrorist-designation-of-the-resistance-front/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">designate</a> a little-known group  called The Resistance Front (TRF) ‚Äî responsible for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> ‚Äî as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) and specially designated global terrorist (SDGT) group.</p>
<p>The April 22 attack ‚Äî which resulted in the deaths of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a> ‚Äî sparked a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military confrontation</a> between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan as New Delhi blamed it on Islamabad, which strongly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">denied</a> the allegations while calling for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral investigation</a>.</p>
<p>According to a <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36xe95g06zo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BBC News</a></em> report in June, the group had initially said it was behind the attack, but later disowned it.</p>
<p>The US State Department claimed that the little-known group was a ‚Äúfront and proxy‚Äù of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).</p>
<p>‚ÄúTRF has also claimed responsibility for several attacks against Indian security forces, including most recently in 2024,‚Äù the State Department said in a statement.</p>
<p>In a statement today, the FO said, ‚ÄúAny linkage with LeT, a defunct organisation <a class="link--external" href="https://nacta.gov.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/proscribed-organizations-06-oct-2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">banned</a> in Pakistan, belies ground realities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan has effectively and comprehensively dismantled concerned outfits, arrested and prosecuted the leadership, and deradicalised its cadres,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan condemns terrorism in all forms and manifestations; zero tolerance, and international cooperation against terrorism are cornerstones of our policy.‚Äù</p>
<p>The FO highlighted Pakistan‚Äôs counterterrorism efforts, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896143">apprehension</a> of Mohammad Sharifullah, who was the ‚Äúmastermind‚Äù of the 2021 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1642871">Abbey Gate bombing</a> at Kabul airport.</p>
<p>The statement further said that the investigations into the Pahalgam incident were ‚Äústill inconclusive‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile the issue under consideration pertains to US domestic laws, India has a track record of exploiting such designations to push anti-Pakistan propaganda with a view to divert international attention from its irresponsible and rogue behaviour, including ongoing human rights atrocities, especially in occupied Kashmir,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The FO‚Äôs statement also urged the international community to ‚Äúadopt objective and non-discriminatory policies‚Äù to address terrorism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTerrorist organisations like Majeed Brigade must also be listed as [an] alias of BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army),‚Äù the FO asserted.</p>
<p>In 2022, an anti-terrorism court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1684132">awarded</a> a combined sentence of 33 years imprisonment to LeT chief Hafiz Saeed in two cases of terror financing registered by the Counter Terrorism Depart¬≠ment.</p>
<p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global money laundering and terrorism financing watchdog, in 2022 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1716183">removed</a> Pakistan from a list of countries under ‚Äúincreased monitoring‚Äù, also known as the ‚Äúgrey list‚Äù, after four years.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt has two concurrent action plans. After a lot of work by Pakistani authorities, they have largely addressed all of the action plan items,‚Äù then-FATF president Raja Kumar said.</p></p>
