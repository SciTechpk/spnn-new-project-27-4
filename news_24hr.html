            <p><p>Flooding at Punjab’s Kalabagh on the Indus river reached a “medium” level on Friday, while low-level floods were reported at four other locations on the river due to heavy monsoon rains and glacial melting, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said on Friday.</p>
<p>Rescue operations continued in Punjab after recent deadly rains wreaked havoc on and claimed at least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924761/section-144-imposed-across-punjab-emergency-in-parts-as-rains-claim-dozens-of-lives-in-past-24-hours">63 lives</a> across the province. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has forecasted that five more such spells of rain are expected in the coming days, leading to rising water levels, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-directs-ndma-ministers-for-climate-planning-to-prepare-comprehensive-disaster-management-plans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The next spell is expected to begin from July 21 and last till July 28, while the fifth is expected in the first week of August, the sixth in the second week of August and the seventh in its third week.</p>
<p>“The flow of water in rivers is increasing due to monsoon rains and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660">glacial melting</a>,” a statement issued by the PDMA spokesperson said.</p>
<p>According to the data released by the Met Office’s Flood Forecasting Division at 1pm, there was a medium-level flood at Kalabagh with “steady” water inflow (447,941 cusecs) and outflow (440,391).</p>
<p>There was a low-level flood at Chashma Barrage and Tarbela Dam, as well as at Guddu and Sukkur barrages in Sindh, as of 12pm. While the water inflows and outflows were falling at Tarbela and Guddu, they were rising at Chashma and steady at Sukkur.</p>

<p>This year’s monsoon intensity “is 60–70 per cent higher than last year, and averaging 65 per cent more than anticipated across the region”, NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik was quoted as saying by <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-directs-ndma-ministers-for-climate-planning-to-prepare-comprehensive-disaster-management-plans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">APP</a></em>.</p>

<p>PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia directed the administration to stay on high alert.</p>
<p>“PDMA Control Room and District Emergency Operation Centres are monitoring the situation 24/7”, said DG Kathia in a statement, urging the public to take necessary precautionary measures, avoid unnecessary travel, and steer clear of electric wires and poles.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, detailing the rescue efforts for floods in Punjab after the province received record rain, he said that “more than 1000 people were rescued along the Potohar plateau, including 398 citizens in Jhelum, 209 in Chakwal, and 450 in Rawalpindi”.</p>
<p>“No loss of life has been reported yet due to anyone getting caught in the floodwater,” the PDMA DG claimed.</p>
<p>The district administration and Pakistan Army personnel participated in the rescue operations, he added. Citizens were evacuated via helicopters in many areas where rescue boats were unable to reach.</p>
<p>DG PDMA stressed that “monsoon rains are predicted to be more than usual this year”, vowing that all resources would be utilised to protect citizens.</p>
<p>Separately, in a statement issued by its spokesperson, Farooq Ahmad, Punjab Rescue 1122 detailed the casualties and damages that occurred due to the recent monsoon rains since June 25.</p>
<p>It said 109 individuals had lost their lives, 438 were severely injured, 307 were given first aid, and 745 people were provided with rescue services.</p>
<p>The Lahore district recorded the most fatalities, with 24 deaths, while 15 died in Faisalabad, 11 in Sheikhupura, 10 in Rawalpindi, eight in Okara, seven in Bahawalnagar, and 34 died in other districts of Punjab.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 stated that most of the casualties occurred in house collapse incidents  — 351 since June 25 — due to dilapidated buildings. It recorded 61 traffic accidents, 22 electrocutions and four lightning incidents, among others.</p>
<p>According to the statement, 15,000 rescue personnel were on high alert across Punjab with 800 boats.</p>
<p>The majority of casualties were recorded in Punjab, the country’s most populous province, with 103 deaths and 385 injuries. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 40 fatalities, Sindh 20, Balochistan 16 and one death each in Azad Kashmir and Islamabad.</p>
<p>Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the NDMA and the climate and planning ministers to engage the provinces for a comprehensive disaster management plan based on the lessons learnt from this year’s devastating rains and cloudburst events.</p></p>

            <p><p>One Balochistan Constabulary officer was martyred and three others suffered injuries on Friday when unidentified people opened fire on their vehicle on National Highway in the Mastung district, provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind said.</p>
<p>In April, three policemen were martyred and at least 16 others were injured in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904388">blast</a> that targeted a vehicle of the Balochistan Constabulary on Mastung’s Dasht Road. There has been an increase in the frequency of attacks against security forces in Balochistan in recent times.</p>
<p>“According to initial reports, the acting deputy superintendent of police’s (DSP) vehicle was targeted,” the spokesperson Rind said in a statement.</p>
<p>The assailants opened fire on the vehicle near the Choto area of Mastung on the National Highway, the statement elaborated.</p>
<p>Rind stated that “a search operation is underway to apprehend the assailants, and security forces have been dispatched to the site of the attack”.</p>
<p>The injured officers were immediately rushed to Shaheed Nawab Ghaus Bakhsh Hospital in Quetta, he added.</p>
<p>On July 16, three people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924597">killed</a> and seven others were injured as a passenger bus was fired upon in Balochistan’s Kalat. Earlier this month, three cops were injured in an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922575/3-cops-injured-in-blast-on-highway-police-vehicle-in-balochistans-nasirabad">attack</a> on a highway police vehicle in Balochistan’s Nasirabad District.</p>
<p>In a separate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923165">incident</a> on July 9, unknown attackers hurled a grenade at a police checkpoint at the Sibi-Harnai railway crossing gate.</p>
<p>The grenade exploded at the post, but no injuries were reported.</p>
<p>On June 21, two personnel of the Frontier Corps were martyred and four were injured in a bomb attack in Kalat’s Mongochar area.</p></p>

            <p><p>Five private companies on Friday proposed routes for the newly announced <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921541">ferry service</a> from Gwadar to the Gulf region, according to the maritime ministry.</p>
<p>On July 1, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs announced an ambitious plan to expand Gwadar Port’s operational capacity by introducing additional shipp­ing lines and launching a ferry service connecting Pak­istan with Gulf Cooperation Council countries.</p>
<p>The move is expected to provide an affordable, direct maritime link for passengers and cargo, particularly benefiting expatriate communities and cross-border traders.</p>
<p>Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry chaired a meeting on the ferry service today to review the “technical and financial aspects of ferry operations”, a statement by his ministry said.</p>
<p>“Five private companies presented their proposals,” the statement added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“The interest of the private sector in ferry service has increased,” Chaudhry said, adding that various routes were under consideration. “The ferry service will promote regional connectivity and trade.”</p>
<p>“The movement of passengers and goods from Gulf countries will become easier,” he noted, adding that the service will highlight Gwadar on the international maritime map.</p>
<p>The ministry also stated that the meeting included instructions to conduct further evaluations of the submitted proposals. “Authorities were directed to ensure that all regulatory, technical, and logistical considerations are fully addressed ahead of the ferry service launch,” it said.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the maritime minister held a phone call with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti and discussed provincial cooperation. Bugti “assured full cooperation in the ferry service project”, according to the ministry.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/dpr_gob/status/1946098676092322165" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on X, the Balochistan government said, “The meeting discussed important matters related to the development of Gwadar, public facilities, and increasing employment opportunities for the youth.”</p>
<p>CM Bugti was quoted as saying that the provincial government was giving “serious consideration” to the ferry service from Gwadar to Oman, which will “facilitate pilgrims and ease travelling for the local population”.</p>
<p>“Assuring full cooperation from the Balochistan government, the chief minister stated that this initiative will prove to be a milestone in strengthening regional connectivity,” the statement read.</p>

<p>The Balochistan government also vowed to provide cooperation and support at every level for the full operationalisation of Gwadar Port.</p>
<p>“All proposed development projects of the Gwadar Port Authority will be fully supported so that Gwadar Port can play a central role in the national economy,” the statement affirmed.</p>
<p>The statement also said that 1.2 million gallons of clean drinking water will be provided daily to Gwadar citizens through a desalination project that will be established under the Gwadar Port Authority, calling it a “significant step toward a lasting solution to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1780993">long-standing water issue</a>”.</p>

<p>CM Bugti was quoted as saying, “The government is committed to providing world-class training to the youth.”</p>
<p>The youth will be taught various skills under the Pak-China Technical Vocational Centre, while the provincial government’s program to train and provide overseas employment to 30,000 youths will be supported by the Pak-China Technical Vocational Centre, the statement added.</p>
<p>Today’s development comes after Chaudhry visited the Gwadar port on Wednesday to review various ongoing development projects.</p>

<p>The country has recently increased efforts on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1883968">commercialisation</a> of the Gwadar Port, which was built more than a decade ago but remains a non-starter, turning the multi-billion-dollar infrastructure facility into a white elephant instead of becoming a transhipment hub.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the government sought the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885214">private sector’s support</a> in routing their cargoes through the port, seeking detailed proposals to enhance trade.</p>
<p>Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had issued directives for devising short- and medium-term strategies to operationalise Gwadar Port effectively within six months. He emphasised the importance of comparing Gwadar’s trade costs with other regional ports.</p></p>
