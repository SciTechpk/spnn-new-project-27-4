            <p><p>A constitutional bench (CB) of the Supreme Court on Monday live-streamed its proceedings for the first time as it resumed hearing a set of review pleas against the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621">top court’s ruling</a> that had declared the PTI eligible for reserved seats.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In its July 12, 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">short order</a>, eight out of 13 judges ruled that 39 out of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621#:~:text=the%20verdict%20stated.-,List%20of%2080%20MNAs,-The%20verdict%20listed">list of 80 MNAs</a> were and are the returned candidates of the PTI, setting it to emerge as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845532">single largest party</a> in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>However, the ruling had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1868333">not been implemented</a> by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860119">National Assembly</a>, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had raised some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859716">objections</a>. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1846084">PML-N</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847508/ppp-takes-cue-from-pml-n-files-review-petition-on-sc-reserved-seats-verdict">PPP</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850678#:~:text=ECP%20files%20review%20plea">ECP</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, a full-strength 13-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin Khan took up the review pleas earlier this month. However, Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi declared the applications as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908809/two-judges-object-as-sc-accepts-review-pleas-on-reserved-seats-for-hearing">inadmissible</a> during the first hearing and were not part of the subsequent proceedings.</p>
<p>Justice Aminuddin has noted that the two judges had not been excluded by the CB itself, but had stepped back voluntarily.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621">detailed verdict</a> on the reserved seats case, which was authored by senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, the SC had observed that the ECP’s numerous “unlawful acts and omissions” had “caused confusion and prejudice to PTI, its candidates and the electorate who voted for PTI”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>It had also castigated the ECP for failing to fulfil its “role as a guarantor institution and impartial steward” of electoral processes.</p>
<p>On September 14, 2024 — the day the government was supposed to lay the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859132">26th Amendment</a> in both Houses of the parliament but could not — the Supreme Court, through a clarification, had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1858957">reprimanded the ECP</a> for not implementing its July 12 ruling in the reserved seats case.</p>
<p>Later on October 18, in yet <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866044">another clarification</a>, Justice Shah reiterated that the effect of an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850580/law-to-sap-pti-strength-bulldozed-through-parliament">amendment</a> made in the Elections Act 2017 in August last year could not undo the reserved seats case verdict.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The bill, titled “Elections (Second Amendment) Act, 2024”, was seen as aimed at <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850590">circumventing</a> the apex court’s verdict on the reserved seats case by barring independent lawmakers from joining a political party after a stipulated period.</p>
<p>A six-judge CB of the apex court was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875874/sc-to-take-up-pti-plea-against-tweaks-to-elections-act-on-dec-4th">set to take up</a> the PTI’s petition challenging those tweaks to the election laws in December 2024. A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1864669">separate plea</a> of the PTI against the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1805488">Jan 13, 2024 ruling</a> denying it its election symbol is also pending before the SC.</p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has appointed Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib as his special assistant on blockchain and cryptocurrency, with the status of a minister of state.</p>
<p>On February 25, the finance ministry had announced it was considering “establishing a National Crypto Council” to adopt emerging digital currencies in line with global trends. It later <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895975">appointed</a> Saqib as chief executive officer of the PPC.</p>
<p>According to a press release issued today, Saqib will now be responsible for developing a comprehensive, FATF-compliant regulatory framework for digital assets, launching Bitcoin mining initiatives, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, finance, and land records.</p>
<p>Additionally, he will also facilitate “licensing and oversight of virtual asset service providers (VASPs)” and champion “investor protection and Web3 ecosystem growth” in the country.</p>
<p><a class="link--external" href="https://www.forbes.com/consent/ketch/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2020/asia/social-entrepreneurs/#1626ed436e1c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According</a> to <em>Forbes</em>, Saqib — who is part of their ‘30 under 30’ list — is the cofounder of Tayaba, which the publication describes as “a social enterprise that aims to provide solutions to the water crisis in Pakistan”.</p>
<p>He also received his MBE in 2023 for contributions to the UK’s National Health Service, the statement added.</p>
<p>An MBE, which stands for “Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire”, is awarded for an outstanding achievement or service to the community which has had a long-term, significant impact.</p>
<p>According to the statement today, this appointment reflected the country’s  “commitment to aligning with global trends”.</p>
<p>“Just as the United States has brought leaders like David Sacks — appointed by Donald Trump as the White House AI and Crypto Czar — into its digital policy framework, Pakistan is taking a forward-thinking approach by empowering a youth leader to help steer national strategy in emerging technologies,” the statement read.</p>
<p>The press release also stated that the country stood at a “critical digital crossroads” — with it consistently ranking in the top 10 globally for crypto adoption, according to the 2023 Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index.</p>
<p>It noted Pakistan currently had 40 million crypto users and an annual crypto trading volume exceeding $300 billion.</p>
<p>Additionally, it added that the “nation produces around 40,000 IT graduates annually and boasts the 4th largest freelancer market worldwide”.</p>
<p>According to Saqib, “Pakistan’s unique demographic and digital landscape offers an unprecedented opportunity to leapfrog into the future of technology—where blockchain and crypto will drive economic growth, innovation, and global competitiveness.”</p></p>

• Both sides reaffirm principled support for ‘core concerns’, including Kashmir dispute; call for Gaza ceasefire<br />
• Premier advocates investments in renewable energy, IT, defence production, agriculture</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: In the first leg of his four-country tour, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday arrived in Turkiye, where he met President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to not only thank Ankara for its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909193/erdogan-conveys-turkiyes-solidarity-to-pm-shehbaz-amid-india-escalation">support</a> during recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tensions</a> with India but also cement bilateral economic cooperation.</p>
<p>“Both leaders reaffirmed their principled support for each other’s core concerns, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute,” said an official press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on Sunday.</p>
<p>In his meeting with President Erdogan, the PM advocated joint ventures and enhanced bilateral investment, highlighting key sectors, including renewable energy, information technology, defence production, infrastructure development, and agriculture as potential areas of mutual interest.</p>
<p>The two leaders also conducted a comprehensive review of the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and reiterated their resolve to elevate the strategic partnership.

Both sides agreed to take steps to achieve the $5 billion annual bilateral trade target agreed earlier by the two leaders.</p>

<p>In addition to bilateral issues, Prime Minister Shehbaz and President Erdogan discussed pressing regional and international developments. They also expressed concern over the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza, urgently calling for an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian access to the affected Palestinian population.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz, who was accompanied by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, expressed heartfelt gratitude to the government and people of Turkiye for their unwavering support to Pakistan during the recent developments in South Asia. He lauded Turkiye’s principled stance and the outpouring support of goodwill of the Turkish people for Pakistan and termed it as a source of great comfort and strength for Pakistan.</p>

<p>The premier highlighted the commitment, courage and the spirit of sacrifice of the armed forces of Pakistan and the resolute patriotism that was demonstrated in an unprecedented manner, which contributed to Pakistan’s victory in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566/marka-i-haq-pakistan-army-names-period-of-conflict-with-india-since-april-22-may-10">Marak-i-Haq</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909913/govt-terms-new-retaliatory-operation-against-india-bunyan-um-marsoos-state-media">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a>.</p>
<p>According to state-run <em>PTV News</em>, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Information Minis­ter Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant Syed Tariq Fatemi also participated in the meeting.</p>

<p>During the visits, he is expected to hold “wide-ranging discussions” with the nations while acknowledging their support during Pakistan’s recent escalation with India.</p>

<p>The visit comes a fortnight after Pakistan and India reached a US-brokered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> following a brief military confrontation. During the conflict, the Iranian foreign minister visited both nations to act as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">mediator</a>. According to the FO’s statement, the PM will have “wide-ranging discussions” with the leaders of the four countries on issues including bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance.</p>
