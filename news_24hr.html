            <p><p><strong>• SBP exec says crypto transactions illegal, cases being referred to law enforcement<br />
• Finance secretary says legal framework will only be introduced if govt legalises crypto<br />
• Pakistan unveils first govt-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve</strong></p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Amid growing official promotion of Bitcoin adoption, both the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) on Thursday said that cryptocurrency remains banned in the country and all its transactions are illegal under current regulations.</p>
<p>During a meeting of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal said that although the prime minister had recently formed a Crypto Council — chaired by the finance minister — through an executive order to explore digital asset policy, a cryptocurrency ban is intact under SBP and SECP regulations.</p>
<p>“There will be a legal framework only when the government formally takes a decision, but the current legal status is that crypto is not a legal tender in Pakistan,” Mr Bosal said, conceding that no parliamentary backing exists for cryptocurrency use.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Mr Bosal also reconfirmed later to journalists that the federal budget would be announced on June 10 and discussions with the International Monetary Fund were ongoing virtually on budget estimates and proposed measures. He said the Asian Development Bank was expected to approve an $800 million loan to Pakistan on June 3.</p>
<p>Committee members expre­ssed confusion over the government’s approach. Mirza Ikhtiar Baig questioned why the public was being encouraged to invest in crypto when it remained legally banned, warning that investors could face serious consequences.</p>
<p>Mohammad Mobeen wondered why the government was dealing with the subject of Bitcoins and cryptocurrency instead of the SBP. He stressed that while the government was calling crypto illegal, it had simultaneously allocated power capacity for mining operations.</p>
<p>Further highlighting the policy inconsistency, he pointed out that Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), had been holding meetings with high-profile global leaders.</p>
<p>Shahram Tarakai said the country’s foreign exchange would flow out of the country very soon through cryptos and the government would then be in a fix.</p>
<p>Other members raised questions about whether the crypto mining would be in government or private sector hands, and noted that illegal hawala channels would likely be replaced by unregulated digital transfers.</p>
<p>Sohail Jawad, an executive director of the SBP, said the central bank had issued a directive in 2024, declaring the legal status of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies illegal, and that stance was still intact.</p>
<p>In fact, the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) is still referring crypto-related cases to law enforcement agencies for further action, he said.</p>
<p>He said a national working group of digital currency had been established and suggestions had also been given to the Pakistan Crypto Council. He said El Salvador was the only country with legalised cryptocurrency in the world, and even that nation was reconsidering the decision.</p>
<p>The State Bank of Pakistan does not recognise crypto assets, which are digital currencies in which transactions are verified and recorded by a decentralised system. The SBP issued a formal notice in 2022 advising the general public to be cautious of and refrain from trading cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p><strong>Need for regulation</strong></p>
<p>The committee discussion on cryptocurrency was triggered by a bill on digital currency regulations proposed by MNA Sharmila Farooqi. She argued that Pakistan needed to regulate crypto to prevent money laundering, especially after its exit from the Financial Action Task Force’s grey list.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Crypto Council was officially launched in March this year to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country’s financial landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Bitcoin Reserve</strong></p>
<p>The debate coincided with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914060/pakistan-unveils-first-govt-led-strategic-bitcoin-reserve">unveiling</a> of the country’s first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib, the newly promoted special assistant to the prime minister on crypto and blockchain.</p>
<p>An official statement released by the Ministry of Finance said the unveiling was held at Las Vegas, United States, at an event for an elite audience that included US Vice President J.D. Vance, and the sons of US President Donald Trump — Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.</p>
<p>“This wasn’t just a policy moment — it was a rebranding of a nation,” the statement said, adding that Mr Saqib conveyed a bold message that Pakistan was no longer defined by its past.</p>
<p>Speaking at the event, Mr Saqib said Pakistan is “being reborn as a forward-looking hub of digital innovation — powered by its youth, sharpened by necessity, and led by a new generation of tech statesmen.”</p>
<p>He added, “I’m not just here as a minister. I’m here as the voice of a generation — a generation that is online, on-chain, and unstoppable.”</p>
<p>A statement issued by Mr Saqib’s office said that while “other leaders talk about potential, Bilal is unlocking it — with bold national moves that put Pakistan at the centre of the global crypto conversation”.</p>
<p>He also announced the establishment of a national Bitcoin wallet, holding digital assets already in state custody — not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signalling long-term belief in decentralised finance.</p>
<p>He also thanked President Trump for his role as a peacemaker in the recent India-Pakistan conflict and for his commitment to crypto adoption.</p>

<p>He will be joined by Yasir who qualified for the finals with a 76.07m throw in the B Qualification round.</p>

Yasir heads into the final ranked ninth.</p>
<p>Arshad took to Instagram today to announce his entry into the final.</p>
<p>“Alhamdulillah qualified this morning for the final competition tomorrow afternoon [May 31] at 1:10pm PKT at the Asian Championships.</p>
<p>“As always I would need your support and prayers,” he said.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914183/hrcp-calls-for-repeal-of-controversial-peca' target='_blank'><strong>HRCP calls for repeal of controversial Peca</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: A report released by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) on Thursday highlighted serious flaws in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889378">Prevention of Electronic Crimes (Amendment) Act 2025</a> and called for the law to be repealed entirely, without accepting any coercive application of its iterations from 2016 to 2023.</p>
<p>Produced under HRCP’s Legislation Watch Cell, the report’s findings were presented by digital rights activist Farieha Aziz at an advocacy meeting held as part of a European Union-funded project. Introducing the session, HRCP Director Farah Zia noted with alarm the recent wave of repressive laws, particularly those undermining civic spaces and being used to suppress dissent and freedom of expression.</p>
<p>Farieha Aziz, who authored the report, pointed out that Peca criminalised vague categories of “fake and false information,” carrying penalties of up to three years’ imprisonment. It also establishes a powerful regulatory authority, a complaints council and a tribunal — all subject to disproportionate executive control.</p>
<p>Additional concerns include the reclassification of previously bailable and non-cognisable offences into non-bailable and cognisable ones, thereby widening the scope for coercive action.</p>

<p>Moreover, the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency has replaced the Federal Investigation Authority, operating without adequate safeguards.</p>
<p>Speaking at the meeting, journalist Adnan Rehmat emphasised the state’s responsibility to protect individuals’ rights, according to a statement issued by the HRCP. He advocated for the decriminalisation of free speech and suggested engaging political parties through broad-based representation.</p>
<p>Journalist Saleem Shahid criticised Peca for allegedly violating constitutional rights to free speech and access to information. He urged journalists and civil society to form a united front to defend these freedoms.</p>
<p>Former BNP-M legislator Sanaullah Baloch underscored that freedom of expression is essential to a strong parliament.</p>
<p>HRCP Co-Chair Munizae Jahangir highlighted the issue of hyper-regulated connectivity in Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan, as well as the pressure faced by journalists operating in these regions and in Azad Kashmir.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>In this context, journalist Asad Ali Toor shared his personal experience of discovering that his family’s bank accounts had been frozen — allegedly in connection with his work — a tactic Munizae Jahangir described as “economic terrorism”.</p>
<p>Digital rights activists Usama Khilji and Aftab Alam called for the formation of a national coalition of civil society members, journalists, and human rights defenders to engage political parties on the rapid escalation of curbs on freedom of expression and opinion.</p>
<p>Supporting the proposal, HRCP council member Farhatullah Babar stressed the need for countering <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911549/session-delibrates-on-combating-disinformation">disinformation</a> while simultaneously protecting the broader rights to free speech and access to information.</p>
<p>Concluding the meeting, HRCP Islamabad Vice Chair Nasreen Azhar proposed that the coalition should identify all laws that conflict with constitutional guarantees of fundamental freedoms.</p>
