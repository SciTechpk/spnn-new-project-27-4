            <p><p>President Asif Ali Zardari <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921423">appointed</a> the chief justices to the four high courts on Monday.</p>
<p>Letters from the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) last week said that Justice Sarfraz Dogar was nominated as the new chief justice of the Islamabad High Court, Justice Rozi Khan Barrech as the chief justice for the Balochistan High Court, Justice Syed Muhammad Attique Shah for the Peshawar High Court and Justice Junaid Ghaffar for the Sindh High Court.</p>
<p>The JCP had held four consecutive meetings to make a decision related to the appointments and, by a majority of its total membership in each meeting, opted to allow the acting chief justices to continue serving the top roles.</p>
<p>Four identical notifications from the law ministry said that the president appointed the chief justices, with effect from the date they take their oath of office, under clause (1) of Article 193 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>Article 193 outlines the process for the appointment of high court judges.</p>
<p>The chief justices are likely to take the oath sometime this week. Sources had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922344/chief-justices-of-four-high-courts-likely-to-take-oath-next-week">said</a> the notifications were expected today and the top judges may take oath the following day.</p>
<p>President Zardari would administer the oath to Justice Dogar at the Presidency, while the chief justices of the other high courts would take the oath from the respective governors.</p></p>

            <p><p>Pakistan and Afghanistan recognised terrorism as a serious threat as the inaugural round of the Additional Secretary-Level Mechanism between the Foreign Ministries of Pakistan and Afghanistan was held in Islamabad on Monday.</p>
<p>The talks are the latest in a series of steps between both nations to improve ties, such as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904628">revival</a> of the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914300">upgrading</a> of each country’s diplomats from the rank of chargé d’affaires to ambassador.</p>
<p>According to a press release from the Foreign Office, the Pakistani delegation was led by Additional Secretary (Afghanistan and West Asia) Ambassador Syed Ali Asad Gillani, while the Afghan side was led by the Director General of the First Political Division at the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mufti Noor Ahmad Noor.
 </p>
<p>“Discussions covered key areas of bilateral interest, including trade and transit cooperation, security, and connectivity. Both sides recognised terrorism as a serious threat to regional peace and security. The Pakistani side emphasised the need for concrete actions against terrorist groups operating on Afghan soil, noting that such groups undermine Pakistan’s security and hinder regional development.”
 </p>
<p>According to the FO, both sides discussed deepening trade and transit cooperation and reviewed the implementation of measures announced to facilitate Afghan transit trade during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905251">April visit</a> of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar to Kabul, including the removal of a 10 per cent processing fee, the provision of an insurance guarantee, reduction in scanning and examination and making the track and trace system operational.
 </p>
<p>The delegations “underlined the importance of enhanced regional connectivity as a catalyst for sustainable growth and shared prosperity”, the FO said, adding that they agreed to work towards finalising the framework agreement for the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway.
 
“The two sides also discussed matters related to the repatriation of Afghan nationals,” the FO said.</p>

<p>According to the statement, Pakistan highlighted its efforts to facilitate documented travel from Afghanistan through the issuance of over 500,000 visas across a range of categories, such as medical, tourist, business, and study, from January 2024 till now.</p>
<p>“Both sides agreed to work together to further strengthen the legal movement of individuals across borders,” the press release read.
 
The delegations reaffirmed their commitment to sustaining engagement and addressing mutual challenges, the FO said.</p>
<p>“They recognised lasting security as a cornerstone for both the region’s optimal development as well as for further advancement of bilateral relations.”
 
The delegations decided to convene the next round of additional-secretary talks at mutually convenient dates.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922611/trump-dispatches-letters-outlining-new-tariffs-on-foreign-nations' target='_blank'><strong>Trump dispatches letters outlining new tariffs on foreign nations</strong></a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Monday that he was slapping 25 per cent tariffs on Japan and South Korea, in his first letters to trading partners ahead of a deadline to reach a deal with Washington.</p>
<p>Trump had said on the weekend that starting from today, he would send a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922286/trump-says-probably-12-tariff-letters-being-sent-out-on-monday">first batch</a> of up to 15 letters to countries informing them that he would reimpose <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810/trumps-tariffs-stoke-global-trade-war-as-china-eu-hit-back">harsh levies</a> that he had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903146">postponed</a> in April.</p>
<p>In near-identically worded letters to the Japanese and South Korean leaders, Trump said the tariffs would apply from August 1 because their trading relationships with Washington were “unfortunately, far from reciprocal”.</p>

 
<p>Trump warned the countries, both key US allies in East Asia, of an escalation if they responded to the new US tariffs.</p>
<p>But he also said he was ready to modify levies “downwards” if Japan and South Korea changed their trade policies.</p>
<p>Later, Trump also announced the US will impose 25pc tariffs on <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Malaysia</a> and <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kazakhstan</a>, 30pc on <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">South Africa</a> and 40pc on <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Laos</a> and <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114813317938414369" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Myanmar</a> in letters posted on Truth Social.</p>
<p>Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Sunday that he “won’t easily compromise” in trade talks with Washington.</p>
<p>Trump originally announced sweeping tariffs on world economies on what he called “Liberation Day” on April 2, claiming the United States was being “ripped off”. Amid market turmoil, Trump then suspended the initial tariffs for 90 days, a deadline that expires on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But the Trump administration has said that the duties will not “boomerang” back until August 1, apparently extending the deadline despite denials from officials.</p>
<p>While the Trump administration has signalled hopes of striking dozens of deals by early July — at one point boasting of “90 deals in 90 days” — there have been limited results so far.</p>
<p>Washington has unveiled pacts with only <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909589">Britain</a> and Vietnam, while the US and China agreed to temporarily <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916482">lower</a> tariff levels on each other’s products that earlier reached three digits.</p>
<p>Later, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that 12 other countries will also receive letters about the new tariffs.</p>
<p>“President Trump will also sign an executive order today delaying the July 9 deadline to August 1, so that the reciprocal tariff rates or these new rates … will be going out the door within the next month and those countries continue to negotiate with the US,” she said during a press briefing.</p>
<p>She added that “in the effort of transparency”, the letter will continue to be posted to Truth Social.</p>
<p>When asked about which other countries would receive letters, Leavitt told reporters to “keep your eyes on Truth Social”.</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#change-their-tune" id="change-their-tune" title="Permalink"></a>‘Change their tune’</h2>
<p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there would be a number of deals coming up.</p>
<p>“We are going to have several announcements in the next 48 hours,” Bessent told <em>CNBC</em> in an interview today. “We’ve had a lot of people change their tune in terms of negotiations. So my mailbox was full last night with a lot of new offers, a lot of new proposals.”</p>
<p>There was no immediate response from the White House on whether Trump would formally extend the Wednesday deadline for the tariffs to snap back.</p>
<p>Asked about Trump’s letters, Bessent said these would inform partners of the tariff rate their products face when trading with the US unless they want to “come back and try to negotiate”.</p>
<p>Bessent told <em>CNBC</em> that he would “be meeting with my Chinese counterpart sometime in the next couple of weeks”. The two sides have so far held high-level talks in Geneva and London. But Washington and Beijing’s pause on tit-for-tat tariffs is due to expire in mid-August.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>On whether he was disappointed in the number of trade deals achieved so far, Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro maintained that he is “happy with the progress we’ve had”.</p>
<p>“Every country that we run a major deficit with is fully engaged,” he told <em>CNBC</em>.</p>
<p>Trump has also threatened another 10pc tariff on countries aligning themselves with the emerging BRICS nations, accusing them of “Anti-American policies” after they <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922519">slammed</a> his duties at a summit.</p>
<p>For now, partners are still rushing to avert Trump’s tariffs altogether.</p>
<p>The European Commission said that EU chief Ursula von der Leyen had a “good exchange” with Trump on trade when the pair spoke on Sunday.</p></p>
