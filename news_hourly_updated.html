<p>The latest fatalities in Israel, reported by Israel‚Äôs national emergency services, raised the death toll to 23 since Friday.</p>
<p>Israeli attacks in Iran have killed at least 224 people so far, including 70 women and children, while over 1,200 have been injured, the health ministry was quoted as saying earlier today by <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/at-least-224-killed-over-1-000-wounded-in-israeli-strikes-on-iran-health-ministry/3599882" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anadolu Agency</a></em>.</p>
<p>More than 90 per cent of the wounded were civilians, including women and children, health ministry official Hossein Kermanpour <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/HKermanpour/status/1934331936912326671" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X.</p>
<p>At least 100 more were wounded in Israel in the overnight blitz, part of a wave of attacks by Tehran in retaliation for Israel‚Äôs strikes targeting the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of sworn enemy Iran.</p>
<p>As the conflict did not seem to calm down, the Kremlin said Russia remains ready to act as a mediator between Israel and Iran, and that Moscow‚Äôs previous proposal to store Iranian uranium in Russia remains on the table.</p>
<p>Before Israel launched strikes on the Islamic Republic, Russia said last week that it stood ready to remove highly enriched uranium from Iran and convert it into civilian reactor fuel as a potential way to calm the crisis.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis proposal remains on the table, it remains relevant. But, of course, with the outbreak of hostilities, the situation has become seriously complicated,‚Äù Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou know that we condemn those actions that have led to such a dangerous escalation of tension in the region,‚Äù Peskov stated.</p>
<p>He noted that the root causes of the conflict needed to be addressed and eliminated, and that the military strikes were escalating the entire crisis to beyond serious levels.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd secondly, we also note a significant consolidation of society in Iran against the background of the bombing that is currently being carried out by the Israeli side,‚Äù Peskov added.</p>
<p>Stating that Russia ‚Äúremains ready to do everything necessary to eliminate the root causes of this crisis‚Äù, Peskov said the situation was ‚Äúescalating more than seriously, and, of course, this is not affecting the situation for the better‚Äù.</p>
<p>Asked about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs remarks to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/netanyahu-reveals-iran-marked-trump-enemy-number-one-assassination-plot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News</a></em> on Sunday that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917243">regime change</a> in Iran could be a result of Israel‚Äôs military attacks, Peskov said that the Kremlin had seen the remarks.</p>
<p>The statement comes after US President Donald Trump yesterday cited the possibility that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, could help.</p>
<p>Search and location operations were underway in the coastal city of Haifa, where around 30 people were wounded, emergency authorities said, as dozens of first responders rushed to the strike zones.</p>
<p>Fires were seen burning at a power plant near the port, the media reported. Video footage showed several missiles over Tel Aviv and explosions could be heard there and over Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Israel‚Äôs military warned of a new missile salvo incoming from Iran. ‚ÄúA short while ago, the IDF identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the State of Israel,‚Äù the army posted on Telegram, using the acronym for its official name.</p>
<p>It said its air defences were working to intercept the threat but advised people to ‚Äúenter a protected space and remain there until further notice‚Äù.</p>
<p>Several residential buildings in a densely populated neighbourhood of Tel Aviv were destroyed in a strike that blew out the windows of hotels and other nearby homes just a few hundred meters from the US Embassy branch in the city.</p>
<p>The US ambassador to Israel said the building sustained minor damage, but there were no injuries to personnel.</p>
<p>British maritime security firm Ambrey said that fires were observed at the power plant in the vicinity of Israel‚Äôs Haifa port, <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>

<p>Israel‚Äôs public broadcaster <em>Kan</em> reported that at least four areas were hit in the latest Iranian attacks on central Israel.</p>
<p>The predawn missiles also struck near Shuk HaCarmel, a popular market in Tel Aviv that typically draws large crowds of residents and tourists buying fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as popular bars and restaurants.</p>
<p>A residential street in nearby Petah Tikva and a school in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish city of Bnei Brak were also hit.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs semi-official <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/06/16/3336347/more-hypersonic-missiles-used-in-heaviest-iranian-strike-on-israel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tasnim</a></em> news outlet termed the latest strikes on Israel the ‚Äúheaviest missile attacks‚Äù since last week. It added that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) had ‚Äúapparently employed the ‚ÄòFattah‚Äô hypersonic ballistic missiles in the latest operation‚Äù.</p>

<p>Iran does not intend to develop nuclear weapons but will pursue its right to nuclear energy and research, President Masoud Pezeshkian said today, reiterating Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1700780">religious edict</a> against weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>Iran had claimed the existence of the <em>fatwa</em> for years before making the text public for the first time in 2010, when it was being accused by the West and Israel of seeking to secretly acquire the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>While asserting that Iran remains opposed to developing weapons of mass destruction, Esmaeil Baghaei, Iran‚Äôs foreign ministry spokesperson, said the Iranian parliament is preparing a bill to leave the nuclear <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1479334">Non-Proliferation Treaty</a> (NPT).</p>
<p>The Iranian president, speaking during a parliamentary session on Monday, also called for unity and solidarity ‚Äúmore than ever‚Äù against the Israeli aggression, <em>Press TV</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/06/16/749935/We-must-stand-united-against-the-criminals--aggression--Iran%E2%80%99s-Pezeshkian" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian asserted that Iran had the right to benefit from nuclear energy and research that served the nation‚Äôs interests, adding that no one had the right to deny this right.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have extended a hand of brotherhood to all Islamic nations ‚Äî for they are all our brothers. Today, most, if not all, of them stand with us and by our side,‚Äù he further said.</p>
<p>The president said the US violated international norms by ‚Äúallowing‚Äù Israel to attack Iran, stressing that Iran never sought war or initiated it.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe enemy cannot remove us or our nation from the scene through violence, killings, and assassinations,‚Äù Pezeshkian said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor every hero who falls, hundreds more will rise to carry the flag and stand against the oppression, injustice, crimes, and betrayal committed by these aggressors,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>On the slain nuclear researchers killed in Israel‚Äôs attacks, Pezeshkian asked: ‚ÄúWhat crime did a scientist commit to deserve being murdered, along with his family, by someone from the other side of the world?‚Äù</p>

<p>The Israeli military said earlier today that it was striking surface-to-surface missile sites in central Iran, adding it was ‚Äúoperating against this threat in our skies and in Iranian skies‚Äù.</p>
<p>Israel has claimed strikes as far away as Iran‚Äôs holy city of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1835205">Mashhad</a> in the far east, 2,300 kilometres from Israel.</p>
<p>Iranian state television reported that at least five people were killed on Sunday by an Israeli strike that hit a residential building in downtown Iran.</p>
<p>Colonel Reza Sayyad, a spokesman for Iran‚Äôs armed forces, threatened a ‚Äúdevastating response‚Äù to Israel‚Äôs attacks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLeave the occupied territories (Israel) because they will certainly no longer be habitable in the future,‚Äù he warned in a televised address, adding shelters will ‚Äúnot guarantee security‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to <em>AFP</em>, residential areas in both countries have suffered deadly strikes since the hostilities broke out, with Israel‚Äôs Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slamming Iran on Sunday for allegedly targeting civilians.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIran will pay a very heavy price for the premeditated murder of civilians, women and children,‚Äù he said, during a visit to the site of a missile strike on a residential building in the coastal city of Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>His remarks came hours after Iranian missile fire killed another 10 people yesterday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a likely Iranian drone killed a woman in Syria, a Britain-based war monitor said, in what would be the first death on Syrian soil since the current hostilities between Iran and Israel began, reported <em>AFP.</em></p>
<p>The drone struck the woman‚Äôs home in western Tartus province, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p>
<p>Iran has executed a man who was found guilty of spying for Israel‚Äôs intelligence agency Mossad, the semi-official <em>Fars</em> news agency reported today, identifying the man as Esmail Fekri.</p>
<p>The execution is the <a class="link--external" href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-hanging-israel-mossad-spy-90089362075772025a0e0da5ee763be0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">third</a> in recent <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/30/iran-hangs-man-accused-of-spying-for-israel-mossad" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">weeks</a> related to the conduct of espionage on behalf of Israel.</p>
<p>Iranian media, including <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1404/03/25/3335833/%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%DB%8C-2-%D8%B9%D8%B6%D9%88-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%AC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tasnim</a></em>, reported on Sunday that police had arrested two suspects over alleged links to Israel‚Äôs Mossad spy agency.

<p>In Iran, a heavy cloud of smoke hung above Tehran after Israeli aircraft struck two fuel depots. Local media also reported an Israeli strike on the police headquarters in the city centre.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt been able to sleep since Friday because of the terrible noise,‚Äù said a Tehran resident who gave her name as Farzaneh.</p>
<p>‚ÄúToday, they hit a house in our alley, and we were very scared. So we decided to leave Tehran and head to the north of the country.‚Äù</p>
<p>Some, however, were determined to stay.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is natural that war has its own stress, but I will not leave my city,‚Äù 31-year-old Shokouh Razzazi told <em>AFP.</em></p>
<p><em>AFP</em> images from Israel‚Äôs Haifa, meanwhile, also showed a column of smoke rising on Sunday evening following an Iranian missile barrage.</p>

<p>The military said rescue teams ‚Äúhave been dispatched to several hit sites in Israel‚Äù, while the fire services reported rescuers heading to a building on the coast that sustained a ‚Äúdirect hit‚Äù.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, in Bat Yam, first responders wearing helmets and headlamps picked through a bombed-out building.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere was an explosion and I thought the whole house had collapsed,‚Äù said Bat Yam resident Shahar Ben Zion.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was a miracle we survived.‚Äù</p>

<p>In Washington, two US officials told <em>Reuters</em> that Trump had vetoed an Israeli plan in recent days to kill Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe found out that the Israelis had plans to hit Iran‚Äôs supreme leader. President Trump was against it, and we told the Israelis not to,‚Äù a US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>When asked about the <em>Reuters</em> report, Netanyahu <a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/netanyahu-reveals-iran-marked-trump-enemy-number-one-assassination-plot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Fox News</em></a> on Sunday: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so many false reports of conversations that never happened, and I‚Äôm not going to get into that.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe do what we need to do,‚Äù he told <em>Fox</em>‚Äôs ‚ÄòSpecial Report With Bret Baier‚Äô.</p>
<p>Asked whether <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917243">regime change</a> in Iran was one of the objectives of Israel‚Äôs strikes, Netanyahu said that ‚Äúit certainly could be the result, because the Iran regime is very weak‚Äù.</p>
<p>In the same interview, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/netanyahu-trump-iran-fox-news-b2770483.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Independent</a></em> reported, Netanyahu claimed that Iran attempted to assassinate Trump twice ‚Äúthrough proxies‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThrough their intel, yes; they want to kill him,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs enemy number one,‚Äù the Israeli premier said, referring to the US president.</p>
<p>Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20shifting%20stance%20around%20the%20Israeli%20strikes%2C%20which%20he%20called%20%E2%80%9Cexcellent%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9Cvery%20successful%E2%80%9D%20in%20a%20series%20of%20media%20interviews%20on%20Friday">lauded Israel‚Äôs offensive</a> but said Washington had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917285#:~:text=Trump%20distances%20US%20from%20strikes%20on%20Iran%2C%20warns%20against%20attacks%20on%20it%20in%20%E2%80%98any%20way%E2%80%99">nothing to do</a> with it, while threatening to unleash ‚Äúthe full strength and might‚Äù of the US military if Iran attacked American interests.</p>
<p>However, seemingly contradicting his ally, Netanyahu claimed that American pilots were shooting down drones headed towards Israel. In the same interview, he also said that he and Trump were ‚Äúfully coordinated‚Äù.</p>
<p>Trump has urged the two foes to ‚Äúmake a deal‚Äù, adding, however, that ‚Äúsometimes they have to <a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-israel-iran-have-fight-out-believes-deal-possible" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fight it out</a>‚Äù first.</p>
<p>He <a class="link--external" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-us-gets-involved-israel-iran-conflict/story?id=122865561" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>ABC News</em></a> on Sunday that he would be ‚Äúopen‚Äù to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, being a mediator. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible we could get involved‚Äù in the ongoing battle in the Middle East, he said.</p>
<p>Two US officials said on Friday that the US military had helped shoot down Iranian missiles that were headed toward Israel, according to <em>Reuters</em>. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/after-sitting-out-the-iran-attack-u-s-steps-in-to-help-israel-intercept-missiles-16749866" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> the same.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi maintained Tehran had ‚Äúsolid proof‚Äù that US forces had supported Israel in its attacks.</p>
<p>He also told a meeting of foreign diplomats that Iran‚Äôs actions were a ‚Äúresponse to aggression‚Äù. ‚ÄúIf the aggression stops, naturally our responses will also stop,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Iran scrapped <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">planned</a> nuclear <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903561">talks</a> with the United States, saying it was ‚Äúmeaningless‚Äù to negotiate while under fire.</p></p>

                <h2>SBP maintains 11pc interest rate amid Mideast conflict</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) maintained its policy rate on Monday at 11 per cent, after many analysts cited inflation risks from rising global commodity prices amid Iran-Israel tensions.</p>
<p>The central bank‚Äôs policy rate, after being slashed by 1,000bps from 22pc since June 2024 in seven intervals, was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908601">cut to 11pc</a> last month.</p>
<p>Several brokerages had initially expected a cut but revised their forecasts after the Israeli strikes sparked fears of a broader conflict.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 11 per cent,‚Äù the SBP said in a statement.</p>
<p>The committee noted that the recent uptick in inflation in May <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914976">to 3.5pc</a> year-on-year was in line with its expectation, whereas core inflation declined ‚Äúmarginally‚Äù.</p>
<p>The headline inflation had hit an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908067">all-time low</a> of 0.3pc YoY after declining for several months from <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1757288">around 40pc</a> in May 2023.</p>
<p>The escalating hostilities after Israel‚Äôs attacks on Iran on Friday had triggered a sharp spike in oil prices ‚Äî a worry for Pakistan given the broader impact on imported inflation from a potentially prolonged conflict and tightening of crude supplies.</p>
<p>Eleven of 14 respondents in a snap poll by <em>Reuters</em> expected the SBP to leave the benchmark rate unchanged at 12pc. Two forecast a 100 basis-point (bps) cut and one predicted a 50bps cut.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere remains an upside risk of a rise in global commodity prices in light of geopolitical tensions, which could mark a return to inflationary pressures,‚Äù said Ahmad Mobeen, senior economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p>
