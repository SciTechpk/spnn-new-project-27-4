                <h2>Nepra slashes uniform tariff by Rs1.89 for Aug-Oct</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Thursday notified a decrease of Rs1.89 in the uniform tariff for the next three months.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/Ex-WAPDA%20DISCOS/2025/TRF-100%20XWDISCOS%20PERIODIC%20ADJUSTMENT%20FY%202024-25%2007-08-2025%2012380-83.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a> dated August 7 and available with <em>Dawn.com</em> said that the authority ‚Äúdecided to allow the application of instant quarterly adjustments on the consumers of K-Electric as well, with the same applicability period.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAccordingly, the instant quarterly adjustment of negative Rs1.8881/kWh (per kilowatt hour) shall also be charged from the consumers of K-Electric except life line and prepaid consumers, to be recovered in a period of three months [from] August 2025 to October 2025.‚Äù</p>
<p>Nepra stated that this discount will be applied to bills for the applicable period issued before the notification, adding that distribution companies (Discos) will comply with court orders.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nepra also notified a negative fuel cost adjustment (FCA) of Rs0.78 per unit for consumers of all ex-Wapda distribution companies (XWDiscos) except for K-Electric (KE) in their bills for August.</p>
<p>According to a separate Nepra <a class="link--external" href="https://nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/Ex-WAPDA%20DISCOS/2025/TRF-100%20XWDISCOS%20FCA%20JUN%202025%2007-08-2025%2012350-66.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a> ‚Äî also dated August 7 and available with <em>Dawn.com</em> ‚Äî the authority decided on an FCA of Rs0.78 for the month of June 2025 based on variations in fuel charges in the approved tariffs of XWDiscos.</p>
<p>Nepra decided that the FCA ‚Äúshall be applicable to all consumer categories except lifeline consumers, protected consumers, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and pre-paid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for pre-paid tariff‚Äù, the notification read.</p>
<p>The notification stated that XWDiscos would reflect the June FCA in the billing month of August 2025, which would be shown separately on consumers‚Äô bills based on the units billed to them in June.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn case any bills of August 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in [the] subsequent month,‚Äù Nepra added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile effecting the Fuel Charges Adjustment, the concerned XWDiscos shall keep in view and strictly comply with the orders of the courts, notwithstanding this order.‚Äù</p>
<p>In another notification from today, Nepra replied to a request from the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA-G) seeking a monthly FCA for June, finding that based on the information provided, the actual pool fuel cost was Rs.7.68 per kilowatt hour (kWh) against the reference fuel cost component of Rs.8.3341 per kWh</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe actual fuel charges, as claimed by CP–†–ê, for the June 2025 decreased by Rs.0.65 per kWh as compared to the reference fuel charges,‚Äù the notification read.</p>
<p>Today‚Äôs notifications come in the wake of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928756">Nepra hearing</a> discussing complaints of overbilling and requests for a negative FCA.</p>
<p>The regulator had called the public hearing on the request of XWDiscos seeking a negative quarterly adjustment of Rs1.80 per unit to refund about Rs53.4 billion to consumers from August to October. The refund stems from savings in capacity payments during the fourth quarter (April-June) of FY2025.</p></p>

                <h2>NA passes bill to establish Pakistan Land Port Authority</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The National Assembly passed the Pakistan Land Port Authority Bill 2025 on Thursday to facilitate the movement of goods and people across border crossing points.</p>
<p>With the bill‚Äôs approval, Pakistan would become the third South Asian country, after Bangladesh and India, to have a land port authority. The Bangladesh Land Port Authority was created in 2002, while India did so in March 2012.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe House discussed and passed the Pakistan Land Port Authority Bill, 2025,‚Äù the NA‚Äôs official X account said. The bill was moved by Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry on behalf of Interior Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi.</p>
<p>Once approved by the Senate and signed by President Asif Ali Zardari, the bill will establish the Pakistan Land Port Authority, which would function as a statutory body responsible for inter-agency coordination to facilitate the movement of goods and people across border crossing points.</p>
<p>As MNA Ali Zahid, who was chairing the session, ordered the clause-by-clause reading of the bill, PPP‚Äôs Syed Naveed Qamar noted that his party had reservations on some clauses.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúThe legislative committee of the party went through the bill and suggested a whole number of amendments in the bill to make it a better authority,‚Äù Qamar, chairman of the NA‚Äôs Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, said.</p>
<p>‚Äú[‚Ä¶] We have accepted the bill after going through a lot of deliberations and negotiations with the committee,‚Äù Qamar noted.</p>
<p>On the invitation of Zahid, Qamar read out amendments to at least 12 clauses of the legislation, each of which Chaudhry said he had no objection to. They were individually moved before the House and voted in favour of, and subsequently, the bill was passed as well.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#the-pakistan-land-port-authority-bill" id="the-pakistan-land-port-authority-bill" title="Permalink"></a>The Pakistan Land Port Authority Bill</h2>
<p>The PPP government made the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/775056/land-port-authority-for-cross-border-trade">first attempt</a> to establish a land port authority in 2012 under the ambit of the commerce ministry, while the PTI government made the <a class="link--external" href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2335944/plpa-to-start-operation-in-february-2022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">second attempt</a> in 2021.</p>
<p>The PML-N government had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1287704/formation-of-land-port-authority-discussed">discussed</a> the matter during its previous tenure in 2016, with various models of upgraded border posts for covered cargo at Jamrud, Taftan and Sost mulled.</p>
<p>In December 2024, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar moved the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.na.gov.pk/uploads/documents/6763fef237324_339.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bill</a> on behalf of Naqvi, but at the time, Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah had not referred it to the relevant committee.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The proposed legislation will provide a framework for the declaration, regulation, security and oversight of all land ports for promoting trade, fostering free competition, implementing border control and protecting the country‚Äôs strategic interests.</p>
<p>The port authority will establish a robust mechanism to carry out effective coordination with border agencies for trade facilitation in pursuance of commitments under international agreements and conventions for improved land port efficiency and regional port competitiveness.</p>
<p>The bill also proposes the establishment of a 16-member governing council for supervising the authority.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no single agency for the coordinated functioning of various government authorities and service providers at international border points. This lack of coordination sometimes causes a delay in the flow of goods and passengers.</p>
<p>High-tech equipment is also needed to be installed at land ports to check illegal immigration and smuggling of goods.</p></p>
