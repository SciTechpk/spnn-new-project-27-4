            <p><p>Police on Monday fired tear gas and used water cannons to disperse protesters marching towards the Chief Minister’s House in Karachi to demand promotions and pay raises, causing traffic snarls in several areas.</p>
<p>According to South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Syed Asad Raza, the police took action as negotiations among the representatives of the employees and officials failed.</p>
<p>He told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “The Sindh Employees’ Alliance (SEA) — an alliance of different departments of Sindh government employees — were marching towards the Chief Minister’s House.</p>
<p>“The SEA has made three major demands, including an increase of 70 per cent salaries and pension of Sindh employees of Sindh from grade 1 to 22, granting DRA (disparity reduction allowance) of 50pc to all employees of the same grades, and group insurance and benevolent fund after retirement to all employees of the said grades as per pattern of Balochistan government.”</p>

<p>DIG Raza said that the leaders of the alliance held talks with officials, including with him, Planning and Development Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, Karachi commissioner and finance secretary at the Commissioner’s office.</p>
<p>“The talks failed as there was no agreement,” he said, adding that the protesters gathered outside the Karachi Press Club in the morning and planned to move towards the CM House.</p>
<p>The roads near the CM House were already barricaded by the law enforcement agencies, he said, adding that police used water cannons to disperse protesters marching towards the Aiwan-i-Saddar Road, near the Governor House.</p>
<p>Witnesses and protesting leaders told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the police used tear gas shells as well.</p>
<p>“They were dispersed and diverted towards the venue of the protest at the Karachi Press Club after the police action,” DIG Raza said, adding that no one was arrested.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media outside the KPC, SEA’s Ashraf Khaskheli, Zamir Chandio, and other leaders said the police resorted to “torture” while dispersing the protesters.</p>
<p>They said that they would plan a future course of action and were planning to move towards Bilawal House in Clifton for their demands.</p>
<p>The leaders claimed that the Minister Nasir Shah had “accepted” their demands, but Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah sought three days for talks.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Nasir Shah told the media that the Sindh government would try to address the legitimate demands of the employees.</p>
<p>“It has been a priority of the PPP-led government to provide jobs to the youth,” Nasir said, adding that he would present the demands before CM Murad.</p>
<p>He further said that while everyone had the right to protest, such protests should not happen as they cause inconvenience to the general public.</p>
<p>Separately,  South SSP (Traffic) Suhai Aziz told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “Four main roads, namely Aiwan-i-Saddar, Dr Ziauddin Ahmad Road, Din Muhammad Wafai Road and Sarwar Shaheed, have been closed by district police.”</p>
<p>The traffic police chief said that 4pm to 7pm were considered peak hours when “traffic is moving bumper to bumper”.</p>
<p>“Due to the closure of the four major roads, there is a major impact on adjacent roads like I.I. Chundrigar Road, Abdullah Haroon, M.T. Khan and Saddar,” she added.</p>
<p>According to traffic alerts issued by the Karachi police, the roads were closed due to “security reasons”. The alerts said, “Traffic from PIDC Chowk is being diverted towards Club Road, and from State Life Building towards B. Mountain Road,” adding, “Traffic from Sultanabad Chowki is being directed towards Mai Kolachi Road and Boat Basin.</p>
<p>“Traffic from Fountain Chowk is being diverted towards Zainab Market, and from Thana Gali towards M.R. Kiani Chowrangi,” they added.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921230/pakistan-urges-india-to-resume-functioning-of-iwt-after-hague-courts-supplemental-award' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan urges India to resume functioning of IWT after Hague court’s supplemental award</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Monday welcomed the decision by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague to issue a “supplemental award” in the Indus Waters case, urging India to resume the functioning of the Treaty, which it has held in abeyance since May.</p>
<p>According to the PCA’s rules, a supplemental award is an additional ruling issued by a court or tribunal after its initial decision, usually to address a specific issue that wasn’t fully resolved or to clarify certain points, such as jurisdiction, competence, or interpretation of a treaty or agreement.</p>
<p>India in April held the Indus Waters Treaty in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">abeyance</a> following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">termed</a> any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the <a class="link--external" href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTs/Volume%20419/volume-419-I-6032-English.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IWT</a> had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.</p>
<p>“In a supplemental award announced on 27 June 2025, the Court of Arbitration hearing the Pakistan-India dispute over Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects has found that its competence remains intact, and that it has a continuing responsibility to advance these proceedings in a timely, efficient, and fair manner,” the FO said in today’s statement.</p>
<p>“The Court of Arbitration decided to announce this supplemental award in the wake of India’s illegal and unilateral announcement to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance.”</p>
<p>It added that the award “vindicates Pakistan’s position that the Indus Waters Treaty remains valid and operational, and that India has no right to take unilateral action about it”.</p>
<p>The FO urged India to “immediately resume the normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty, and fulfil its treaty obligations, wholly and faithfully.”</p>

<p>Pakistan earlier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920611/pakistan-hails-hague-courts-supplemental-award-in-indus-waters-case-says-india-cant-sideline-arbitration-process">welcomed</a> the decision by the PCA to issue a “Supplemental Award of Competence” in the Indus Waters case, reiterating that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.</p>
<p>According to the government’s statement, Pakistan welcomed the PCA’s decision and stated that the court affirmed its competence despite India’s unilateral action against the IWT.</p>
<p>“Pakistan looks forward to receiving the court’s award on the first phase on the merits in due course following the hearing that was held in Peace Palace in The Hague in July 2024,” the statement read.</p>
<p>“The high priority, at this point, is that India and Pakistan find a way back to a meaningful dialogue, including on the application of the Indus Waters Treaty,” the government said, reiterating remarks made by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that Pakistan was “ready to engage in a meaningful dialogue with India on all outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism”.</p>
<p>The Indian Ministry for External Affairs (MEA) had “categorically rejected” the PCA’s supplemental award and stated that it did not recognise the court itself, according to Indian newspaper <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-categorically-rejects-court-of-arbitrations-supplemental-award-on-kishenganga-ratle-hydropower-projects/article69745841.ece" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Hindu.</a></em></p>
<p>“India has never recognised the existence in law of this so-called Court of Arbitration, and India’s position has all along been that the constitution of this so-called arbitral body is in itself a serious breach of the Indus Waters Treaty and consequently any proceedings before this forum and any award or decision taken by it are also for that reason illegal and per se void,” the ministry maintained.</p>
<p>According to <em>The Hindu</em>, the MEA said that after the Pahalgam attack, India exercised “its rights as a sovereign nation under international law” and placed the IWT in abeyance “until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism”. The ministry additionally described the Court of Arbitration’s latest declarations as a “charade at Pakistan’s behest”.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#treaty-remains-in-force" id="treaty-remains-in-force" title="Permalink"></a>‘Treaty remains in force’</h2>
<p>According to a <a class="link--external" href="https://pcacases.com/web/sendAttach/76022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> from the PCA, the court found that it was not open to India to suspend the IWT or hold it in abeyance unilaterally.</p>
<p>“The Court first considered the terms of the Treaty (IWT), which do not provide for the unilateral ‘abeyance’ or ‘suspension’ of the Treaty; rather, according to its terms, the Treaty continues in force until terminated with the mutual consent of India and Pakistan,” the press release read.</p>
<p>“The Court found that the terms of the Treaty, read in light of the Treaty’s object and purpose, do not allow either Party, acting unilaterally, to hold in abeyance or suspend an ongoing dispute settlement process, given that to do so would fundamentally undermine ‘the value and efficacy of the Treaty’s compulsory third-party dispute settlement process’.”</p>
<p>During the court proceedings, the PCA noted that it was not open to India to unilaterally hold the IWT in abeyance “regardless of how India’s position was characterised or justified under international law”.</p></p>

            <p><p>Diplomatic talks between Washington and Tehran cannot resume unless the US rules out further strikes on Iran, its deputy foreign minister <a class="link--external" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20r18x8x05o" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the <em>BBC</em> late Sunday.</p>
<p>Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the British broadcaster that the US had signalled it wants to return to the negotiating table, a week after it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">struck</a> three Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>“We have not agreed to any date, we have not agreed to the modality,” said Takht-Ravanchi.</p>
<p>“Right now we are seeking an answer to this question. Are we going to see a repetition of an act of aggression while we are engaging in dialogue?”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>The US needed to be “quite clear on this very important question”, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said he was not offering Iran anything nor talking to it “since we totally obliterated” the country’s nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>“I am not offering Iran anything, unlike Obama,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>The two countries were in talks over Tehran’s nuclear programme when Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">hit</a> Iranian nuclear sites and military infrastructure earlier this month, with the US joining by bombing three nuclear sites — Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan — on June 21.</p>
<p>At least 935 people were killed in Iran during its 12-day war with Israel, Iranian state media reported today, nearly a week since a ceasefire took hold. “During the 12-day war waged by the Zionist regime against our country, 935 martyrs have been identified so far,” the official <em>IRNA</em> news agency quoted judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir as saying, adding that the death toll included 132 women and 38 children.</p>
<p>The deputy minister revealed to the <em>BBC</em> that the US had signalled it did “not want to engage in regime change” by targeting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>
<p>Takht-Ravanchi also said Iran should still be allowed to enrich uranium.</p>
<p>“The level of that can be discussed, the capacity can be discussed, but to say that you should not have enrichment, you should have zero enrichment, and if you do not agree, we will bomb you, that is the law of the jungle,” he said.</p>
<p>Israel claims that Iran’s nuclear programme is close to producing a bomb, whereas Tehran says it is for peaceful purposes.</p>
<p>It is not clear yet how much damage the strikes inflicted on Iran’s nuclear facilities, which Trump had said were “totally obliterated”.</p>
<p>UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said Iran would probably be able to begin to produce enriched uranium “in a matter of months”.</p>
<p>Takht-Ravanchi said he did not know how long it would take.</p>
<p>Under a 2015 deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium below 3.67 per cent purity for fuel for commercial nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1406529">abandoned</a> the agreement in 2018 and Iran responded by producing uranium enriched to 60 pc — above levels for civilian usage but still below weapons grade.</p>
<p>That material, if further refined, would theoretically be sufficient to produce more than nine nuclear bombs.</p></p>
