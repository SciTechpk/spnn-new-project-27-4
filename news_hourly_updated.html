                <h2>7 dead, 6 injured in GB‚Äôs Danyor as landslide hits volunteers restoring water supply</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least seven volunteers died and six were injured early on Monday when a landslide hit individuals working at a water channel in Gilgit-Baltistan‚Äôs (GB) Danyor city, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate cha¬≠nge and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660/situationer-unprecedented-melting-in-g-b">melting glaciers</a> have become more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921009/at-least-8-dead-13-injured-in-rain-related-incidents-across-gb-punjab-and-sindh-officials#:~:text=two%20sisters%20died%20after%20being%20swept%20away">late June</a>.</p>
<p>The situation worsened when deadly floods <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20so%20far%2C%2010%20fatalities%20and%20four%20injuries%20have%20been%20reported">10 deaths</a> have been confirmed across the region, with a dozen tourists <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928659/funeral-held-in-absentia-for-missing-tourists-in-gbs-babusar-after-14-days-of-search-efforts">missing</a>.</p>
<p>Thirteen volunteers, mainly young people, were attempting to restore the water supply in the main water channel from Danyor nullah to Danyor town, which had been damaged due to the recent floods, when the landslide hit at 2am today.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThirteen volunteers restoring the water supply were buried under the rubble,‚Äù Gilgit‚Äôs Rescue 1122 said in a statement.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Stating the casualties, it said the injured were taken to a hospital. District Emergency Officer (operations) Abdul Basit was present at the site to supervise the restoration, Rescue 1122 added.</p>
<p>Muhammad Akbar, one of the residents who took part in the rescue operations, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the bodies and injured had been moved to ‚Äúvarious hospitals in Gilgit and Danyor‚Äù.</p>
<p>On July 22, a flash flood in Danyor nullah <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930#:~:text=Rescue%201122%20said%20a%20flash%20flood%20in%20Danyor%20nallah%20inundated%20residential%20communities">inundated</a> residential communities and damaged crops and irrigation channels. The deluge also damaged link roads and suspension bridges, cutting road links to affected areas.</p>
<p>Hussain Akbar Shah, another local, said thousands of Danyor residents were facing a shortage of drinking water and irrigation water as the valley depended on water from the nullah.</p>
<p>A statement by the GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq stated that the total number of volunteers was 15, out of whom seven were confirmed dead.</p>
<p>An emergency has been declared at hospitals in Gilgit, the spokesperson added. ‚ÄúOur hearts are saddened by this unfortunate accident. Gilgit is in a state of mourning,‚Äù Faraq said.</p>

<p>Funeral prayers were later held for the volunteers who died in the incident. Residents also protested at Danyor Chowk against the incident, holding the government responsible for it.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters, area elders led by former GB minister Muhammad Iqbal said the government had failed to res¬≠tore the disrupted water supply despite repeated assurances.</p>
<p>The elders noted that although residents had managed to temporarily restore the pipeline, subsequent flooding destroyed it again, while the government had not started work on it. The protesters demanded that the government take action, or they would launch protests.</p>
<p>GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan expressed his condolences on the incident and announced compensation for the bereaved families.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe families of those who died in the Danyor nullah [incident] will receive compensation as per the government policy,‚Äù CM Gulbar said, directing that the wounded be provided with the best medical treatment.</p></p>

                <h2>Award-winning Al Jazeera journalist Anas Al Sharif, 3 colleagues killed in targeted Israeli airstrike</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prominent <em>Al Jazeera</em> journalist Anas Al Sharif, who had previously been threatened by Israel, was among four colleagues in an Israeli airstrike on Sunday, in an attack widely condemned by media and rights groups.</p>
<p>Israel‚Äôs military said it targeted and killed Al Sharif, alleging he had ‚Äúheaded a Hamas cell and was involved in rocket attacks against Israel‚Äù.</p>
<p><em>Al Jazeera</em> rejected the claim and said that before his death, Al Sharif had also dismissed earlier claims by Israel that he was connected to Hamas.</p>
<p>Al Sharif, aged 28, was among a group of four <em>Al Jazeera</em> journalists and an assistant who died in a strike on a tent near Shifa Hospital in eastern Gaza City, Gaza officials and <em>Al Jazeera</em> said. An official at the hospital said two other people were also killed in the strike.</p>
<p>Calling Al Sharif ‚Äúone of Gaza‚Äôs bravest journalists‚Äù, <em>Al Jazeera</em> said the attack was a ‚Äúdesperate attempt to silence voices in anticipation of the occupation of Gaza‚Äù.</p>
<p>The other journalists killed were Mohammed Qreiqeh, photographers Ibrahim Al Thaher, and Mohamed Nofal and Mohammed Noufal.</p>

<p>Al Sharif was previously part of a <em>Reuters</em> team, which in 2024 won a Pulitzer Prize in the category of Breaking News Photography for coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said in a statement that Al Sharif was the head of a Hamas cell and ‚Äúwas responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF (Israeli) troops,‚Äù citing intelligence and documents found in Gaza as evidence.</p>
<p>Journalists‚Äô groups and <em>Al Jazeera</em> denounced the killings.</p>
<p>A press freedom group and a United Nations expert previously warned that Al Sharif‚Äôs life was in danger due to his reporting from Gaza. UN Special Rapporteur Irene Khan said last month that Israel‚Äôs claims against him were unsubstantiated.</p>
<p><em>Al Jazeera</em> said Al Sharif had left a social media message to be posted in the event of his death that read, ‚Äú‚Ä¶I never hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or misrepresentation, hoping that God would witness those who remained silent.‚Äù</p>
<p>Last October, Israel‚Äôs military had named Al Sharif as one of six Gaza journalists it alleged were members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, citing documents it said showed lists of people who completed training courses and salaries.</p>
<p><em>Al Jazeera</em> categorically rejects the Israeli occupation forces‚Äô portrayal of our journalists as terrorists and denounces their use of fabricated evidence, the network said in a statement at the time.</p>
<p>The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which in July urged the international community to protect Al Sharif, said in a statement that Israel had failed to provide any evidence to back up its allegations against him.</p>
<p>Israel‚Äôs pattern of labelling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom, said Sara Qudah, CPJ‚Äôs director for the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>Al Sharif, whose X <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/AnasAlSharif0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">account</a> showed more than 500,000 followers, posted on the platform minutes before his death that Israel had been intensely bombarding Gaza City for more than two hours.</p>
<p>Hamas said the killing may signal the start of an Israeli offensive.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe assassination of journalists and the intimidation of those who remain paves the way for a major crime that the occupation is planning to commit in Gaza City,‚Äù Hamas said in a statement.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would launch a new offensive to dismantle Hamas strongholds in Gaza, where a hunger crisis is escalating after 22 months of conflict.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnas Al Sharif and his colleagues were among the last remaining voices in Gaza conveying the tragic reality to the world,‚Äù <em>Al Jazeera</em> said.</p>
<p>The Gaza government media office said 237 journalists have been killed since the war started on October 7, 2023. The Committee to Protect Journalists said at least 186 journalists have been killed in the Gaza conflict.</p></p>
