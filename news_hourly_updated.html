                <h2>Trump praises COAS again for averting nuclear war</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday once again <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917868">credited</a> Field Marshal Asim Munir for helping prevent a nuclear <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">conflict</a> with India, adding that he persuaded both sides to back down by linking peace to trade.</p>
<p>Explaining how he helped defuse tensions across the globe — from Ukr­­aine to Serbia — Trump said “the most impo­r­­tant” of these conflicts was last month’s war scare between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>“And that was not whether or not they may someday have nukes, like we are talking about the Middle East, like we are talking about with Israel and Iran. This is — they have nuclear weapons,” President Trump said at his news conference in The Hague, at the conclusion of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920050/nato-summit-commits-to-higher-spending-and-collective-defence">Nato summit.</a></p>
<p>Referring to recent tensions between the two South Asian neighbours, Trump said, “I ended that with a series of phone calls on trade. I said, ‘Look, if you are going to be fighting each other…’ It was getting very bad — you know how bad that last attack was. It was very bad. If you are really going to go fighting with each other, we are not going to do any trade.’ They said, ‘No, no. No, you have to do a trade deal’.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He described a conversation with Pakistan’s army chief and praised him in personal terms: “In fact, I had the general — he was really very impressive — the general from Pakistan was in my office last week. You know Prime Minister Modi is a great friend of mine. He is a great gentleman. He is a great man. And I got them to reason. I said, ‘We are not doing any trade deal if you are going to be fighting. And if you are going to be fighting each other, we are not doing any trade deal’.”</p>
<p>Trump concluded, “And you know what? They said, ‘No, I want to do a trade deal.’ And we stopped the nuclear war.”</p>
<p>The remarks highlighted the key role played by Field Marshal Munir in easing regional tensions.</p>
<p>Although Trump did not name the general directly in his public remarks, he had earlier described Munir as “an exceptional human being and an inspiring personality.”</p>
<p>These statements stand in contrast to India’s official position, which maintains that New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1560322">acted</a> independently during the May crisis and that Washington did not mediate. Trump’s remarks support Pakistan’s view that quiet US diplomacy — and direct intervention from the White House — helped calm tensions.</p>
<p>In broader comments during the Nato summit, Trump also said, “The Pakistanis know Iran very well, better than most. But they are not happy.” While brief, the comment underscored Washington’s view of Pakistan as a key regional player, especially as the US explores reopening talks with Tehran.</p>
<p>Trump indicated negotiations with Iran could resume “as early as next week.”</p>

<p>GILGIT: NDMA’s Nat­ional Emergencies Ope­ration Centre (NEOC) on Wednesday issued a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (Glof) alert for northern areas, including Gilgit-Baltistan, citing a dangerous combination of persistent high temperatures, intensified monsoon currents and a prevailing westerly wave.</p>
<p>The alert comes as current heatwaves intensify glacier melting across the region, leading to increased water levels and flash floods creating disasters in downstream areas.</p>
<p>A flash flood triggered on Wednesday by a melting glacier occurred in the Burundubar stream, which flows into the famous tourist point Attabad Lake, according to Rescue 1122.</p>
<p>The floodwater blocked access to the Luxus hotel, entering its premises where “a large number of national and foreign tourists were present”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>160 evacuated by boat after flash flooding near Attabad Lake</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More than 160 tourists and hotel staff were evacuated by boat.</p>
<p>The flood also damaged trees and land, creating “panic among stranded tourists cut off from land link”.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, rising temperatures triggered flooding in Barga nallah in Skardu, where water “once again entered homes and crops, causing widespread destruction,” police said.</p>
<p>GB Environmental Pro­tection Agency’s (GBEPA) Director Khadim Hussain told Dawn that the frequency of melting glacier disasters “intensified in recent years”.</p>
<p>Mr Hussain attributed this to global climate cha­nge and localised factors.</p>
<p>“In old times, snowfall received the mountains in November to December, that was converting into ice, now snowfall in February and March, that couldn’t convert into ice, with heatwaves, the snow melting in speed that causes flooding,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that “localised factors including def­orestation, unplanned con­­struction, and tourism influx,” along with incr­e­ased population and certain energy practices, contribute to accelerated glacier melt.</p>
<p>Another environmental expert told <em>Dawn</em> that many in GB live “in downstream areas of nallahs and rivers and near glaciers,” and when floods hit, “they have no time to save themselves.”</p>
<p>The expert highlighted the broader consequences, saying, “The GB glaciers produce 80pc of Pakistan’s agricultural water. This isn’t just a GB issue — it affects the whole country.”</p>
<p>Concerns were also raised that the GB government “has shown little priority in creating awareness or reducing the risks of climate change and disasters.”</p>
