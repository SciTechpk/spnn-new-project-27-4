            <p><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday said that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910113/world-community-hails-ceasefire-decision-between-pakistan-and-india">ceasefire</a> between India and Pakistan was extended until May 18, adding that the matter will “ultimately go to dialogue” between the civilian leadership of the two nations.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">American intervention</a> for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>On Monday, the director general of military operations for both sides <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910567">held</a> the first round of talks via hotline after the ceasefire.</p>
<p>Speaking in the Senate today, FM Dar said that a military-to-military conversation took place between the two countries today, where they decided to extend the ceasefire until May 18.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, the matter will go to dialogue between the civilian leadership of the countries,” FM Dar said. “Right now, these are military-to-military communications.”</p>
<p>He said that a political dialogue would take place between the two countries and that a “resolution for all the problems will be discussed”.</p>
<p>“We have told the world that we will carry out a composite dialogue,” Dar said.</p>
<p>A day prior, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911132">invited</a> India to a comprehensive dialogue to address all contentious issues, including the Kashmir dispute and the water distribution, between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)</em>, Dar said that Pakistan did not request a ceasefire during the recent escalation with India.</p>
<p>Instead, it [ceasefire] was initiated following a call from the US Secretary of State, who conveyed that India was willing to halt hostilities, Dar said.</p>
<p>Dar emphasised that Pakistan had exercised restraint and communicated this to all friendly nations even before the outbreak of hostilities.</p>
<p>“We told our friends we would not initiate an attack, but we would certainly respond if provoked,” he said, adding that Pakistan’s response was measured, decisive, and in line with international norms.</p>

<p>Paying tribute to the bravery and proficiency of Pakistan Air Force (PAF) falcons for inflicting a crushing defeat on the enemy during the operation, the premier said the success has also strengthened the belief of our friends and supporters in us.</p>
<p>Addressing the PAF falcons during his visit to Kamra Airbase today, PM Shehbaz said the PAF falcons “blew away the enemy’s pride into dust in a matter of just a few hours”.</p>
<p>He said, “Our daring eagles have taught a lesson to the enemy that if it ever tries to engage in any misadventure again, it will be served a destructive blow.”</p>
<p>The prime minister vowed that the nation will never forget the sacrifices of those martyred during this unprovoked aggression of the enemy.</p>
<p>He said we will uphold the dignity of our martyrs’ sacrifices and will build a prosperous and great country.</p>
<p>Directing his address to India, the premier said while India’s war-fever is over, we are ready to talk with it for peace.</p>
<p>He said let us remind India of the conditions for peace foremost among which is ensuring the right to self-determination for Kashmiri people under UNSC resolutions.</p>
<p>The prime minister said India mocked itself globally by unjustifiably blaming Pakistan for the Pahalgam incident, while there are irrefutable pieces of evidence of India’s involvement in terrorist activities inside Pakistan.</p>

<p>Separately, the Senate passed a resolution paying tribute to the armed forces for demonstrating “unwavering resolve, unparalleled Professionalism, and steadfast dedication in the successful execution of Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos.”</p>
<p>The resolution, presented by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, said the operation was carried out with exceptional restraint and maturity, reflecting the conduct of a responsible nuclear state.</p>
<p>It congratulated the people of Pakistan for rising above all political, ethnic, and ideological divides and differences, demonstrating unity in support of national leadership across the political spectrum and speaking with one voice and one purpose to defend the people, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and dignity of the country.</p>
<p>It honoured the sacrifices of the valiant martyrs who laid down their lives in the defence of the sovereignty and national honour of the country.</p>
<p>It condemned “the brutal and unprovoked Indian attacks on innocent civilians, including women, children and mosques”.</p>
<p>It urged the government to proactively engage the international community for a peaceful, just and lasting resolution of the Indian-held Kashmir, stressing the critical importance of strict adherence to the Indus water treaty.</p></p>

            <p><p>Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Thursday warned in an interview with British broadcaster <em><a class="link--external" href="https://news.sky.com/story/pakistan-vows-swift-response-if-india-violates-ceasefire-13368060" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sky News</a></em> that any Indian ceasefire violation would be met with a “swift and assured response” by Pakistan, cautioning that serious escalation could result in mutual destruction.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>.

It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>On May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">announced</a> that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan. According to the government, forty civilians — including seven women and 15 children — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910733">lost</a> their lives in the Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Sky News</em>, DG ISPR warned that by rooting for war, India was carving out a “recipe for mutual destruction,” adding that the world now recognised the extent of the nuclear threat.</p>
<p>“Any sane player like the USA understands this absurdity and what the Indians are trying to do here,” Lt Gen Chaudhry told the publications.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Talking about India’s actions in Kashmir, he accused the country of trying to “internalise the issue and harassing” Kashmiri people with a heavy troop presence.</p>
<p>“It is a problem that has to be resolved by the people of Kashmir as per the United Nations Security Council resolution,” he said.</p>
<p>He continued: “Anyone who tries to violate our territory and integrity and sovereignty, our response will be brutal.”</p>
<p>DG ISPR warned that a “serious escalation between India and Pakistan would destroy both sides” under the concept of mutually assured destruction — a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy which posits that a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by an attacker on a nuclear-armed defender with second-strike capabilities would result in the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender.</p>
<p>In a press conference <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910381">held</a> last week after the ceasefire was brokered, DG ISPR had cautioned that a conflict between Islamabad and New Delhi “can lead to peril of more than 1.6 billion people.”</p>
<p>“In reality, there is no space for war between India and Pakistan,” he added.</p></p>

            <p><p>A vice president of one of the parallel film events at the Cannes Festival was suspended Thursday after being publicly denounced for sexual violence, witnesses and organisers told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>During a roundtable discussion about <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1396838">sexual assault</a> organised by France’s film board (CNC), a woman stood up and publicly denounced an executive from the ACID Cannes film section.</p>
<p>“The young woman acted with great courage and was immediately taken care of by charities present,” Erwan Balanant, a French MP who was in the room, told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>It came as the main Cannes Festival barred a French actor from the premiere Thursday of a film in the running for the Palme d’Or top prize because he has been accused of rape by three former partners.</p>
<p>The ACID Cannes event is not part of the official festival, but runs at the same time and has some organisational links.</p>
<p>It showcases up-and-coming directors and more experimental cinema.
“Today, during a public roundtable, we heard testimony implicating one of our members, currently vice-president of ACID, in serious acts that could amount to sexual violence,” two other co-presidents of the organisation said in a statement to <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>They said the man had been suspended as a precautionary measure and that “an internal investigation process has been entrusted to an external body.” The vice president cannot be named for legal reasons.</p>
<p>Cannes has been under pressure from MPs and activists to take a tougher line on sexual violence.</p></p>
