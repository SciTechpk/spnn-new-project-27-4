                <h2>Karakoram Highway reopened as rescue, aid efforts continue in flood-hit GB</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Karakoram Highway (KKH) was reopened on Saturday as aid and rescue operations continued in Gilgit-Baltistan after flash floods battered the region.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719">devastating impacts</a> of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">heat¬≠¬≠waves</a>, erratic weat¬≠her patterns and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660">glacial melting</a> have triggered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a> and intense floods across the region.</p>
<p>On Monday, floods swept through GB‚Äôs Babusar area in Diamer district and Naran, causing landslides and leaving many <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926193">stranded</a>. At least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926487">nine people</a> died and more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure were damaged as a result.</p>
<p>In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said: ‚ÄúThe Karakoram Highway is open for all types of traffic.‚Äù</p>
<p>He recalled that the main artery had been blocked due to landslides and mud flow on Friday, adding that machinery was sent to restore the road.</p>
<p>Faraq further said that rescue and search operations were underway across the region. The recent floods have caused severe destruction in the region, particularly in the Kunduz region and the Ghanche district, he noted.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúFloods in GB have destroyed many houses, water channels, communication roads, standing crops, shops and electricity poles,‚Äù the official said.</p>
<p>He added that the local government has distributed ‚Äúhundreds of tents, thousands of food packets and medicines to the affected people‚Äù across the region.</p>
<p>Speaking about the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">search operation</a> in Babusar, Faraq said, ‚ÄúThere may be 10 to 12 missing tourists at the Babusar valley as a search operation was ongoing.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Pakistan Army, GB Scouts, Rescue 1122 and local volunteers are taking part in the operation,‚Äù he said, adding that continuous landslides and increasing water flow were hampering the search.</p>
<p>Another rescue operation was underway in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/642478/trekking-to-tranquility">Fairy Meadows</a>, according to the government spokesperson.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFour stranded tourists at Fairy Meadows near Nanga Parbat basecamp, including one man and three women, were airlifted through Pakistan Army helicopters on early Friday,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan and his cabinet will also hold a press conference today regarding flood disasters and rehabilitation operations, Faraq added.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the National Disaster Management Authority <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/pmd-issues-glof-alert-for-gb-kp-as-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-from-diamer-amid-floods#:~:text=NDMA%20issues%20landslide%20alert">issued</a> a landslide alert for the northern areas of the country.

<p>The GB government has started free and special flights yesterday to evacuate stranded tourists and local people, GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmed Mirza noted.</p>
<p>In a media briefing on Friday, Mirza said 135 people, including 80 tourists, were taken from Skardu to Islamabad through a C-130 flight. ‚ÄúA special C-130 flight will start from Gilgit to Islamabad to shift stranded tourists and local passengers to Islamabad,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>He also said that the GB government made the arrangements with the NDMA and Pakistan Army to ‚Äúfacilitate safe evacuation of tourists, patients, and students who were stranded at multiple locations‚Äù.</p>
<p>A helicopter service was also launched to evacuate tourists stranded in the affected areas, he added.</p>
<p>The chief secretary further noted, ‚ÄúThe main cause of most of the incidents was melting glaciers and cloudburst.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that the cloudburst-induced <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">destructive flood</a> at Babusar valley washed away around eight kilometres of the road leading to Babusar Top, sweeping away two dozen vehicles and leaving <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/officials-say-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-amid-gb-floods-govt-issues-landslide-alert">hundreds of tourists</a> and locals stranded.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, the stranded tourists at Babusar valley and Deosai areas were safely evacuated through timely efforts by locals, Rescue 1122, district administration, the Pakistan Army, Frontier Works Organisation (FWO), and local community volunteers,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Mirza stated that 12km of roads, 26 bridges, 20 vehicles, water channels, cattle sheds, shops, agricultural lands, crops, private and public properties, irrigation channels, and drinking water supply systems had been damaged in several areas of GB.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe GB government is effectively dealing with the situation,‚Äù he said, asserting the administration was providing aid to the affected places.</p></p>

                <h2>Info minister apologises to boxer Shahzaib Rind for ‚Äòunjustified‚Äô delay in monetary reward, support</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday apologised to mixed martial arts player Shahzaib Rind for the ‚Äúinordinate delay‚Äù in the government‚Äôs promised financial reward and support.</p>
<p>In September, Rind <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859830">made history</a> when he won the Karate Combat Championship (KC-49) in Singapore, becoming the first-ever world champion from Pakistan after defeating Brazil‚Äôs Bruno Roberto De Assis in the final.</p>
<p>Following the win, <a class="link--external" href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2501761/karate-champion-shahzaib-rind-receives-rs100m-reward-from-president-zardari" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> had presented Rind with a cheque worth Rs 100 million, the <a href="https://www.samaa.tv/2087313582-mma-fighter-shahzaib-rind-rewarded-with-job-cash-after-win-against-india">Balochistan government</a> announced Rs2m as a cash prize, while a <a class="link--external" href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2498392/sardar-yaar-muhammad-rind-announces-reward-for-karate-champion-shahzaib-rind" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">former minister</a> had also promised him 25 acres of land.</p>
<p>Tarar‚Äôs apology today comes after Rind, in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/RindhShahzaib/status/1948070734607122889" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X on Wednesday, had slammed the government for its ‚Äúfake promises‚Äù of Rs5m in cash and an additional Rs80m to support his training and upcoming matches.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur politicians are corrupt,‚Äù Rind alleged, adding that the last time he won, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had announced rewards for him.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was all [a] lie; I never got [a] penny from them. They just take pictures, fake promises and forget shame,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>Last year, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had issued a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-congratulates-shahzaib-rind-on-winning-karate-combat-championship/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> congratulating Rind and <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/pmln_org/status/1789587982296510500" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">met with him</a>. However, a report on any announcement of a reward could not be found.</p>
<p>Tarar responded to Rind‚Äôs criticism today, apologising for the delay in the promised support.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere seems to be some miscommunication. We sincerely apologise for this unjustified delay,‚Äù the minister <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/TararAttaullah/status/1948967159796744580" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on X.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSportsmen like you are our real heroes and we value your achievements. You have brought great honour to the country and made us all proud.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added: ‚ÄúThe prime minister has taken a serious notice of this inordinate delay and rest assured, it will be sorted out immediately inshallah.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe PM has further instructed that such mistakes must never happen in the future. We regret this unjustified delay and the inconvenience caused,‚Äù the minister said.</p>

<p>In response, Rind welcomed the ‚Äúacknowledgement‚Äù, saying: ‚ÄúI truly appreciate the prime minister‚Äôs attention to this matter and his commitment to supporting athletes like myself.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRepresenting Pakistan on the world stage is an honour, and I will always give my all for our country. Inshallah, with your support, we can continue to uplift and inspire the next generation of champions,‚Äù he added, saying he looked forward to the issue‚Äôs resolution soon.</p>

<p>In April last year, Rind had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1829004">decried</a> the government‚Äôs lack of support, saying it was its ‚Äúbad luck‚Äù that it did not support the country‚Äôs heroes after his 2-1 victory over India at Dubai‚Äôs Karate Combat 45 event.</p></p>
