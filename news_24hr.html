            <p><p>The Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee (RHC) on Tuesday announced that it has not sighted the Zilhaj moon, meaning Pakistan would observe Eidul Azha on June 7.</p>
<p>The committee’s meeting took place on a roof in Islamabad’s Kohsar Block, where the religious affairs ministry has its <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/QExNBEGH6bpF75948" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">office</a>.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference, RHC Chairman Maulana Abdul Khabeer Azad said, “No testimony of sighting the moon of the month of Zilhaj was received from any part of Pakistan […]. Therefore, it was decided with consensus that Zilhaj 1, 1446AH would be on May 29, Thursday and Eidul Azha would be observed on June 7, Saturday.”</p>
<p>He noted that the weather remained cloudy in most parts of the country and clear in some.</p>
<p>Maulana Azad presided over the meeting of the RHC earlier in the evening, with officials and experts from other departments also gathered to sight the moon.</p>
<p>Simultaneous zonal meetings of the RHC also took place at their respective headquarters in the provincial capitals to send testimonies.</p>
<p>Dr Mohammad Hasan Ali, director of the Institute of Meteorology and Geophysics at the Pakistan Meteorological Department; Shaukatullah Khan of the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco); and Zainul Abedin from the science and tech ministry were among those present during the meeting, Azad said.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Suparco <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912584">predicted</a> that the festive occasion of Eidul Azha would likely be celebrated across Pakistan on June 7.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>According to Suparco, while the birth of a new moon for Zilhaj 1446 AH would occur on May 27, the possibility of the moon being sighted across the country today would be extremely low even under optimal weather conditions.</p>
<p>Cloudy weather <a class="link--external" href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/pk/islamabad/258278/hourly-weather-forecast/258278" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> in the federal capital further reduced the sighting probability.</p>
<p>Celebrated on the 10th of Zilhaj, Eidul Azha marks the culmination of Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam.</p></p>

<p>A roof and wall collapse in Mattani village injured three people, while another person was injured in the collapse of a wall in the city’s Garhi Qamardin area. A solar panel fell on Phandu Road and injured a person.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913481">warned</a> that the district administrations to take precautionary measures as more rain and gusty winds were expected in the upper and central parts of the country.</p>
<p>At least 19 people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913151">killed</a> over 90 others injured as powerful windstorms and heavy rains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913072/multiple-casualties-reported-amid-heavy-rains-across-punjab">battered</a> several parts of the country on Saturday, paralysing road and air traffic, damaging infrastructure and triggering widespread power outages.</p>

            <p><p>Locals staging a sit-in against a suspected drone strike in Mir Ali last week, claiming the lives of four children, announced on Tuesday that they have ended their protest after having reached an agreement with the local administration.</p>
<p>For the past seven days, the locals in Mir Ali had been staging a sit-in, demanding justice in the wake of a suspected <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912113">strike</a> that took place in Mir Ali’s Hurmuz village on May 19 during the daytime, leaving four children of the same family dead and injuring five others, including a woman. While the military’s media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912393">clarified</a> that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>Allama Iqbal Dawar, one of the organisers, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that following a series of talks held between the protesters and officials, both sides reached an agreement on late Monday night.</p>
<p>The bodies of the deceased have been buried, and the roads previously blocked by the protesters are now open, while officials are set to meet the affected families and announce compensatory measures soon.</p>
<p>Additionally, Mufti Baitullah, spokesman for the Jirga, also announced the agreement while addressing the protesters in a video seen by <em>Dawn.com.</em> Baitullah was seen lauding the Jirga members for playing a positive role in the whole affair.</p>
<p>When approached by <em>Dawn.com</em>, District Police Officer Waqar Ahmad confirmed that the agreement had been signed but did not reveal any details about the pact.</p>
<p>Similarly, Mir Ali Tehsildar Sher Bahadar told <em>Dawn.com</em> that a four-point agreement had been reached. However, he too did not elaborate any further.</p>
<p>However, North Waziristan Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Yousuf Karim told the local media that he had held thorough talks with the tribal leaders, assuring them that the government and the army would pay “serious attention” to the safety of the residents during operations against the militants.</p>
<p>Last week, the local elders had threatened to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1913361">march</a> to Islamabad to protest against the drone strike in case their demands were not met.</p></p>
