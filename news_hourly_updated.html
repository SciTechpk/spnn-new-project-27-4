A day earlier, President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">said</a> US air strikes  ‚Äútotally obliterated‚Äù Iran‚Äôs main nuclear sites, as Washington joined <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919362/we-will-end-this-war-iran-warns-gambler-trump">Israel‚Äôs war</a> with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.</p>
<p>The strikes on Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities, which came four days after Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917868">meeting</a> with Trump and a day after the government said it decided to formally recommend Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize for his role during the recent conflict with India, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919259/pakistan-backed-security-council-resolution-seeks-immediate-de-escalation">condemned</a> by Pakistan. A meeting of the NSC,  the highest forum for security deliberations comprising the civil and military top brass, was subsequently convened.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif chaired the meeting, with Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir also attending the important moot, and reviewed the evolving regional situation following the Israeli aggression against Iran.</p>

<p>Sources in the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office had told <em>Dawn</em> that Field Marshal Munir would brief the committee on the details of his meeting with Trump.</p>
<p>A press release from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office said: ‚ÄúThe committee strongly condemned Israel‚Äôs acts of aggression and expressed regret that these military attacks coincided with a constructive negotiation process between Iran and the US. These reckless actions have escalated tensions, threatening to ignite a wider conflict and diminishing the opportunities for dialogue and diplomacy. The NSC reaffirmed Iran‚Äôs right to self-defence as enshrined in the UN Charter.‚Äù</p>
<p>The committee members also conveyed their condolences to the Iranian government and people on the loss of innocent lives and offered prayers for the recovery of those injured.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile reiterating Pakistan‚Äôs stated position, the NSC expressed grave concern over the potential for further escalation after the attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan on June 22 which violated the resolutions of the International Atomic Energy Agency, relevant international law and the UN Charter.‚Äù</p>
<p>The committee members also reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs close engagement with relevant parties in the situation and endorsed the government‚Äôs readiness to continue efforts and initiatives aimed at promoting regional peace and stability.</p>
<p>The NSC called on all relevant parties to resolve the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy in line with the UN Charter, underscoring the need to adhere to international human rights and humanitarian laws.</p>

<p>The US president had stepped up his rhetoric against Iran since Israel first struck the country, repeating his insistence that it could never have a nuclear weapon. Tehran has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a> the claim, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p>
<p>Condemning the US attacks as a violation of international law, Iran said it was ‚Äúresolved to defend Iran‚Äôs territory, sovereignty, security and people by all force‚Äù. It also responded with a volley of missiles at Israel that wounded scores of people in Tel Aviv.</p></p>

            <p><p>Iran said on Monday that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">US attack</a> on its nuclear sites expanded the range of legitimate targets for its armed forces and called US President Donald Trump a ‚Äúgambler‚Äù for joining Israel‚Äôs military campaign against the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>Since Trump joined Israel‚Äôs campaign by dropping massive <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842#:~:text=The%20US%20strikes%20included%2014%20bunker%2Dbuster%20bombs%2C%20more%20than%20two%20dozen%20submarine%2Dlaunched%20Tomahawk%20missiles%20and%20over%20125%20military%20aircraft%2C%20the%20top%20general%20added.">bunker-buster bombs</a> on Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday morning, Tehran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate.</p>
<p>But while it has continued to fire missiles at Israel, it has yet to take action against the United States itself, either by firing at US bases or by targeting the 20 per cent of global oil shipments that pass near its coast at the mouth of the Gulf.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMr Trump, the gambler, you may start this war, but we will be the ones to end it,‚Äù Ebrahim Zolfaqari, spokesperson for Iran‚Äôs Khatam al-Anbiya central military headquarters, <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/RT_com/status/1937038083595354557" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Monday in English at the end of a recorded video statement.</p>

<p>Iran and Israel traded another wave of air and missile strikes on Monday as the world braced for Tehran‚Äôs response.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs administration has repeatedly said that its aim is solely to destroy Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919269/all-eyes-on-iran-after-trump-pulls-the-trigger-on-bunker-busters#:~:text=oil%20and%20gas.-,%E2%80%98Not%20at%20war%20with%20Iran%E2%80%99,-Defence%20Secretary%20Hegseth">not to open a wider war</a>.</p>
<p>But in a social media post on Sunday, Trump openly spoke of toppling the hardline clerical rulers who have been Washington‚Äôs principal foes in the Middle East since Iran‚Äôs 1979 revolution.</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#more-israeli-strikes" id="more-israeli-strikes" title="Permalink"></a>More Israeli strikes</h2>
<p>Israel‚Äôs airstrikes on Iran have met little resistance from Iranian defences since Israel launched its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">surprise attack</a> on June 13, killing many of Iran‚Äôs top <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">commanders</a>.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said on Monday that about 20 jets had conducted a wave of strikes against military targets in western Iran and Tehran overnight. In Kermanshah, in western Iran, missile and radar infrastructure was targeted, and in Tehran a surface-to-air missile launcher was struck, it said.</p>
<p>Iranian news agencies reported air defences had been activated in central Tehran districts, and Israeli air strikes had hit Parchin, the location of a military complex southeast of the capital.</p>
<p>Iran says more than 400 people have been killed in the Israeli attacks, mostly civilians, but has released few images of the damage since the initial days of the bombing. Tehran, a city of 10 million people, has largely emptied, with residents fleeing to the countryside to escape attacks.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs retaliatory missile strikes on Israel have killed 24 people, all civilians, and injured hundreds, the first time a significant number of Iranian missiles have ever penetrated Israeli defences.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said a missile launched from Iran in the early hours of Monday had been intercepted by Israeli defences. Air raid sirens blared overnight in Tel Aviv and other parts of central Israel.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#limited-retaliation" id="limited-retaliation" title="Permalink"></a>Limited retaliation</h2>
<p>Beyond those missiles, Iran‚Äôs ability to retaliate is far more limited than a few months ago, since Israel inflicted defeat on Iran‚Äôs most feared regional proxy force, Hezbollah in Lebanon, whose downfall was swiftly followed by that of Iran‚Äôs most powerful client ruler, Syria‚Äôs Bashar al-Assad.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs most effective threat to hurt the West would probably be to restrict global oil flows from the Gulf. Oil prices spiked on Monday at their highest since January. But they have not yet shot up to crisis levels, indicating that traders see a path out of the conflict that avoids serious disruption.</p>
<p>Brent crude futures were down 0.5pc to $76.64 a barrel as of 8:30am GMT (1:30pm PKT), after briefly jumping above $80 at the opening.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs parliament has approved a move to close the Strait of Hormuz that leads into the Gulf, which would require approval from the Supreme National Security Council, a body led by an appointee of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>
<p>Attempting to strangle the strait could send global oil prices skyrocketing, derail the world economy and invite conflict with the US Navy‚Äôs massive Fifth Fleet that patrols the Gulf from its base in Bahrain.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs economic suicide for them if they do it. And we retain options to deal with that,‚Äù US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.</p>
<p>As Tehran weighed its options, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi was expected to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow today. The Kremlin has a strategic partnership with Iran, but also close links with Israel.</p>
<p>Speaking in Istanbul yesterday, Araqchi said his country would consider all possible responses and there would be no return to diplomacy until it had retaliated. <em>TASS</em> news agency later quoted him as saying Iran and Russia were coordinating their positions.</p></p>
