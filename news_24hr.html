            <p><p>• KP’s Malakand and Hazara divisions, parts of Punjab, Sindh likely to receive rain today<br />
• PDMA says 135 killed in Punjab<br />
• Medium to high-level flow expected in rivers from tomorrow</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Authorities are bracing for another spell of rain and thunderstorms, which are expected to hit many parts of the country from today (Monday).</p>
<p>According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the Malakand and Hazara divisions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the southern parts of Punjab and Sindh, eastern Balochistan and parts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) are likely to receive rain and thunderstorms with strong winds.</p>
<p>According to the PMD’s detailed national forecast, Islamabad may receive rain and thunderstorms at night.</p>
<p>In KP, while most districts will stay hot and humid, scattered rain with thunderstorms and gusty winds are expected in Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Malakand, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Kurram, and Waziristan.</p>
<p>Rain and thunderstorms are forecast for urban centres of Punjab in the south, such as Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan, though overall weather of the province will remain partly cloudy and humid.</p>
<p>Later at night, the rain spell is expected to reach Rawal­pindi, Murree, Gali­yat, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Narowal and Lahore.</p>
<p>In Sindh, where the moderate to heavy rain has alre­ady been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925461/six-people-killed-during-widespread-rains-in-most-districts-of-sindh">reported</a> from some parts, several areas are bracing for more precipitation.</p>
<p>The PMD said Mir­purkhas, Mithi, Tharparkar, Badin, Sujawal, Umerkot, Chhachhro, Padidan, Khair­pur, Karachi, Thatta, Ghotki, Chhor, Sukkur, Kashmore, Shikar­pur, Jacobabad, Larkana, Naushahro Feroze, Sanghar, Dadu, Hyderabad, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Matiari, and Shaheed Benazirabad are all expected to receive rain and thunderstorms, with heavy downpours likely in some areas.</p>

<p>In Balochistan, while most regions will remain hot and humid, the forecast includes rain and thunderstorms for Barkhan, Sibi, Kohlu, Musakhel, Killa Saifullah, Loralai, Dera Bugti, Nasirabad, Zhob, Kalat, Khuzdar, Awaran, and Lasbela.</p>
<p>For Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, partly cloudy weather with rain and thunderstorms is expected, and heavy rainfall is likely at isolated places in Kashmir.</p>
<p><strong>Rivers in high flood</strong></p>
<p>A separate alert from the country’s  Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) echoed the warning, saying that  “moderate to strong monsoon activity is likely to start” over the upper catchments of those same rivers after 36 hours.</p>
<p>The division specifically predicted a medium to high-level flow in the Chenab and  Jhelum rivers, along with their associated nullahs and those of the Ravi river, from July 22 to 24.</p>
<p>The Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Sunday released grim statistics, confirming 135 fatalities and 478 injuries across the province from monsoon-related incidents this year.</p>
<p>The casualties included 99 deaths from building collapses, 19 from drowning, 12 from electrocution and five from lightning strikes.</p>
<p>In response to the dire forecast, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia directed all district administrations to remain on high alert for what he termed a “dual threat.”</p>
<p>“We are facing dual threats of urban flooding in cities and flash floods in riverine areas,” Mr Kathia said, warning that heavy precipitation in upper catchment areas could cause dangerous water level rises in the Sutlej, Ravi, Chenab, Jhelum, and Indus rivers between July 22 to 24.</p>
<p>The Punjab government has also activated its compensation policy, providing financial assistance ranging from Rs 1m to Rs 5m to the families of those who lost loved ones.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925555/govt-swings-into-action-over-quetta-honour-killings' target='_blank'><strong>Govt swings into action over Quetta ‘honour killings’</strong></a>
            <p><p>QUETTA: A primary suspect was detained on Sunday and raids were underway for the arrest of other culprits after a gruesome video went viral, showing the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925448/viral-video-case-registered-in-couples-murder-and-suspect-arrested-says-balochistan-cm">killing</a> of a couple over ‘honour’ in the Dagari area of Quetta.</p>
<p>The incident purportedly took place around Eidul Azha and has been described as an act of ‘honour killing’. In the video, a group of people can be seen killing a woman and a man, apparently for contracting a love marriage.</p>
<p>After the clip went viral on social media, a case on terrorism charges was registered on the ord­ers of Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, and the Levies and the Counter-Terrorism Dep­artment subsequently arr­es­ted one of the key suspects.</p>
<p>“The case was registered under anti-terrorism laws…on behalf of the Balochistan government, as no one from the area, including the relatives or other people, submitted any application to the Levies or the CTD,” officials said, adding that efforts were underway to arrest more people.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The slain couple had reportedly married without the permission of their families and the matter was taken to the ‘elders’ of the area, who pronounced a death sentence.</p>
<p>Sources said the ill-fated couple, Ehsan Samalani and Bano Satakzai, were invited to the village for lunch and later taken to an abandoned place in Dagari, where they were informed about the decision of the elders.</p>
<p>“You are allowed to shoot me, but nothing more than that,” the slain woman told the perpetrators in Brahvi before her murder.</p>
<p>She asked her killers to let her walk seven steps before shooting her. She was shot thrice apparently by her brother, followed by the killing of her partner. The bodies have yet to be recovered, further complicating the investigation.</p>
<p>The video is believed to have been filmed just before Eidul Azha, and the authorities are conducting raids to apprehend the remaining perpetrators, whose identities have reportedly been established but not made public.</p>
<p>“The state will not remain a silent spectator to such barbarism,” said CM Bugti on X (formerly Twitter), vowing that justice would be served.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>In a press conference at the Karachi Press Club on Sunday, Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind confirmed that the individuals seen in the video had been traced through facial recognition and Nadra data.</p>
<p>“One suspect is in custody, and data of all visible individuals in the video has been handed over to Nadra. We are closing in on the rest,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr Rind clarified that the state itself had become the complainant in the case to ensure accountability and justice, emphasising that external pressure would not be tolerated during the investigation.</p>

<p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, whose party rules Balochistan, condemned the cold-blooded killing, expressing profound grief and outrage over the incident. He said that those involved in this heinous murder are nothing less than beasts and deserve no mercy.</p>
<p>Aladdin Khilji, provincial director of Aurat Foundation and chairman of the Balochistan EVAWG Alliance (Ending Violence against Women and Girls), also condemned the act.</p>
<p>“This video has shaken us to the core. It is a stark reminder that honour killings remain a brutal reality in Balochistan. From 2019 to 2024, 212 people have been murdered in the name of honour,” he said in a statement.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925557/senate-race-in-kp-now-a-two-way-fight' target='_blank'><strong>Senate race in KP now a two-way fight</strong></a>
            <p><p>PESHAWAR: In what initially shaped up to be a three-way contest — among PTI, PTI ‘dissidents’ and opposition lawmakers — turned out to be almost a two-way match after the size of PTI’s ‘disgruntled’ faction was effectively reduced to just one candidate.</p>
<p>As of Sunday night, six PTI nominees and five opposition picks were in the running in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for the upper house of parliament. Late-night reports suggested that two more ‘disgruntled’ PTI candidates pulled out of the race hours after the exit of Mohammad Waqas Orak­zai and Syed Irshad Hus­sain. Khurram Zee­shan was the only disgruntled PTI member, till the filing of this report in the wee hours of Monday morning, vying for a general seat.</p>
<p><strong>Proportional representation</strong></p>
<p>Unlike the general elections, the ‘first past the post’ system (where the person receiving the highest number of votes is declared the winner) is not employed here.</p>
<p>Instead, the ‘single transferable vote’ system of proportional representation is used.</p>
<p>Under this system, voters cast a single ballot, which mentions all the candidates they would like to see elected, in order of their personal priority or preference (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on).</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Each of these votes has a value. A quota calculated by the ECP determines how many votes each candidate needs to be considered elected.</p>
<p>The votes received by each candidate are tallied in each count. When a candidate receives enough votes to cross the quota, the extra value of his or her votes is transferred down to lower priority candidates (in the order mentioned by the voters).</p>
<p>The candidates who receive the fewest votes are eliminated and their votes are transferred to other candidates in the order of preference.</p>
<p>The process of transferring votes from successful and eliminated candidates continues until all vacant seats are filled.</p>
<p><strong>How many votes needed?</strong></p>
<p>Theoretically, for the KP Assembly — which has a total of 145 seats — a candidate for one of seven general seats requires at least 21 votes to succeed (calculated by dividing the total number of seats in the KP Assembly by the number of vacant seats being contested).</p>
<p>For each of the women’s and technocrat seats, this number is 72.</p>
<p>Currently, there are 92 PTI-backed members in the 145-member assembly, whereas the opposition’s strength has gone up to 53.</p>
<p>Among opposition parties, JUI-F is the largest with 18 seats, followed by PML-N with 17 seats. The PPP holds 10 seats, ANP four, while PTI-P has three seats in the assembly.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the candidates?</strong></p>
<p>The PTI-backed Senate candidates on general seats include Murad Saeed, Faisal Javed, Mirza Muhammad Afridi and Noorul Haq Qadri. For the technocrat and women’s seats, the party has named Muhammad Azam Khan Swati and Rubina Naz as its candidates, respectively.</p>
<p>The opposition-backed candidates include Attaul Haq of JUI-F, Muhammad Talha of PPP, Niaz Ahmad of PML-N on general seats, whereas Dilawar Khan of JUI-F is in the run for the technocrat seat, while the PPP has nominated Rubina Khalid for the women’s seat.</p>
<p>Based on the late-night reports, among the ‘disgruntled’ PTI members, Waqas Orakzai, Irfan Saleem, Irshad Hussain and Ayisha Bano had already exited the race, leaving Khurram Zeeshan in the race.</p>
