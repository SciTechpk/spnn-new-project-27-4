<p>As the session ‚Äî chaired by NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq ‚Äî commenced, opposition lawmakers erupted into anti-government slogans. Starting his speech, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the budget was being presented at a ‚Äúhistoric moment‚Äù marked by national unity and resolve, referencing the recent Pakistan-India conflict.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe spirit with which we protected our national sovereignty, we need to ensure our financial security in the same way,‚Äù he maintained, continuing his speech through the noisy session.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan has now achieved economic stability and is moving towards a Pakistan that is prosperous.‚Äù</p>
<p>The minister highlighted the current account surplus, remittances, and the stability of the rupee while also mentioning the positive reports from international credit rating agencies <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897569">Moody‚Äôs</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904417">Fitch</a> that upgraded Pakistan‚Äôs rating.</p>

<p>Aurangzeb said that it was unavoidable to aim for a 14pc tax-to-GDP ratio and added that achieving the national targets was ‚Äúimpossible without the transformation of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).‚Äù</p>
<p>The government has set an ambitious tax collection target for the FBR at Rs14,131 billion, an 8.95pc increase from last year‚Äôs goal.</p>

<p>Detailing that transformation, the minister listed B2B e-voicing, AI-based audit selection systems for sales and income tax, e-billing and faceless audits, and a new central control unit to centralise data collection, among other steps.</p>

<p>Expanding upon the results, he said 390,000 high-value non-filers of tax were identified through data integration, with Rs300m recovered. The minister further highlighted that there was a 100pc increase in the number of tax filers, taking the revenues to Rs105bn.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor the first time, the IMF (International Monetary Fund) has acknowledged Rs389bn revenues through law enforcement,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Speaking on tax revenues, he said the tax-to-GDP ratio was only 8.8pc in June 2024, which was raised to 10.3pc in the first nine months of FY2025, and would reach 10.4pc by the end of June.</p>
<p>The government‚Äôs revenue was now at 11.6pc, including the provinces‚Äô 0.8pc contributions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe FBR has increased tax-to-GDP ratio by 1.6pc, which is historic not just in Pakistan but the world,‚Äù he asserted.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb also announced tax relief measures for the salaried class, stating that the government planned to reduce the tax slabs, ‚Äúbalancing inflation and take-home [income]‚Äù.</p>
<p>Those earning between Rs0.6m and Rs1.2m would pay a 2.5pc tax, those with income greater than Rs1.2m and less than Rs2.5m would pay an 11pc tax, with those earning above that and till Rs3.2m would need to pay a 23pc tax.</p>
<p>For the corporate sector, the minister said it was being proposed to reduce the super tax rate for corporations earning between Rs200m-Rs500m annually to 5pc.</p>
<p>The finance minister proposed that Balochistan and the merged districts in KP, which ‚Äúhad a leeway with taxes for the past seven years‚Äù, were now to pay sales tax starting from 10pc for five years.</p>
<p>He said an 18pc tax would be applied on imported solar panels, while online businesses and digital marketplaces would also come under the tax net.</p>
<p>However, noting that the agriculture sector was the economy‚Äôs engine of growth, Aurangzeb said no further tax on fertiliser and pesticides was being mulled.</p>
<p>He warned that those committing theft in sales tax would face strict punishments, with the right to appeal. An automated risk-based income tax adjustment would be introduced to prevent the misuse of the income tax system.</p>
<p>He further said that foreign vendors from countries having no bilateral tax agreements with Pakistan could be taxed. ‚ÄúA 5pc tax on items from foreign vendors has been proposed.‚Äù</p>
<p>Petrol, diesel and hybrid cars that were excluded from an 18pc sales tax would now be hit with the same tax as well, the minister said.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb said that the federal government‚Äôs non-tax revenue target would be Rs5.15tr, with pure earnings of Rs11.08tr.</p>
<p>He added that the total expenditure is aimed at Rs17.58tr, out of which Rs8.21 would be for payments of mark up.</p>
<p>For the defence sector, for which Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said the budget share would be increased, Rs2.55tr would be allocated.</p>
<p>Expanding on the defence budget later during his speech, Aurangzeb stated that officers and junior commissioned officers would get a special relief allowance from the budget ‚Äúin light of the contribution of the armed forces to defending our borders‚Äù.</p>
<p>Civil administration expenditure would be Rs0.97tr, pension expenditure Rs1.06bn, power and other sectors Rs1.19bn, according to Aurangzeb.</p>
<p>The minister detailed Rs1.93tr worth of grants allocated for AJK, GB and KP‚Äôs merged districts, including for BISP and education.</p>
<p>He also took a jibe at those ‚Äúwho were raising alarm about a mini-budget‚Äù, adding that no such move had been taken by the government.</p>
<p>The finance czar said that there was a 31pc <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903338">reduction in electricity prices</a>, as well as 50pc reduction in prices for protected consumers.</p>
<p>Mentioning the privatisation of distribution companies, he said: ‚ÄúProfessional boards have been cleared of political corruption.‚Äù</p>
<p>The minister went on to announce that the government had made plans to ‚Äúprocure cheap energy‚Äù.  Noting the closure of costly power plants and reforms in the oil and gas sector, he said Turkish and other international companies were willing to invest in Pakistan.</p>

<p>He mentioned the $5bn investment pledge by Reko Diq and pointed out fuel price deregulation aimed to promote competition.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGold mines in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904563">Reko Diq</a> are a key part of our future. The plan‚Äôs feasibility study was completed in January,‚Äù he noted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe expect $71bn in cash flows [as well as] $7bn in tax and $8bn in royalties,‚Äù he said, terming the project a ‚Äúgame changer‚Äù.</p>
<p>Detailing the steps to be taken under the National Tariff Policy, Aurangzeb said additional customs duties will come to an end in four years, regulatory duties will end in five years, Customs Act‚Äôs Schedule 5 will also be eliminated in five years, and customs duty will be structured in slabs, with the maximum being 15pc.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTariff reforms will be applied step by step so that businesses can adjust and challenges are reduced. This will apply to all economic areas, including pharma, IT, telecom, textile and engineering.‚Äù</p>
<p>Quoting the World Bank, Aurangzeb informed the NA that these instruments would lower the tariffs, bringing them to the same level as Vietnam and Indonesia.</p>
<p>He then spoke about improving debt management and said: ‚ÄúOur economy has been stuck in debt for two decades, paying back loans. Our debt-to-GDP ratio was 74pc two years ago. But now, it is below 70pc. We will lower it further.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are diversifying debt products, the Sukuk bond has been started and launching products is being considered.‚Äù</p>
<p>The minister stressed that reforms in loss-making state-owned enterprises were underway, along with steps being taken to reduce fiscal strain and invite investment.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will complete PIA (Pakistan International Airlines) and Roosevelt Hotel transactions this year,‚Äù he asserted.</p>
<p>On pension reforms, the minister highlighted that the increase in pensions had been ‚Äúlinked‚Äù to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).</p>
<p>Pointing out that Pakistan was one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, the minister underscored the need for foreign assistance in mitigation, noting the IMF‚Äôs $1.3bn <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893900">climate fund</a>.</p>
<p>On social protection, the minister reaffirmed the government‚Äôs commitment to helping the underprivileged, stating that Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) helped over 11m children go to school.</p>
<p>He added that 1.5m pregnant mothers and children were given funds, while 250,000 were granted training on financial literacy.</p>
<p>Speaking about the digital sector, Aurangzeb noted that Pakistan‚Äôs cybersecurity ranking was rising. ‚ÄúThere has been $3.1bn in IT exports in the year‚Äôs 10 months, which is 21.2pc more than the previous year,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The minister proposed raising <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916213/pakistan-becoming-regional-it-hub">IT exports</a> to $25bn in the next five years.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb informed the parliament that the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority had launched a three-year plan for financing small and medium enterprises.</p>
<p>He said that under the SME risk coverage scheme, 95,000 SMEs had received Rs300bn in funding till May 2025.</p>
<p>Announcing measures for the construction sector, Aurangzeb said withholding tax slabs for property buying would be reduced from 4pc to 2.5pc, from 3.5pc to 2pc, and from 3pc to 1.5pc.</p>
<p>He further said that construction loans and mortgage financing for low-cost housing, as well as a tax credit on 10-marla houses and 2,000 flats, would be introduced.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo promote mortgage financing we want to get on with it, guaranteer system will be introduced,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The minister added that e-commerce platforms and courier services would also be taxed. ‚ÄúDigital economy should contribute to revenues,‚Äù he stressed.</p>
<p>He noted that pensioners below the age of 70 were getting over Rs100m collectively in pensions, so a 5pc tax would be applied to their income.</p>
<p>However, there would be no tax on low-to-medium income pension-earners.</p>
<p>The minister also detailed relief for federal government employees of Grades 1-20, saying they would get a 10pc pay raise. Retired government workers would get a 7pc pension hike, while disabled employees would receive a Rs6,000 convenience allowance.</p>
<p>Expanding on the new classification system for income tax, Aurangzeb said the difference between filers and non-filers would end. Only those who file their tax returns would be able to carry out huge transactions, including sale and buy of cars, and bank accounts.</p>
<p>On the topic of overseas Pakistanis, he noted $31.2bn were remitted to Pakistan, recording a 31pc increase of $10bn.</p>
<p>He affirmed that the government was taking steps for overseas Pakistanis, including an online system, civil procedure laws to prevent fraud, a quota in chartered medical schools, and civil awards for the top 15 senders.</p>
<p>Speaking about the agricultural sector, which comprises 34pc of the economy, Aurangzeb said Rs2.64bn were earned in FY24-25, adding that the National Seed Policy 2025 and the National Agri Technology Policy 2025 had been ‚Äúnearly approved‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚ÄúInterprovincial and interfederal connection improved,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Referring again to the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916097/pakistan-agreed-to-ceasefire-despite-having-upper-hand-on-condition-of-more-talks-with-india-bilawal">Pakistan-India conflict</a>, Aurangzeb stressed the need for the country to increase its water reservoirs and ensure water security.</p>
<p>Under the 2018 National Water Policy, he mentioned the goals of 10m-acre increase in water storage, 35pc reduction in water waste and 30pc increase in water-use efficiency.</p>
<p>He detailed that Rs133bn would be allocated for projects, Rs34bn for investment and Rs2bn for 15 key schemes, detailing the breakdown for various dams.</p>

<p>Before the session, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, following a meeting of the federal cabinet, questioned the contributions made to the national exchequer by the country‚Äôs elite economic group, ahead of the presentation of the budget for FY26.</p>
<p>‚ÄúToday, the federal cabinet will discuss the budget and give its approval. In the previous quarter year, the entire nation has faced these challenges. This is in no way an ordinary achievement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe sacrifices the common man has made, the burden the salaried class has borne in the previous budget. They say ‚Äòwe are salaried [class] but still gave Rs400bn to the treasury [‚Ä¶] what have the elite and the wealthy groups contributed compared to us?‚Äô,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is a question that the elite, including me, have to answer,‚Äù the premier noted.</p>
<p>He further said, ‚ÄúPakistan is standing at a point where we have to take off,‚Äù adding that the country‚Äôs stability indicators were satisfactory.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBe it the inflation rate, be it the policy rate, your exports increased, your remittances have seen a quantum jump, your IT exports have increased, and they have a lot of potential to increase.‚Äù</p></p>

                <h2>‚ÄòShort of structural, bold reforms‚Äô: Finance experts unpack 2025-2026 budget</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>In a rather noisy National Assembly session on Tuesday, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292/budget-fy26-pakistan-targets-42pc-growth-slashes-overall-spending">presented</a> the budget for the fiscal year 2025-2026, with a total outlay of Rs17.573 trillion and an ambitious 4.2 per cent growth target.</p>
<p>In his speech, Aurangzeb said the budget was being presented at a ‚Äúhistoric moment‚Äù, referring to the recent Pakistan-India escalation. He stressed the need for ensuring the country‚Äôs financial security in the same way that national sovereignty was protected.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan has now achieved economic stability and is moving towards a Pakistan that is prosperous,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p><em>Dawn.com</em> reached out to leading economists and analysts for their key takeaways from the budget. Here‚Äôs what they had to say:</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#an-anomaly" id="an-anomaly" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòAn anomaly‚Äô</h2>
<p>Economist Adil Nakhoda noted that the government had reduced its outlay for the current fiscal year, which, according to him, was an anomaly. ‚ÄúThis is likely due to the significant decline in interest payments as the government‚Äôs debt as a percentage of the gross domestic product has also declined,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He pointed out that the increase in defence expenditures was also anticipated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTax collection is expected to increase. This should come via an increase in the size of the tax net rather than increasing the burden on those already in the tax net,‚Äù Nakhoda said.</p>
<p>He added that the main feature of the budget was the government‚Äôs plan to undertake tariff rationalisation. ‚ÄúAlthough tariff cuts have been announced, the important task is to ensure that they are not replaced with anti-dumping duties and countervailing duties to ensure better transparency in the process.‚Äù</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#short-of-structural-bold-reforms" id="short-of-structural-bold-reforms" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòShort of structural, bold reforms‚Äô</h2>
<p>Highlighting the positive aspects of the budget, macroeconomist Sajid Amin Javed said the rationalisation of the tariff regime was a signal of opening the economy and pushing the industry to modernise and innovate. ‚ÄúBringing the customs duties and other duties to zero in the next four to five years is a good policy direction.‚Äù</p>
<p>Tax simplification, he noted, was a very important aspect, as tax filing in Pakistan was complicated for layperson. ‚ÄúAnother good thing is eliminating the non-filer category.‚Äù</p>
<p>On the flip side, Amin pointed out that on a strategic level, ‚Äúthis is exactly the budget that one can expect under the International Monetary Fund‚Äù ‚Äî targeting stabilisation and meeting revenue targets.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMost of the policy measures regarding taxation revolve around meeting revenue targets,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI feel this is a bid to correct the existing system in bits and pieces, but the bigger reforms that are often discussed, such as bringing wholesalers and retailers, and agriculture into the tax net, there wasn‚Äôt much said on it.‚Äù</p>
<p>The macroeconomist stressed that structural reforms, which were much needed to increase the tax base, were not seen. ‚ÄúOverall, it seems that the budget is silent on structural reforms. Even the relief, I feel, is as expected under the IMF programme.‚Äù</p>
<p>He also highlighted some contradictions in the budget. ‚ÄúOn the other hand, we are saying we want to formalise the economy and increase financial inclusion, but we have increased taxes on withdrawing money from banks for non-filers from 0.6pc to 1pc, which I feel may discourage financial inclusion.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOverall, I feel the budget falls short on structural and bold reforms; it is a stabilisation budget formed to meet revenue targets. One more thing I am seeing is that the objective or principle guiding the budget is the incoming IMF tranche.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is no undue relief. There is an attempt to balance the fiscal discipline,‚Äù Amin added.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#misplaced-priorities" id="misplaced-priorities" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòMisplaced priorities‚Äô</h2>
<p>‚ÄúThere is some positive news: fiscal consolidation,‚Äù said Ali Hasanain, an associate professor of economics at LUMS. ‚ÄúWe have reduced the budget deficit significantly, and we have run a primary budget surplus, which means that our expenditures for this year were less than the revenue.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur debt profile will improve over time. I believe we have already seen better debt maturities in the past year, and we are going to see that the overall interest payments have gone down. Overall, the debt is moving towards stabilisation, and we are not in as bad a debt crisis as we were previously.‚Äù</p>
<p>He noted that the big changes seen could be thought of more as accounting discipline rather than structural reforms, ‚Äúwhich means we have reduced expenses in development spending and cut subsidies‚Äù. While structural changes were missing, there was emphasis on discipline in spending, which Hasanain said was both good and bad.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThirdly, our development spending continues to look like it has distorted priorities. For example, 30pc of development spending is on transport and 5pc-6pc on education, which shows you are following an old development plan and your priorities are misplaced.‚Äù</p>
<p>Talking about the reduced tax bill for the real estate sector, he said it went against the grain of advice by most economists and international institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. ‚ÄúIt encourages speculative investments, and it does not improve the external sector picture.‚Äù</p>
<p>Moreover, the national tariff policy saw some serious tariff reductions, Hasanain said. He explained that Pakistan, over the last decade, had substantially increased its protection of certain industries such as auto and mobile manufacturing. The raw material for these industries was imported on cheap tariffs, and the final good was imported on expensive tariffs. ‚ÄúThis type of industry is a road to nowhere because it doesn‚Äôt make you globally competitive, nor does it increase exports.‚Äù</p>
<p>Commenting on the overall budget, he said that it was relatively disciplined but within the status quo and political constraints. ‚ÄúI think structural reforms and a serious reform agenda have not manifested. When that happens, change would be seen in several areas.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf they actually want to transform the country, it should be done by rethinking how the country is governed,‚Äù he added.</p></p>
