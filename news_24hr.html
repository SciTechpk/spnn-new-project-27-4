            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927959/pakistan-secures-landmark-tariff-deal-as-us-attitude-shifts' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan secures ‘landmark’ tariff deal as US attitude shifts</strong></a>
            <p><p><strong>• No official word from US; PM Shehbaz thanks Trump<br />
• Islamabad says agreement includes reduction of tariffs; diplomatic circles believe US will charge 15-20pc on Pakistani goods<br />
• Trump rails against India, Russia; many countries still in a lurch as tariff deadline expires</strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON: A day after signing an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927725">agreement</a> with the United States to develop “massive oil deposits” in Pakistani territory, Pakistani officials said the two nations had concluded a trade deal on Thursday, establishing a uniform tariff rate for bilateral trade.</p>
<p>“The agreement will result in a reduction of reciprocal tariffs, especially on Pakistani exports to the United States,” said an official statement released by the Pakistan Embassy in Washington.</p>
<p>In a statement issued in Islamabad, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called it “a landmark deal, which will enhance our growing cooperation and expand the frontiers of our enduring partnership in the days to come”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He also thanked US President Donald Trump “for his leadership role in finalising this historic US-Pakistan trade agreement”.</p>
<p>The embassy noted that the deal would boost bilateral trade, expand market access, attract investment and foster cooperation in areas of mutual interest.</p>
<p>The breakthrough was reached during a meeting between Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, along with United States Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer, in Washington. Secretary Commerce Jawad Paul and Pakistan’s Ambassador to the United States Rizwan Saeed Sheikh were also present.</p>
<p>President Trump announced the trade deal via a post on Truth Social, though he only mentioned the agreement to explore oil deposits. Similarly, the Pakistani statement placed more emphasis on the oil arrangement.</p>
<p>While Pakistan is celebrating the deal, the United States has yet to make an official statement regarding the agreement.</p>
<p>Moreover, while President Trump has mentioned specific tariff rates in announcements with other countries, he did not provide such details regarding the agreement with Pakistan.</p>
<p>However, diplomatic sources said the United States has agreed to charge a 15 to 20 per cent tariff on goods from Pakistan. The sources noted that the deal gives Islamabad an edge over India, which has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927587">slapped</a> with a 25pc tariff rate and penalised for buying weapons and oil from Russia and Iran.</p>
<p>The embassy noted that the deal marks the beginning of a new era of economic collaboration, especially in energy, mining and minerals, IT, cryptocurrency and other sectors.</p>
<p>It complements Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to broaden the scope of Pakistan-US economic ties and to include partnerships at the US state level. The agreement enhances Pakistan’s access to the US market — and vice versa.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to spur increased US investment in Pakistan’s infrastructure and development projects.</p>
<p>“This trade agreement underscores the commitment of both nations to deepen their bilateral relationship and explore all avenues for strengthening trade and investment ties,” the official statement added.</p>
<p><strong>‘Changing attitude in Washington’</strong></p>
<p>Hours after announcing the oil exploration deal, President Trump posted another message on his official site, clearly expressing his frustration with India.</p>
<p>“I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care,” he wrote. “We have done very little business with India. Their tariffs are too high — among the highest in the world.”</p>

<p>Dr Aparna Pande, the director of the India Initiative at the Hudson Institute in Washington, told the <em>New York Times</em> that “for the first time in 35 years, [India] is faced with an American administration that is not driven by strategic altruism”.</p>
<p>The nuance in the bilateral relationship embraced by US presidents since Bill Clinton — because of India’s rising importance to America’s national security — “appears to be fading”, Dr Pande said.</p>
<p>Analysts and officials in New Delhi told the <em>Times</em> that the changing attitude in Washington “has disrupted a relationship built painstakingly over decades, one that recognised India’s balancing act in a difficult region dominated by China and Russia”.</p>
<p>India had been allowed to grow closer to the United States on its own terms and had taken a firmer stance on China, the report added.</p>
<p>Christopher Clary, associate professor of Political Science at the University at Albany, said in a social media post that “if you were to summarise the history of US-India and US-Pakistan ties, it would go something like this: India sometimes refuses to make positive-sum compromises out of principle, and Pakistan has often compromised — or at least pretended to compromise — to ensure positive ties with Washington.”</p>
<p>Other analysts argued that the discovery of vast deposits of rare earth materials and oil also caused the change in Washington’s thinking.</p>
<p>Some analysts also draw a parallel between recent developments in Iran and the shift in Washington, pointing out that Pakistan borders two sensitive countries, Afghanistan and Iran.</p>
<p><strong>‘New world trade order’</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trump’s dream of a new world trade order faced a crucial test on Thursday, with dozens of economies — including key commercial partners like Canada — yet to secure US tariff deals ahead of a midnight <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903146">deadline.</a></p>
<p>The last-gasp scramble to strike bilateral accords came as an appeals court in Washington considered the legality behind Trump’s strategy of invoking emergency economic powers to declare sweeping duties on imports.</p>
<p>The 79-year-old Republican doubled down on the wide-ranging levies, posting on Truth Social: “Tariffs are making America GREAT &amp; RICH Again”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-3/5  w-full  media--left  ">
        <div class="media__item  "><img alt="Screengrab from Truth Social/@realDonaldTrump" src="https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/01082539112839f.png" /></div>

<p>He insisted in a separate post that the world’s biggest economy would have “no chance of survival or success” without protectionist measures.</p>
<p>However, in a sign of flexibility, he announced on Friday that he was delaying a tariff hike on Mexican products originally due on Friday for 90 days after talks with counterpart Claudia Sheinbaum.</p>
<p>So far, Washington has announced pacts with Britain, Vietnam, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea and the European Union, with those new rates expected to take effect Friday.</p>
<p>South Korea squeezed in a last-minute agreement on a 15pc tariff, significantly below the 25pc that Trump threatened on its goods.</p>
<p>But Trump announced 50pc tariffs on Brazilian products — while postponing imposition and allowing key exemptions — as an effort to pressure the US ally to drop its prosecution of right-wing former president Jair Bolsonaro on coup charges.</p>
<p>He also unveiled a 25pc levy on Indian imports, and warned Canada it would face trade repercussions for planning to recognise a Palestinian state.</p>
<p>And the details of the agreements that have been made remain vague. For example, the EU, while having reached a pact, continues pushing for a carve-out for its wine industry.</p>

            <p><p>GILGIT: More cloudburst-induced floods hit Ghizer and Hunza districts on Tuesday, causing widespread destruction.</p>
<p>According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA), the heavy rainfall led to flooding in Khatam village in Ghizer’s Gupis Valley, blocking the Ghizer-Shandur Road and damaging agricultural land and private properties.</p>
<p>The floodwaters also caused significant damage to the irrigation channel in Ghalapan village in Gojal, upper Hunza, which provides water for over 50,000 forest trees, according to residents.</p>
<p>The Gilgit-Baltistan government has declared 37 villages across the region as calamity-hit areas. According to a notification issued by the GB Home and Prisons Department, the affected areas include 12 villages in Diamer, nine in Gilgit, five in Ghizer, four each in Skardu and Shigar, two in Ghanche, and one each in Nagar and Kharmang.</p>

<p>GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said in a statement that the recent floods across Gilgit-Baltistan have caused an estimated Rs20 billion in damages. The floods have destroyed infrastructure, homes, agricultural land and public utilities.</p>
<p>Mr Faraq added that 22 vehicles were swept away by the floods, while 10 people, mostly tourists, have lost their lives. Four individuals have sustained injuries and between 10 and 15 tourists are still missing. Search operations are currently underway.</p>
<p>Over 500 homes and agricultural land, crops, roads, bridges and both public and private infrastructure have been significantly damaged.</p>
<p>The Gilgit-Baltistan government has initiated emergency and rehabilitation operations across the affected areas.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927951/trump-is-right-about-indian-economy-says-rahul-gandhi' target='_blank'><strong>Trump is right about Indian economy, says Rahul Gandhi</strong></a>
            <p><p><strong>• US president criticises India for doing business with Russia, describing both economies as ‘dead’<br />
• Medvedev brushes aside Trump’s attack</strong></p>
<p>NEW DELHI: By declaring the Indian economy as dead in the water on Thursday, President Donald Trump has put Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party in a bind. Until recently, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was canvassing support for the US president’s election. Its supporters were holding special prayers and muttering mystical chants for Trump’s victory. There was at least one temple created where a sculptured image of Trump was worshipped.</p>
<p>But Trump has ignored the lavish praise and called out India’s energy imports from Russia and its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927819">tariff</a> regime as non-negotiable.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The Indian government said it was trying to figure out a response by consulting all the “stakeholders”, a euphemism for angry businesses whose hopes were riding on Mr Modi’s daring ability to play both sides of the street.</p>
<p>That appears to have hit a dead-end. Encouraging words have come from former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev who poohpoohed Mr Trump’s vitriol and continued to see a world in good cheer despite the US president’s hissed warnings.</p>
<p>On the other hand, opposition leader Rahul Gandhi was sanguine that Trump was right at least about the state of the Indian economy. “He [Trump] is right. Everybody knows that the Indian economy is a dead economy, except the prime minister and the finance minister. I am glad that President Trump has stated a fact.</p>
<p>“The whole world knows – India’s economy is a dead economy and the BJP has destroyed the economy. Why did they destroy it? To help Adani,” said Mr Gandhi while speaking to reporters outside the parliament on Thursday.</p>
<p>Mr Gandhi was carefully silent about India’s Russia <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844615">ties.</a> The reference to tycoon Gautam Adani seemed more severe as the billionaire businessman close to Mr Modi is facing a corruption case in the US.</p>
<p>Rahul Gandhi’s statement came hours after Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927587">announced</a> on Wednesday that a 25 per cent tariff, plus a penalty, will be imposed on India starting Aug 1. The Modi government has responded to it saying that it “will take all steps necessary to secure our national interest”.</p>
<p>Later on Wednesday, Trump mou­nted a sharp attack and said: “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”</p>
<p><strong>Medvedev’s ‘unmoved’</strong></p>
<p>In Moscow, Mr Medvedev responded to Trump’s comments with studied calm, saying they were “nervous reaction” and are evidence that Moscow is pursuing the right path.</p>
<p>The US president had described Medvedev as a “failed” former leader and warned him to “watch his words”, adding that Medvedev was “entering very dangerous territory”.</p>
<p>Medvedev was unmoved. “If some words from the former president of Russia trigger such a nervous reaction from the high-and-mighty president of the United States, then Russia is doing everything right and will continue to proceed along its own path,” Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, wrote on social media.</p>
<p>He also ridiculed Trump’s claim that the Russian and Indian economies were “dead” and going “down together” due to lack of cooperation with the US.</p>
<p>Medvedev had earlier dismissed Trump’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927617">demands</a> for Moscow to swiftly end its military campaign against Ukraine, calling the threats of secondary sanctions against Russian energy customers “theatrical” and ineffective.</p>
<p>Trump previously criticised the BRICS group of nations, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and several other states, for pursuing a new multipolar world order. The US president claimed proposed tariffs on countries doing business with BRICS members could cripple the organisation.</p>
<p>Trump’s statement regarding India and Medvedev followed New Delhi’s refusal to accommodate US demands on trade.</p>
<p>Mr Gandhi said that the Modi government had “destroyed India’s economic, defence and foreign policy. They are running this country into the ground”.</p>
