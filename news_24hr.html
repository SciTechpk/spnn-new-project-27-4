            <p><p>Pakistan was appointed as the vice chair of the UN Security Council’s (UNSC) Counter-Terrorism Committee on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The committee was established by UNSC resolution 1373 (2001), adopted unanimously on September 28, 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.</p>
<p>The committee, comprising all 15 UNSC members, is tasked with monitoring implementation of the above resolution, which requested countries to implement several measures intended to enhance their legal and institutional ability to counter terrorist activities at home, in their regions and around the world.</p>
<p>Pakistan was also appointed head of the UNSC committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011), which oversees the implementation of the sanctions measures on the Afghan Taliban.</p>
<p>In a press release, the Pakistan Mission to the UN called the appointments a “significant diplomatic development”.</p>

<p>It added that Pakistan was also appointed as the co-chair of the UNSC’s Informal Working Group (IWG) on documentation (working methods) and the newly established IWG on Sanctions.</p>
<p>The IWG on documentation focuses on improving the UNSC’s working methods, transparency, efficiency and inclusiveness.</p>
<p>The IWG on Sanctions issues aims to review and enhance the design, implementation, and effectiveness of UN sanctions regimes.</p>
<p>“These appointments represent an acknowledgement of Pakistan’s active engagement with the United Nations system, including its constructive role as an elected member of the Security Council,” the press release said, adding, “They are also an international recognition of Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts”.</p>
<p>Pakistan, it said, remained committed to working with the UN and fellow member states in advancing the principles and purposes of the UN Charter as well as playing its part in the global fight against terrorism in collaboration with its international partners.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1882311">began</a> a two-year term as a non-permanent UNSC member on the first day of the new year.</p>
<p>This marks Pakistan’s eighth term on the council, providing an opportunity to shape discussions on pivotal international issues, but also posing significant challenges.</p>

<p>Pakistan’s term coincides with heightened tensions in conflict zones such as Gaza, held Kashmir and Syria.</p></p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has invited the opposition leader for consultations on appointing the next chief election commissioner (CEC), months after the incumbent’s term expired in January, it emerged on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The constitutional deadline for the appointment of a new chief election commis­sioner and two members of the Election Com­mission of Pakistan (ECP)  <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897583">exp­ired</a> on March 12, with no action from the government.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866480">26th Amendment</a> allowed the CEC and the members to continue till their successors come in. As per Article 215(4) of the Constitution, the appointment of the CEC and members must be completed within 45 days.</p>
<p>In a letter dated May 16 and addressed to Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub — seen by <em>Dawn.com</em> — the prime minister noted that the term of the incumbent CEC, Sikandar Sultan Raja, expired on January 27 this year, adding that he was holding office in accordance with the second proviso to clause 1 of Article 215 of the Constitution (term of office of the Commissioner [and members]).</p>
<p>“In term of clause (2A) of Article 213 and sub-clause (b) of clause (2) of Article 218 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, three names each for the appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and two Members (i.e. for Sindh and Balochistan) are to be forwarded to the Parliamentary Committee for hearing and confirmation of any one person against each position,” the letter read.</p>
<p>“In view of the aforesaid, you are invited for a meeting for consultation, in terms of clause (2A) of Article 213 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, in order to finalize three names each for appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and Members from Sindh and Balochistan.”</p>
<p>No exact date for a meeting was given, nor were any names released about prospective CECs.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#disqualification-reference" id="disqualification-reference" title="Permalink"></a>Disqualification reference</h2>
<p>Separately, a hearing on the disqualification reference against Ayub was adjourned until July 1 as he was obligated to attend the upcoming federal budget session in parliament.</p>
<p>Last week, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Sadiq <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914430">forwarded</a> a reference seeking Ayub’s disqualification to the ECP.</p>
<p>The reference is based on an application filed by former MNA Babar Nawaz, who lost to Ayub in the 2024 general election in NA-18 (Haripur) by a margin of 82,000 votes.</p>
<p>A five-member committee chaired by the CEC presided over the hearing, with Ayub stating that he had yet to appoint counsel.</p>
<p>“The budget session will start soon and I am a member of the Finance Committee. The budget meeting will be held for two weeks,” he said, requesting time to attend the budget session and appoint a leader.</p>
<p>Sindh Election Commission member Nisar Durrani said that there is a 90-day time limit to act on the speaker’s reference. The commission granted Ayub’s request and adjourned the hearing until June 24.</p>
<p>In a separate case in which the opposition leader was accused of rigging by Babar Nawaz, the opposition leader’s lawyer sought time to submit a reply and arguments. The commission adjourned the hearing until July 1.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Speaking to reporters following the hearing, Ayub assailed the National Assembly for sending the reference “without using their brains”.</p>
<p>“The speaker did not consult me about this reference,” he said. “In the 2018 elections, I beat my opponent by 40,000 votes. He previously approached the Abbottabad High Court, but the case was dismissed.”</p></p>

            <p><p>The high-powered delegation, led by former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, has reached Washington after concluding its two-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow">visit</a> to the United Nations Headquarters in New York on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pakis­tan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">launched</a> a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence here.</p>
<p>The delegation comprises Senator Rehman, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt and Jalil Abbas Jilani.</p>
<p>In New York, the delegation “drew attention to India’s illegal use of force and violations of international law, including the UN Charter and International Humanitarian Law, particularly targeting of civilian areas and killing of innocent civilians, including women and children”, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>It added that the delegation rejected India’s allegations regarding the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909746">attack</a> in India-occupied Kashmir “without a shred of evidence, and warned against India’s weaponisation of water through its unilateral hold on the IWT [Indus Waters Treaty] in violation of international law and treaty obligations”.</p>
<p>According to the statement, the delegation met with the UN secretary-general, the president of the General Assembly, the president of the Security Council, the representatives of the Security Council’s permanent and non-permanent members, ambassadors of the OIC Group, representatives of the media, civil society, and think tanks, and the Pakistani community.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the delegation highlighted the country’s role and commitment to combating terrorism in all forms, while also “drawing attention of the international community towards Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan, and its transnational assassination campaign”.</p>
<p>“Cooperation, not politicisation, was required to effectively combat the menace of terrorism, it was underlined,” the statement said.</p>
<p>The delegation also emphasised the country’s responsible and lawful response to Indian aggression and provocations, adding that Pakistan “seeks peace but will always defend its sovereignty with resolve”.</p>
<p>It warned that Indian attempts to create a “new normal” that implied arbitrary and unilateral strikes could lead to disastrous consequences in South Asia’s nuclear environment, reiterating that peace in the region hinged on a just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in line with the UN Security Council resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>“The international community was urged to uphold international law and the sanctity of treaties, push for the revival and normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty, and support the initiation of a comprehensive dialogue to resolve all outstanding issues between India and Pakistan, including the core dispute of Jammu and Kashmir,” the statement read.</p>
<p>Speaking at a press conference at UN Headquarters, Bilawal said coope­ration between Pakistan and India’s intelligence agencies could significantly reduce terrorism in South Asia.</p>
<p>“I am completely confident that if ISI and RAW were ready to sit down and work together to fight these forces, we would see a significant decrease in terrorism in both India and Pakistan,” he added.</p>
<p>He also urged the global community to remain engaged in South Asia, warning that the risk of conflict between nuclear-armed neighbours had grown, not diminished, after the recent ceasefire.</p>
<p>“With the intervention of the international community — and I would like to mention particularly the role played by the US President Donald Trump and his team led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio — we did manage to achieve a ceasefire between India and Pakistan,” said Bilawal. “This is a welcome first step, but it’s only a first step.”</p>

<p>Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, detailing PM Shehbaz’s recent multi-state <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow">visit</a>, said the international community was lauding Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts.</p>
<p>“We are being praised for our kinetic actions”, he said, adding that Pakistan’s narrative was clear to the international community from the beginning and remained so until the resolution of the conflict.</p>
<p>While addressing a press conference, FM Dar said the delegation led by PM Shehbaz expressed gratitude for the support of countries to Pakistan throughout the period of tension, particularly Turkiye and Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>“People in Turkiye and Azerbaijan took to the streets to celebrate the resolution,” he said, noting that Pakistan’s victory was a victory for the entire Muslim community.</p>

<p>Appreciating Turkiye’s role in de-escalation efforts, he recalled that on the night of May 6, when India attacked, his Turkish counterpart was “the first one to call and ask if there is anything they can do for Pakistan”.</p>
<p>He further said that in the wake of the recent events, India’s “hegemony has been destroyed” and its supremacy “blown in the air”, adding that Indians were now blaming each other while Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts were being globally acknowledged.</p>

<p>Separately, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) Syed Tariq Fatemi called on Yury Ushakov, senior aide to the Russian president on foreign policy issues, and briefed him on the recent escalation in South Asia, outlining Pakistan’s position vis-à-vis India’s aggressive actions, especially unilaterally holding the IWT in abeyance.</p>
<p>“Besides these meetings, the SAPM gave two interviews to the leading Russian TV networks, expressing his candid views on the increasingly positive trends in Pakistan-Russia relations and recent escalation between Pakistan and India. He also had an extensive exchange of views with a group of academics and journalists from prominent print and electronic media. Furthermore, the SAPM was hosted by Valdai Discussion Club, a prestigious think-tank in Moscow, for a talk on June 4, on the recent developments in South Asia and Pakistan-Russia relations.</p>
<p>“Overall, the visit of the SAPM was highly successful, with several important official engagements and candid exchanges with parliamentarians, a think tank, several academics and journalists. It paved the way to explicitly share Pakistan’s perspective on the recent situation and other important issues, such as IWT to the Russian side.</p>
<p>“There was widespread appreciation for the manner in which Pakistan was enhancing its relations with Russia, in important areas of trade, investment, energy and connectivity routes,” the FO said.</p>
