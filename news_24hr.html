            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911211/dg-ispr-warns-of-swift-and-assured-response-in-case-india-breaks-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>DG ISPR warns of ‘swift and assured response’ in case India breaks ceasefire</strong></a>
            <p><p>Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Thursday warned in an interview with British broadcaster <em><a class="link--external" href="https://news.sky.com/story/pakistan-vows-swift-response-if-india-violates-ceasefire-13368060" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sky News</a></em> that any Indian ceasefire violation would be met with a “swift and assured response” by Pakistan, cautioning that serious escalation could result in mutual destruction.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>On May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">announced</a> that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan. According to the government, forty civilians — including seven women and 15 children — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910733">lost</a> their lives in the Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Sky News</em>, DG ISPR warned that by rooting for war, India was carving out a “recipe for mutual destruction,” adding that the world now recognised the extent of the nuclear threat.</p>
<p>“Any sane player like the USA understands this absurdity and what the Indians are trying to do here,” Lt Gen Chaudhry told the publications.</p>
<p>Talking about India’s actions in Kashmir, he accused the country of trying to “internalise the issue and harassing” Kashmiri people with a heavy troop presence.</p>
<p>“It is a problem that has to be resolved by the people of Kashmir as per the United Nations Security Council resolution,” he said.</p>
<p>He continued: “Anyone who tries to violate our territory and integrity and sovereignty, our response will be brutal.”</p>
<p>DG ISPR warned that a “serious escalation between India and Pakistan would destroy both sides” under the concept of mutually assured destruction — a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy which posits that a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by an attacker on a nuclear-armed defender with second-strike capabilities would result in the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender.</p>
<p>In a press conference <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910381">held</a> last week after the ceasefire was brokered, DG ISPR had cautioned that a conflict between Islamabad and New Delhi “can lead to peril of more than 1.6 billion people.”</p>
<p>“In reality, there is no space for war between India and Pakistan,” he added.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911203/india-has-offered-us-a-trade-deal-with-no-tariffs-trump' target='_blank'><strong>India has offered US a trade deal with no tariffs: Trump</strong></a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that India had offered a trade deal that proposed “no tariffs” for American goods, while expressing his dissatisfaction with Apple’s (AAPL.O) plans to invest in India.</p>
<p>New Delhi is seeking to clinch a trade deal with the US within the 90-day pause announced by Trump on April 9 on tariff hikes for major trading partners.</p>
<p>“It is very hard to sell in India, and they are offering us a deal where basically they are willing to literally charge us no tariffs,” Trump said in a meeting with executives in the Qatari capital Doha.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> has reported that New Delhi has offered to reduce duties to zero on 60 per cent of tariff lines in a first phase of the deal under <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901301">negotiation</a> with Washington, while offering preferential access to nearly 90pc of the merchandise India imports from the US.</p>
<p>India’s equity benchmarks jumped to a seven-month high after Trump’s comment on the deal with India.</p>
<p>The Indian trade ministry did not reply to a mail seeking comments on the proposed deal.</p>
<p>Trump in Doha said he had confronted Apple’s CEO Tim Cook about shifting production to India, as the American company moves to make most of its iPhones sold in the United States at factories in India by the end of 2026, and is speeding up those plans to navigate potentially higher tariffs in China.</p>
<p>“Tim, we treated you very good, we put up with all the plants you built in China for years … we are not interested in you building in India, India can take care of themselves, they are doing very well, we want you to build here”, Trump recalled himself telling <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903322">Cook</a>, who was not in the Doha meeting.</p>
<p>India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in recent years promoted India as a smartphone manufacturing hub and Apple’s suppliers have ramped up production in the country.</p>
<p>In March, Apple’s main India suppliers <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1568475">Foxconn</a> and Tata shipped nearly $2 billion worth of iPhones to the US, an all-time high, to bypass Trump’s impending tariffs.</p>
<p>The United States is India’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totalling some $129bn in 2024. The trade balance is currently in favour of India, which runs a $45.7bn surplus with the US.</p>
<p>India’s trade minister Piyush Goyal will lead a trade delegation to the United States starting May 16 to advance trade negotiations, two government officials told <em>Reuters</em> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>India has some of the world’s highest tariffs on imports, and Trump has previously called India a “tariff abuser”.</p></p>

            <p><p>Bulls took control of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday as shares gained over 1,400 points, bringing calm to yesterday’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911142/stocks-close-flat-on-budget-jitters-rupee-concerns">heightened volatility</a>.</p>
<p>The positive momentum comes just a day after Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911147/sbp-receives-2nd-tranche-of-1bn-from-imf">received</a> the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">second tranche</a> from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), worth $1 billion, under its loan programme.</p>
<p>The KSE-100 index opened with a gain of  858.23 points (0.73 per cent) to stand at 119,394.75 points from the previous close of 118,536.52 at 9:40am.</p>
<p>The intraday high was recorded 119,990.30 points at around 3:18pm, 1,453.78 points (1.23pc) higher than yesterday.</p>
<p>Finally, the KSE-100 closed at 119,961.91 points, with a gain of 1,425.39 points (1.20pc) compared to the previous close.</p>

<p>Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, said the market was positive due to the recent inflows from the IMF.</p>
<p>He also noted there were “expectations of further inflows on the back of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691/imf-approves-disbursement-of-1bn-to-pakistan-under-7bn-deal">IMF Board approval</a>”, which on May 9 greenlit the $1bn tranche but also allowed an additional arrangement for $1.4bn climate funds under the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893193/imf-mission-to-visit-pakistan-next-week-to-take-forward-1bn-climate-fund-talks-aurangzeb">Resilience and Sus­tainability Facility</a> (RSF).</p>

<p>Today’s bullish momentum comes as the market continues to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910505/psx-jacks-up-record-9pc-as-ceasefire-with-india-calms-investors">recover</a> from the upheaval brought by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186">intense military row</a> between Pakistan and India last week, after the two agreed to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>

<p>Tariq also mentioned lower yields on treasury bill auctions and expectations of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903565">resolution</a> of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1865802/circular-debt-the-hidden-force-behind-rising-electricity-costs">circular debt</a> in the gas and power sectors.</p>
