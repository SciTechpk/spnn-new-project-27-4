                <h2>FO says Pakistan has ‚Äòdismantled‚Äô terrorist outfits amid US designation of group blamed for Pahalgam attack</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs stance against terrorism, saying that the country has ‚Äúeffectively and comprehensively dismantled‚Äù terrorist outfits.</p>
<p>The statement follows the US State Department‚Äôs decision on Thursday to <a class="link--external" href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/07/terrorist-designation-of-the-resistance-front/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">designate</a> a little-known group  called The Resistance Front (TRF) ‚Äî responsible for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> ‚Äî as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) and specially designated global terrorist (SDGT) group.</p>
<p>The April 22 attack ‚Äî which resulted in the deaths of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a> ‚Äî sparked a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military confrontation</a> between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan as New Delhi blamed it on Islamabad, which strongly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">denied</a> the allegations while calling for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral investigation</a>.</p>
<p>According to a <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36xe95g06zo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BBC News</a></em> report in June, the group had initially said it was behind the attack, but later disowned it.</p>
<p>The US State Department claimed that the little-known group was a ‚Äúfront and proxy‚Äù of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).</p>
<p>‚ÄúTRF has also claimed responsibility for several attacks against Indian security forces, including most recently in 2024,‚Äù the State Department said in a statement.</p>
<p>In a statement today, the FO said, ‚ÄúAny linkage with LeT, a defunct organisation <a class="link--external" href="https://nacta.gov.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/proscribed-organizations-06-oct-2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">banned</a> in Pakistan, belies ground realities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan has effectively and comprehensively dismantled concerned outfits, arrested and prosecuted the leadership, and deradicalised its cadres,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan condemns terrorism in all forms and manifestations; zero tolerance, and international cooperation against terrorism are cornerstones of our policy.‚Äù</p>
<p>The FO highlighted Pakistan‚Äôs counterterrorism efforts, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896143">apprehension</a> of Mohammad Sharifullah, who was the ‚Äúmastermind‚Äù of the 2021 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1642871">Abbey Gate bombing</a> at Kabul airport.</p>
<p>The statement further said that the investigations into the Pahalgam incident were ‚Äústill inconclusive‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile the issue under consideration pertains to US domestic laws, India has a track record of exploiting such designations to push anti-Pakistan propaganda with a view to divert international attention from its irresponsible and rogue behaviour, including ongoing human rights atrocities, especially in occupied Kashmir,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The FO‚Äôs statement also urged the international community to ‚Äúadopt objective and non-discriminatory policies‚Äù to address terrorism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTerrorist organisations like Majeed Brigade must also be listed as [an] alias of BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army),‚Äù the FO asserted.</p>
<p>In 2022, an anti-terrorism court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1684132">awarded</a> a combined sentence of 33 years imprisonment to LeT chief Hafiz Saeed in two cases of terror financing registered by the Counter Terrorism Depart¬≠ment.</p>
<p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global money laundering and terrorism financing watchdog, in 2022 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1716183">removed</a> Pakistan from a list of countries under ‚Äúincreased monitoring‚Äù, also known as the ‚Äúgrey list‚Äù, after four years.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt has two concurrent action plans. After a lot of work by Pakistani authorities, they have largely addressed all of the action plan items,‚Äù then-FATF president Raja Kumar said.</p></p>

            <p><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Friday announced that Pakistan recorded a current account surplus of $2.1 billion during the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>Due to the widening trade gap and higher external debt servicing, the country <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917759">posted</a> a current account deficit of $103 million in May compared to a $47m surplus in the preceding month and $1.2bn in March.</p>
<p>According to SBP <a class="link--external" href="https://easydata.sbp.org.pk/apex/f?p=10:211:::NO:RP:P211_DATASET_TYPE_CODE,P211_PAGE_ID:TS_GP_BOP_BPM6SUM_M,210&amp;cs=1B25722420322956C75438ADD306E4B0A" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data</a>, the current account saw a surplus of $2.1bn, compared to a deficit of $2.1bn during the previous fiscal year.</p>

<p>Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad highlighted the developments in a post on X, stating that the surplus was the highest in 22 years.</p>
<p>‚Äú[The] country‚Äôs current account for June 2025 closes in $328m surplus, taking full-year surplus to over $2.1bn,‚Äù he wrote.</p>
<p>Schehzad added that remittances surged by 27 per cent year-on-year to reach a ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù $38bn.</p>
<p>He added that in the current fiscal year, textile exports increased by 7.4pc year-on-year to $17.9bn, while IT (information technology) and IT-enabled services exports climbed to $4.6bn ‚Äî a year-on-year increase of 44pc.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLast, but not the least, [the] Pakistan Equities Market (KSE-100) crossed 140,000 points, making a historic mark in its history, with market value crossing Rs 16.8 trillion (close to $60bn),‚Äù he wrote.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed gratitude for the current account surplus, calling it ‚Äúvery welcome‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúForeign exchange reserves have exceeded $19bn due to government measures,‚Äù he was quoted as saying in a statement from his office.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe main reason for the stability in current account surplus is a significant increase in remittances and exports,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúImproving financial and economic indicators show that the country‚Äôs economy is on the path of stability.‚Äù</p>
<p>Commending his team, the PM said that the government is taking priority steps to provide a business and investment-friendly environment in the country, according to the statement.</p></p>
