            <p><p>• PM calls US president ‘man for peace’; says offer of impartial probe into Pahalgam was met with aggression<br />
• Bilawal says New Delhi can’t be ‘net security provider’ in the region if it can’t even defend its own skies<br />
• Dar blames political rhetoric from Indian leaders for keeping South Asia tensions high</p>
<p>WASHINGTON / ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari have praised US President Donald Trump for his role in helping <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">de-escalate</a> the latest India-Pakistan military confrontation, and urged Washington to facilitate a comprehensive dialogue between the two nuclear neighbours.</p>
<p>Speaking at an event at the US Embassy in Islamabad marking the 249th anniversary of American independence, PM Shehbaz said the recent four-day conflict had revealed the “Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909771/dg-ispr-says-india-has-no-evidence-for-pahalgam-incident-or-alleged-attacks-in-last-48-hours">incident</a> was a false-flag operation”, and credited President Trump for playing a decisive role in ensuring a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire.</a></p>
<p>The premier said that the US president had shown beyond any doubt that “he is a man for peace … and beneficial business deals”.</p>
<p>He added, “President Trump is a man against escalation and a man against cold and hot war.”</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">downed</a> six Indian fighter jets in self-defence after Indian aggression on May 6-7 resulted in the deaths of 33 Pakistani civilians.</p>
<p>“We responded with restraint and patience,” he said. “Our offer for an impartial international probe into the Pahalgam incident was met with aggression instead.”</p>
<p>He said that India “should have come out with solid evidence and convinced the world about the occurrence of the incident”.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also extended heartfelt felicitations to the US president and people of the United States, on his behalf and on behalf of the Pakistani nation, on celebrating their Independence Day.</p>
<p>He said the bilateral ties between the US and Pakistan were entering into renewed friendship, and the close contacts were being revived.</p>
<p><strong>Facilitate dialogue</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, speaking to US-based Pakistani journalists in Washington, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said President Trump “deserves credit” for helping facilitate the ceasefire between Pakistan and India last month.</p>
<p>“We should also pay attention to what the US president is saying. On 10 different occasions, he has taken credit for facilitating the ceasefire between India and Pakistan — and rightly so. He deserves that credit, because it was his efforts that helped make the ceasefire possible,” said Mr Bhutto-Zardari, the leader of the Pakistani delegation that began a three-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915108">visit</a> to Washington on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“So, if the US is willing to help Pakistan in maintaining this ceasefire, it is reasonable to expect that an American role in arranging a comprehensive dialogue would also be beneficial for us,” he added.</p>
<p>While India publicly denies that President Trump played any role in the ceasefire agreement and consistently rejects third-party mediation on bilateral issues, Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s remarks appear aimed at drawing the US into a more proactive diplomatic role in South Asia.</p>
<p>“Yes, America has an establishment, a thought pattern,” he acknowledged, “but knowing the ground realities, we are not delusional. We know what the realities of this city (Washington) are, what its geopolitics are, but we are here because we believe that our message is the message of truth. It aligns with international laws and relevant UN Security Council resolutions.”</p>
<p>His comments also targeted what he described as a failed US strategy of building up India as a regional security anchor. Referring to New Delhi’s recent troubles, he said: “What security will that net security provider provide to others when it cannot do that for itself? They were supposed to protect others, but couldn’t protect their own planes.”</p>
<p>“The concept of India as a counterweight to China now seems hollow. It’s not even a paperweight anymore. This approach, I believe, must now be re-evaluated,” he said.</p>
<p>India has long pitched itself as a “net security provider” in the Indo-Pacific region — a concept US policymakers have also endorsed. But Mr Bhutto-Zardari said this strategy had outlived its utility.</p>
<p>“I believe that this strategy of building up India as the net security provider has failed,” he said. “I believe what can really provide security to this region, and to the rest of the world, is peace bet­ween India and Pakistan.”</p>
<p><strong>Rhetoric sustaining tensions</strong></p>
<p>Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday expressed readiness for a comprehensive dialogue with India, but warned that rising political rhetoric from Indian leaders is sustaining high tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals following last month’s military confrontation.</p>
<p>“Whenever they (Indians) want a dialogue, at any level, they will find us ready, but we are not desperate,” Mr Dar said during a press briefing in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Mr Dar said that although the ceasefire has held, political tensions remain inflamed by statements from Indian leaders, particularly Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently described the military exchange as “just a trailer” ahead of upcoming elections in Bihar.</p>
<p>“Political rhetoric is still on, possibly for internal reasons,” Mr Dar said. “I wish sense prevails. We are peace lovers, focused on economic revival, but dignity, sovereignty and territorial integrity come first.”</p>
<p>Mr Dar insisted that any future dialogue between Pakistan and India must be comprehensive, addressing terrorism, water rights under the Indus Waters Treaty, and broader bilateral issues. “When India is ready for talks, it will find us ready for talks on all issues.”</p>
<p>He also rejected Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishan­kar’s assertion that the talks should only cover the issue of terrorism, saying it wouldn’t work.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915519/provinces-take-the-lead-on-rs42tr-in-uplift-spending' target='_blank'><strong>Provinces take the lead on Rs4.2tr in uplift spending</strong></a>
            <p><p>• NEC approves plan with consensus as govt eyes 4.2 per cent growth in next fiscal year<br />
• Centre to finance projects worth Rs1 trillion amid 29pc PSDP cut, provincial allocations to fund the rest<br />
• Sindh, KP ‘unhappy’ with exclusion of projects from federal budget<br />
• Premier, all CMs to meet today on Indian moves against Pakistan’s water</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Fuelled by a 22pc increase in provincial allocations, the National Economic Council (NEC) on Wednesday approved with consensus a record Rs4.22 trillion national development outlay for the next fiscal year to upgrade growth rate to 4.2pc from 2.7 this year, despite an IMF-decreed 29pc cut in the public sector development programme (PSDP) compared to the current year.</p>
<p>The provincial expansionary stance is expected to come under the International Monetary Fund’s watch, which has been pushing for greater provincial cash surpluses to support the federal government in delivering a healthy amount for debt servicing, besides effective taxation of the agriculture income under a new national fiscal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910966">pact.</a></p>
<p>The meeting of the NEC — the country’s highest economic decision-making forum — was moved up by a day so that the prime minister, who chaired the meeting, could travel abroad. All provincial chief ministers, the deputy prime minister, and federal ministers for planning, finance and information were present. PM’s adviser Rana Sanaullah also attended the meeting.</p>
<p>The meeting also decided that the PM and all CMs would meet on Thursday morning for a special meeting in light of India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913144">move</a> to disrupt Pakistan’s water share. They will ponder a strategy to safeguard Pakistan’s water resources.</p>
<p>The development portfolio includes Rs1tr from PSDP, Rs2.869 trillion from the provincial annual development plans (ADPs), and Rs355bn for separate projects by the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) through their resources.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the Centre has allocated Rs880bn for the PSDP, down 20pc when compared to the current year’s revised allocation of Rs1.1tr and 37pc lower than the original allocation of Rs1.4tr. Yet, the government pitched the PSDP at Rs1tr after including Rs120bn to be generated through a petroleum levy imposed by the prime minister last month to finance projects in Balochistan.</p>
<p>The provincial share for next year has gone up by 22pc from Rs2.358tr. The provinces had pitched Rs2.795tr ADPs two days ago at the meeting of the Annual Plan Coordination Committee (APCC), but revised it to Rs2.869tr for the next year.</p>
<p><strong>Punjab leads charge</strong></p>
<p>The next year’s development plan is led by Punjab with a record Rs1.204tr, 20pc higher than the Centre, up 10.6pc compared to the current year’s Rs1.089tr. This is the first time a federating unit has exceeded the federal allocation, showing enhanced financial muscle of the provinces. Sindh trailed just behind the Centre with Rs967bn allocation, a healthy 27pc increase from its current year’s Rs705bn development fund. Punjab and Sindh enhanced their allocations by Rs16bn and Rs80bn respectively over what they had reported to the APCC on Monday.</p>
<p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa announced to invest Rs417bn in development next year, showing a massive 33pc increase over the current year’s allocation of Rs313bn. It had reported Rs440bn ADP in APCC but scaled down by Rs23bn. Balochistan, mostly dependent on the federal support, would announce Rs281bn development plan, up 12pc over the current year’s Rs252bn. Likewise, estimates for SOE’s projects were also jacked up to Rs355bn from Rs288bn two days ago.</p>
<p>Sources said despite their own heavy allocations, the Sindh and KP chief ministers complained over exclusion of their projects from the federal budget, while the Balochistan chief minister thanked the Centre for giving special attention to the restive province. KP chief minister’s adviser on finance Muzammil Aslam, however, appreciated the centre’s limitations in the given circumstances.</p>
<p>The cash-strapped government, however, did not forget protecting allocations for coalition partners’ parliamentarians scheme at Rs50bn and also enhanced funds for PML-N’s trademark road-building projects.</p>
<p>All other sectors, including special areas like Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, would be handicapped by lower allocations, as all sectors, including energy, food, and water, faced funding constraints.</p>
<p>Based on these spending plans, the government set next year’s growth <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915125">target</a> at 4.2pc, supported by 4.4pc target in agriculture output, 4.3pc in industry and 4pc in the services sector, and an inflation rate at 7.5pc.</p>
<p>It set the target for national savings at 14.3pc of GDP in FY 2025-26, slightly higher than the current year’s 14.1pc and total investment of 14.7pc of GDP, up from 13.8pc in FY 2024-25. This reflects a narrowing saving investment gap to be financed through modest external inflows.</p>
<p>Public investment is projected to increase from 2.9pc to 3.2p; similarly, private investment is also projected to rise from 9.1pc of GDP to 9.8pc. Fiscal and monetary policies will aim for consolidation and stability, with an expected inflation of 7.5pc due to the low base effect and risk of ongoing trade tensions and domestic tariff rationalisation measures.</p>
<p>The agriculture growth will be supported by a recovery in important crops (6.7pc) and cotton ginning (7pc), as well as robust performance in livestock.  The industrial sector is expected to benefit from a significant revival in LSM with 3.5pc growth, the planning ministry said, with 3pc growth in mining and quarrying, “alongside sustained growth momentum in construction and energy, gas and water supply”.</p>
<p>The services sector, which forms the largest share of GDP, is set to grow by 4pc, underpinned by stronger performance in wholesale and retail trade, transport, storage &amp; communications, financial services and real estate.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915518/balochistan-amends-ata-allowing-detention-sans-charge-for-three-months' target='_blank'><strong>Balochistan amends ATA, allowing detention sans charge for three months</strong></a>
            <p><p>QUETTA: The Baloc­histan Assembly on Wednesday adopted the Anti-Terrorism (Balo­chistan Amendment) Act, 2025, giving law enforcement agencies powers to detain any person for three months without being charged.</p>
<p>The draft of the bill was moved by Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) MPA Mir Sadiq Sanjrani.</p>
<p>JUI-F MPA Ms Shahida Rauf, while speaking on the floor of the House, said that the bill is being bro­ught to the assembly with good intentions and her party would support it.</p>
<p>She, however, suggested to the Leader of the House that every clause of the bill should be discussed in the House again so that there remained no ambiguity about it.</p>
<p>“If only one party opposes it, that will cause great loss to the province,” Ms Rauf said, adding that the bill should not be passed in haste.</p>
<p>Jamaat-i-Islami MPA Maulana Hidayatur Rehman, while taking up the issue of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1876335">missing persons</a>, said the matter must be resolved.</p>
<p>Commenting on the draft of the amendment, he said the anti-terrorism bill might be correct, but it needs to be clear who it actually benefits.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Who will be held accountable for those being killed?” Maulana Rehman said, adding that the Counter Terrorism Department’s actions are visible to everyone and the House should be taken into confidence on the bill and it should be passed only after taking the opinion of every member of the House.</p>
<p>Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti claimed the issue of missing persons has been used to discredit state institutions, and legislation was the solution to the problem.</p>
<p>“We must now prevent this issue from being misused. Now, anyone arrested will be presented before a magistrate.”</p>
<p><strong>Six-year sunset clause</strong></p>
<p>The bill, seen by <em>Dawn</em>, proposes that anyone suspected of offences enshrined in the anti-terrorism law may be held in preventive detention for up to three months for the purpose of inquiry.</p>
<p>The inquiry will be held by a police officer not below the rank of Superintendent or through a Joint Interrogation Team (JIT). If the detention order is issued by the armed forces or intelligence agencies, the inquiry shall be conducted by a JIT consisting of members of the concerned agency.</p>
<p>During the course of inquiry, the concerned law enforcement officer heading it shall be vested with all powers relating to search, arrest, and seizure of property and other materials relevant to the offence.</p>
<p>The amended law also allows for detainees to be confined in a detention / rehabilitation / de-radicalisation centre who, upon a written request by the investigating agency or investigating officer, can be handed over to any law enforcement agency for the purpose of investigation.</p>
<p>The provincial government shall notify Oversight Board(s), comprising two civilians, two military officers, a psychiatrist, and a criminologist, under the chairmanship of the additional chief secretary (Home) or any other nominated officer to assess the case of each detainee and their ideological disposition and mental, physical, and psychological condition during detention, and recommend, where necessary, their transfer to a rehabilitation / de-radicalisation centre.</p>
<p>Explaining the bill’s salient features, CM Bugti told the House that if any institution picks someone up, it can keep them in custody for up to three months, after which they must be presented before a court and informed of the charges filed against him/her.</p>
<p>The detained person will be kept in a centre where he/she can meet their family members and the lawyer of the detained person will also be informed about it.</p>
<p>“If anyone disappears beyond this system, then he/she will be considered a truly missing person,” Mr Bugti said, adding that the new law would be valid for six years. The legislation also includes a provision to extend its operation by two years through a notification by the provincial government.</p>
