            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said Pakistan won the war but sought peace and invited India to live as a “peaceful neighbour”, as the country celebrated Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’s success with a ceremony.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan began after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> air strikes on Pakistan, causing civilian casualties. Both sides exchanged missiles over the following week, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> tensions. An <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">American intervention</a> led to a ceasefire.

<p>Today’s ceremony, marking the Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanksgiving Day), was held at the Pakistan Monument in Islamabad and attended by PM Shehbaz, armed forces chiefs, and other civil and military leaders. It began with the recitation of the Holy Quran, opening speeches, a flypast, and national songs.</p>

<p>Beginning his speech, PM Shehbaz praised the martyrs, their families, his cabinet members, service chiefs, and the nation for successfully responding to the Indian aggression.</p>
<p>“We have won the war but we want peace. We have taught our enemy a lesson but we condemn aggression, he said. “We want this part of the world to be as prosperous and progressive as others through hard work, undying efforts and living like peaceful neighbours.”</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz said he had had a meeting with the services chiefs on the night between May 9 and 10, in which it was decided that since the enemy had crossed “the last limit” and rejected Pakistan’s offer of an international investigation, a “measured response” must be given.</p>
<p>He detailed that around 2:30am that night, the army chief had told him on a secure telephone call that India had launched its ballistic missiles on Pakistan.</p>
<p>“He told me, ‘Mr prime minister, grant us permission to strike the enemy with such force that they never forget it’.”</p>
<p>The premier added that later that night after Pakistan retaliated, the army chief had told him: “We have given a befitting response and now we are being requested for a ceasefire. So, what do you think?”</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said that he had responded: “What could be greater than landing a blow that leaves the enemy’s head spinning and desperate for a ceasefire? Go ahead and accept the offer.”</p>
<p>“This is a brief account of a long story from that day,” he said.</p>
<p>He informed the audience that the technology used by the Pakistan Air Force had stunned the enemy and sent the trust and confidence of allies soaring. “This is a historic development that God brought about within a matter of hours,” PM Shehbaz said, adding that the military’s prowess was being talked about from the United States to Japan.</p>
<p>The premier said no major power can now block Pakistan’s path, with the entire nation united from Peshawar to Karachi, standing behind and supporting the army. He also reiterated his gratitude to allied nations for their efforts in achieving the ceasefire.</p>
<p>He went on to say that the conflict solved nothing, only bringing more poverty, unemployment and other problems to both sides.</p>
<p>“The lesson is that we have to sit down at the table like peaceful neighbours and settle our outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir. Without resolving these issues, I don’t think we will have peace in this part of the world on a long-term basis.</p>
<p>“If we want permanent peace then we need permanent solutions of Jammu and Kashmir and water distribution. Then once we resolve these issues, the sky’s the limit. We can talk of trade, exchange of business communities and cooperate in the field of counter-terrorism,” the prime minister emphasised.</p>

He added that innocent Pakistani citizens were martyred in this cowardly attack.</p>
<p>“In response to the enemy’s aggression, our falcons struck such effective blows that the enemy’s military bases, weapons depots and air bases were turned into ruins,” the premier continued.</p>
<p>He also praised the leadership of Chief of Army Staff General (COAS) Syed Asim Munir and paid tributes to Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu and his falcons as well as the security of the maritime borders of the Pakistan Navy under the leadership of Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf.</p>

            <p><p>Turkiye-based Celebi, which provides airport ground handling in India, has launched a legal challenge to New Delhi’s decision to overturn its security clearance, arguing that “vague” national security concerns were cited without reasoning.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Amid growing public anger in India about Turkiye’s stance on Pakistan in the India-Pakistan conflict, the Indian government on Thursday revoked Celebi’s security clearance in the “interest of national security”.</p>
<p>Celebi Airport Services India, in a May 16 filing seen by <em>Reuters</em>, asked the Delhi High Court to set aside that decision, arguing it would impact 3,791 jobs and investor confidence, and was issued without any warning to the company.</p>
<p>“Mere rhetoric of national security without elaborating upon in what manner is an entity a threat to national security is unsustainable in law,” the company said in the filing, which is not public.</p>
<p>The order “fails to disclose any specific or substantive reason except for a vague and general reference to ‘national security’… [it] provides no reasons or justification”, it added.</p>
<p>India’s government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The case is likely to be heard on Monday.</p>
<p>In its filing, Celebi said that while its shareholders were registered in Turkiye, “majority end control” of the group is held by companies that do not have Turkish incorporation or origin.</p>
<p>In revoking Celebi’s clearance on Thursday, India’s junior aviation minister Murlidhar Mohol said on X the government had received requests from across India to ban Celebi.</p>
<p>“Recognising the seriousness of the issue and the call to protect national interests, we have taken cognizance of these requests,” he said.</p>

<p>The Shiv Sena party, a key ally in Modi’s government, had held protests against Celebi in Mumbai this week, demanding that the city’s airport sever ties with it.</p>
<p>Celebi in its filing said it was providing ground handling services at airports in New Delhi, Kerala, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Goa.</p>
<p>It had undergone background checks and security verifications by various national security and intelligence agencies in India before starting work, it added.</p>
<p>Delhi Airport late on Thursday said on X it had “officially ended its association with Celebi” for ground handling and cargo operations.</p>

<p>The judge also imposed a fine of Rs200,000 and ordered him to pay Rs500,000 in compensatory damages to the victim. In case of failing to pay, the convict will be sentenced to six months’ additional imprisonment.</p>
<p>The first information report of the case was lodged at the Saddar Beroni police station on July 20, 2024, under Pakistan Penal Code Section 376iii (punishment for rape of a minor) on the complaint of the victim’s mother.</p>
<p>The mother said she worked as a housemaid and had left her 21/22-year-old daughter and nine-year-old son at home when the culprit had entered around noon and raped the former. The woman said her children had raised a hue and cry with her son alerting someone who called her up and informed her about the incident.</p>
<p>The woman had urged the police for the strictest of punishment to be meted out to the culprit.</p>
<p>In February, a Rawalpindi additional sessions judge had convicted a man of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893013">raping his niece</a>, sentenced him to life imprisonment and awarded a Rs500,000 fine.</p>
<p>Rape laws in Pakistan have seen significant reforms, particularly with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1595907">Anti-Rape Ordinance 2020</a>, which introduced special courts for expedited trials, mandated medico-legal examinations within six hours, and established a national sex offender registry.</p>
<p>However, systemic challenges persist, as over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1624732">80 per cent</a> of suspected sex offenders are acquitted due to deficient investigations, weak prosecutions, and societal prejudices.</p></p>
