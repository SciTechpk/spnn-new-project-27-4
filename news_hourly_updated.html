                <h2>‚ÄòTerrorist attack‚Äô injures 6 FC personnel in KP‚Äôs Bannu: police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Six Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel were injured in a ‚Äúterrorist attack‚Äù at a checkpoint in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Bannu district on Wednesday, a police spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Bannu Police spokesperson Aamir Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>: ‚ÄúTerrorists attacked a Frontier Constabulary checkpoint situated in the border area of Takhti Khel Wazir in Bannu.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs a result of the attack, six personnel of the FC were injured, but the immediate response of the constabulary forced the terrorists to flee.‚Äù</p>
<p>Over a week ago, President Asif Ali Zardari promulgated an ordinance empowering the federal government to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924024/fc-upgraded-to-status-of-federal-force">transform the FC</a>, a border security force, into the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924291/revamped-fc-not-police-force-but-security-unit">Federal Constabulary</a>.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Aamir added that the injured constables have been taken to the Combined Military Hospital in Bannu for treatment.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPolice teams have been sent to the area and have begun a search operation to track down the terrorists,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">surge</a> in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies‚Äô personnel, and security forces.</p>
<p>Attacks increased after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">broke</a> a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP ‚Äî including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur ‚Äî have seen a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a>, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773/3-terrorists-killed-during-joint-operation-in-kps-bannu-police">this month</a>.</p>
<p>A day ago, a police official identified as Constable Hayatullah was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925895/police-constable-martyred-in-bannu-terrorist-attack">martyred</a> when terrorists attacked him in the district while he was returning home from duty.</p>
<p>On July 21, over a dozen terrorists <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1925535">attacked</a> a police station in the Bakkakhel town of Bannu. However, the cops responded effectively and thwarted their nefarious plan to take over the building. The police also thwarted a sabotage bid by defusing explosives in the Ghoriwala town of Bannu. An official said the explosives were seized during an intelligence-based operation in the area.</p>
<p>On July 19, two police officials, including an officer, were injured when terrorists carried out a quadcopter <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925051">attack</a> on Bannu‚Äôs Miryan police station.</p></p>

            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926053/swat-student-death-case-authorities-seal-madressah-police-return-students-to-families" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <h2>Swat student death case: authorities seal madressah, police return students to families</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Omar on Wednesday said that authorities sealed the madressah in Swat, where a student was killed earlier this week, and returned its other students to their parents.</p>
<p>A young student was allegedly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925841/young-student-allegedly-beaten-to-death-by-seminary-teachers-in-swat-police">beaten to death</a> by his madressah teachers on Monday evening in Swat‚Äôs Chaliyar village, according to the police. He was rushed to the nearest hospital by students and teachers, but doctors declared him dead upon arrival.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in his office accompanied by Superintendent of Police (Investigation) Badshah Hazrat Khan, DPO Omar said: ‚ÄúWhen we came to know of this incident, we also thought to check with the other students studying in the madressah if there was any other case such as this or not. We sent our team to this madressah and when statements were taken from the children, it was found out that some others had been subjected to violence as well.‚Äù</p>
<p>Omar said police detained all madressah staff upon receiving this information with nine more taken into custody and a case registered on the police‚Äôs complaint under the Child Protection Act.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAround 160 to 170 students were retrieved and we returned them safely to their families after contacting them and the madressah was sealed.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said investigations into any possible sexual assault under way with samples taken, adding that the relevant section would be added to the first information report (FIR) on any confirmation.</p>
<p>DPO Omar said there were four suspects nominated in the FIR and two were subsequently arrested, with teams formed to trace and arrest the others.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey will not be able to escape the law. We will arrest them as soon as possible,‚Äù he said of the absconding suspects.</p>
<p>He said the police took action immediately upon being alerted of the incident and the case was registered.</p>
<p>Omar said the items used to allegedly beat and bind the student were also recovered.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, KP Chief Khateeb Maulana Tayyab Qureshi strongly condemned the incident in a statement, saying that ‚Äúthe death of a student at the hands of a madressah teacher is the height of brutality.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe elements involved in the incident should be severely punished. Such so-called reciters and teachers are a stain on the name of madressahs. The public should avoid admitting children to unregistered madressahs.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said the condemnation of the incident by the Wifaq-ul-Madaris was a positive development</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will never allow brutality under the guise of religious education. Islam does not allow us to beat children. A teacher is not allowed to beat, regardless of their field. The government should take retribution from the teacher involved in the beating.‚Äù</p>
<p>Talking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, he reiterated his strong condemnation, saying no amount would be enough.</p>
<p>He demanded exemplary punishments for the culprits who were becoming a basis to defame religion and madressahs so that no one ever dared to commit such crimes, especially in regards to students and children.</p>
<p>Qureshi said students were the responsibility of madressahs to be taken care of, adding that such violence and treatment harmed students‚Äô psyche and health. He also hailed the sealing of the madressah and the return of the students to their families.</p>
<p>He also appealed to ulema to ensure that violence and physical beatings did not occur at seminaries, saying that the law and religion did not allow it.</p>
<p>Under the KP Child Protection and Welfare Act 2010 and its 2018 regulations, corporal punishment is a punishable offence, violation of which can result in up to six months of imprisonment or a Rs50,000 fine, or both.</p>
<p>In May this year, the KP Private Schools Regulatory Authority, through a <a class="link--external" href="https://psra.gkp.pk/notification/15/detail" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a>, strictly prohibited corporal punishment in all private schools across the province after receiving complaints.</p>
<p>Violations, however, continue to prevail. According to a recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924804/crisis-of-protection-child-rights-violations-surge-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa">report</a> by the KP Child Protection and Welfare Commission, children across the province were subjected to 33 different forms of abuses, including 14 incidents of corporal punishment.</p>
<p>In April, a seminary teacher in Kasur was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905109">arrested</a> for allegedly beating a student with a hot iron for not memorising his lesson at Bangla Kambovan.</p></p>
