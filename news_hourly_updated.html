                <h2>6 killed in GB flash floods as search for missing tourists continues: official</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least six tourists were killed in Gilgit-Baltistan‚Äôs Diamer district as heavy floods battered the region, while a search for missing visitors was underway, an official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudburst-induced</a> floods wreaked havoc across the region. The flood-related <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829">death toll</a> in the region rose to five on Tuesday, after four lost their lives and 15 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719">went missing</a> on Monday.</p>
<p>GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that rescue teams recovered another body in Babusar valley, taking the total number of deaths to six. ‚ÄúThe search operation to locate the remaining tourists at Babusar is underway,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>According to Rescue 1122, GB‚Äôs Ghanche district experienced floods in various areas. Flash floods in Kandos villages damaged a dozen homes, a dispensary, mosques, agricultural land and crops, it said.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 also stated that flash floods in Sikarkoi damaged several houses and other infrastructure in Dass Mohallah and the surrounding areas in Gilgit.</p>

<p>Separately, rescue teams on Thursday recovered the body of a retired colonel who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/pmd-issues-glof-alert-for-gb-kp-as-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-from-diamer-amid-floods#:~:text=Two%20swept%20away%20in%20Rawalpindi%E2%80%99s%20DHA'">went missing</a> after his car was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925919">swept away</a> by floodwaters and slipped into a drain in Rawalpindi last week, while a search for his daughter continues, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>Rescue efforts have been underway since Tuesday, when Retired Colonel Ishaq Qazi, aged approximately 62‚Äì64 years, and his 25-year-old daughter went missing after the car they were in was swept away by rainwater.</p>
<p>District Emergency Officer (DEO) Sibghatullah said, ‚ÄúThe body of Ishaq had been found near the Soan River bridge, while rescue operations are underway to look for his daughter.‚Äù</p>
<p>Earlier today, Sibghatullah had said that rescue operations had entered a third day to search for the duo, while parts of their car had been found.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRescue 1122 found the bonnet and a door of the car under the Soan River bridge,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>According to a statement by Islamabad‚Äôs Sihala police station on Tuesday, the duo were in a grey Honda vehicle and were residents of Defence Housing Authority‚Äôs Phase 5.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDue to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain,‚Äù the police statement had said.</p>
<p>Pakistan experiences <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925461">monsoon rainfall</a> from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>Last week, Section 144 was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924761">imposed</a> across Punjab along with a state of emergency in several districts as heavy rains triggered flooding and claimed over 60 lives across the province in 24 hours.</p>

<p>On the other hand, residents of a housing society blocked Rawalpindi‚Äôs Grand Trunk Road after the rescue teams could not recover the body of a teenager who had drowned a day earlier.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, a 17-year-old boy drowned while crossing a nullah near the Metro City Housing Society. He was walking on a small passage when high-speed torrents swept him away in deep waters.</p>
<p>Two of his relatives jumped in the water to rescue him, but they told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the water was moving at high speed and the boy could not be saved.</p>
<p>Gujar Khan assistant superintendent of police and assistant commissioner also reached the spot and called the Rescue 1122 team, who were unable to retrieve the body as of the filing of this report. The residents of the area blocked the GT Road, citing the ‚Äúinaction and incapacity of Rescue 1122 in recovering the victim‚Äôs body after many hours‚Äù.</p>

                <h2>Pakistan and Saudi Arabia stress mutual resolve to strengthen defence cooperation</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Islamabad and Riyadh on Thursday emphasised mutual resolve to enhance bilateral defence cooperation as Saudi Arabia‚Äôs naval chief met with Pakistan‚Äôs top military officer, the military‚Äôs media wing said.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in mutual economic <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885389">interests</a>, strategic military cooperation, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1876955">assistance</a> and energy <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889514">supplies</a>, with Riyadh being a significant <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889514">source</a> of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.</p>
<p>According to a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7363" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the Royal Saudi Naval Forces‚Äô (RSNF) chief of staff, Vice Admiral Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Ghuraybi, called on Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza at Joint Staff Headquarters in Rawalpindi today.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe CJCSC highlighted the historical brotherly relations between [the] Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and [the] Islamic Republic of Pakistan, and emphasised mutual resolve for enhancing existing bilateral defence cooperation,‚Äù the ISPR said.</p>
<p>The dignitaries discussed the evolving regional security dynamics within the Middle East and South Asia, particularly focusing on maritime security, it added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>A ‚Äúsmartly turned-out tri-services contingent‚Äù presented a guard of honour to the Saudi naval chief as he arrived at the headquarters earlier today, the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Al Ghuraybi also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925853">met</a> with his Pakistani counterpart Admiral Naveed Ashraf at the Naval Headquarters in Islamabad.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>During the meeting, both leaders discussed enhancing defence cooperation and the regional maritime security situation, along with other matters of mutual interest.</p>
<p>The two naval chiefs pledged to further strengthen and diversify the scope of the existing bilateral defence relationship between the countries.</p>
<p>A day ago, CJCSC Mirza <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926164/cjcsc-meets-turkish-azeri-defence-ministers">attended</a> the 17th International Defence Industry Fair in Istanbul.</p>
<p>On the sidelines of the event, he held meetings with Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler, Chief of Turkish General Staff Metin Gurak, Azerbaijan‚Äôs Defence Minister Hasanov Zakir Asgar Oglu and his deputy Gurbanov Agil Salim Oglu.</p></p>
