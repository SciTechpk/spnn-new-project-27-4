                <h2>Pakistan bans all ports to Indian flag carriers in tit-for-tat move</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan on Saturday banned the use of its ports by Indian flag carriers in a tit-for-tat response as diplomatic tensions between the two nations flared in the wake of a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">killed 26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe.</a></p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing</a> its forces and India‚Äôs premier granting ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>‚Äù to the military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of April 30, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an Indian incursion within 24‚Äì36 hours, diplomatic channels have been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension">engaged</a> to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>Earlier today, India said Pakistani-flagged ships would not be allowed to visit any of its ports, and Indian flagged-ships would not visit any ports in Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis order is issued to ensure safety of Indian assets, cargo and connected infrastructure, in public interest and for interest of Indian shipping,‚Äù the Directorate General of Shipping said in a statement.</p>
<p>Similarly, an order issued later today from the Ministry of Maritime Affairs‚Äô Ports and Shipping Wing said: ‚ÄúIn view of the recent development of maritime situation with neighbouring country, Pakistan in order to safeguard maritime sovereignty, economic interest and national security enforces following measures with immediate effect: Indian flag carriers shall not be allowed to visit any Pakistani port, Pakistani flag carriers shall not visit any Indian port [and] any exemption or dispensation shall be examined and decided on case to case basis.‚Äù</p>
<p>Following last week‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284/trade-ties-and-flights-off-limits-as-pakistan-retaliates-to-indias-moves">tit-for-tat measures</a>, New Delhi has taken more steps against Pakistan, including <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907663/diplomatic-channels-work-overtime-amid-threat-of-indian-adventurism#:~:text=PAF%E2%80%99s%20prompt%20response.-,Airspace%20concerns,-With%20tensions%20running">closing its airspace</a> for Pakistani planes until May 23 and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908068/india-continues-blocking-social-media-channels-tries-to-undercut-imf-deal">blocking</a> social media accounts of media and leaders.</p>
<p>Trade between the two nations has dwindled over the last few years.</p>
<p>In August 2019, Pakistan had already <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1499076">formally downgraded</a> its trade relations with India to the level of Israel, with which Islamabad has no trade ties at all, in reaction to New Delhi‚Äôs decision to revoke Article 370 of its constitution that granted occupied Kashmir a special status.</p>

<p>India also said it banned the import of goods originating from or transiting via Pakistan and suspended the exchange of inbound mail and parcels.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.dgft.gov.in/CP/?opt=notification" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a>, said the ban on all imports will take effect immediately.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis restriction is imposed in the interest of national security and public policy,‚Äù it said.</p>

<p>In response to India‚Äôs slew of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">aggressive moves</a> against the country in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan announced <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284">retaliatory measures</a> that have included halting all border trade, closing its airspace to Indian carriers and expelling Indian diplomats.</p>
<p>However, Pakistan earlier this week <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907774/govt-allows-150-stranded-afghan-trucks-to-cross-wagah-border-for-goods-delivery">allowed</a> 150 stranded Afghan trucks carrying goods for India to cross the Wagah Border, easing a weeks-long bottleneck, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.</p>
<p>In another step to cut off ties, the Indian government also announced today it was suspending the exchange of all ‚Äúinbound mail and parcels‚Äù from Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGovernment of India has decided to suspend exchange of all categories of inbound mail and parcels from Pakistan through air and surface routes,‚Äù a public notice issued by its communications ministry said, according to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-suspends-exchange-of-all-inbound-mails-parcels-from-pakistan-101746263268350.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hindustan Times</a></em>.</p>
<p>The notification was also shared on the official X account of India‚Äôs Communications Minister Jyotiraditya M. Scindia.</p>

<p>Mail exchanges between the two arch-rivals also saw a breakdown in 2019 following India‚Äôs revocation of occupied Kashmir‚Äôs special status, according to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/pakistan-resumes-postal-mail-services-with-india20191119123042/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ANI News</a></em>.</p>
<p>Pakistan suspended postal mail services in August 2019 and resumed them in November that year, <em>ANI</em> said, citing Pakistani media reports.</p>
<p>Parcel services, however, remained suspended as of Nov 19, 2019, the report added.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDuring the visit, media representatives would be taken to the exact locations falsely propagated by India as terrorist camps and would be presented with factual, on-ground realities that refute these malicious allegations,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>The ministry said that Pakistan reaffirmed its steadfast commitment to peace and ‚Äúcategorically rejected any form of terrorism or terrorist activities anywhere in the world‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe nation remains resolute in defending its sovereignty, and any aggression by India will be met with a swift and befitting response,‚Äù it concluded.</p>

                <h2>Pakistan reacted responsibly despite India‚Äôs provocative actions: PM Shehbaz</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said that Pakistan‚Äôs reaction had been responsible and measured so far despite India‚Äôs provocative actions following severe tensions between the two countries in wake of the Pahalgam incident.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000.

<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> and India‚Äôs premier granting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">‚Äúoperational freedom‚Äù</a> to the military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an Indian incursion within 24‚Äì36 hours, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension">diplomatic channels</a> have been engaged to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>A statement from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office (PMO) said PM Shehbaz held a meeting with Ambassador of the Republic of Turkiye Dr Irfan Neziroglu at the PM House.</p>
<p>The premier reiterated that Pakistan had always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.</p>
<p>The prime minister emphasised that India had failed to share any evidence and was falsely trying to link Pakistan to the Pahalgam incident, the statement said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia has yet to respond to Pakistan‚Äôs offer to have a credible, transparent and neutral international investigation to ascertain the facts behind the Pahalgam incident,‚Äù he said, adding that Pakistan would cooperate fully with such an investigation and would welcome if Turkiye joined it.</p>

<p>The prime minister also highlighted that Pakistan had rendered great sacrifices in its counter-terrorism efforts, including 90,000 casualties and over $152 billion in economic losses over the years.</p>
<p>He further said that India‚Äôs actions would distract Pakistan from its counter-terrorism efforts.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz expressed his gratitude to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for his strong statement that supported Pakistan during the prevailing situation in South Asia as well as his call for peace in the region.</p>
<p>The prime minister noted that Turkiye‚Äôs support to Pakistan was reflective of the ‚Äúhistoric, deep-rooted and time-tested brotherly relations‚Äù between the two countries and their peoples.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed the government‚Äôs focus on economic recovery and growth for which it required peace and security in its neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The Turkish ambassador informed the prime minister that Turkiye appreciated Pakistan‚Äôs position and expressed its solidarity with Pakistan while calling for de-escalation and urging restraint in the current crisis to maintain peace and security in South Asia.</p>

<p>Separately, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to regional peace and stability while resolutely protecting its sovereignty and national interests in a telephone conversation with Greek counterpart George Gerapetritis.</p>
<p>FM Dar briefed him on current regional developments, categorically rejecting India‚Äôs ‚Äúbaseless allegations, disinformation campaign and illegal unilateral measures‚Äù that threatened regional peace and security.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe strongly condemned India‚Äôs unilateral decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance ‚Äî a blatant violation of its international obligations,‚Äù the Foreign Office (FO) said in a press release.</p>

<p>Dar reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs call for an independent and transparent investigation to establish the facts.</p>
<p>FM Gerapetritis emphasised the importance of restraint to prevent escalation and preserve peace and stability. He welcomed Pakistan‚Äôs proposal for a neutral and transparent inquiry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Azad Jammu Kashmir Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq said on Friday that India was hatching conspiracies to create unrest in the territory.</p>
<p>In his address to the All Parties Kashmir Conference hosted in the state metropolis, he warned,  ‚ÄúIf India attacks Pakistan, we will respond with full force. India is actively plotting to destabilise AJK.‚Äù</p>
<p>He emphasised that Pakistan‚Äôs political leadership must demonstrate complete solidarity and stand firmly behind the armed forces against the Indian aggression.</p>
<p>Reaffirming his stance on the Kashmir issue, Haq said his narrative drew strength from the people of Pakistan, the armed forces and the country‚Äôs military leadership.</p>
<p>He said that a single action by the Indian government had brought the situation back to what it was before August 5, 2019.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Liberation Cell is ready to support if the political leadership from the All Parties Kashmir Conference forum wants to participate in the protest demonstration,‚Äù the AJK premier said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs far as the Kashmir policy is concerned, we are open for debate and ready to remove any shortcomings,‚Äù he remarked.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have to think about how to take forward the issue of Kashmir, for which we have lost three generations,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Highlighting the significance of national unity, Haq said, ‚ÄúThe enemy attacks you only when he thinks that the nation is divided.‚Äù</p></p>
