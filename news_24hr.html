            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925613/11-suspects-arrested-in-balochistan-couples-killing-case-transferred-to-serious-crimes-wing-police' target='_blank'><strong>11 suspects arrested in Balochistan couple’s killing, case transferred to serious crimes wing: police</strong></a>
            <p><p>At least 11 suspects, including a tribal leader, have been arrested for their alleged involvement in the killing of a man and a woman in Balochistan after a video of the murder went viral on social media, with the case now handed over to the Serious Crimes Investigation Wing (SCIW), police said.</p>
<p>Superintendent of Police (SP) SCIW Syed Saboor Agha told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “Eleven people have been arrested, including a tribal leader who issued directives to shoot the couple, and all of them will appear before a judicial magistrate today.”</p>
<p>The viral video showed a group of men leading a couple out of vehicles and into a desert before gunning them down with pistols and shooting the bodies. Political figures and activists said it was an ‘honour’ killing incident. On Sunday, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PakSarfrazbugti/status/1946928844923195709" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced on X</a> that he had directed the Balochistan Police to take immediate action, following which one suspect was apprehended.</p>
<p>According to a first information report (FIR) — a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em> — registered by the Station House Officer (SHO) Naveed Akhtar at Quetta’s Hanna-Urak Police Station, he lodged the complaint after receiving the video clip that had gone viral on social media, showing a man and a woman being brutally shot and killed by armed individuals.</p>
<p>SHO Akhtar stated that he, along with his team, reached Balochistan’s Dagari, situated on the outskirts of Quetta and, upon investigation, discovered that the incident occurred three days before Eidul Azha in the area of Sanjidi in Dagari.</p>
<p>“The victims seen in the viral video have been identified as Bano Bibi and Ihsanullah,” the FIR said, naming eight suspects who allegedly shot the couple dead. The FIR also mentioned 15 other unknown suspects involved in the incident.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, SHO Naveed Akhtar said, “Owing to the nature of the murder, the case has now been transferred to the Serious Crime Investigation Wing for further investigation.”</p>
<p>Prior to being killed, the victims were allegedly taken to a tribal leader, who declared them guilty of being involved in an ‘immoral relationship’ (locally termed ‘Karo Kari’) and ordered their execution, following which they were taken to the [desert] and shot dead, the FIR said.</p>
<p>“The murder was filmed and uploaded to social media to spread fear and panic among the public,” it added.</p>
<p>According to the FIR, a case was registered against the suspects under Sections 302 (murder), 149 (unlawful assembly), 148 (rioting while armed with a deadly weapon), 147 (rioting) of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.</p>
<p>One of the main suspects — tribal leader Sardar Sherbaz Satakzai — was presented before an anti-terrorism court today with Judge Muhammad Mubeen presiding over the case.</p>
<p>The suspect was handed over to SCIW on a two-day physical remand on the judge’s order upon the police’s request.</p>
<p>Chief Justice Balochistan High Court Justice Rozi Khan Barrech took notice of the case and summoned the additional chief secretary and inspector general of police Balochistan to the court in the matter.</p>
<p>In a press release issued by BHC — seen by <em>Dawn.com</em> — it was notified that BHC Chief Justice “has taken notice of the news circulating on electronic, print and social media of the murder of a couple for marrying out of choice at Dagari”. The statement added that, “In this matter, the chief justice has summoned the chief secretary and IG Balochistan to court on July 22, 2025”.</p>
<p>The incident was widely condemned by politicians, civil society activists, and the public, who termed it “barbaric” and urged the government to take swift action against the perpetrators.</p>
<p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari called the suspects “beasts”, saying that they deserved no concessions. “I have faith that the criminals involved in this murder will be brought to justice soon,” he said, according to the state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/domestic/bilawal-condemns-murder-of-couple-in-balochistan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)</a>.</em>  “This murder should be a test case for the Balochistan government, as it is gender terrorism.”</p>
<p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif shared the video in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KhawajaMAsif/status/1946923637686284672" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, with a message for the people of Balochistan. Referring to the growing militancy in the province, he said: “Those who have taken up arms against the state — start by raising your voice against the unjust system that surrounds you.”</p>
<p>He continued that the ones responsible for this “oppression are your own brothers, not the travellers and labourers from other provinces”, pointing out the recent bus attack in Balochistan’s Kalat district, which left three people dead and other similar incidents in the recent past.</p>
<p>PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman also <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/sherryrehman/status/1946955545946337781" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">condemned</a> the murder in a post on X, labelling it an “unforgivable crime”.</p>
<p>“Crushing the right to marry is a violation of fundamental human rights. Killing in the name of tribal decisions is a despicable act. The cycle of brutality in the name of honour must be stopped,” she wrote.</p>
<p>“By mercilessly killing the married couple, not only have law and justice been insulted, but the authority of the provincial government has also been challenged,” Rehman added. “The chapter of oppression and barbarism under the guise of jirgas must be closed.”</p>
<p>The senator emphasised that the perpetrators must be brought to justice and that legislation to end “outdated customs” was indispensable.</p>
<p>Baloch activist Sammi Deen Baloch decried the shooting as an ‘honour’ killing, appealing to Baloch elders to “respect women’s decisions”.</p>
<p>“As a woman, this chilling incident is deeply painful and heart-wrenching for me,” she wrote on X. “Killing any woman in the name of honour is not only a heinous crime but also the worst humiliation of humanity.</p>
<p>“I appeal to Baloch and Pashtun tribal elders, influential sections of society, and intellectuals to respect women’s decisions. Today’s woman is the same woman who is educated, aware, and fully capable of making decisions about her future.”</p>
<p>She demanded that the killing be investigated transparently and comprehensively so that the suspects would be brought to justice and “no one dares to repeat such a barbaric act in the future”.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849480">‘honour’ killings</a> continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881836">Data</a> from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p>
<p>The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.</p></p>

            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has arrived in New York to attend high-level signature events of Pakistan’s UN Security Council (UNSC) Presidency, including a conference on Palestine, according to the Foreign Office.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921308">assumed</a> the UNSC Presidency for the month of July 2025, making it the country’s eighth term on the Security Council as a non-permanent member. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026. The presidency involves a focus on multilateralism, peaceful dispute resolution, and regional cooperation.</p>
<p>“Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar,
arrived in New York for an official visit from 21 to 28 July 2025,” the FO announced in a post on X.</p>
<p>“During the visit, he will lead high-level signature events under Pakistan’s Presidency of the UN Security Council, hold bilateral and multilateral meetings in New York and Washington, DC, and represent Pakistan at the International Conference on the two-state solution, co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and France.”</p>

<p>It added that upon his arrival, FM Dar was received by Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Asim Iftikhar, and the Ambassador of Pakistan to the United States, Rizwan Saeed Sheikh.</p>
<p>According to a July 19 <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/curtain-raiser-deputy-prime-ministerforeign-ministers-visit-to-the-united-states-to-attend-high-level-signature-events-of-pakistans-security-council-presidency" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> issued by the FO, Dar will attend a high-level conference on the “Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution”, to express Pakistan’s strong commitment and unwavering support for the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>The conference was originally planned for June but was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917074">postponed</a> due to the Iran-Israel war, which also led to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917150">rescheduling</a> of Dar’s visit. According to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/13/macron-not-expected-to-attend-un-summit-on-two-state-solution-for-palestine-and-israel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Guardian</a></em>, the moot will now be held on July 28 and 29.</p>
<p>Since October 8, Israeli strikes have killed more than 58,000 Palestinians in Gaza. Pakistan has consistently raised its voice for the people of Palestine, calling for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921570/dont-be-a-bystander-pakistan-tells-unsc">urged</a> the UNSC not to remain “a bystander” amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>
<p>Aside from the Palestine conference, Dar is also set to chair a high-level briefing of the UNSC, focused on enhancing cooperation between the UN and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).</p>
<p>“The meeting is being held as part of Pakistan’s efforts to strengthen collaboration between the OIC and the UN for maintenance of international peace and security,” the FO statement said.</p>
<p>Dar is expected to have several other bilateral engagements with his counterparts, as well as senior UN officials, during his stay. He will also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925550">meet</a> US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on July 25.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925627/evidence-shows-jeju-air-pilots-shut-off-less-damaged-engine-before-crash-source-says' target='_blank'><strong>Evidence shows Jeju Air pilots shut off less-damaged engine before crash, source says</strong></a>
            <p><p>The South Korea-led investigation into Jeju Air’s fatal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881778">plane crash</a> in December has “clear evidence” that pilots shut off the less-damaged engine after a bird strike, a source with knowledge of the probe said on Monday.</p>
<p>The source said the evidence, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1883042">cockpit voice recorder</a>, computer data and a physical engine switch found in the wreckage showed pilots shut off the left engine instead of the right engine when taking emergency steps after a bird strike just before it was scheduled to land.</p>
<p>“The investigation team has clear evidence and backup data, so its finding will not change,” the source told <em>Reuters</em> on condition of anonymity because investigators have not released an official report including this evidence.</p>
<p>A government source said examinations of the plane’s recovered engines found that no defects had been present before the bird strike and crash.</p>
<p>The December 29 crash of the Boeing 737-800 jet at Muan Airport <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881898">killed</a> all but two of the 181 passengers and crew members on board and was the deadliest air disaster on South Korean soil.</p>
<p>Investigators told victims’ family members at a briefing on Saturday that the right engine had been more severely damaged by a bird strike than the left, and there was circumstantial evidence that pilots had turned off the less-damaged left engine, according to a third source who was at the briefing.</p>
<p>South Korean media outlets including <em>MBN</em> and <em>Yonhap</em> reported that information on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>South Korea’s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB), which is leading the investigation, did not respond immediately to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Boeing referred questions about the crash to ARAIB. Engine maker CFM International, a joint venture between GE GE.N and France’s Safran, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Jeju Air said it was actively cooperating with the ARAIB’s investigation and awaiting the official announcement of the results.</p>
<p>Most air crashes are caused by multiple factors, and under international rules, a final report is expected within a year of an accident.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1887983">preliminary report</a> released in January said duck remains were found in both engines of the Jeju Air plane after the flight from Bangkok crashed at Muan Airport, but did not give details about the extent of remains or damage found in each engine.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#objections-from-victims-families" id="objections-from-victims-families" title="Permalink"></a>Objections from victims’ families</h2>
<p>South Korea’s investigation body on Saturday cancelled a planned release to media of an update on what is known so far about the engines.</p>
<p>Families of the crash victims were briefed on the report ahead of its planned release, but objected to its publication, saying that it appeared to apportion blame to the pilots without exploring other contributing factors, lawyers representing the families said.</p>
<p>The Jeju Air flight overshot Muan Airport’s runway as it made an emergency belly landing and crashed into an embankment containing navigation equipment, leading to a fire and partial explosion.</p>
<p>Representatives of victims’ families and the Jeju Air pilots’ union said over the weekend that the investigation needs to also focus on the embankment, which aviation experts have said likely contributed to the high death toll.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The Jeju Air pilots’ union said the ARAIB was “misleading the public” by suggesting there was no problem with the left engine given traces of bird remains were found in both engines.</p>
<p>The union accused the ARAIB of trying to make pilots “scapegoats” by failing to provide scientific and technological grounds that the plane could have landed safely with only the left engine turned on.</p>
<p>Air accidents are complex incidents that occur due to a number of contributing factors, and investigators have not produced evidence so far to support the implication that the accident was a result of pilot error, the union said.</p>
<p>Investigators are so far “silent about organisational responsibility”, the union said.</p>
<p>A body representing bereaved families said in a statement there were some phrases related to the cause of the accident in the planned press release that could be interpreted as if a final conclusion had been reached, and all facts surrounding the incident must be clarified.</p></p>
