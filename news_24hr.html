            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday questioned the contributions made to the national exchequer by the country’s elite class, ahead of the presentation of the budget for FY26.</p>
<p>Addressing a meeting of the federal cabinet in Islamabad, PM Shehbaz said: “Today, the federal cabinet will discuss the budget and give its approval. In the previous quarter year, the entire nation has faced these challenges. This is in no way an ordinary achievement.</p>
<p>“The sacrifices the common man has made, the burden the salaried class has borne in the previous budget. They say ‘we are salaried [class] but still gave Rs400bn to the treasury […] what have the elite and the wealthy groups contributed compared to us?’,” he added.</p>
<p>“This is a question that the elite, including me, have to answer,” the premier noted.</p>
<p>He further said, “Pakistan is standing at a point where we have to take off,” adding that the country’s stability indicators were satisfactory.</p>
<p>“Be it the inflation rate, be it the policy rate, your exports increased, your remittances have seen a quantum jump, your IT exports have increased, and they have a lot of potential to increase.”</p>
<p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb will unveil the annual federal budget today, expected to provide some relief to the salaried group, during a National Assembly session chaired by Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq.</p>
<p>Aurganzeb, in a press conference yesterday, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916059/pakistan-economic-survey-2024-25-to-be-unveiled-today">launched</a> the <a class="link--external" href="https://finance.gov.pk/survey/chapter_25/Highlights.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-2025</a>, a pre-budget document that contains details of major socio-economic achievements during the outgoing fiscal year.</p>
<p>Media reports say the government is likely to present a Rs17.6 trillion budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, down 6.7 per cent from this fiscal year. It has projected a fiscal deficit of 4.8pc of GDP, against a targeted 5.9pc deficit in 2024-25, the reports say.</p>
<p>The budget for FY26 is expected to prioritise <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916156/after-expanding-the-net-new-budget-will-focus-on-increasing-tax-rates">expanding the tax base</a>, enforcing agriculture income tax laws, and reducing government subsidies to industry, to meet the terms of a $7 billion IMF <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">bailout.</a></p>
<p>The IMF has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915517">urged</a> Pakistan to widen the tax base through reforms, which include taxing agriculture, retail, and real estate.</p>

<p>The session will open with recitation, followed by the finance minister presenting the federal budget, according to an NA <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/NAofPakistan/status/1932314298803437720" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a>.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb is also expected to present other documents, including the Finance Bill 2025, the grant demands for the upcoming year and the Excess Budget Statement for the previous two fiscal years.</p>

<p>Facing limited room for fresh tax measures, the government has resorted to rebranding taxation — shifting from “broadening the tax base” to pursuing “equity” — in an effort to justify higher taxes on lower-income segments. This shift means lower tax rates on a wide range of goods and services will be raised, a move the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) anticipates will generate maximum revenue.</p>
<p>The FBR faces significant <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901203">challenges</a> in meeting its tax collection targets, as doubts persist over its ability to enforce existing tax laws effectively.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some relief is expected for the salaried class in lower tax slabs. Officials indicate that the exemption limit may be further raised, alongside a lower tax rate for individuals earning around Rs100,000 per month.</p>

<p>According to former finance minister <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914504/we-asked-two-ex-finance-ministers-what-the-2025-26-budget-should-look-like-here-are-their-thoughts">Asad Umar</a>: “The fundamental question for the government at this point is: how to increase the revenue and what expenditures to cut”.</p>
<p>“Last year’s budget placed a crushing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1839582">burden</a> on the salaried class. This budget must include a reversal of that unfair taxation,” he added.</p>
<p>In February this year, Aurangzeb <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893822">admitted</a> that there was a massive <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892506">tax burden</a> on the salaried class and indicated that the government may provide some relief to them.</p></p>

<p>ISLAMABAD: Facing limited room for fresh tax measures, the Shehbaz Sharif-led coalition government has resorted to rebranding taxation — shifting from “broadening the tax base” to pursuing “equity” — in an effort to justify higher taxes on lower-income segments. This transition comes as the government eyes a record revenue target of nearly Rs14 trillion for FY26, a 22 per cent increase over projections for the outgoing fiscal year.</p>
<p>Tied to its commitments under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1861236">programme</a>, the government estimates autonomous revenue collection at Rs12.845tr, based on 4.2pc GDP growth and 7.5pc inflation.</p>
<p>To meet the ambitious target, the government will need an additional Rs655 billion in new tax measures and another Rs400bn through enforcement — figures expected to be finalised in Tuesday’s cabinet meeting ahead of Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s budget speech.</p>
<p>The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) faces significant challenges in meeting its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907709">tax collection targets</a>, as doubts persist over its ability to enforce existing tax laws effectively.</p>
<p>Despite concerns about sluggish field operations, no substantial measures have been introduced to bolster enforcement in recent years. An initiative to provide operational vehicles to field officers was also withdrawn following backlash.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ministry of Finance officials continue to present optimistic projections, seemingly hoping for a tax windfall without acknowledging economic headwinds. Large-scale ind­us­tries remain in decline, while sectors like real estate and consumption goods bear the brunt of excessive taxation, further dampening economic activity.</p>
<p>With key industries contracting and consumer confidence fading, the feasibility of achieving ambitious revenue targets remains highly questionable in the next fiscal year.</p>
<p>The government’s proposed tax-to-GDP ratio target for FY26 is 12.3pc, comprising FBR’s share (10.6pc of GDP), provincial collections and the petroleum development levy (PDL).</p>
<p>Moreover, revenue collection could face further setbacks due to a lower-than-expected <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914987/govt-to-prioritise-high-value-projects-as-development-budget-stands-at-rs880bn-only-ahsan-iqbal">allocation</a> for the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), which includes fewer new projects. The federal PSDP also remains notably smaller than those of Punjab and Sindh.</p>
<p>Compounding the issue, the federal government is now seeking financial contributions from Punjab and Sindh to fund dam construction, an unusual move that underscores fiscal limitations at the Centre. These factors create added pressure, as the federal government struggles to balance tax collection efforts with a constrained development budget.</p>
<p><strong>From broadening to equity</strong></p>
<p>Officials involved in tax policy formulation indicate that the government is now moving from tax broadening measures to a new approach centred on equity. This shift means lower tax rates on a wide range of goods and services will be raised, a move the FBR anticipates will generate maximum revenue.</p>
<p>Under the earlier broadening strategy, exemptions were systematically withdrawn, even on essential products like food, stationery items and books, to expand the tax base.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Now, in the second phase, the FBR is introducing “equity” as a justification for increasing lower tax rates across various sectors. This approach will result in a series of hikes in withholding tax rates, targeting dividends, stock markets and other financial transactions.</p>
<p>It is also proposed to levy taxes at the Thresher Unit Level, which would require the use of larger machines to improve the quality of tobacco processing — an effort aimed at increasing revenue collection from the tobacco sector.</p>
<p>At the same time, the FBR intends to implement a new concept of transactions using banking instruments, applying lower tax rates to digital transactions and higher rates to cash-based ones.</p>
<p>This concept will replace the current distinction between filers and non-filers.</p>
<p>However, the real test lies ahead — whether these increased tax rates will bolster revenue collection or further stifle economic activity, particularly as key industries and investment sectors struggle under mounting financial pressures. As part of its proposed new tax measures, the FBR is preparing to introduce a new tax on solar panels, processed food items and a carbon tax, signalling an effort to expand revenue streams amid fiscal constraints.</p>
<p>The tax measures are likely to spark concerns among consumers and businesses, particularly in the renewable energy sector. A tax on solar panels could dampen incentives for clean energy adoption at a time when Pakistan faces mounting electricity costs and energy shortages. Similarly, additional taxation on processed foods may lead to higher consumer prices, affecting household budgets.</p>
<p>However, in a move to provide temporary relief to the agricultural sector, the government has secured an exemption from the IMF on fertilisers and pesticides.</p>
<p>This exemption, extended for another year, will alleviate cost pressures on farmers struggling with rising input prices and uncertain market conditions.</p>
<p>While the government tightens fiscal measures in other sectors, some relief is expected for the salaried class in lower tax slabs. Officials indicate that the exemption limit may be further raised, alongside a lower tax rate for individuals earning around Rs100,000 per month.</p>
<p><strong>Fiscal challenges</strong></p>
<p>While this move aims to stimulate domestic manufacturing and enhance production capacity, it comes at a cost to government revenue. The reduction in import duties will significantly lower tax collection at the import stage, creating further fiscal challenges for an already strained revenue system.</p>
<p>The government is also considering extending the tax measures to former Fata and Pata members, who are exempt until June 30, 2025. This will be another area where the government plans to include tax measures in the budget. However, the Sindh government has asked the federal government to avoid all taxes, including the agriculture income tax on farm products.</p>
<p>Former FBR chairman Dr Irshad Ahmed criticised the government’s persistent reliance on policy measures, arguing that new tax measures alone would not resolve systemic revenue challenges. According to him, such additional revenue merely increases the burden on existing taxpayers while failing to expand the tax base effectively.</p>
<p>Dr Ahmed stressed that the core issue lies in enforcement, which requires a complete overhaul of the FBR’s field formations. He pointed out that officers remain confined to their offices with little access to potential taxpayers, rendering tax collection efforts ineffective.</p>
<p>He also recalled a previous attempt to establish strong tax offices at the district level, an initiative that was ultimately blocked by bureaucratic resistance.</p>
<p>Despite possessing ext­en­sive taxpayer data, FBR lacks the capacity to analyse it effectively and identify tax evaders. Add­ressing these gaps requires significant investment in capacity-building, infrastructure and operational enhancements — elements currently missing from the government’s strategy.</p>
<p>Without a robust enforcement framework, new revenue measures will provide only a temporary financial boost, while those outside the tax net continue to evade their dues.</p>

            <p><p>The provincial government on Tuesday said it has decided to implement strict rules to improve traffic flow and prohibit parking on Karachi’s I.I. Chundrigarh Road — often known as the city’s ‘Wall Street’ — to tighten traffic regulation enforcement and improve road safety.</p>
<p>Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah issued the instructions after receiving a briefing on traffic management in the metropolis, a statement issued by his spokesperson, Abdur Rasheed Channa, said.</p>
<p>According to the statement, parking will be prohibited on I.I. Chundrigar Road, beginning from Shaheen Complex to the Merewether Tower. CM Shah also directed the authorities concerned to ban parking for all types of vehicles from Muhammad Bin Qasim Road to Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road up to the S.M. Law College.</p>
<p>I.I. Chundrigar Road, a major road in the city’s central business district, is often referred to as Karachi’s “Wall Street”. The road is a significant financial hub, serving as the location for the Pakistan Stock Exchange, major banks, and other financial institutions.</p>
<p>The chief minister was informed by traffic police authorities that parking on pavements and main roads will be banned alike, but motorists will be allowed to park their vehicles on Railway Ground.</p>
<p>Murad said that action should be taken against traffic rules violations and illegal parking, and vehicles with fancy or illegal number plates should be confiscated.</p>
<p>CM Sindh was informed that a crackdown is underway against vehicles with unregistered or non-standard number plates, and only official number plates will be acceptable. Deputy Inspector General of Police (Traffic) Pir Muhammad Shah assured the chief minister that police were taking action to ensure the implementation of traffic rules.</p>
<p>The Sindh government had recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915821">approved</a> a set of changes, including a ban on four-seater rickshaws, mandatory third-party vehicle fitness checks, and sharp increases in traffic violation fines.</p>
<p>The government made it mandatory to acquire fitness certification for both commercial and non-commercial vehicles, and outsourcing vehicle fitness evaluations to third parties. It also decided to ban the sale of tinted windows, fancy lights, and sirens, whether online or at physical shops.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915847">Fine</a> were also imposed. For wrong-way driving, the approved fines were set at Rs200,000 for government vehicles, Rs100,000 for other four-wheelers and Rs25,000 for motorcycles.</p>
<p>Driving a vehicle without a valid licence will cost a fine of Rs25,000 for motorcyclists and Rs50,000 for car drivers. One-wheeling or drifting will result in a Rs100,000 fine for a first-time offence, going up to Rs200,000 and Rs300,000 for repeated violations, the government said.</p>
<p>These decisions were taken in the backdrop of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895007">surge</a> in traffic accidents, particularly involving <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903332">dumpers</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908095">water tankers</a> that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024.</p></p>

            <p><p>Florence in Italy could hit 39C as hot weather sweeps continent, while parts of South Africa brace for snow</p><p>The severe thunderstorms that have been lashing parts of Europe over recent days are expected to give way to high temperatures this week. Several regions could climb to 10C (50F) above seasonal norms, with Italy braced for the full force of the heat. Florence in Tuscany is forecast to soar to a sweltering 39C on Thursday and across the weekend.</p><p>Germany, France and Belgium will also face hot weather from Wednesday, with widespread highs at least 9C above the June average. Many other parts of Europe are forecast to experience temperatures 5-7C above normal. This is the result of a high-pressure system creating a heat dome over the region, whereby sinking air compresses and warms as it descends, trapping heat near the surface.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/09/weather-tracker-storms-summer-heat-europe-south-africa">Continue reading...</a></p>
