            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923918/pti-shows-willingness-to-talk-but-demands-accountability-from-institutions' target='_blank'><strong>PTI shows willingness to talk but demands ‘accountability’ from institutions</strong></a>
            <p><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Saturday called on state institutions to engage in dialogue with the PTI, but demanded that they hold themselves accountable.</p>
<p>Gandapur and the PTI’s top leadership are on a visit to Lahore to formally launch a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923856/pti-brass-gathers-in-lahore-to-kick-start-aug-5-movement">movement</a> to seek the release of party founder Imran Khan and devise a strategy for its nationwide protest, which will reach its crescendo on August 5 — marking two years since the ex-premier was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a>.</p>
<p>Since Imran’s incarceration in several cases, which he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1890696#:~:text=He%20claimed%20that%20four%20convictions%20against%20him%20were%20politically%20motivated">claims</a> are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1843176">politically motivated</a>, his party’s relationship with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880551">government</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832432">establishment</a> has turned exceedingly sour. The PTI has held several protests over the last year, most of which escalated into <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1857709">violence</a> after facing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875003/day-of-clashes-in-islamabad-ends-in-pti-protesters-retreat">state repression</a>.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference flanked by PTI’s Punjab leadership, CM Gandapur said: “We have to correct our institutions ourselves. Come, sit together, own your mistakes and move forward.”</p>
<p>He recalled that Imran, despite his wife also being imprisoned in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831">graft case</a>, had repeatedly said he was ready to talk for the sake of the country.</p>

<p>Imran was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">jailed</a> on Aug 5, 2023 in a case related to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878307/imran-khan-bushra-bibi-indicted-in-new-toshakhana-case">state gifts</a>, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831">£190 million graft case</a> and faces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845818">pending trials</a> related to the May 9, 2023 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">riots</a>.</p>
<p>In the wake of the nationwide May 9 protests, which saw important <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">military installations</a> come under attack, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753589">thousands</a> of PTI workers and almost the entire <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1774736">top-tier leadership</a> were rounded up, with many still facing court proceedings under serious <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891122/five-pti-leaders-16-activists-indicted-in-another-may-9-case">charges</a>.</p>
<p>The military considers the PTI the “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832432">planners and architects</a>” of the May 9 riots and has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832048">demanded</a> an apology from Imran, who in turn <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850002/imran-puts-onus-of-apology-on-army-for-his-detention">claimed</a> that the army owes an apology to him since he was “abducted” by the Rangers on May 9. However, days later, he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850840">offered to apologise</a> on the condition that the involvement of PTI supporters in the violent protests was proved through CCTV evidence.</p>
<p>At today’s press conference, Gandapur was accompanied by PTI Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja, Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar, KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati and MNA Latif Khosa.</p>
<p>“Come and talk, acknowledge and correct your mistakes,” Gandapur reiterated today, noting that it was everyone’s collective responsibility to think about Pakistan’s future.</p>
<p>“The state institutions, whose duty is not to engage in politics, are playing every role in forming, running and overthrowing governments,” the PTI leader alleged. “And when you ask, they reply with delight that ‘we are non-political’.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Gandapur, stressing that he was a soldier’s son and brother, said: “My military is being defamed due to a few wrong people and their decisions.”</p>
<p>“The state institutions have ignored their duties which are stated in the Constitution and are instead doing other work, due to which terrorism has [risen] in the country,” he said, adding that the security situation in KP and Balochistan had worsened because “those responsible for guarding the borders were chasing the PTI instead”.</p>
<p>The KP CM quipped: “Where are those who imposed martial laws? They are not in Pakistan today. Who is suffering? My Pakistanis.”</p>
<p>The chief minister called for a dialogue “based on reasons”, saying he was ready to be punished severely if it was proven that he “conspired”. “Whoever’s mistake there is, they will admit it […] we are ready if they punish us, but if the matter comes to punishment, then every person [responsible] will be punished.”</p>
<p>Asked if the PTI would hold a dialogue with the military establishment or politicians, Gandapur said that decision was up to Imran, noting he has previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891813">stated</a> that talks must be held with “decision-makers” but there was no objection to government officials being included in the process.</p>
<p>The PTI leader urged “those who are the beneficiaries of this system and those who have hijacked it” to hold talks, stressing that they are “answerable” and “must bear the burden” for the country’s economic situation and heightened terrorism.</p>
<p>Gandapur also assailed the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866652/president-zardari-gives-assent-to-26th-constitutional-amendment">26th Amendment</a> passed in October last year, saying the judiciary had been “handcuffed” through it.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Gandapur called on the political parties in the ruling coalition to go into the public, which he said had “rejected” them.</p>
<p>He cautioned that those parties will then face the consequences later on of the “culture” they had developed. Addressing their supporters, he said, “They (leaders of other political parties) will flee abroad. You have to stay here.”</p>
<p>He asked if it was “right as a human and a Muslim” if a PTI leader’s home was raided and their privacy was violated. “If you are silent on this, then if this happens to you tomorrow, then no one will raise a voice for you either.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#90-days-to-decide-whether-to-continue-politics" id="90-days-to-decide-whether-to-continue-politics" title="Permalink"></a>‘90 days to decide whether to continue politics’</h2>
<p>Speaking about the PTI’s new movement, Gandapur referred to a “90-day announcement” made yesterday by his party, saying that they had begun from today.</p>
<p>He said the PTI has given itself 90 days to decide on its future. He detailed: “On August 5, we will take the movement to its peak through political means while following the laws and the Constitution.</p>
<p>“[…] We have set our targets that we have to decide within 90 days whether we should even do politics in this country […] if politics do not lead to a result, then we will let you know about our plan of action that will come forward.”</p>
<p>“<em>Hum aar ya paar karein gain</em> (We will either do or die),” the KP CM said, adding there was no use of politics in the country as “there is no politics”. He called the public to let the system continue as is if they wanted to remain “slaves” or join the PTI’s movement if they wanted “freedom”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to a query, Gandapur said that Imran was “leading the movement himself”.</p>
<p>Thanking PTI workers, leaders, its lawmakers and overseas supporters, Gandapur vowed to organise a grassroots movement upwards from the streets, towns, and cities.</p>
<p>A caravan of KP lawmakers led by CM Gandapur, as well as MPA Bhachar, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923856/pti-brass-gathers-in-lahore-to-kick-start-aug-5-movement">reached Lahore</a> via G.T. Road yesterday evening. During a layover in Jhelum, the KP CM said that the protest had been launched, and the parliamentary meeting in Lahore would mull the final protest strategy to step up the campaign seeking Imran’s release.</p>
<p>The PTI in the northern Punjab region has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923404">decided</a> to rely on its grassroots workers to galvanise its support — a move which contrasts with its earlier practice of depending on heavyweights to drum up support for its protests.</p></p>

            <p><p>Police have formed a special investigation team to probe the death of actor Humaira Asghar Ali, whose body was found in a Karachi apartment earlier this week, it emerged on Sunday.</p>
<p>Humaira was laid to rest in the Model Town Q Block graveyard in Lahore on Friday following a sparsely-attended funeral, days after her body was <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193833/actor-and-model-humaira-asghar-ali-found-dead-in-karachis-dha">discovered</a> at her apartment in Karachi.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923487#:~:text=An-,autopsy%20report,-by%20police%20surgeon">autopsy report</a> by police surgeon Summaiya Syed, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, confirmed that the body was in an “advanced stage of decomposition” and at least eight months old.</p>
<p>According to the notification, available with <em>Dawn.com</em> issued by South Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Mahzoor Ali, “A special team comprising of the following officers/officials is hereby constituted under the supervision of Deputy Superintendent of Police Imran Ali Jagrani (Clifton Division Acting Superintendent of Police) in connection with recovered dead body of Humaira Asghar Ali in the jurisdiction of Gizri Police Station.”</p>
<p>The team will be headed by Defence Sub-Divisional Police Officer Aurangzaib Khattak with South Assistant Superintendent of Police Nida Junaid, Gizri Station House Officer (SHO) Muhammad Farooq, Sub-Inspector Muhammad Amjad and IT Branch Police Constable Muhammad Adeel as its members.</p>
<p>The notification directed the team to inquire into the facts and thoroughly investigate the death of Humaira to ascertain the cause of death, whether natural, accidental, suicidal or murder, by utilising all available resources and submit a progress report to the SSP’s office on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The autopsy report was released to the police, but the coroner could not determine the actor’s cause of death due to the level of decomposition.</p>
<p>Police had earlier said that when approached, her family in Lahore — particularly her father — refused to take the body for burial, triggering shock across the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>On Thursday, however, her brother Naveed Asghar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923487">arrived</a> in Karachi to take the body to Lahore for burial, calling out media outlets for portraying his family in bad light. Police had stated that the actor’s body would be handed over to her brother after DNA matching.</p>
<p>Speaking to journalists, Naveed said, “The body was in police custody. The police had kept the body for investigation before calling us (the family) to claim it.”</p>
<p>He said that for the last three days, the family was in contact with Chhipa and the police.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>“According to the guidelines, we were [eventually] going to receive the body and perform the rites,” he said.</p>
<p>Besides being a theatre, film and TV artist, Humera was also a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923582/humaira-asghar-laid-to-rest-in-model-town#:~:text=Besides%20being%20a%20theatre%2C%20film%20and%20TV%20artist">visual artist</a> who studied at Punjab University’s Fine Arts Department and completed a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts in painting. During her university days, she had interaction with theatre groups such as Natak, led by Dr Ahmed Bilal, which was a university-based theatre group consisting of students.</p>
<p>She had interactions with Amjad Islam Amjad, Qavi Khan and other senior actors who used to visit the university for lectures. In her early years of performing art, she did about four or five Pakistan television plays. She also extensively did socially relevant and objective theatre those days.</p></p>

            <p><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority ((PDMA) on Sunday issued a warning for people downstream to stay away from the banks of the Indus River ahead of the Tarbela Dam’s spillways being opened.</p>
<p>A PDMA alert issued today said the spillways would be opened at 2:30pm on Sunday, with the water level likely to reach 160,000 to 260,000 cusecs due to the release of water from the dam.</p>
<p>It cautioned that flooding is likely in the Indus River and its tributaries and canals.</p>
<p>“The PDMA directs the district administration to keep the local population alert,” the notification said, urging the public to avoid going near rivers and canals.</p>
<p>It also cautioned parents that children should not go near canals.</p>
<p>“Fishermen and livestock keepers should move to safer places,” the advisory said. Tourists and locals were urged to heed the advisory.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>“In case of any untoward situation, the public should call 1700,” the PDMA said.</p>
<p>A similar warning was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921686/people-downstream-tarbela-dam-warned-of-water-release">issued</a> earlier this month, with sources telling <em>Dawn</em> that the spillways of the Tarbela Dam were likely to be put into operation for the first time in the flood season 2025.</p>
<p>On Friday, the National Emer­gencies Operation Centre (NEOC) of the National Disa­ster Management Authority (NDMA) issued a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923519">weather alert</a> warning that moderate to heavy monsoon rains are expected to affect multiple regions of the country for a three-day period commencing from July 13 (Sunday).</p>
<p>The forecast indicates moderate to heavy monsoon rainfall across various regions of Pakistan, as a result of which substantial rises in river flows were expected — most notably in the Indus, Kabul, Jhelum (upstream of Mangla), and Chenab rivers.</p>
<p>The advisory stated that Tarbela, Taunsa, and Guddu barrages were currently at low flood levels, while Kalabagh and Chashma were at medium flood levels.</p></p>
