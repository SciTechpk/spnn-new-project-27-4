            <p><p>Incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s son Kasim Khan has highlighted that his father was jailed in “really poor conditions” that were “getting worse by the moment”.</p>
<p>Imran’s sons — Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim, 26 — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910789">called attention</a> to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Earlier this month, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">said</a> Sulaiman and Kasim will go to the United States before coming to Pakistan as part of a movement calling for the ex-premier’s release. The siblings visited the US and engaged US lawmakers on the issue of their father’s incarceration.</p>
<p>Imran, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a> since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.</p>
<p>In an interview on US media outlet <em>Real America’s Voice</em> shared today, Kasim said, “Right now he’s in really, really poor conditions and it looks like they’re getting worse and worse by the moment. So we’re looking for any way out possible.”</p>
<p>While emphasising that Imran was “incarcerated in a solitary confinement cell”, he said, “The state of the cell he’s in is awful, quite frankly.”</p>
<p>He continued, “He’s showering in muddy water.  I don’t mean unfiltered water. It’s muddy, dirty water,” alleging that 10 people who were incarcerated had died from filthy conditions.</p>
<p>Kasim expressed worry over not being able to see his father and said, “There were moments … he went 10 days without any light in his cell,” calling it a “torture tactic”.</p>
<p>“He gets only two hours a day in daylight. We’re not able to speak to him at all,” he added.</p>

<p>Kasim said that he and his brother were “looking to America at the moment” for support, stating, “A lot of the people here have expressed concern. It seems like it might be the only route out at the moment.”</p>
<p>Speaking about meeting US President Donald Trump’s key aide Richard Grenell, he said, “Grennell was very kind to spend some time with us.”</p>
<p>He continued, “We spoke at length and I don’t want to get into details but I’m very, very hopeful from that.”</p>
<p>He said that Imran from a prison cell won the Feb 2024 elections, which went through “vicious rigging”.</p>
<p>“[Despite] the amount of underhand tactics they used before the election to rig it against his favour, [he] still he managed to win.”</p>
<p>Separately, Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan said today that the sons would “definitely” come to Pakistan as they had a National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (Nicop) and they were “citizens of Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“If anything were to happen to Imran’s sons, it would become an international matter,” she told reporters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif remarked, “Why would the government stop Imran’s sons from coming to Pakistan?”</p>
<p>He told reporters in Islamabad that the government did not want PTI to “resort to any violence”. “The PTI will not be allowed to pull off another May 9 or Nov 26.”</p>
<p>A day earlier, PTI swiftly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927421">rubbished</a> media reports claiming that the incarcerated leader told reporters at Adiala Jail that his sons would not be coming to Pakistan and taking part in or leading any protest.</p>
<p>PTI Central Information Secretary Waqas Akram had stated: “The news circulating in the media regarding Imran Khan Sahib’s children is completely false. Imran Khan sahib has absolutely not stopped his children from coming to Pakistan.</p>
<p>“I would request those media friends who report from Adiala to only broadcast exactly what Khan sahib says. It is inappropriate to take things out of context, selectively, or to present conversations according to their own wishes.”</p></p>

            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Wednesday assailed and rejected the Indian parliament’s debate on “Operation Sindoor”, claiming that the remarks made in the Lok Sabha “distort facts, justify aggression, and glorify conflict for domestic consumption”.</p>
<p>The two countries entered a brief but intense <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military escalation</a> after India, without evidence, blamed Pakistan for the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On May 6–7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long missile exchange. A US-brokered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> ended the war.</p>
<p>During Tuesday’s debate, Indian Home Minister Amit Shah <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927416">claimed</a> that security forces killed three “Pakistanis” involved in the Pahalgam attack in Operation Mahadev, <em>Reuters</em> reported. “I want to tell … the entire nation that these were the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927163#:~:text=Indian%20army%20says%20three%20suspected%20fighters%20killed%20in%20held-Kashmir">three terrorists</a> who killed our citizens … and now all three have been killed,” Shah told parliament during the discussion.</p>
<p>In a statement issued today on the Indian parliament debate, FO spokesperson Ambassador Shafqat Ali Khan said: “Pakistan categorically rejects the baseless assertions and provocative claims made by the Indian leaders during the Lok Sabha debate on the so-called ‘Operation Sindoor’. These statements reflect a dangerous tendency to distort facts, justify aggression and glorify conflict for domestic consumption.</p>
<p>“The world knows that India attacked Pakistan without any verifiable evidence or a credible investigation into the Pahalgam Attack. During the intervening night of May 6 and 7, 2025, India’s targeting of the alleged terrorist infrastructure resulted actually in the martyrdom of innocent men, women, and children. India failed to achieve any of its strategic objectives. On the other hand, Pakistan’s resounding success in neutralising the Indian fighter jets and military targets is an indisputable fact.”</p>
<p>He said that “instead of misleading their compatriots, the Indian leaders would be well-advised to acknowledge the losses incurred by their armed forces and accept the active role played by the third parties in realising the ceasefire”.</p>
<p>The FO spokesperson said that India had not used the immediate offer made by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for a transparent and independent probe into the Pahalgam Attack but had instead chosen the “path of belligerence and aggression”.</p>
<p>He further added that India had “acted as a judge, jury and executioner at the same time” and thus in the backdrop of all this, “any claims regarding the so-called ‘Operation Mahadev’ do not hold any significance for us”.</p>
<p>“The account given by the Indian home minister is replete with fabrications, leading to serious questions about its credibility. Is it a mere coincidence that the alleged perpetrators of the Pahalgam Attack were killed at the start of the Lok Sabha debate?”</p>

<p>The FO statement also criticised the Indian government for its statements about establishing a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911476">new normal</a>” in bilateral relations through the strikes and rubbished New Delhi’s narrative of “nuclear blackmail” on the part of Pakistan, calling such claims “a misleading and self-serving construct” that were “an attempt to veil its own escalatory impulses while shifting blame onto Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“For us, the only ‘normal’ in bilateral relations is respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and adherence to the principles and purposes of the UN Charter,” the statement read.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The FO said it was “well known that Pakistan deterred India through its conventional capabilities, affirming that discipline and restraint remain its guiding principles”.</p>
<p>The FO spokesperson also once again expressed disapproval of the “misplaced assertions” by the Indian leadership regarding the Indus Waters Treaty. “India’s decision to hold the treaty in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">abeyance</a> shows its blatant disregard for the sanctity of international treaties, and strikes at a fundamental pillar of regional cooperation,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>He added that India should adhere to the terms of the agreement rather than “taking pride in a unilateral and illegal move”.</p>
<p>“India’s continued reliance on disinformation, jingoism, and chest-thumping risks destabilising South Asia,” the FO stated, reiterating that Pakistan was a “responsible” nation and reaffirming its commitment to “peace, regional stability and a meaningful dialogue for resolution of all outstanding issues”.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927600/jirgas-to-be-held-from-aug-2-to-address-woes-of-kp-residents-cm-gandapur' target='_blank'><strong>Jirgas to be held from Aug 2 to address woes of KP residents: CM Gandapur</strong></a>
            <p><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur announced on Wednesday that a series of jirgas will be convened from August 2 to decide on future steps on a wide array of concerns among the province’s residents.</p>
<p>The provincial government has opposed the newly launched <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927454/curfew-imposed-as-forces-launch-operation-sarbakaf-in-bajaur">military operation</a> in Bajaur unless it is taken into confidence by the Centre and has vowed to lift a three-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927438/curfew-imposed-as-3-day-operation-against-militants-begins-in-bajaur-official">curfew</a> imposed in the district’s 16 areas yesterday.</p>
<p>Security forces backed by gunship helicopters and artillery launched ‘Operation Sarbakaf’ against terrorists in the Lowi Mamund tehsil on Tuesday. Tribal elders in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1842401">Bajaur</a> and some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925049">other</a> KP districts have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1119721">long opposed</a> any military operation, citing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892832">concerns</a> over displacement.</p>
<p>Although not confirmed officially by security forces, sources said that at least four terrorists were killed, around 12 were wounded, and about 10 were captured alive in different areas of the Lowi Mamund tehsil. Locals also claimed that a child was among two civilians who died, and eight others, including two minors and a woman, were wounded in clashes between security forces and terrorists.</p>
<p>In a video statement issued today, Gandapur emphasised the importance of unity between the government, state institutions and the general public.</p>
<p>“The public and all institutions have to work together to establish peace,” Gandapur said. “We have to achieve peace because our future depends on it.”</p>
<p>According to the chief minister, there was a “conspiracy” in effect to build discord between the government, the public and institutions. He added that those building distrust need to be “exposed” to thwart this conspiracy.</p>
<p>“Unless the people stand with their government and institutions, we will not win this war. Everyone needs to stand with us amid this war,” he stated, adding that the state will target both terrorists and their facilitators.</p>
<p>“Facilitators … of terrorism need to be targeted because it defies our faith, our laws and our traditions,” he warned.</p>
<p>“These terrorists take shelter in populated areas so that when they carry out attacks, a retaliatory strike by our armed forces will cause collateral damage,” Gandapur continued.</p>
<p>“They are doing this to create distrust between the people and the armed forces. This is why we need to expel them from our cities. We will not tolerate their presence in populated areas.”</p>
<p>Gandapur added that government officials, police and military personnel are “guests” of the people of KP, adding that according to tradition, “violence against guests is intolerable and we will give a befitting response”.</p>
<p>Paying tribute to those who sacrificed their lives in the fight against terrorism, the chief minister said that the jirgas will start at the divisional level on August 2, with stakeholders and political figures from multiple areas across KP.</p>
<p>“We will all sit together and have consultations on how to alleviate people’s reservations and concerns,” he said.</p>
<p>“Following these jirgas, there will be a grand jirga, where we will present our policy, a plan and future steps and discuss it with stakeholders and government officials.</p>
<p>“Nobody wants any operation because of the damage it causes. When we receive reports of their [terrorists’] presence, we will launch an investigation. The investigations will remain ongoing until we eradicate the threat of terrorism,” he added. “This will ensure that there is no collateral damage.”</p>

<p>Chairing a PTI parliamentary party meeting in Peshawar late last night, Gandapur said: “We are not in favour of any military operation without the provincial government being taken into confidence.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He lamented that the “relationship of confidence between our army and our public” was eroding due to the “martyred civilians and collateral damage in Bajaur”, adding that the lack of trust was failing the country’s fight against terrorism.</p>
<p>The meeting vowed that the recent curfew in parts of Bajaur would be revoked today. However, an official announcement for that is yet to be made.</p>
<p>It was decided that further course of action regarding an operation would be announced after the matter was debated in the KP Assembly.</p>
<p>“We are standing with our public. We will go to every extent for our public,” CM Gandapur vowed. “We cannot ruin our soil for those decisions that are imposed on us without our consultation.”</p>
<p>The meeting made several decisions regarding the ongoing security situation and its future actions to address the concerns raised by the people.</p>
<p>CM Gandapur ordered all deputy commissioners not to impose any curfew without permission from the KP home department, regardless of “any kind of situation”. He also decided to transfer the powers of imposing Section 144, under which a curfew is put in place, to the department.</p>

<p>The PTI meeting further decided to revoke the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1505809">KP Actions (in aid of civil power) Ordinance 2019</a>, with legislation for that expected to be introduced in Friday’s KP Assembly session.</p>
<p>The ordinance provided legal cover to several detention centres set up during military operations — similar to two <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/643667/new-regulations-give-legal-cover-to-detentions-in-tribal-areas">2011 regulations</a> imposed in the tribal areas.</p>
<p>The gathering also approved the decisions taken at a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926456/gandapur-rails-against-good-taliban-bad-taliban-distinction">multi-party conference</a> (MPC) held last week, wherein Gandapur opposed a renewed military offensive to eradicate militancy in the region and vowed to take action against all armed outfits.</p>
<p>Further, the KP CM said he would meet with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir to discuss the province’s law and order situation.</p>
<p>Speaking on a series of jirgas <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927149/kp-govt-says-cm-in-contact-with-administration-over-tirah-shooting#:~:text=would%20be%20organised%2015%20days%20after%20that%20to%20devise%20a%20strategy%20to%20implement%20the%20MPC%E2%80%99s%20declaration">planned</a> in the upcoming week, the chief minister said: “In the next 10 days, we will hold multiple jirgas, each of two districts, after which a grand jirga of all stakeholders in terrorism-ridden areas will be convened.</p>
<p>“In view of the decisions made in the jirgas, policies will be re-evaluated,” he said, adding that the government will convey the reassessment to “those responsible for protecting the borders”.</p>
<p>The KP CM claimed that soldiers who sacrificed their lives were “not rewarded properly due to wrong policies”. “We have repeatedly said to review these policies.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, PTI MPA Anwar Zeb Khan said protesters were gathering at Bajaur’s Umary Chowk to demonstrate against the “unannounced operation”.</p>
<p>Pictures shared by him of the purported protest showed hundreds of men gathered on a street.</p>

<p>The gathering follows yesterday’s protest by residents of War Mamund tehsil against the operation, where they demanded that authorities ensure the safety of civilians during the operation.</p>
<p>Besides Zeb, MPAs Dr Hamidur Rehman and Mohammad Nisar Khan; former MNA Gul Zafar Khan; and MNA Mubarakzeb Khan, the prime minister’s special assistant on tribal districts, have condemned the operation and the curfew in the area.</p>
<p>Former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan also expressed concerns over the operation’s launch and urged authorities to stop it immediately.</p>

<p>The Awami National Party also condemned the military action, with party chief Senator Aimal Wali Khan and provincial president Mian Iftikhar Hussain questioning its legality.

<p>Compensation of Rs2.5m was also announced for those injured during the “incident”.</p>
<p>The KP chief secretary and Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed were among various officials present during the meeting.</p>

<p>The reported incident comes just days after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927004">seven protesters</a> were shot dead and 16 others were injured in Khyber district’s Tirah Valley.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had condemned the “firing on peaceful citizens by <em>khawarij</em>” — a term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). However, according to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927004#:~:text=Security%20personnel%20guar%C2%ADding%20the%20installation%20reportedly%20opened%20fire%20to%20control%20the%20crowd%2C%20according%20to%20sources.">sources</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926949#:~:text=some%20of%20the%20protesters%20alleged%20that%20the%20forces%20at%20the%20gates%20fired%20at%20them">protesters</a>, security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly had opened fire to control the crowd.</p>
<p>Following the incident, security officials <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927004#:~:text=Security%20officials%20meet%20tribal%20elders">met with</a> a delegation of Tirah elders and announced compensation for the victims on their demand. The KP government also announced separate Rs10m for each deceased and Rs2.5m for the injured.</p></p>
