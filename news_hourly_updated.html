                <h2>Foreign Office slams Ajit Doval over ‚Äòsuccessful hits‚Äô claims</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Friday rejected claims by Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval that India had successfully hit all nine identified targets on May 7, calling the remarks ‚Äúreplete with distortions and misrepresentations‚Äù.</p>
<p>Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan, addressing a weekly press briefing, said Doval‚Äôs statements reflected ‚Äúa deliberate attempt to mislead the public‚Äù and violated ‚Äúthe norms of responsible statecraft‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBoasting of military aggression against a sovereign nation is a grave breach of the United Nations Charter and established principles of international law,‚Äù Mr Khan said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRather than resorting to fictitious narratives, India should accept the downing of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">six fighter jets</a> and severe damages to other military targets.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Mr Khan also said it was public knowledge that the so-called terrorist targets attacked by India resulted in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">deaths of civilians</a>.</p>
<p>To a question, Mr Khan said: ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907327">Indian involvement</a> in sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan is very clear, and the international community is now becoming more aware of it.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added: ‚ÄúInitially, the Indian state-sponsored terrorism was targeting Pakistan, but we have seen that in the recent past, it has gone global. If this Indian malign approach is not checked, we have seen the consequences of that.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mr Khan accused India of orchestrating a global <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1882451">assassination campaign</a>, targeting individuals in Canada, the United States, and other countries.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to questions about declassified US documents that revealed the US spent billions of dollars in Afghanistan to defeat the Soviet Union, with facilitation by Pakistan, Mr Khan said: ‚ÄúWhat is in the past is in the past and we look at the past to guide us to a better future, rather than to become its prisoners.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mr Khan declined to comment on US President Donald Trump‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/07/08/politics/video/trump-fundraiser-threats-moscow-beijing-src-digvid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported threat</a> to bomb Beijing if China invaded Taiwan, saying he would not speculate.</p>
<p>However, he reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs close ties with China, describing the country as a ‚Äúclose friend‚Äù and ‚Äúiron brother,‚Äù and emphasised strategic cooperation and relations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe historically have very strong relations with the US and we are keen to continue these relations,‚Äù Mr Khan said. He also expressed hope that a trade agreement with the US would be signed soon.</p>

                <h2>Govt looks to invite several satellite-based internet firms</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The launch of satellite-based internet services in the country has been delayed as authorities look to invite more players into the field and formulate stricter regulations for foreign satellite operators, following the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">India-Pakistan</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/israel-iran-conflict">Iran-Israel conflicts</a>.</p>
<p>Following the expiration of the temporary no-objection certificate (NOC) for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899475/musks-starlink-gets-licence-to-operate-in-pakistan">Starlink</a> in March, all foreign satellite operators are now required to submit new applications under the newly drafted Satellite Communications Regula¬≠tions.</p>
<p>These regulations are being finalised by the Pak¬≠is¬≠tan Space Activities Reg¬≠ulatory Board (PSARB), based on industry feedback gathered during a recent roundtable discussion.</p>
<p>In addition to Starlink, two other Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operators, OneWeb and Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology (SSST), have expressed interest in starting operations in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Once registered under the new regulations, satellite internet providers will need to obtain operational licences from the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>A PTA official said that all companies, including Starlink, can launch their services by the end of this year. Meanwhile, sources told <em>Dawn</em> that Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, is also likely to attend the launch ceremony.</p>
<p>Starlink was the first company to submit a formal application for registration, but delays in licensing have occurred due to the absence of regulations. The company has already been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923085/musks-starlink-receives-indias-final-regulatory-nod-for-launch">granted approval</a> to provide satellite internet services in India.</p>
<p>A senior official from the Ministry of IT and Telecom emphasised the need for stringent regulations to ensure security, particularly in light of recent conflicts.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe new regulations will include important security clauses that may have been overlooked if the recent wars had not occurred,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúBesides, Pakistan needs more than one satellite internet provider, and two more companies have expressed interest.‚Äù</p>
<p>The LEO satellite network operates at an altitude of less than 2,000km from the Earth‚Äôs surface, offering high-speed data connectivity in all weather conditions at a relatively low cost, with a latency delay of only 25 milliseconds.</p>
<p>Pakistan‚Äôs state-owned company, PakSat, a subsidiary of Suparco, currently provides satellite internet through Satellite Multi-Mission-1 (MM-1), the country‚Äôs second telecommunication satellite, launched in August 2024.</p>
<p>Unlike LEO satellites, the MM-1 is a geostationary satellite positioned at an altitude of around 37,500km above the Earth‚Äôs surface, with a latency delay of about 600 milliseconds.</p>
<p>PakSat currently serves around 300 clients, with a capacity to accommodate up to 5,000 users. The service is primarily sold to the corporate sector, armed forces and telecom providers for remote regions.</p>
