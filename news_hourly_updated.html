                <h2>We won the war but seek peace: PM Shehbaz invites India to live as ‚Äòpeaceful neighbour‚Äô</h2>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said Pakistan won the war but sought peace and invited India to live as a ‚Äúpeaceful neighbour‚Äù, as the country celebrated Operation Bunyanum Marsoos‚Äôs success with a ceremony.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan began after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> air strikes on Pakistan, causing civilian casualties. Both sides exchanged missiles over the following week, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> tensions. An <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">American intervention</a> led to a ceasefire.

<p>Today‚Äôs ceremony, marking the Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanksgiving Day), was held at the Pakistan Monument in Islamabad and attended by PM Shehbaz, armed forces chiefs, and other civil and military leaders. It began with the recitation of the Holy Quran, opening speeches, a flypast, and national songs.</p>

<p>Beginning his speech, PM Shehbaz praised the martyrs, their families, his cabinet members, service chiefs, and the nation for successfully responding to the Indian aggression.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have won the war but we want peace. We have taught our enemy a lesson but we condemn aggression, he said. ‚ÄúWe want this part of the world to be as prosperous and progressive as others through hard work, undying efforts and living like peaceful neighbours.‚Äù</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz said he had had a meeting with the services chiefs on the night between May 9 and 10, in which it was decided that since the enemy had crossed ‚Äúthe last limit‚Äù and rejected Pakistan‚Äôs offer of an international investigation, a ‚Äúmeasured response‚Äù must be given.</p>
<p>He detailed that around 2:30am that night, the army chief had told him on a secure telephone call that India had launched its ballistic missiles on Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe told me, ‚ÄòMr prime minister, grant us permission to strike the enemy with such force that they never forget it‚Äô.‚Äù</p>
<p>The premier added that later that night after Pakistan retaliated, the army chief had told him: ‚ÄúWe have given a befitting response and now we are being requested for a ceasefire. So, what do you think?‚Äù</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said that he had responded: ‚ÄúWhat could be greater than landing a blow that leaves the enemy‚Äôs head spinning and desperate for a ceasefire? Go ahead and accept the offer.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is a brief account of a long story from that day,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He informed the audience that the technology used by the Pakistan Air Force had stunned the enemy and sent the trust and confidence of allies soaring. ‚ÄúThis is a historic development that God brought about within a matter of hours,‚Äù PM Shehbaz said, adding that the military‚Äôs prowess was being talked about from the United States to Japan.</p>
<p>The premier said no major power can now block Pakistan‚Äôs path, with the entire nation united from Peshawar to Karachi, standing behind and supporting the army. He also reiterated his gratitude to allied nations for their efforts in achieving the ceasefire.</p>
<p>He went on to say that the conflict solved nothing, only bringing more poverty, unemployment and other problems to both sides.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe lesson is that we have to sit down at the table like peaceful neighbours and settle our outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir. Without resolving these issues, I don‚Äôt think we will have peace in this part of the world on a long-term basis.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf we want permanent peace then we need permanent solutions of Jammu and Kashmir and water distribution. Then once we resolve these issues, the sky‚Äôs the limit. We can talk of trade, exchange of business communities and cooperate in the field of counter-terrorism,‚Äù the prime minister emphasised.</p>

                <h2>Turkiye‚Äôs Celebi sues India over ‚Äòvague‚Äô clearance pullback amid South Asia tension</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Turkiye-based Celebi, which provides airport ground handling in India, has launched a legal challenge to New Delhi‚Äôs decision to overturn its security clearance, arguing that ‚Äúvague‚Äù national security concerns were cited without reasoning.</p>

<p>Amid growing public anger in India about Turkiye‚Äôs stance on Pakistan in the India-Pakistan conflict, the Indian government on Thursday revoked Celebi‚Äôs security clearance in the ‚Äúinterest of national security‚Äù.</p>
<p>Celebi Airport Services India, in a May 16 filing seen by <em>Reuters</em>, asked the Delhi High Court to set aside that decision, arguing it would impact 3,791 jobs and investor confidence, and was issued without any warning to the company.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMere rhetoric of national security without elaborating upon in what manner is an entity a threat to national security is unsustainable in law,‚Äù the company said in the filing, which is not public.</p>
<p>The order ‚Äúfails to disclose any specific or substantive reason except for a vague and general reference to ‚Äònational security‚Äô‚Ä¶ [it] provides no reasons or justification‚Äù, it added.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The case is likely to be heard on Monday.</p>
<p>In its filing, Celebi said that while its shareholders were registered in Turkiye, ‚Äúmajority end control‚Äù of the group is held by companies that do not have Turkish incorporation or origin.</p>
<p>In revoking Celebi‚Äôs clearance on Thursday, India‚Äôs junior aviation minister Murlidhar Mohol said on X the government had received requests from across India to ban Celebi.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRecognising the seriousness of the issue and the call to protect national interests, we have taken cognizance of these requests,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p>The Shiv Sena party, a key ally in Modi‚Äôs government, had held protests against Celebi in Mumbai this week, demanding that the city‚Äôs airport sever ties with it.</p>
<p>Celebi in its filing said it was providing ground handling services at airports in New Delhi, Kerala, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Goa.</p>
<p>It had undergone background checks and security verifications by various national security and intelligence agencies in India before starting work, it added.</p>
<p>Delhi Airport late on Thursday said on X it had ‚Äúofficially ended its association with Celebi‚Äù for ground handling and cargo operations.</p>

<p><em>Reuters</em> reported on Friday that Air India was lobbying Indian officials to halt rival IndiGo‚Äôs leasing tie-up with Turkish Airlines, citing business impact as well as security concerns sparked by Istanbul‚Äôs support for Pakistan.</p></p>
