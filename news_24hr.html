            <p><p>Karachi’s central mourning procession of Ashura commenced at Nishtar Park on Sunday amid tight security, police said.</p>
<p>Yaum-i-Ashura is observed every year on Muharram 10 with solemnity to pay homage to Imam Husain — the grandson of Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) — and other martyrs of Karbala.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Karachi Traffic Police issued a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921828">traffic plan</a> for Muharram 8 to 10, outlining the procession routes as well as alternative traffic flows.</p>
<p>Stringent security measures are being taken across the country, such as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920725/army-to-be-deployed-across-country-for-security-during-muharram">army deployment</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919931">crackdown</a> on sectarian content and hate mongers, ahead of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920308">Ashura</a> (Muharram 10), being observed today.</p>
<p>The Ashura majlis in Karachi commenced at Nishtar Park, according to an alert from the police. “The number of participants is approximately 3500 to 4000 and it is being led by Shahenshah Hussain Naqvi.”</p>
<p>Traffic has been closed from main Numaish to MA Jinnah Road up to Kharadar  Husseinia Irania Imam Bargah, with the exception of Bab-e-Urdu Chowk, Karachi traffic police said in a post on X.</p>

<p>A total of 7,004 police personnel are present for surveillance and security for the main procession.</p>
<p>Additionally, 733 NGOs, as well as senior officers of Karachi Police, and 6,271 head constables and constables are performing duty today. Expert police snipers have also been deployed alongside the main procession.</p>
<p>“Traffic police officers and personnel have been deployed to maintain traffic flow on the main procession routes and crossings, including alternative traffic routes arranged for the 10th Muharram procession, so as to keep the traffic flowing by keeping the public safe from any inconvenience,” said a statement from the office of Karachi’s additional inspector general of police.</p>
<p>“Karachi Police is providing complete security to the mourners participating in the 10th Muharram processions.”</p>
<p>The statement urged the public to keep an eye on their surroundings and immediately inform the police on Madadgar 15 of any suspicious or unusual situation.</p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid rich tribute to the sacrifice of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) and his companions, saying that Ashura gives us a message of sacrifice, truthfulness, sincere determination, and standing up for the truth.</p>
<p>In their separate messages on Yaum-i-Ashura, they urged the nation to uphold the values and principles of fortitude and courage demonstrated by the martyrs of Karbala and to exhibit perseverance in the face of trials, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>President Zardari said that Karbala is a symbol of an eternal struggle against falsehood. “This day is not only an unparalleled story of sacrifice, loyalty, and patience but also a bright lamp that shows the path of truth and righteousness in the darkness of every era.”</p>
<p>In his message, PM Shehbaz said: “Karbala teaches us that although the path of truth is difficult, it is the path that leads to the pleasure of Allah Almighty and the satisfaction of hearts and eternal prosperity.”</p>
<p>He said the message of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) is not limited to his time but is a universal message, which even today convinces us that a Muslim stands for the truth, supports the oppressed, and advocates justice in all circumstances.</p></p>

            <p><p>Elon Musk, an ex-ally of US President Donald Trump, said on Saturday he had launched a new political party in the United States to challenge what the tech billionaire described as the country’s “one-party system.”</p>
<p>The world’s richest person — and Trump’s biggest political donor in the 2024 election — had a bitter <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915756">falling out</a> with the president after leading the Republican’s effort to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891574">slash</a> spending and cut federal jobs as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).</p>
<p>Musk has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921560/trump-musk-revive-feud-over-big-beautiful-tax-cut-bill">clashed</a> with Trump over the president’s massive domestic spending <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922374">plan</a>, saying it would explode the US debt, and vowed to do everything in his power to defeat lawmakers who voted for it.</p>
<p>Now he has created the so-called America Party, his own political framework, through which to try and achieve that.</p>
<p>“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste &amp; graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” the SpaceX and Tesla boss posted on X, the social media platform that he owns.</p>
<p>“Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”</p>

<p>Musk cited a poll — uploaded on Friday, US Independence Day — in which he asked whether respondents “want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system” that has dominated US politics for some two centuries.</p>

<p>The yes-or-no survey earned more than 1.2 million responses.</p>

<p>Musk also shared a meme depicting a two-headed snake and the caption “End the Uniparty.”</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#laser-focus-on-vulnerable-lawmakers" id="laser-focus-on-vulnerable-lawmakers" title="Permalink"></a>‘Laser-focus’ on vulnerable lawmakers</h2>
<p>It is not clear how much impact the new party would have on the 2026 mid-term elections, or on the presidential vote two years after that.</p>
<p>The Trump-Musk feud reignited in dramatic fashion late last month as Trump pushed Republicans in Congress to ram through his massive domestic agenda in the form of the One Big Beautiful Bill.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Musk expressed fierce opposition to the legislation and ruthlessly attacked its Republican backers for supporting “debt slavery.”</p>
<p>He vowed to launch a new political party to challenge lawmakers who campaigned on reduced federal spending only to vote for the bill, which experts say will pile an extra $3.4 trillion over a decade onto the US deficit.</p>
<p>“They will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth,” Musk said earlier this week.</p>
<p>After Musk heavily criticised the flagship spending bill — which eventually passed Congress and was signed into law — Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921414">threatened</a> to deport the tech tycoon and strip federal funds from his businesses.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to take a look,” the president told reporters when asked if he would consider deporting Musk, who was born in South Africa and has held US citizenship since 2002.</p>
<p>On Friday, after posting the poll, Musk laid out a possible political battle plan to pick off vulnerable House and Senate seats and become “the deciding vote” on key legislation.</p>
<p>“One way to execute on this would be to laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts,” Musk posted on X.</p>
<p>All 435 US House seats are up for grabs every two years, while about one third of the Senate’s 100 members, who serve six-year terms, are elected every two years.</p>
<p>Some observers were quick to point out how third-party campaigns have historically split the vote — as businessman Ross Perot’s independent presidential run in 1992 did when it helped doom George H.W. Bush’s re-election bid, resulting in Democrat Bill Clinton’s victory.</p>
<p>“You are pulling a Ross Perot, and I don’t like it,” one X user wrote to Musk.</p></p>

            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: PTI has denounced PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922101">remarks</a> suggesting Pakistan could extradite citizens to India as a confidence-building measure (CBM), accusing him of undermining national security and appeasing a hostile neighbour.</p>
<p>According to reports, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said Pakistan had no objection to handing over “individuals of concern” to India, provided New Delhi showed a willingness to cooperate.</p>
<p>In a hard-hitting statement on Saturday, PTI CIS Sheikh Waqas Akram criticised the PPP chairman’s stance, calling him an “immature political child”. He said the proposal was ill-advised and detrimental to Pakistan’s national security narrative, adding that such statements humiliate the country on international platforms.</p>
<p>Mr Akram accused the “fraudulently imposed” government of bringing Pakistan to its knees.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Accuses PPP chairman of appeasing India, undermining national security</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“We fail to understand why Bilawal is so keen on appeasing India,” he asked, alleging that the PPP chairman was proving time and again that he lacked political wisdom, vision and understanding of regional geopolitics.</p>
<p>“Instead of holding India accountable for its continued aggression, water terrorism and cross-border interference, Bilawal was proposing CBMs that compromise Pakistan’s sovereignty and integrity,” he said.</p>
<p>He emphasised that it was imperative to ask Mr Bhutto-Zardari on whose behalf he issued such a statement and what he intended to achieve by offering such concessions to a belligerent India by humiliating Pakistan on an international stage. Mr Akram also criticised the PPP chairman’s inconsistency.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Bilawal has become a symbol of confusion and contradiction in Pakistan’s foreign policy discourse,” he said. “PPP was founded by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on the legacy of Kashmir, but today, Bilawal is betraying that legacy by pursuing political gains at the expense of Kashmiri blood.” Mr Akram went on to mock Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s political credentials, stating that leadership is earned, not built through media appearances and styling. “If PPP’s intelligentsia truly cares about Bilawal, they should let him contest local body elections first and appear on regional TV channels instead of being pushed on international media, where he only embarrasses Pakistan,” he stated.</p>
<p>He said the PPP chairman would lead the party to complete elimination, advising that if the party wanted to survive, he must step aside and hand over its leadership to Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, “who, at the very least, shows more promise and sense than him”.</p>
