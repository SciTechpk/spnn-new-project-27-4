            <p><p>Pakistan on Monday conducted a successful training launch of a Fatah Series surface-to-surface missile with a range of 120 kilometres as part of ongoing ‚ÄúEx Indus‚Äù, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7275" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>The test launch comes amid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908387">heightened tensions</a> between nuclear powers Pakistan and India in the wake of New Delhi‚Äôs aggressive measures in the wake of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile‚Äôs advanced navigation system and enhanced accuracy,‚Äù the ISPR statement read.</p>

<p>The training launch was witnessed by senior officers of the army , as well as officers, scientists and engineers from Pakistan‚Äôs strategic organisations, the military‚Äôs media wing said.</p>
<p>The chairman joint chiefs of staff committee and the army chief congratulated the participating troops, scientists, and engineers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey expressed complete confidence in the operational preparedness and technical proficiency of [the] Pakistan Army to thwart any aggression against the territorial integrity of Pakistan,‚Äù the ISPR added.</p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari congratulated scientists and engineers, as well as the nation, on the successful test of the Fatah missile, according to a post on X by the PPP.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe president appreciated the efforts of the security forces, scientists and engineers to strengthen the country‚Äôs defense.</p>
<p>‚Äú[He] reiterated national commitment to ensure national security and defence.‚Äù</p>

<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the efforts of the chairman joint chiefs of staff, the army chief, and the scientists and engineers involved in preparation for the launch, according to a statement from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe success of the training launch clearly shows that Pakistan‚Äôs defence is in strong hands.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prime minister expressed satisfaction over the professional capabilities of the Pakistan Army and its full preparedness for national defense,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the ISPR said that Pakistan had conducted a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908176">successful training launch</a> of the Abdali Weapon System, a surface-to-surface missile with a range of 450km.</p>
<p>In May last year, the army <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1833760">conducted a test-launch</a> of Fatah-II guided rocket system which had a range of 400 kilometres.</p>
<p>The guidance system makes this rocket a precision weapon enhancing its lethality and efficacy, while the trajectory mode and terminal guidance technology enables it to evade the enemy‚Äôs anti-ballistic missile systems.</p>

<p>A day ago, Islamabad decided to seek an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908460">immediate session</a> of the United Nations Security Council to apprise world powers about the recent tensions with India.</p>

<p>It said Pakistan would specifically highlight the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty by India.</p></p>
