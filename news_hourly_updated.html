                <h2>Rubio, PM Shehbaz stress importance of promoting durable Israel-Iran peace</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke on Thursday with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif about <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920431/iran-wont-back-down-but-looking-to-avoid-war">recent developments</a> in the Middle East, underlining a shared commitment to regional stability and non-proliferation amid renewed efforts to engage <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920138">Iran</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecretary of State Marco Rubio spoke today with Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif regarding events in the Middle East. Secretary Rubio emphasised that Iran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon,‚Äù US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/06/secretary-rubios-call-with-pakistani-prime-minister-sharif-3/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe two leaders acknowledged the importance of working together to promote a durable peace between Israel and Iran and to maintain regional stability,‚Äù she added.</p>

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The call highlights Washington‚Äôs growing engagement with Islamabad at a time when the Biden administration is reportedly exploring a new diplomatic initiative with Tehran, possibly ‚Äúas early as next week‚Äù.</p>
<p>Rubio‚Äôs statement that ‚ÄúIran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon‚Äù will be interpreted in various ways in both Pakistan and the United States. Some may see it as an indication of alignment between the two countries, while others may view it as an affirmation of Pakistan‚Äôs position as a potential stabilising partner in a region fraught with uncertainty.</p>
<p>The latest contact builds on a series of high-level engagements, including a phone call last Friday in which PM Shehbaz expressed satisfaction over what he described as a ‚Äúcordial and productive discussion‚Äù <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917868">between</a> US President Donald Trump and Pakistan‚Äôs military chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir.</p>
<p>That meeting, held earlier this month at the White House, was notable for both its optics and timing. Munir became the first serving Pakistani army chief to be formally received by a sitting US president ‚Äî a gesture widely interpreted as an acknowledgment of the military‚Äôs central role in Pakistan‚Äôs foreign and security policy.</p>
<p>The Pakistani military‚Äôs media wing later reported that the White House luncheon focused on joint counterterrorism efforts and the potential for expanded bilateral trade.</p>
<p>Trump, in remarks at a Nato summit in The Hague following the meeting, credited General Munir with helping to avert a nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan, referring to him ‚Äî though not by name ‚Äî as a quiet but decisive actor during last month‚Äôs standoff.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>‚ÄúThe most important of these conflicts,‚Äù Trump said, ‚Äúwas last month‚Äôs war scare between India and Pakistan. And that was not whether or not they may someday have nukes, like we are talking about the Middle East‚Ä¶ This is ‚Äî they have nuclear weapons.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump described how he intervened through a series of calls that linked trade to peace.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>‚ÄúIf you are going to be fighting each other‚Ä¶ we are not going to do any trade,‚Äù he recalled telling both sides. ‚ÄúThey said, ‚ÄòNo, no. No, you have to do a trade deal.‚Äô‚Ä¶ And we stopped the nuclear war.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Trump avoided naming General Munir directly, he has in the past referred to the Pakistani general as ‚Äúan exceptional human being and an inspiring personality‚Äù.</p>
<p>These remarks, which closely mirror Pakistan‚Äôs version of events, stand in contrast to India‚Äôs official stance. New Delhi maintains it acted independently during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918769">May crisis</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917877/modi-maintains-there-was-no-us-mediation-in-ceasefire-with-pakistan">rejects</a> any suggestion of third-party mediation. Trump‚Äôs candid remarks suggest otherwise, indicating a more active White House role than previously acknowledged.</p>
<p>In his broader comments following last week‚Äôs White House meeting, Trump also noted: ‚ÄúThe Pakistanis know Iran very well, better than most. But they are not happy.‚Äù</p>
<p>Though brief, this comment hints at Washington‚Äôs evolving perception of Pakistan ‚Äî not merely as a South Asian actor but as a player with insight into regional dynamics. It also reinforces the relevance of Rubio‚Äôs phone call with Sharif, suggesting that the US is keen to draw on Islamabad‚Äôs experience as it revisits the idea of talks with Tehran.</p>
<p>Rubio‚Äôs statement on preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon re-emphasises US strategic priorities. Pakistan‚Äôs apparent position ‚Äî implicit in the call‚Äôs emphasis on peace and stability ‚Äî may help strengthen its image in Washington as a constructive and responsible actor in a volatile neighborhood.</p>
<p>Observers say the back-to-back engagements ‚Äî and Pakistan‚Äôs active role in both South Asian and Middle Eastern dialogues ‚Äî signal a diplomatic moment of consequence, one in which Islamabad has the opportunity to shape outcomes far beyond its immediate borders.</p></p>

<p>ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Thursday passed the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292">federal budget</a> for the upcoming fiscal year, with an outlay of Rs17.57 trillion, despite opposition calls for the budgetary proposals to be made public and for the passage to be delayed until public input had been sought.</p>
<p>The House passed the Finance Bill for 2025 with certain amendments, incorporating around half of the suggestions put forward by the finance committees of both houses of parliament. All amendments proposed by the opposition were rejected.</p>

<p>Speaking to lawmakers, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari explained why his party was supporting the federal budget. He highlighted an increase of 20 per cent in the allocation for the Benazir Income Support Pro¬≠gra¬≠mme (BISP), a flagship initiative originally envisioned by former prime minister Benazir Bhutto.</p>
<p>He criticised the previous PTI government for attempting to undermine BISP in every budget and praised Prime Minister Sheh¬≠baz Sharif for consistently increasing its funding since assuming office. Mr Bhutto-Zardari also noted that the government had raised the income threshold for tax exemption from Rs600,000 to Rs1.2 million annually.</p>
<p>The PPP chairman also pointed out that the tax on solar panels had been reduced from 18pc to 10pc following objections from PPP members.</p>
<p>He also welcomed the decision to curtail the arrest powers of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), noting that arrests in tax cases could now only be made in instances of proven fraud, not during the inquiry stage, and that such offences had been declared bailable. ‚ÄúThese are the reasons why the PPP is supporting this budget,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>However, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan criticised the federal budget as a ‚Äúdisastrous‚Äù 64pc deficit, which he argued would severely harm the country.</p>
<p>He expressed concerns that Pakistan‚Äôs economy could face a crisis similar to Sri Lanka‚Äôs, with the agricultural sector and large-scale industry failing, potentially leading the country to bankruptcy.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúContrary to its claims, the government has failed to bring about economic reforms or complete the privatisation of any major entity,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat is why I will not say it is a visionary budget in the absence of any reforms‚Äù, he said.</p>
<p>Barrister Gohar also raised concerns about the allocation for BISP, which had been increased from Rs313 billion to over Rs700 billion, arguing that there had not been a fair distribution of funds across the country.</p>
<p>He criticised the new powers granted to the FBR to appoint auditors for evaluation and audit, calling it unconstitutional and in violation of Article 242 of the Constitution and relevant rules.</p>
<p>Malik Aamir Dogar of PTI argued that the government did not have a mandate from the public to present or approve the budget. He accused the government of consulting the IMF while preparing the federal budget but not consulting the public before its approval.</p>
<p>PTI‚Äôs Muhammad Atif Khan also questioned how a party that was not voted into power could impose new taxes on the people. He held the previous PML-N government (2013-18) responsible for causing a significant rise in capacity payments due to ‚Äúdubious‚Äù power purchase agreements with independent power producers (IPPs).</p>
<p>Aliya Kamran of JUI-F moved a cut motion, criticising tax evasion and lack of transparency and accountability within the FBR system. Shandana Gulzar of PTI also criticised the government, accusing it of misleading the public about economic figures and implementing anti-people policies.</p>
<p>Ali Muhammad Khan, addressing Mr Bhutto-Zardari, asked him to become the voice of the poor masses and oppose measures like the imposition of new taxes on vehicles starting from 850cc.</p>
<p>Mobeen Arif of PTI proposed deferring the passage of the bill until the public had been consulted.</p>
<p>Latif Khosa, alluding to the country‚Äôs growing debt, questioned the government‚Äôs handling of loans, asking, ‚ÄúHave¬≠n‚Äôt you mortgaged three generations?‚Äù He added that nearly half of the population had fallen below the poverty line.</p>
<p>Opposition members strongly objected to granting arrest powers to FBR officials, arguing that the government had turned the ‚Äúmost corrupt‚Äù institution into a police force, potentially leading to harassment of citizens under the pretext of tax collection.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also attended the proceedings and met leaders from both sides of the aisle, including Mr Bhutto-Zardari.</p>
<p><strong>Budget 2025-26</strong></p>
<p>The federal budget for the next fiscal year projects an economic growth rate of 4.2pc and an inflation rate of 7.5pc. The net revenue receipts have been estimated at Rs11.07tr, with FBR collections projected to rise by 18.7pc to Rs14.13tr. Non-tax revenues are estimated at Rs5.15tr.</p>
<p>Key allocations include Rs2.55tr for defence, Rs1.06tr for pension expenditures, and Rs1.19tr for subsidies on electricity and other sectors. Relief measures in the budget include a 10pc increase in salaries, 7pc in pensions and tax relief for the salaried class across all income brackets.</p>
<p>The budget also includes Rs716bn for BISP and Rs1tr for the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), in which the largest allocation of Rs328bn is earmarked for transport infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>The PSDP for the next fiscal year has been aligned with the objectives of URAAN Pakistan, prioritising high-impact, near-completion foreign-funded projects and new initiatives of national importance.</p>
<p>Key infrastructure projects like Diamer Bhasha, Mohmand Dam and K-IV have been allocated Rs32.7bn, Rs35.7bn and Rs3.2bn, respectively. Besides, Rs10bn has been allocated for the lining of Kalri Baghar Feeder and Rs4.4bn for installing a telemetry system on the Indus Basin System.</p>
<p>The Higher Education Commission has been allocated Rs39.5bn for 170 projects. Additionally, Rs18.5bn has been earmarked in the PSDP for various education initiatives.</p>
<p>The agriculture sector will receive Rs4bn for 10 ongoing and five new schemes. The budget also includes incentives for the construction industry, such as a reduction in withholding tax on property purchases.</p>
