            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir has vowed to “crush” terrorists in Balochistan, stating that India’s involvement in terrorism in the country’s largest province was “no longer hidden”, state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/01-06-2025/balochistans-grand-jirga-reaffirms-commitment-to-security-stability-of-province" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>His comments came during a grand jirga in Quetta on Saturday, organised to interact with tribal leadership and discuss the evolving security situation in Balochistan, with particular focus on terrorists receiving support from India. The COAS and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif delivered speeches and interacted with tribal elders.</p>
<p>In April, at least six people, including three students, lost their lives and over 40 others — mostly students — sustained injuries after a bomb targeted a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912542/pm-vows-strong-action-against-perpetrators-after-school-bus-blast-in-khuzdar">school bus</a> in Balochistan’s Khuzdar. Following the attack, the military <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">accused</a> India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.</p>
<p>Reaffirming that the enemy’s “nefarious designs will fail”, the field marshal said: “It is an open malicious act of terrorism waged on our people, our progress, and our peace. Pakistan has concrete evidence of India’s involvement with terrorist networks in Balochistan.</p>
<p>“The Pakistan Army, with the unwavering support of the nation and the brave Baloch people, will confront and crush every enemy, foreign or domestic, that dares to challenge our sovereignty.”</p>
<p>Stating that Pakistan was ready to respond to any act of aggression, the field marshal said, “Peace in Balochistan is non-negotiable and that the future of Pakistan is directly linked to a stable, prosperous Balochistan.”</p>
<p>Earlier during the event, PM Shehbaz underscored that terrorist groups under the umbrella of <em>Fitna Al Hindustan</em> sought the support of locals, which must be denied to them.</p>
<p>“Indian-sponsored proxies operating in Balochistan have intensified their efforts to undermine peace, destabilise the province, and disrupt development initiatives led by the Government of Pakistan and the Armed Forces,” PM Shehbaz emphasised.</p>
<p>The prime minister reiterated the need for engagement at the grassroots level and ensuring that terrorists find no social space.</p>
<p>The tribal elders agreed to stand “shoulder-to-shoulder” with the government and the armed forces, reaffirming their commitment to the security, stability, and development of the province.</p>
<p>The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912572/bla-and-ttp-are-indian-proxies-govt-will-prove-indias-involvement-in-khuzdar-bus-attack-asif">attacks</a>. The outlawed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897969">Balochistan Liberation Army</a>, in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.</p>
<p>In March, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419/jaffar-express-hijacking-state-media-reports-190-rescued-2nd-day-of-operation-underway-in-balochistan">Jaffar Express</a> train was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area, resulting in the deaths of 26 hostages, including 18 security personnel. Five more security personnel were martyred during the operation.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914758/jui-fs-fazl-assails-child-marriage-law-announces-protest-rallies-across-country' target='_blank'><strong>JUI-F’s Fazl assails child marriage law, announces protest rallies across country</strong></a>
            <p><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday rejected the recently enacted Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Act 2025, announcing nationwide protest rallies aimed at “creating awareness” among the public.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911451">bill</a>, which sought to protect the rights of children and eventually eradicate marriages of children under the age of 18 in Islamabad, was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914268/president-zardari-signs-bill-to-curb-child-marriage-into-law">signed into law</a> by the president on May 27 after sailing through both houses of parliament.</p>
<p>However, the move attracted <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913987">strong opposition</a> from religious segments of society, with the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) — a constitutional body responsible for giving legal advice on Islamic issues to the government and the Parliament — ruling that “classifying marriage under the age of 18 as rape did not conform with Islamic law.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Peshawar today, the JUI-F chief rejected the law, alleging that it “made fornication easier while making legitimate marriages difficult”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is a strange country — during the time of General Musharraf, a constitutional amendment was passed in the name of women’s rights that decriminalised fornication,” Fazl said. “It took it out of the realm of sin.</p>
<p>“Now, they are trying to ban the marriage of people under 18. The CII has already rejected this and all ulemas and their parties have agreed that it contradicts the Quran and sunnah,” he added, lamenting that despite constitutional guarantees, the Constitution was “being trampled”.</p>
<p>Announcing that the JUI-F would “take steps” to protest the legislation, Fazl announced a series of rallies and a large conference in Hazara Division in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on June 29.</p>
<p>“We will stage rallies, but they won’t focus on one subject, like Al-Aqsa Mosque,” the party chief explained. “Now, we will host rallies to create awareness about national sovereignty and Islamic governance.”</p>
<p>He added, “God willing, we will present our stance to the world freely. Islam is a faith that moves with the world and can be beneficial.”</p>
<p>Underage marriages are practised in some parts of the country, most commonly in rural areas, driven largely by poverty and limited access to education. According to a 2019 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1456915/21pc-girls-in-pakistan-become-victim-of-child-marriage-who-reports">World Health Organisation</a> report, about 21 per cent of girls in Pakistan were married before 18.</p>
<p>The same year, the Senate passed the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1479198">Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Bill, 2018</a> — a private member bill presented by PPP  Senator Sherry Rehman, proposing that the legal minimum age of marriage in the country be set at 18.</p>
<p>At that time, JUI-F had opposed the bill as well, calling it “contradictory to Islamic principles,” and suggesting that the bill should be sent to the CII before being discussed in the Senate. It was, however, not passed by the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Similarly, in 2021, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1630556">Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Marriage Restraint Bill, 2021</a> presented by PPP MPA Nighat Orakzai — aimed at banning marriages of people under the age of 18 — could not become law.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Sindh government had promulgated the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1112097">Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act 2013</a>.</p></p>

            <p><p>Mohammad Haris hit a swashbuckling maiden international century to guide Pakistan to a 3-0 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914595">clean sweep</a> of Bangladesh with a seven-wicket win in the third and final Twenty20 international in Lahore on Sunday.</p>
<p>Haris, playing in his 17th T20I, carted seven sixes and eight boundaries in his 107 off just 46 balls as Pakistan chased down a challenging 197-run target in 17.2 overs for their first home T20I series win in three-and-a-half years.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914401">won</a> the first two <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914161">matches</a> by 37 and 57 runs at the same venue.</p>
<p>Parvez Hossain smashed four sixes and seven boundaries in his solid 34-ball 66 to lift Bangladesh to 196-6 in their 20 overs.</p>
<p>Pakistan lost Sahibzada Farhan for one in the first over, but Haris, whose hundred came up off 45 balls, added 92 for the second wicket with Saim Ayub and an unbroken 60 for the fourth with Salman Agha, who made 15 not out.</p>
<p>Ayub hit four sixes and two boundaries in his 29-ball 45 while Hasan Nawaz scored 13-ball 26 as the home batters enthralled a near-capacity 30,000 crowd at Gaddafi Stadium.</p>
<p>Earlier, Parvez shared a 110-run opening stand with Tanzid Hasan (32-ball 42 with three sixes and as many boundaries) after the tourists were sent in to bat.</p>
<p>The Parvez-Tanzid stand gave Bangladesh an ideal start for their highest T20I total against Pakistan, beating the 175-6 they made against them at Pallekele in 2012.</p>
<p>Towhid Hridoy, who scored 25 from 18 balls with a six and two boundaries, then added 49 for the third wicket with Litton Das, who made 22.</p>
<p>Fast bowlers Abbas Afridi (2-26) and Hasan Ali (2-38) were the pick of the home bowlers.</p></p>
