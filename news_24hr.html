            <p><p>Pakistan has conducted a successful training launch of the Abdali Weapon System, a surface-to-surface missile with a range of 450 kilometres, the military’s media affairs wing said on Saturday.</p>
<p>“The launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile’s advanced navigation system and enhanced maneuverability features,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release.</p>
<p>It noted that the launch was a part of “Ex Indus” and was witnessed by the commander of the Army Strategic Forces Command (AFSC), senior officials from the Strategic Plans Division and the AFSC, as well as scientists and engineers from Pakistan’s strategic organisations.</p>
<p>The ISPR also released a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/GovtofPakistan/status/1918574501459100072" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> of the successful launch.</p>

<p>President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza and the services chiefs extended their congratulations to the participating troops, scientists, and engineers, the ISPR said.</p>
<p>“They expressed complete confidence in the operational preparedness and technical proficiency of Pakistan’s Strategic Forces to ensure credible minimum deterrence and safeguard national security against any aggression,” the statement added.</p>
<p>The test launch comes amid heightened tensions between nuclear powers Pakistan and India in the wake of New Delhi’s aggressive measures in the wake of a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.</p>

<p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir on Thursday asserted that any “misadventure” by India would be met with a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907785/any-military-misadventure-by-india-will-be-met-with-swift-resolute-notch-up-response-coas">swift, resolute and notch-up response</a>”. The next day, the army’s top brass also warned India of a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war">sure and decisive</a>” response should it attempt to impose war.</p>

            <p><p>Pakistan’s envoy to the United States has called on the global community to resolve the Kashmir dispute, terming it the “core issue” of the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284/trade-ties-and-flights-off-limits-as-pakistan-retaliates-to-indias-moves">complete breakdown</a> of ties with India in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.</p>

<p>“It could be an important part of President [Donald] Trump’s legacy to attend to this situation — not with a Band-Aid solution, but by addressing the core issue: the Kashmir dispute,” Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855847">Rizwan Saeed Sheikh</a> said in an interview with <em>Fox News Digital</em> published earlier today.</p>
<p>“This is one nuclear flashpoint,” the envoy said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Sheikh’s statement echoes his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907760/pm-shehbaz-thanks-china-for-endorsing-pakistans-proposal-of-neutral-probe-into-pahalgam-attack#:~:text=Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20envoy%20calls%20on%20Trump%20to%20ease%20tensions%20with%20India%3A%20report">recent call to Trump</a> to step in and help ease soaring tensions with India. He had highlighted that as a president “standing for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration”, there was no “higher or flashier flashpoint” than the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>Trump, in his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=Overseas%20wars%20and%20plans%20for%20peace">inaugural speech</a> as the US president, had said: “My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.”</p>
<p>A ceasefire — which has since been broken — was secured between <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886289">Israel and Hamas</a> following Trump’s election, and he has also been engaging with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906950">Ukraine and Russia</a> to halt their war.</p>
<p>During his interview with <em>Fox News</em>, Sheikh also called on nations around the globe to help with a lasting settlement to the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>He said: “Previously, when the situation has been at this level or the tensions have escalated, the international community has attended to the situation, but taken their eyes [and] attention away, even before the situation could fully diffuse.</p>
<p>“This time, perhaps it would be […] timely in terms of the situation elsewhere on the globe, with similar instances, […] to perhaps not afford a Band-Aid solution, but to address the broader problem.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Any misadventure or miscalculation can lead to a nuclear interface,” the ambassador was quoted as saying. “That is certainly not desirable in such a densely populated region.”</p>
<p>“We want a peaceful neighbourhood,” Sheikh emphasised, adding that Pakistan did not want any instability in the region.</p>
<p>However, he stressed, Pakistan’s desire for peace “should not in any way be misconstrued as a sign of weakness”. “We want peace with dignity.”</p>
<p>Sheikh described India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">response</a> to the Pahalgam attack as dangerously premature and inflammatory, according to the report.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The envoy reiterated Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s offer to hold a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral and transparent</a>” probe into the Pahalgam attack. He pointed out that both the investigation offer and Pakistan’s request for evidence linking it to the attack had gone “unanswered”.</p>
<p>“Within minutes of the attack, India began levelling accusations against Pakistan,” he said, noting that a post-investigation report was filed just 10 minutes after the incident occurred, despite the remote and rugged terrain near the scene.</p>
<p>The ambassador warned that the region was once again being held “hostage to the war of hysteria” by India’s government and media, who immediately “began beating war drums”.</p>
<p>On the allegations implied by India, which has not yet named Pakistan or any entity directly, Sheikh said the suspects were reportedly Indian nationals whose homes have already been raided.</p>
<p>He questioned why India is looking outside its borders rather than addressing “administrative inadequacies” in occupied Kashmir. He slammed India’s broader policies in held Kashmir, including the alleged settlement of non-residents into the region.</p>

<p>Speaking about India’s <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unilateral suspension</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>, Ambassador Sheikh said: “That is as grossly illegal as it can get. This is one treaty that has withstood wars between India and Pakistan.”</p>
<p>Law Minister Azam Naz­eer Tarar said yesterday that Pakistan’s final response to India’s letters on the IWT <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908128/multiple-ministries-to-craft-pakistans-response-on-iwt">would be crafted</a> in consultation with all relevant ministries, including foreign affairs, water resources and law.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik has also said Islamabad would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907454">approach international forums</a>, including the World Bank that brokered it, regarding the treaty’s suspension.</p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">killed 26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000.

As Pakistan, in the early hours of April 30, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an Indian incursion within 24–36 hours, diplomatic channels have been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension">engaged</a> to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>India’s Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.dgft.gov.in/CP/?opt=notification" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a> said the ban will take effect immediately.</p>
<p>“This restriction is imposed in the interest of national security and public policy,” it said.</p>
<p>In response to India’s slew of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">aggressive measures</a> against the country in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan announced <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284">retaliatory measures</a> that have included halting all border trade, closing its airspace to Indian carriers and expelling Indian diplomats.</p>
<p>However, Pakistan on May 1 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907774/govt-allows-150-stranded-afghan-trucks-to-cross-wagah-border-for-goods-delivery">allowed</a> 150 stranded Afghan trucks carrying goods for India to cross the Wagah Border, easing a weeks-long bottleneck, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.</p>
<p>Trade between the two nations has dwindled over the last few years.</p>
<p>In August 2019, Pakistan had already <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1499076">formally downgraded</a> its trade relations with India to the level of Israel, with which Islamabad has no trade ties at all — in reaction to New Delhi’s decision to revoke Article 370 of its constitution that granted occupied Kashmir a special status.</p></p>
