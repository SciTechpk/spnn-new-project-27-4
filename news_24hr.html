            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915012/responsibility-of-sc-judges-to-speak-truth-demands-courage-to-defy-political-pressure-justice-shah' target='_blank'><strong>Responsibility of SC judges to speak truth demands courage to defy political pressure: Justice Shah</strong></a>
            <p><p>Supreme Court (SC) Senior Puisne Judge Mansoor Ali Shah has said that SC justices have a responsibility to “speak truth to power, guided by the Constitution as their unwavering normative anchor”, in an interview seen by <em>Dawn.com</em> on Monday.</p>
<p>Shah has previously expressed that the judiciary needs to stand against influence or pressure from the executive. In November 2024, he said, “The independence of the judiciary is the cornerstone of justice, and its true test lies in a judge’s ability to stand firm under authoritarian regimes.”</p>
<p>Speaking exclusively to law magazine <em><a class="link--external" href="https://the-legal.org/the-legal-international-13th-issue-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Legal</a></em>, Shah said that the role of SC justices must be understood as that of protectors of the Constitution and fundamental rights rather than as policymakers.</p>
<p>“Judges must balance respect for legislative intent with a commitment to constitutional principles, ensuring that the judiciary acts as an impartial arbiter rather than a policymaker,” he said in response to a question about the role of SC judges amid a shifting legal landscape.</p>
<p>“Their role demands not only legal expertise but also wisdom, courage, and humility, as their decisions profoundly impact individuals and society at large,” he added.</p>
<p>“At the heart of this role lies a deeper philosophical imperative: judges must speak truth to power, guided by the Constitution as their unwavering normative anchor.”</p>
<p>Justice Shah noted that this responsibility “requires not compromise but courage to defy political pressures, resist majoritarian impulses, and stand firm in the face of injustice”.</p>
<p>“Let future jurists not be defined by fear or fatigue, but by purpose. Let them carry forward a judiciary that is not complicit in silence, but committed to struggle. The Constitution doesn’t just need protection it needs protectors,” he emphasised.</p>
<p>Previously, Shah <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878549">termed</a> the passing of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866452/26th-constitutional-amendment-awaits-presidential-assent-after-sailing-through-na-in-late-night-session">26th Constitutional Amendment</a> “one of its (the judiciary’s) weakest moments in our history”, expressing concern that executive overreach was interfering in judicial affairs and processes.</p>
<p>In a letter to SC Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail written in December, Shah wrote, “This unprecedented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1877116">shift</a> in the composition of the JCP (Judicial Commission of Pakistan) poses grave risks, including the potential for political appointments and the packing of courts with judges lacking an ideological commitment to the rule of law.”</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909718">landmark decision</a> in May, the SC allowed civilians accused in the May 9, 2023 riots — triggered by the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan — to be tried in military courts, overturning an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783065/may-9-riots-sc-declares-military-trials-of-civilians-null-and-void">earlier ruling</a> that declared military trials of civilians null and void.</p>
<p>However, the decision was not unanimous — the two dissenting judges, Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Naeem Akhtar Afghan — declared military court convictions “without jurisdiction” and unconstitutional. Rights groups and leaders of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) have likewise decried the ruling, citing concerns over due process.</p>
<p>The legal fraternity weighed in too, warning that the judgment threatened the right to a fair trial and chipped away at civilian justice system.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915020/' target='_blank'><strong>Man convicted for desecrating Holy Quran outside London’s Turkish consulate</strong></a>
            <p><p>A man who desecrated a copy of the Holy Quran outside the Turkish consulate in London was found guilty on Monday of committing a religiously aggravated public order offence, in a verdict critics said effectively reinstated an abolished blasphemy law.</p>
<p>Hamit Coskun, 50, was fined 240 pounds ($325) at London’s Westminster Magistrates’ Court after being convicted of being disorderly by shouting “F*** Islam” as he held aloft the burning book near the consulate in central London in February.</p>
<p>The lawyer for Coskun, whose father was Kurdish and his mother Armenian and who lived in central England, had argued that the prosecution amounted to an attempt to bring back a blasphemy law that was abolished in England in 2008.</p>
<p>Coskun had denied the charge and said on social media he was carrying out a protest against the Turkish government. While he was holding the book aloft, he was attacked by a man with a knife who kicked and spat at him.</p>
<p>“Burning a religious book, although offensive, to some is not necessarily disorderly,” said Judge John McGarva.</p>
<p>“What made his conduct disorderly was the timing and location of the conduct and that all this was accompanied by abusive language. There was no need for him to use the ‘F word’ and direct it towards Islam.”</p>
<p>He was motivated by “hostility towards members of a religious group, namely followers of Islam”, McGarva said.</p>
<p>“Your actions in burning the Quran where you did were highly provocative, and your actions were accompanied by bad language in some cases directed toward the religion and were motivated at least in part by hatred of followers of the religion,” said the judge.</p>
<p>State prosecutors insisted Coskun was not being prosecuted for burning the book.</p>
<p>“He is being prosecuted for his disorderly behaviour in public,” said Philip McGhee, for the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>
<p>The National Secular Society (NSS), which helped pay his legal fees, said the prosecution was “a significant blow to freedom of expression”, a sentiment echoed by the main opposition Conservative Party.</p>
<p>“Britain has no blasphemy laws. Yet this verdict creates one de facto,” the party <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/Conservatives/status/1929558585349951809?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on X.</p>
<p>“Parliament never voted for it. The British people do not want it. This decision is wrong.”</p>

            <p><p>Former star cricketer Shoaib Akhtar received a defamation notice of Rs1 billion from sports journalist and former Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official Nauman Niaz on Monday, reigniting yet another feud between the two personalities.</p>
<p>The legal notice dated May 29, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, claimed that the ex-pacer made “baseless” and “unethical” comments regarding Niaz.</p>
<p>On May 25, Akhtar appeared on a show on a private news channel where he said that Niaz “used to carry our bags” and “he was kept for that purpose”, the notice stated.</p>
<p>“Your [Akhtar’s] comment/remark was not only factually incorrect, it was an assault on memory and dignity,” it said.</p>
<p>The notice read that Akhtar’s statement employed “foul and defamatory language” against Niaz, with the “sole intention of destroying the reputation acquired by him [Niaz] through hard work”.</p>
<p>“That the false statements and the representations made by you [Akhtar] … have injured the reputation of our client [Niaz], lowered him in the estimation of others, reduced him to ridicule, unjust criticism, dislike and contempt …”</p>
<p>“It is expected that our client will suffer severe financial and reputational loss and harm as a result of your actions,” it added.</p>
<p>The notice asked Akhtar to issue an apology and retraction within 14 days, otherwise, he will face legal proceedings under Defamation Ordinance 2002 with damages amounting to Rs1bn.</p>
<p>In a post on X, the former “Rawalpindi Express” <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/shoaib100mph/status/1929503021811060825" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> that he received a “legally defective, unfounded, ego-satisfying and utterly frivolous” defamation notice from Niaz, saying that he has contacted a lawyer “to draft and send a befitting reply in this regard”.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The pair have engaged in similar feuds in the past.</p>
<p>In 2021, Niaz <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1656128">tendered</a> an “unconditional apology” for his misconduct with Akhtar in a live TV show a week ago, prompting the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1654347">resignation</a> of the former star pacer from the channel.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>They were part of a panel for a <em>PTV</em> Sports programme, where Akhtar credited the Pakistan Super League’s Lahore Qalandars franchise for discovering Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf.</p>
<p>Niaz took issue with Akhtar’s comments and said: “You are being a little rude so I don’t want to say this but if you’re being over-smart then you can go. I am saying this on air.”</p>
<p>Once the show resumed after a break, Akhtar apologised to the guests on the panel and announced his resignation from <em>PTV</em>, saying that he could not continue with the programme because of “how I was treated on national television”.</p>
<p>Niaz later confessed to his “mistake” and said that the reaction to his outburst was justified. He added, “I had no right. To err is human and for that, I apologise. Not only once, but a million times. Shoaib has been a rock star. Whatever happened on camera was unbecoming.”</p></p>
