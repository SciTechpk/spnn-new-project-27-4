            <p><p>Pakistan has received the second tranche of special drawing rights (SDR) worth $1.023 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme, the central bank said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The amount will be reflected in its foreign exchange reserves for the week ending on May 16, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said in a post on X. It would raise the reserves to $11.355bn.</p>

<p>Last week, the IMF had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">approved</a> the immediate disbursement of about $1bn to Pakistan under the ongoing EFF and allowed an additional arrangement for the $1.4bn Resilience and Sus­tainability Facility (RSF).</p>
<p>In a statement issued last Friday, the IMF had said its Executive Board completed the first review of Pakistan’s economic reform programme supported by the EFF arrangement.</p>
<p>“This decision allows for an immediate disbursement of around $1bn (SDR 760 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to about $2.1bn (SDR 1.52bn). In addition, the IMF Executive Board approved the authorities’ request for an arrangement under the RSF, with access of about $1.4bn (SDR 1bn),” it said.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>It noted that Pakistan’s policy efforts under the EFF had already delivered “significant progress” in stabilising the economy and rebuilding confidence, amidst a challenging global environment.</p>
<p>“Fiscal performance has been strong, with a primary surplus of two per cent of gross domestic product achieved in the first half of FY25, keeping Pakistan on track to meet the end-FY25 target of 2.1pc of GDP.</p>
<p>“Inflation fell to a historic low of 0.3pc in April, and progress on disinflation and steadier domestic and external conditions, have allowed the State Bank of Pakistan to cut the policy rate by a total of 1100 bps since June 2025. Gross reserves stood at $10.3bn at end-April, up from $9.4bn in August 2024, and are projected to reach $13.9bn by end-June 2025 and continue to be rebuilt over the medium term.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it said the RSF would support the authorities’ efforts to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and build economic and climate resilience.</p>
<p>A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) had said PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction over the approval and “the failure of India’s high-handed tactics” against Pakistan.</p>
<p>“The country’s economic situation has improved and the country is moving towards development. India is plotting a conspiracy to divert attention from our country’s development through unilateral aggression.</p>
<p>“International institutions have responsibly rejected India’s false propaganda. Indian attempts to sabotage the IMF programme have failed,” it quoted the prime minister as saying.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910971/trump-meets-syrian-president-says-he-is-looking-into-normalising-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Trump meets Syrian president, says he is looking into normalising ties</strong></a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump met with Syria’s president in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, after a surprise US announcement it would lift all sanctions on the Islamist-led government, and said Washington was exploring the possibility of normalising ties with Damascus.</p>
<p>He made the comments during a summit between the US and Gulf Arab countries. Trump met Syria’s Ahmed al-Sharaa before the summit. Photos posted on Saudi state television showed them shaking hands in the presence of Saudi Arabia’s crown prince.</p>
<p>Trump also urged Sharaa to normalise ties with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910555">Israel</a>, a White House spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Despite concerns within sectors of his administration over Syria’s leaders’ former ties to Al Qaeda, Trump said on Tuesday during a speech in Riyadh he would lift sanctions on Syria in a major policy shift.</p>
<p>Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan joined Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MbS, virtually in the meeting, <em>Anadolu News Agency</em> reported.</p>
<p>MbS told the summit Saudi Arabia commends Trumps decision to lift sanctions on Syria.</p>
<p>The lifting of sanctions came despite deep Israeli suspicion of Sharaa’s administration, worries initially shared by some US officials. Israeli officials have continued to describe Sharaa as a jihadist, though he severed ties with al Qaeda in 2016. <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908118">Israel’s government</a> did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>The decision is a major boost for Sharaa, who has been struggling to bring the country under the control of the Damascus government after toppling former President Bashar al-Assad in December.</p>
<p>The challenges were laid bare in March when Assad loyalists attacked government forces, prompting revenge attacks in which Islamist gunmen killed hundreds of civilians from the Alawite minority, drawing strong US condemnation.</p>

<p>Trump is on a four-day visit to the oil-rich Gulf states that includes stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Trump’s first day of a four-day swing through the Gulf region was marked by lavish ceremony and business deals, including a <a class="link--external" href="https://-600bn-saudi-investment-pledge" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$600 billion commitment</a> from Saudi Arabia to invest in the US and $142 billion in US arms sales to the kingdom.</p>
<p>Later today, Trump will fly to the Qatari capital Doha, where he will participate in a state visit with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and other officials. Qatar, a key US ally, is expected to announce hundreds of billions of dollars in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910749/trump-starts-gulf-visit-seeking-big-economic-deals">investments</a> in the US.</p>
<p>US ally Israel has opposed sanctions relief for Syria, but Trump on Tuesday said that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who are both close to the US president, encouraged him to make the move.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#former-al-qaeda-commander" id="former-al-qaeda-commander" title="Permalink"></a>Former Al Qaeda commander</h2>
<p>Sharaa was for years the leader of al Qaeda’s official wing in the Syrian conflict. He first joined the group in Iraq, where he spent five years in a US prison. The United States removed a $10 million bounty on Sharaa’s head in December.</p>
<p>His interactions with Sharaa, who led rebel forces that toppled former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December, will be closely watched as observers gauge how serious Washington is about resetting its relationship with Damascus.</p>
<p>Sharaa renounced ties to Al Qaeda in 2016.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910984/pakistan-pulled-off-a-macroeconomic-miracle-report' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan pulled off a ‘macroeconomic miracle’: report</strong></a>
            <p><p>Pakistan’s market has captured the attention of global investors amid its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910847/nuclear-war-wasnt-an-option-dar">heightened tensions</a> with India, US publication <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/pakistan-economy-turnaround-257d44e3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Barron’s</a></em> reports.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, the country has seen a “macroeconomic miracle”. While <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895622">inflation</a> was down from 40 per cent annually to near zero, Eurobonds maturing in 2031 rose from 40 cents on the dollar to 80 cents. The KSE-100 index has also tripled.</p>
<p>The government reached a “stabilisation agreement” with the International Monetary Fund last September with the lender <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860850">approving</a> a $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Over $2bn has already been disbursed.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is a good story,” Genna Lozovsky, a chief investment officer at Sandglass Capital Management, was quoted by <em>Barron’s</em> as saying. “So good it’s not risky enough for us anymore.”’</p>
<p>The media outlet further stated that the recent conflict with India “won’t likely knock Pakistan’s recovery off course” but the “country’s own shaky underpinnings might”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan has been known for boom-and-bust cycles throughout its history,” according to Khaled Sellami, an emerging markets sovereign debt manager at Barings. He said there are some signs that this time could be different.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s period of stabilisation started with a near-default experience in 2022-23 following Imran Khan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1716303">ouster</a>. Alison Graham, chief investment officer at frontier markets specialist Voltan Capital Management stated, “Everyone thought Pakistan would default along with Sri Lanka in 2023.”</p>
<p>Instead, the State Bank of Pakistan hiked interest rates from 10pc to 22pc, putting the country into recession but wringing out inflation.</p>
<p>Last year, the country gained loans from sovereign creditors China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, while the GDP growth bounced back to 2.5pc. “The current account balance is positive, and they have a primary fiscal surplus [excluding interest payments],” Sellami said. “That’s something we haven’t seen in many years.”</p>
<p>Pakistan remains in “relative stagnation” with cotton, apparel and cereals accounting for two-thirds of exports compared to India’s development in advanced industries like IT and pharmaceuticals. Sellami said, “It is belatedly moving into IT outsourcing, foreign sales rising from near nothing to $3bn annually over the past few years,” adding that India was in the $200bn range.</p>
<p>Without a value-added ladder to climb, fate and free-spending election cycles may continue driving Pakistan’s boom and bust, according to Graham. She continued, “Pakistan remains extremely fragile to external shocks.</p>
<p>“When there is a rally, you need to be in early.”</p>
<p>Sellami was more optimistic, being “constructive” on Pakistani Eurobonds. He said that the country’s foreign friends, China and the Gulf states, made it clear in 2022 that they were not writing blank cheques. “The government knows if they deviate from the tightrope they are walking, they won’t have external finance,” he added.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910505">gained</a> a record 9pc — the restored calm in the market mirroring that in the region after the recent Pakistan-India ceasefire that boosted investor mood. “The market has reacted jubilantly to the ceasefire announcement after Pakistan established effective deterrence against India,” noted Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities.</p></p>
