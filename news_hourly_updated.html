                <h2>Pakistani pilgrims barred from by-road travel to Iran, Iraq this Arbaeen: interior minister</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistani pilgrims will be barred from travelling by road to Iran and Iraq for the Arbaeen pilgrimage due to public and national security, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Pilgrims <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855955">visit Iraq</a> to attend the chehlum commemoration ‚Äî also known as Arbaeen (40 in Arabic) ‚Äî to mark the 40th day of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922472/ashura-processions-in-major-cities-of-country-conclude-peacefully">mourning</a> for the martyrdom of Imam Husain, the grandson of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter extensive consultations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [the] Balochistan Government, and security agencies, it has been decided that <em>zaireen</em> (pilgrims) will not be allowed to travel to Iraq and Iran by road for Arbaeen this year,‚Äù Naqvi said on X.</p>
<p>He added that the ‚Äúdifficult decision was taken in the interest of public safety and national security‚Äù.</p>
<p>However, the pilgrims will be able to travel by air, the minister noted.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Naqvi stressed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed authorities to ‚Äúarrange maximum flights to facilitate their pilgrimage in the coming days‚Äù.</p>
<p>Naqvi‚Äôs statement came after he met with PM Shehbaz earlier today to brief him on the new policy for pilgrims, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> (<em>APP</em>) <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/interior-minister-calls-on-pm-briefs-over-zaireens-new-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The premier also directed Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif to arrange ‚Äúspecial flights‚Äù for the pilgrims, <em>APP</em> stated, citing a press release from the PM Office.</p>
<p>Iraq‚Äôs Karbala, where Imam Hussein and his brother Abbas are buried in two enormous mausoleums facing each other, is the centre of the Shia world during this time. More than <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854804/millions-of-pilgrims-rally-for-arbaeen">21 million</a> devotees took part in the pilgrimage last year.</p>
<p>Pakistan is set to introduce a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922178">new travel management system</a> from Jan 1, 2026, under which pilgrims will only be allowed to undertake the journey under registered organisers.</p>

<p>Under the new measures, the traditional Salar System will be abolished and replaced with a Zaireen Group Organisers model. Alongside weekly flights to Iran being increased from six to 15, 107 additional special flights will also be arranged for pilgrims heading to Iraq.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousuf <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925358/religious-affairs-minister-retracts-40000-missing-pilgrims-remark">retracted</a> his statement that 40,000 pilgrims had not returned from trips to Iran and Iraq. He clarified that a ‚Äúmisunderstanding‚Äù of outdated paper records that had not yet been fully digitised resulted in the statement.</p>

                <h2>Trump says EU and US have ‚Äòreached a deal‚Äô on trade</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he had reached a trade agreement with European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have reached a deal. It‚Äôs a good deal for everybody,‚Äù Trump told reporters after talks with von der Leyen at his golf resort in Turnberry, Scotland. The EU chief also hailed it as a ‚Äúgood deal‚Äù.</p>
<p>Earlier, the US president told reporters he felt the two sides had a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926648/trump-sees-50pc-chance-of-trade-deal-with-eu">50-50 chance</a> of a deal with the European Union. The bloc faces an across-the-board US levy of 30 per cent unless it strikes a trade pact by August 1.</p>
<p>Washington warned on Sunday there would be ‚Äúno extensions‚Äù and Trump confirmed ‚Äúthe deals all start on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926398#:~:text=A%20further%20escalation%20in%20trade%20tensions%20could%20deliver%20a%20fresh%20blow%20to%20the%20eurozone%20economy,%20with%20Trump%20having%20set%20a%20deadline%20of%20August%201%20to%20impose%20a%20basic%20tariff%20rate%20of%2030pc%20on%20the%20European%20Union.">August 1</a>‚Äù.</p>
<p>Von der Leyen‚Äôs European Commission, negotiating on behalf of EU countries, is pushing hard for a deal to salvage a trading relationship worth an annual $1.9 trillion in goods and services.</p>
<p>The EU chief said at the start of the talks at Trump‚Äôs luxury golf resort in southwestern Turnberry that if they reached a deal, ‚ÄúI think it would be the biggest deal each of us has ever‚Äù made.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>According to an EU diplomat briefed ahead of the meeting, the contours of a deal are in place, but key issues still need settling.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA political deal is on the table ‚Äî but it needs the sign-off from Trump, who wants to negotiate this down to the very last moment,‚Äù the diplomat told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>The proposal, they said, involves a baseline levy of around 15pc on EU exports to the United States ‚Äî the level secured by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926063">Japan</a> ‚Äî with carve-outs for critical sectors including aircraft and spirits, though not for wine.</p>
<p>Any deal will also need to be approved by EU member states, whose ambassadors, on a visit to Greenland, were updated by the commission Sunday morning. They would meet again after any accord.</p>
<p>According to the EU diplomat, the 27 countries broadly endorsed the deal as envisaged ‚Äî while recalling their negotiating red lines.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#baseline-15pc" id="baseline-15pc" title="Permalink"></a>Baseline 15pc</h2>
<p>The Trump-von der Leyen meeting was taking place in the president‚Äôs luxury golf resort in Turnberry on Scotland‚Äôs southwestern coast. The 79-year-old Trump said on Friday he hoped to strike ‚Äúthe biggest deal of them all‚Äù with the EU.</p>
<p>The EU is focused on getting a deal to avoid sweeping tariffs that would further harm its sluggish economy ‚Äî while holding out retaliation as a last resort.</p>
<p>Under the proposal described to <em>AFP</em>, the EU would commit to ramping up purchases of US liquefied natural gas, along with other investment pledges.
Pharmaceuticals, a key export for Ireland, would also face a 15pc levy, as would semiconductors.</p>
<p>The EU also appears to have secured a compromise on steel that could allow a certain quota into the United States before tariffs would apply, the diplomat said.
But Trump said on Sunday that trade tariffs with the EU would not be lower than 15pc.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#auto-sector" id="auto-sector" title="Permalink"></a>Auto sector</h2>
<p>The EU has been hit by multiple waves of tariffs since Trump reclaimed the White House. It is currently subject to a 25pc levy on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900637">cars</a>, 50pc on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914658">steel and aluminium</a>, and an across-the-board <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810">tariff</a> of 10pc, which Washington threatens to hike to 30pc in a no-deal scenario.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>It was unclear how the proposed deal would impact tariff levels on the auto industry, crucial for France and Germany. Carmakers are already reeling from the levies imposed so far.</p>
<p>While 15pc would be much higher than pre-existing US tariffs on European goods, which average around 4.8pc, it would mirror the status quo, with companies currently facing an additional flat rate of 10pc.</p>
<p>Should talks fail, EU states have greenlit counter tariffs on $109 billion (‚Ç¨93bn) of US goods, including aircraft and cars, to take effect in stages from August 7.</p>
<p>Brussels is also drawing up a list of US services to potentially target.</p>
<p>Beyond that, countries including France say Brussels should not be afraid to deploy a so-called trade ‚Äúbazooka‚Äù ‚Äî EU legislation designed to counter coercion that can involve restricting access to its market and public contracts.</p>
<p>But such a step would mark a major escalation with Washington.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#ratings-dropping" id="ratings-dropping" title="Permalink"></a>Ratings dropping</h2>
<p>Trump has embarked on a campaign to reshape US trade with the world, and has vowed to hit dozens of countries with punitive tariffs if they do not reach a pact with Washington by August 1.</p>
<p>US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday the August 1 deadline was firm and there will be ‚Äúno extensions, no more grace periods.‚Äù</p>
<p>Polls suggest, however, that the American public is unconvinced by the White House strategy, with a recent <a class="link--external" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/692879/independents-drive-trump-approval-second-term-low.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gallup survey</a> showing his approval rating at 37pc, down 10 points from January.</p>
<p>Having promised ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922611/trump-dispatches-letters-outlining-new-tariffs-on-foreign-nations#:~:text=While%20the%20Trump%20administration%20has%20signalled%20hopes%20of%20striking%20dozens%20of%20deals%20by%20early%20July%20%E2%80%94%20at%20one%20point%20boasting%20of%20%E2%80%9C90%20deals%20in%2090%20days%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%94%20there%20have%20been%20limited%20results%20so%20far.">90 deals in 90 days</a>,‚Äù Trump‚Äôs administration has so far unveiled five, including with Britain, Japan and the Philippines.</p></p>
