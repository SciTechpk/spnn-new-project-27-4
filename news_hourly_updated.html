                <h2>Trump says he thinks 5 jets were shot down in India-Pakistan conflict</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Friday that up to five jets were shot down during the recent India-Pakistan conflict that began after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in India-occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam, with the situation calming after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> in May.</p>
<p>Trump, who made his remarks at a dinner with some Republican US lawmakers at the White House, did not specify which side‚Äôs jets he was referring to.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSomething I‚Äôm very proud of [is that] we stopped a lot of wars. A lot of wars. And these were serious, serious wars; would have been going on,‚Äù Trump said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou had India-Pakistan that was going, and in fact, planes were being shot out of the air. Five, five, four or five, but I think five jets were shot down actually,‚Äù Trump said while talking about the India-Pakistan hostilities, without elaborating or providing further detail.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was getting worse and worse, wasn‚Äôt it? [‚Ä¶] These are two serious nuclear countries and they were hitting each other. It seems like a new form of warfare; you saw it recently, when you looked at what we did in Iran when we knocked out their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920005">nuclear capability</a>, totally knocked out,‚Äù he said, referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">US strikes</a> on Iran‚Äôs three nuclear sites.</p>

<p>Pakistan claimed it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downed five</a> Indian planes in air-to-air combat, later stating that figure <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">as six</a>. India‚Äôs highest-ranking general said in late May that India switched tactics after suffering losses in the air on the first day of hostilities and established an advantage before a ceasefire was announced three days later.</p>
<p>As New Delhi launched deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a>, which Islamabad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">denied</a>, the Pakistan Air Force downed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">five</a> Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">strikes</a> on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>India also <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/india-shot-down-high-tech-jets-of-pakistan-confirms-air-marshal-bharti-938212" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed</a> it downed ‚Äúa few planes‚Äù of Pakistan. Islamabad has denied any losses of planes but acknowledged that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186#:~:text=The%20strikes%20targeted%20Nur%20Khan%20air%20base">three air bases</a> suffered hits, while saying that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910381">26 Indian targets</a> were hit.</p>
<p>Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914608">repeatedly</a> said he prevented a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">nuclear war</a>‚Äù between Pakistan and India after Washington held talks with both sides, even <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920139">crediting</a> Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir for helping in it. India has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921534">differed</a> with Trump‚Äôs claims that it resulted from his intervention and his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911719">threats</a> to sever trade talks.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Most recently, on July 7, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923026/trumps-claim-on-averting-india-pakistan-war-gains-new-life">doubled down</a> on its narrative of Trump playing a central role in defusing tensions, despite India claiming otherwise.</p>
<p>Asked about Indian officials‚Äô repeated <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912153">denials</a> of Trump‚Äôs role, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce avoided taking a position. ‚ÄúSo many comments speak for themselves,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>Pressed further, Bruce added, half in jest: ‚ÄúEveryone will have an opinion. That‚Äôs an opinion. Some opinions are wrong. Mine rarely are, but other people‚Äôs opinions can be wrong.‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs statements stand in contrast to India‚Äôs official position, which maintains that New Delhi acted independently during the May crisis and that Washington did not mediate. Trump‚Äôs remarks support Pakistan‚Äôs view that quiet US diplomacy ‚Äî and direct intervention from the White House ‚Äî helped calm tensions.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs position has been that New Delhi and Islamabad must resolve their problems directly and with no outside involvement.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>India is an increasingly important US partner in Washington‚Äôs effort to counter China‚Äôs influence in Asia, while Pakistan is a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524">strong partner</a> in counterterrorism.</p>
<p>The April attack in Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">killed 26 men</a> and sparked heavy fighting between the nuclear-armed Asian neighbours in the latest escalation of a decades-old rivalry.</p>
<p>New Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">strongly denied</a> responsibility while calling for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral</a> investigation. Washington condemned the attack but did not directly blame Islamabad.</p></p>

<p>LAHORE / RAWALPINDI: After ten more people lost their lives across Punjab on Friday, it emerged that more than half of all <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924989">rain-related</a> deaths in the province have occurred in just the last 48 hours.</p>
<p>So far, 123 people have been killed and 462 injured since June 25 as the province received record rainfall, triggering urban flooding which inundated residential areas, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said.</p>
<p>Of these, 71 deaths were reported in the past two days alone, and there will be no respite from torrential rain as the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued an alert for more downpours from July 20.</p>
<p>Another PDMA alert has warned of a high-level flood in the River Indus at Kalabagh and Chashma over the next 24 hours, with authorities being asked to take precautionary measures.</p>

<p>Friday‚Äôs death toll includes three casualties each in Lahore and Chiniot, two in Okara and one each in Chakwal and Sargodha, according to data released by Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad.</p>
<p>In Chakwal, bodies of two persons who were swept away in torrents were recovered on Friday, while another died after being crushed under a roof which caved due to intense downpour, according to Rescue 1122.</p>
<p>The district was one of the worst-affected areas as it received record rainfall over the last three days. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif is expected to visit the district today.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, scores of villages in Chakwal were still plunged into darkness as the power supply could not be restored even after three days.</p>
<p>According to Iesco, 99 high tension and 48 low tension poles and 65 transformers were damaged due to intense rainfall.</p>
<p>Iesco Superintendent Engineer Waheed Ahmed Abbasi told Dawn it would take at least 48 hours to fully restore the power supply.</p>
