                <h2>JCP nominates chief justices of high courts</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) on Tuesday appointed the chief justices to the four high courts, a statement issued by the Supreme Court said.</p>
<p>Per the statement, the JCP held four consecutive meetings to make a decision related to the appointments and, by a majority of its total membership in each meeting, opted to allow the acting chief justices to continue serving the top roles.</p>
<p>Letters were subsequently issued to the prime minister‚Äôs principal secretary, informing the government about the nominations and requesting the forwarding of the same to the president for their appointment.</p>
<p>The letters said that Justice Sarfraz Dogar was nominated as the new chief justice of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), Justice Rozi Khan Barrech as the chief justice for the Balochistan High Court (BHC), Justice Syed Muhammad Attique Shah for the Peshawar High Court, and Justice Junaid Ghaffar for the Sindh High Court (SHC).</p>
<p>Pre¬≠sident Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921132/president-names-justice-dogar-top-judge-at-ihc">already formally decla¬≠red</a> Justice Dogar the ‚Äúsenior-most judge‚Äù of the IHC, following the issuance of a revised seniority list by the Ministry of Law and Justice.</p>
<p>The development followed a ruling by the Supreme Court on June 19, upholding the constitutionality of transferring three judges from other provincial high courts and referring the matter of seniority determination to the president.</p>
<p>On Friday, five IHC judges had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920890">challenged</a> the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision to uphold the transfer of three judges ‚Äî Justice Dogar from the LHC, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro from the SHC, and Justice Muhammad Asif from the BHC.</p>
<p>President Zardari had also declared that the status of the transfer of all three judges would be permanent.</p></p>

                <h2>Teenager dead, 2 terrorists killed as govt offices attacked in Mastung</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Security forces eliminated two ‚ÄúIndia-backed‚Äù terrorists after an attack on government offices in Balochistan‚Äôs Mastung district that killed a teenager and injured seven others on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Terrorists in Balochistan, previously engaged in a low-level insurgency, have recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896269">intensified</a> their attacks. The banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) emerged as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1882568">key perpetrator</a> of terrorist violence in Pakistan in 2024.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTwo terrorists were killed while another three were injured in an intense fire exchange between the security forces and the terrorists,‚Äù Balochistan spokesperson Shahid Rind said in a statement.</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Fitna al Hindustan</em> attacked the tehsil office, government offices and a bank. A 16-year-old boy died while seven individuals were injured by the terrorists‚Äô firing,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>The term ‚Äú<em><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357#:~:text=state%2Dsponsored%20proxies%20of%20India%20(Fitna%20al%20Hindustan)">Fitna al Hindu¬≠stan</a></em>‚Äù is a new phrase coined by Pakistan‚Äôs military, aimed at framing India‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">alleged role</a> in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Frontier Constabulary, Counter-Terrorism Department and Levies immediately cordoned off the area, crushing the terrorists,‚Äù Rind asserted. An intense fire exchange occurred after the security forces ‚Äúencircled‚Äù the terrorists, he added.</p>
<p>Mastung Deputy Commissioner Athar Abbas Raja also confirmed the attack to <em>Dawn.com</em>, adding, ‚ÄúHeavy firing and blasts [were] heard in the small town at around 11am.‚Äù</p>

<p>Action against the perpetrators was ongoing while an ‚Äúorganised‚Äù clearance operation was also underway at the site of the incident, according to the government statement.</p>
<p>It added that search efforts to trace the facilitators of the attackers had also been initiated. The operation to ‚Äúprotect citizens and arrest terrorists‚Äù was based on intelligence input, Rind said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe immediate response by the security forces was effective in preventing further loss of lives,‚Äù the government official highlighted.</p>

<p>Militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in the country last month, according to data <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914847/militant-attacks-increased-to-85-in-may-pakistan-institute-for-conflict-and-security-studies">released</a> by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, which recorded 85 attacks in May compared to 81 in April.</p>
<p>In one of the recent major attacks, a school bus in Balochistan‚Äôs Khuzdar was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357">targeted</a> on May 21, leaving eight children among <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913363">10 dead</a>.</p>
<p>In April, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904388">three policemen</a> were martyred and at least 16 others were injured as a blast targeted a vehicle of the Balochistan Constabulary on Mastung‚Äôs Dasht Road.</p>
<p>Last month, security forces killed two ‚ÄúIndian sponsored terrorists‚Äù in Balochistan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921014/2-terrorists-killed-2-arrested-in-balochistans-duki-district-ispr">Duki district</a> and another two in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915835">Kachhi</a>.</p>

<p>On June 18, a man and a woman were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918035">shot dead</a> when unknown gunmen opened fire at them in the Surgaz area, a locality on the outskirts of Mastung town. Another woman and a child sitting in the car were injured in the firing.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>The country ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>
