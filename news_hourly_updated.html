                <h2>Security forces kill 14 more ‚ÄòIndian-sponsored‚Äô terrorists along Pak-Afghan border in Zhob: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Security forces have killed 14 more terrorists attempting to infiltrate across the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Balochistan‚Äôs Zhob district, the military‚Äôs media wing said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The development adds to 33 terrorists, belonging to the ‚ÄúIndian proxy <em>Fitna al Khawarij</em>‚Äù, who were eliminated on the night of August 7 and 8.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn [the] night 8/9 August 2025, a deliberate sanitisation operation was conducted in surrounding areas of Sambaza along Pakistan-Afghanistan border,‚Äù the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7384" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring the conduct of the operation, 14 more Indian-sponsored <em>khwarij</em> were hunted down and successfully neutralised. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed <em>khwarij</em>,‚Äù the ISPR noted.</p>

<p>This followed the ‚Äúsuccessful engagements by the security forces in general area Sambaza, Zhob District on 7-8 August 2025, during which 33 <em>khwarij</em> were sent to hell‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe number of <em>khwarij</em> killed in two days anti-infiltration operation has risen to 47,‚Äù the military highlighted.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna">Fitna al Khawarij</a></em> is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe security forces remain committed to secure the nation‚Äôs frontiers and thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Pakistan,‚Äù the statement asserted.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to the security forces and praised their professionalism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe nation looks with admiration at the successes of the security forces against the terrorists of the Indian conspiracy. The security forces have brought the Indian-sponsored terrorists involved in spreading chaos in Balochistan to an exemplary end,‚Äù he said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MOIofficialGoP/status/1954104835948646886" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X.</p>
<p>He added, ‚ÄúSecurity forces, through timely operations, sent 47 terrorists of <em>Fitna al-Hindu¬≠stan</em> to hell in two days. By taking swift action, they foiled a sinister conspiracy to sabotage peace in Balochistan.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>Modi‚Äôs efforts to woo US, China hit stalemate after frictions with Trump, Xi: report</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs efforts to engage with the US and China have reached a stalemate, which exposes limitations to India‚Äôs powers on the global stage, <em>The New York Times</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/world/asia/modi-india-trump-china-tariffs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Modi‚Äôs first attempt came in 2014 through a high-level engagement with China came. The Indian premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1132526">rolled out</a> the red carpet for China‚Äôs President Xi Jinping in his home town, organising an intimate riverside dinner in Ahmedabad.</p>
<p>The meeting at the time <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1132621#:~:text=Border%20issues%20are%20on%20the%20agenda%20for%20the%20visit%20of%20Mr%20Xi%2C%20who%20is%20accompanied%20by%20his%20wife%20Peng%20Liyuan.%20But%20both%20sides%20say%20they%20want%20to%20focus%20on%20economic%20cooperation%2C%20with%20India%20seeking%20Chinese%20funding%20for%20an%20overhaul%20of%20its%20dilapidated%20railways%20and%20cooperation%20in%20nuclear%20energy.">focused</a> on economic cooperation, with India seeking Chinese funding for an overhaul of its dilapidated railways and cooperation in nuclear energy.</p>
<p>However, the talks were overshadowed by a stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops along their shared border. ‚ÄúThe flare-up in 2014 was the first of several acts of aggression that would ultimately leave Mr Modi embarrassed, his economy squeezed by the need to keep tens of thousands of Indian troops on a war footing high in the Himalayas for several years,‚Äù <em>The New York Times</em> said.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Modi steered towards the US direction. ‚ÄúMr Modi developed such a bonhomie with US President Donald Trump in his first term that he broke with protocol to campaign for a second term for him at a stadium-packed event in Houston,‚Äù the outlet said, adding that the increasing alignment grew further after ‚Äúthe Biden administration looked past that partisan play to continue expanding relations with India, a bulwark against China‚Äù.</p>
<p>During a joint session of Congress last year, Modi remarked, ‚ÄúAI stands for ‚ÄòAmerica and India‚Äô‚Äù, the report added.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs relations with the US have seemingly faltered during Trump‚Äôs second term.  Terming the recent trade tensions a ‚Äúvery public humiliation‚Äù of Modi, the outlet said that India was singled out for a whopping 50 per cent tariff, with the US citing India‚Äôs continued imports of Russian oil and calling India‚Äôs economy ‚Äúdead‚Äù.</p>
<p>Trump also ‚Äústirred rancour among Indians‚Äù by giving Pakistan‚Äôs leadership an ‚Äúequal footing‚Äù as he tried to settle the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military conflict</a> between the two nuclear-armed neighbours earlier this year, the outlet said.</p>
<p>In June, Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093">hosted</a> Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir at the White House in the weeks following the military confrontation between India and Pakistan. This <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925661/trumps-renewed-interest-in-pakistan-has-india-recalibrating-china-ties">prompted</a> a private diplomatic protest from India in a warning to Washington about risks to their bilateral ties while New Delhi is recalibrating relations with China as a hedge.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll that has plunged India into a moment of soul-searching, exposing limitations to its power on the world stage despite its gargantuan size and growing economy,‚Äù <em>The New York Times</em> stated. The outlet also highlighted Modi‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929293/indias-modi-unwilling-to-compromise-on-agriculture-as-us-tariff-war-escalates">acknowledgement</a> this week that he might pay a ‚Äúpersonal political price‚Äù for the trade dispute with the US.</p>
<p>Amid heightened tensions with the US, India has made moves indicating ‚Äúincreased activity toward warming ties with Beijing again‚Äù, the outlet said.</p>
<p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun on Friday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929662/china-welcomes-indian-pm-modis-planned-visit-for-sco">welcomed</a> Modi‚Äôs plan to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929105">visit</a> China for the first time in seven years to participate in the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. Last month, Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar made his first <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924167/avoiding-trade-curbs-vital-for-normalisation-of-ties-india-tells-china">visit</a> to Beijing since a deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1564042">2020 border clash</a> between Indian and Chinese troops.</p>
<p>The outlet suggested that relations with China ‚Äúremain strained‚Äù due to border disputes and China‚Äôs support for Pakistan during the recent military escalation, adding: ‚ÄúChina, for its part, has been wary of New Delhi‚Äôs efforts to create a manufacturing alternative to China.‚Äù</p>
<p>It further noted Modi‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929654/modi-has-good-conversation-with-putin">current engagement</a> with Russia, saying, ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs steadfastness as a partner is being talked up by officials in India. Mr Modi‚Äôs national security adviser was in Moscow this week to finalise details of a trip by Mr Putin to New Delhi.‚Äù</p>
<p>India‚Äôs aim to rise as an economic and diplomatic power ‚Äúappears deflated by the sudden uncertainty‚Äù, according to <em>The New York Times.</em></p>
<p>It said, ‚ÄúStuck between two superpowers that have shown no hesitation to put India down in moments of friction, there is a growing sense among Indian officials and experts that the country will have to firmly return to its long-tested doctrine of ‚Äòstrategic autonomy‚Äô.‚Äù</p>
<p>This means that India was ‚Äúon its own‚Äù and must ‚Äúmake do with a patchwork of contradictory and piecemeal ties, and avoid overcommitting to alliances‚Äù.</p>
<p>The outlet quoted Nirupama Rao, a former Indian ambassador to Beijing and Washington, who said that Trump‚Äôs punishing moves had upended ‚Äúthe strategic logic of a very consequential partnership‚Äù that had been carefully nurtured over more than two decades. ‚ÄúThere will be ‚Äòvery pragmatic strategic recalibrations‚Äô by New Delhi to protect its interests,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs growing economy allows its leaders breathing room, but it is still a moment of ‚Äúdeep introspection‚Äù for the country, Rao said, adding: ‚ÄúWe have to draw our lessons from that and really focus on the national priorities and what we need to do to become strong and more influential.‚Äù</p></p>
