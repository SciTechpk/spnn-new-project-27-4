            <p><p>Hindus began a vast month-long pilgrimage in India-occupied Kashmir (IoK) on Thursday, with many of the faithful starting from near the site where a deadly April <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> triggered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">conflict with Pakistan</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, half a million devotees took part in the Amarnath pilgrimage to a sacred ice pillar located in a cave in the forested Himalayan hills above the town of Pahalgam.</p>
<p>India has ramped up security for the event, deploying 45,000 troops with high-tech surveillance tools overseeing the gruelling trek to reach the high-altitude cave, dedicated to the Hindu deity of destruction Shiva.</p>
<p>“We have multi-layered and in-depth security arrangements so that we can make the pilgrimage safe and smooth for the devotees,” said VK Birdi, police chief for the Muslim-majority territory.</p>
<p>Pahalgam is the site where gunmen on April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">killed 26</a> mostly Hindu tourists. New Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan, which strongly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">denied</a> the allegations while calling for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral investigation</a>, triggering a series of tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284/trade-ties-and-flights-off-limits-as-pakistan-retaliates-to-indias-moves">diplomatic measures</a> that escalated into a four-day conflict.</p>
<p>On May 7, Pakistan shot down <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">six Indian jets</a> after they <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">bombed sites</a> across the border, setting off an exchange of attacks between the two countries by fighter jets, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">missiles</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909783/dg-ispr-says-77-indian-drones-have-been-shot-down">drones</a> and artillery that killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910733#:~:text=40%20civilians%20%E2%80%94%20including%20seven%20women%20and%2015%20children%20%E2%80%94%20lost%20their%20lives%20in%20the%20Indian%20aggression">dozens</a> until a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> on May 10.</p>
<p>It was the worst standoff by the nuclear-armed nations since 1999, with more than 70 people killed in missile, drone and artillery fire on both sides.</p>
<p>But pilgrim Muneshwar Das Shashtri, who travelled from Uttar Pradesh state, told <em>AFP</em> that “there is no fear of any kind”.</p>
<p>“Our army is standing guard everywhere. No one can raise a finger towards us,” he said.</p>

<p>At Pahalgam, soldiers have turned a tented base camp into a fortress encircled by razor wire.</p>
<p>Troops in newly deployed armoured cars, or from gun positions behind sandbags, keep a close watch — efforts boosted by facial recognition cameras.</p>
<p>“High-quality surveillance cameras have been installed at all major points along the route,” said Manoj Sinha, the Indian-appointed top administrator for occupied Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>All pilgrims must be registered and travel in guarded vehicle convoys, until they start out to walk.</p>
<p>Camouflaged bunkers have been erected in the forests along the route, where dozens of makeshift kitchens provide free food.</p>
<p>Electronic radio cards pinpoint their location.</p>
<p>Pilgrims can take several days to reach the cave, perched at 3,900 metres high, around 30 kilometres uphill from the last easily motorable track.</p>

<p>“Whatever the attack that was carried out here, I am not afraid. I have come to get a glimpse of baba (the ice formation)” said Ujwal Yadav, aged 29, from India’s Uttar Pradesh state, undertaking his first pilgrimage to the shrine.</p>
<p>“Such are the security arrangements here that no one can be hurt.”</p>
<p>Sinha has said that “public confidence is returning”, but admits that pilgrim registration had dipped by 10 per cent this year.</p>
<p>Once a modest, little-known ritual, attended by only a few thousand mainly local devotees, the pilgrimage has grown since the Kashmiris’ uprising erupted in 1989.</p>
<p>India’s government has since heavily promoted the annual event, which runs until August 9.</p>
<p>Those fighting against India’s occupation of Kashmir have said the pilgrimage is not a target, but have warned they would act if it was used to assert Hindu dominance.</p>
<p>In 2017, suspected militants <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1344449/suspected-terrorists-kill-six-hindu-pilgrims-in-held-kashmir">attacked</a> a pilgrim bus, killing 11 people.</p>
<p>The gunmen who carried out the April 22 killings remain at large, despite the manhunt by security forces in IoK, where India has half a million soldiers permanently deployed.</p>
<p>On June 22, India’s National Investigation Agency claimed two men had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919061">arrested</a> from the Pahalgam area, who they said had allegedly “provided food, shelter and logistical support” to the gunmen.</p>
<p>Indian police have issued wanted notices for three of the gunmen, two of whom they claimed were Pakistani citizens.</p></p>

            <p><p>Liverpool’s Portuguese forward Diogo Jota, 28, died in a fiery car crash near Zamora in northwestern Spain with his brother, Spanish state-owned TV station <em>TVE</em> said on Thursday, citing local firefighters.</p>
<p>Police told <em>Reuters</em> everything pointed to that information being correct, although they could not yet officially confirm the names.</p>
<p>The regional fire department of Castille-Leon, where Zamora is located, said on its website a car crashed shortly after midnight on Thursday and burst into flames, with two men, aged 28 and 26, found dead.</p>
<p>Jota, who got married on June 28, helped Liverpool win the Premier League last season and also won the Football Association Challenge (FA) Cup and League Cup with the Merseyside outfit.</p>
<p>Jota arrived at Anfield from Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2020 and scored 65 goals in 182 appearances for the club in all competitions.</p>
<p>He also made 49 appearances for Portugal, twice winning the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Nations League.</p></p>
