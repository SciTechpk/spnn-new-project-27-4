                <h2>At least 9 dead as floods, landslides continue to ravage GB: officials</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least nine people have died as floods and landslides triggered by heavy rain continue to wreak havoc on Gilgit Baltistan, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as the region experienced cloudburst-induced floods that claimed lives and damaged infrastructure. On Monday, floods triggered by heavy rain <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> through GB‚Äôs Babusar area in Diamer district and Naran, leaving many stranded. Subsequently, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/pmd-issues-glof-alert-for-gb-kp-as-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-from-diamer-amid-floods">issued</a> a landslide alert for the northern areas of the country.</p>
<p>GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq, in a statement, confirmed that nine people have lost their lives in the floods and landslides across the region ‚Äî including two women and two children ‚Äî while the search for people swept away by the flood is still underway.</p>
<p>In his statement, he estimated that the ‚Äúnumber of people swept away by floodwater could be around 12-14.‚Äù On the other hand, more than a dozen people were reported to be injured in the floods.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOver 300 stranded tourists have been rescued so far,‚Äù he said, adding that rescue operations have been challenging as floods and landslides continue to ravage parts of the region.</p>
<p>Detailing the property damage caused by floods and landslides, he stated, ‚ÄúIn total, more than 500 houses have been destroyed due to the floods and about 12 kilometres of roads have been destroyed as well.‚Äù</p>

<p>He went on to say: ‚ÄúA total of 27 bridges and 22 vehicles were also destroyed by the floodwaters across the region, along with countless shops, cattle sheds and logs of timber.‚Äù</p>
<p>Both the Pakistan Army and GB scouts played an active role in the rescue and search operation, he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEfforts are also underway to provide water and electricity to thousands of people who are now deprived of these facilities as a result of damage to the water supply and electricity grids,‚Äù Faraq said in his statement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a search operation was underway to find the body of 17-year-old Arman, who was swept away while crossing a nullah in Gujar Khan on Wednesday, a Rescue 1122 official said on Friday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRescue divers have combed through an area 12 km from the site of the accident without any success‚Äù, District Emergency Officer Rescue 1122 Rawalpindi Sibghatullah said in a statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe heirs of the victim have expressed their satisfaction over the rescue efforts,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>On Thursday, residents of the housing society where the teenager lived blocked Rawalpindi‚Äôs Grand Trunk Road after the rescue teams could not recover the body.</p>
<p>The boy was walking on a small passage when high-speed torrents swept him away in deep waters.</p>
<p>Two of his relatives jumped into the water to rescue him, but they told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the water was moving at high speed and the boy could not be saved.</p></p>

                <h2>FM Dar in Washington to meet US counterpart Rubio, discuss ways to strengthen bilateral ties</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar arrived in Washington, DC on Thursday night, on the second leg of his eight-day visit to the United States, the Foreign Office said in a statement.</p>
<p>Dar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925622">arrived</a> in New York on Monday to attend ‚Äúhigh-level signature events‚Äù of Pakistan‚Äôs United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency, including a conference on Palestine.</p>

<p>He is also scheduled to speak at the US think tank, The Atlantic Council, ‚Äúsharing Pakistan‚Äôs perspective on regional and global issues as well as the future of Pak-US relations.‚Äù</p>

<p>Dar‚Äôs visit comes as Pakistan holds the presidency of the UNSC this month. Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921308">assumed</a> the UNSC presidency for July, marking its first presidency since 2013. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026.</p>
<p>Addressing a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926068">reception</a> hosted by Pakistan‚Äôs Mission in New York on Wednesday, Dar called for an inclusive dialogue and cooperative diplomacy over confrontation amid growing turbulence across the world.</p>
<p>The deputy PM asserted that Pakistan‚Äôs leadership has been guided by ‚Äúthese very principles in both deliberations and concrete actions taken during its tenure‚Äù.</p>
<p>The UNSC unanimously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925923">adopted</a> Pakistan-sponsored <a class="link--external" href="https://press.un.org/en/2025/sc16125.doc.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Resolution 2788</a>, calling for the strengthening of international mechanisms to settle disputes through peaceful means.</p>
<p>Dar also announced Pakistan was seeking a seat at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for the 2026-2028 term, with the Asia-Pacific Group endorsing its candidacy. Pakistan last <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1584934">held</a> the membership from 2020 to 2023.</p>

<p>Chairing the UNSC‚Äôs Quarterly Open Debate on the ‚ÄúSituation in the Middle East including the Palestinian Question‚Äù, Dar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926099">urged</a> the UNSC and the international community to bring about an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, along with unrestricted humanitarian access amid a food crisis in the besieged territory.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is time to give the Palestinian people what they have been denied for too long: justice, freedom, dignity, and a state of their own. That is the path to durable peace and stability in the Middle East,‚Äù FM Dar said.</p>
<p>He emphasised that the path to lasting peace lay in upholding international law, ending foreign occupation, rejecting the use of force and advancing solutions through dialogue and diplomacy.</p></p>
