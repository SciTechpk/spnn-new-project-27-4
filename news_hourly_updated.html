                <h2>Pakistan urges India to resume functioning of IWT after Hague court‚Äôs supplemental award</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Monday welcomed the decision by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague to issue a ‚Äúsupplemental award‚Äù in the Indus Waters case, urging India to resume the functioning of the Treaty, which it has held in abeyance since May.</p>
<p>According to the PCA‚Äôs rules, a supplemental award is an additional ruling issued by a court or tribunal after its initial decision, usually to address a specific issue that wasn‚Äôt fully resolved or to clarify certain points, such as jurisdiction, competence, or interpretation of a treaty or agreement.</p>
<p>India in April held the Indus Waters Treaty in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">abeyance</a> following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam that killed 26 ‚Äî an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">termed</a> any attempt to suspend its water share an ‚Äúact of war‚Äù, noting the <a class="link--external" href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTs/Volume%20419/volume-419-I-6032-English.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IWT</a> had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn a supplemental award announced on 27 June 2025, the Court of Arbitration hearing the Pakistan-India dispute over Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects has found that its competence remains intact, and that it has a continuing responsibility to advance these proceedings in a timely, efficient, and fair manner,‚Äù the FO said in today‚Äôs statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Court of Arbitration decided to announce this supplemental award in the wake of India‚Äôs illegal and unilateral announcement to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance.‚Äù</p>
<p>It added that the award ‚Äúvindicates Pakistan‚Äôs position that the Indus Waters Treaty remains valid and operational, and that India has no right to take unilateral action about it‚Äù.</p>
<p>The FO urged India to ‚Äúimmediately resume the normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty, and fulfil its treaty obligations, wholly and faithfully.‚Äù</p>

<p>Pakistan earlier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920611/pakistan-hails-hague-courts-supplemental-award-in-indus-waters-case-says-india-cant-sideline-arbitration-process">welcomed</a> the decision by the PCA to issue a ‚ÄúSupplemental Award of Competence‚Äù in the Indus Waters case, reiterating that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.</p>
<p>According to the government‚Äôs statement, Pakistan welcomed the PCA‚Äôs decision and stated that the court affirmed its competence despite India‚Äôs unilateral action against the IWT.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan looks forward to receiving the court‚Äôs award on the first phase on the merits in due course following the hearing that was held in Peace Palace in The Hague in July 2024,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe high priority, at this point, is that India and Pakistan find a way back to a meaningful dialogue, including on the application of the Indus Waters Treaty,‚Äù the government said, reiterating remarks made by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that Pakistan was ‚Äúready to engage in a meaningful dialogue with India on all outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism‚Äù.</p>
<p>The Indian Ministry for External Affairs (MEA) had ‚Äúcategorically rejected‚Äù the PCA‚Äôs supplemental award and stated that it did not recognise the court itself, according to Indian newspaper <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-categorically-rejects-court-of-arbitrations-supplemental-award-on-kishenganga-ratle-hydropower-projects/article69745841.ece" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Hindu.</a></em></p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia has never recognised the existence in law of this so-called Court of Arbitration, and India‚Äôs position has all along been that the constitution of this so-called arbitral body is in itself a serious breach of the Indus Waters Treaty and consequently any proceedings before this forum and any award or decision taken by it are also for that reason illegal and per se void,‚Äù the ministry maintained.</p>
<p>According to <em>The Hindu</em>, the MEA said that after the Pahalgam attack, India exercised ‚Äúits rights as a sovereign nation under international law‚Äù and placed the IWT in abeyance ‚Äúuntil Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism‚Äù. The ministry additionally described the Court of Arbitration‚Äôs latest declarations as a ‚Äúcharade at Pakistan‚Äôs behest‚Äù.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#treaty-remains-in-force" id="treaty-remains-in-force" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòTreaty remains in force‚Äô</h2>
<p>According to a <a class="link--external" href="https://pcacases.com/web/sendAttach/76022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> from the PCA, the court found that it was not open to India to suspend the IWT or hold it in abeyance unilaterally.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Court first considered the terms of the Treaty (IWT), which do not provide for the unilateral ‚Äòabeyance‚Äô or ‚Äòsuspension‚Äô of the Treaty; rather, according to its terms, the Treaty continues in force until terminated with the mutual consent of India and Pakistan,‚Äù the press release read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Court found that the terms of the Treaty, read in light of the Treaty‚Äôs object and purpose, do not allow either Party, acting unilaterally, to hold in abeyance or suspend an ongoing dispute settlement process, given that to do so would fundamentally undermine ‚Äòthe value and efficacy of the Treaty‚Äôs compulsory third-party dispute settlement process‚Äô.‚Äù</p>
<p>During the court proceedings, the PCA noted that it was not open to India to unilaterally hold the IWT in abeyance ‚Äúregardless of how India‚Äôs position was characterised or justified under international law‚Äù.</p></p>

                <h2>US must rule out more strikes before talks can resume: Iran</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Diplomatic talks between Washington and Tehran cannot resume unless the US rules out further strikes on Iran, its deputy foreign minister <a class="link--external" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20r18x8x05o" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the <em>BBC</em> late Sunday.</p>
<p>Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the British broadcaster that the US had signalled it wants to return to the negotiating table, a week after it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">struck</a> three Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have not agreed to any date, we have not agreed to the modality,‚Äù said Takht-Ravanchi.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRight now we are seeking an answer to this question. Are we going to see a repetition of an act of aggression while we are engaging in dialogue?‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The US needed to be ‚Äúquite clear on this very important question‚Äù, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said he was not offering Iran anything nor talking to it ‚Äúsince we totally obliterated‚Äù the country‚Äôs nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am not offering Iran anything, unlike Obama,‚Äù Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>The two countries were in talks over Tehran‚Äôs nuclear programme when Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">hit</a> Iranian nuclear sites and military infrastructure earlier this month, with the US joining by bombing three nuclear sites ‚Äî Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan ‚Äî on June 21.</p>
<p>At least 935 people were killed in Iran during its 12-day war with Israel, Iranian state media reported today, nearly a week since a ceasefire took hold. ‚ÄúDuring the 12-day war waged by the Zionist regime against our country, 935 martyrs have been identified so far,‚Äù the official <em>IRNA</em> news agency quoted judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir as saying, adding that the death toll included 132 women and 38 children.</p>
<p>The deputy minister revealed to the <em>BBC</em> that the US had signalled it did ‚Äúnot want to engage in regime change‚Äù by targeting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>
<p>Takht-Ravanchi also said Iran should still be allowed to enrich uranium.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe level of that can be discussed, the capacity can be discussed, but to say that you should not have enrichment, you should have zero enrichment, and if you do not agree, we will bomb you, that is the law of the jungle,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Israel claims that Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme is close to producing a bomb, whereas Tehran says it is for peaceful purposes.</p>
<p>It is not clear yet how much damage the strikes inflicted on Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities, which Trump had said were ‚Äútotally obliterated‚Äù.</p>
<p>UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said Iran would probably be able to begin to produce enriched uranium ‚Äúin a matter of months‚Äù.</p>
<p>Takht-Ravanchi said he did not know how long it would take.</p>
<p>Under a 2015 deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium below 3.67 per cent purity for fuel for commercial nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1406529">abandoned</a> the agreement in 2018 and Iran responded by producing uranium enriched to 60 pc ‚Äî above levels for civilian usage but still below weapons grade.</p>
<p>That material, if further refined, would theoretically be sufficient to produce more than nine nuclear bombs.</p></p>
