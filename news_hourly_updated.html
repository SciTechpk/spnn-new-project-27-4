                <h2>7 dead, 6 injured in GB‚Äôs Danyor as landslide hits workers restoring water supply</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least seven people died and six were injured early on Monday when a landslide hit individuals working at a water channel in Gilgit-Baltistan‚Äôs (GB) Danyor city, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate cha¬≠nge and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660/situationer-unprecedented-melting-in-g-b">melting glaciers</a> have become more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921009/at-least-8-dead-13-injured-in-rain-related-incidents-across-gb-punjab-and-sindh-officials#:~:text=two%20sisters%20died%20after%20being%20swept%20away">late June</a>.</p>
<p>The situation worsened when deadly floods <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20so%20far%2C%2010%20fatalities%20and%20four%20injuries%20have%20been%20reported">10 deaths</a> have been confirmed across the region, with a dozen tourists <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928659/funeral-held-in-absentia-for-missing-tourists-in-gbs-babusar-after-14-days-of-search-efforts">missing</a>.</p>
<p>Thirteen workers, mainly young people, were attempting to restore the water supply in the main water channel from Danyor nullah to Danyor town, which had been damaged due to the recent floods, when the landslide hit at 2am today.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThirteen workers restoring the water supply were buried under the rubble,‚Äù Gilgit‚Äôs Rescue 1122 said in a statement.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Stating the casualties, it said the injured were taken to a hospital. District Emergency Officer (operations) Abdul Basit was present at the site to supervise the restoration, Rescue 1122 added.</p>
<p>Muhammad Akbar, one of the residents who took part in the rescue operations, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the bodies and injured had been moved to ‚Äúvarious hospitals in Gilgit and Danyor‚Äù.</p>
<p>On July 22, a flash flood in Danyor nullah <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930#:~:text=Rescue%201122%20said%20a%20flash%20flood%20in%20Danyor%20nallah%20inundated%20residential%20communities">inundated</a> residential communities and damaged crops and irrigation channels. The deluge also damaged link roads and suspension bridges, cutting road links to affected areas.</p>
<p>Hussain Akbar Shah, another local, said thousands of Danyor residents were facing a shortage of drinking water and irrigation water as the valley depended on water from the nullah.</p>
<p>A statement by the GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq stated that the total number of workers was 15, out of whom seven were confirmed dead.</p>
<p>An emergency has been declared at hospitals in Gilgit, the spokesperson added. ‚ÄúOur hearts are saddened by this unfortunate accident. Gilgit is in a state of mourning,‚Äù Faraq said.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Funeral prayers were later held for the workers who died in the incident. Residents also protested at Danyor Chowk against the incident, holding the government responsible for it.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters, area elders led by former GB minister Muhammad Iqbal said the government had failed to res¬≠tore the disrupted water supply despite repeated assurances.</p>
<p>The elders noted that although residents had managed to temporarily restore the pipeline, subsequent flooding destroyed it again, while the government had not started work on it. The protesters demanded that the government take action, or they would launch protests.</p>
<p>GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan expressed his condolences on the incident and announced compensation for the bereaved families.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe families of those who died in the Danyor nullah [incident] will receive compensation as per the government policy,‚Äù CM Gulbar said, directing that the wounded be provided with the best medical treatment.</p></p>

                <h2>Traders sit-in protest on Karakoram Highway enters fourth week</h2>

            <p><p><strong>‚Ä¢ Protesters demand tax exemption for GB residents and clearance of 280 stuck consignments<br />
‚Ä¢  Federal committee, including GB leadership, meets today to discuss resolution</strong></p>
<p>GILGIT: The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929586/traders-continue-sit-in-halting-travel-trade-on-kkh-for-20th-day">ongoing sit-in</a> on Karakoram Highway (KKH) has disrupted travel and trade between Pakistan and China via Khunjerab Pass for the 22nd consecutive day on Sunday as deadlock between government and protesters persisted.</p>
<p>The federal committee constituted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will meet on Monday (today) to make recommendations for resolving the issue. GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmed Mirza, PPP President Amjad Hussain Advocate, former GB chief minister and PML-N President Hafeezur Rehman have also been included in the committee.</p>
<p>Trade and travel between Pakistan and China, as well as business activities at the Sost Dry Port, have remained shut for the past 22 days.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927464">protest sit-in</a>, called by the Tajir Ittehad Action Committee ‚Äî backed by trade organisations, government and opposition parties, and religious groups in the region ‚Äî is being staged at Sost, blocking trade activities between Pakistan and China in support of their demands.</p>
<p>Members of a committee formed by Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan to resolve the matter had met the protest organisers on Friday. They discussed the issues and prepared recommendations to present to the Prime Minister‚Äôs committee.</p>
<p>The protesters have given a two-point agenda to the committee. They demanded exemption of GB residents from income tax, sales tax, and other federal taxes on items imported from China through the Khunjerab Pass.  They also demanded Customs clearance of 280 consignments stuck at Sost Dry Port for over a year under a one-time amnesty scheme.</p>
<p>The protesters announced that they would not call off their protest until their demands are implemented.</p>
<p>Addressing the protest, Rehan Shah, PML-N Hunza president, said that the people of GB have long been demanding their constitutional and legal rights. He added that political, religious, and trade organisations ‚Äî along with both government and opposition members in GB ‚Äî support these demands.</p>
<p>He stated that GB has been deprived of constitutional and legal rights for the past seven decades.</p>
<p>Zahoor Karim, PPP local president, said the federal government should only collect taxes after giving GB representation in Pakistan‚Äôs National Assembly and Senate. He stressed that the ‚Äúeconomic murder‚Äù of GB residents would not be tolerated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe FBR has introduced policies to deprive GB people of their economic resources. Trade between Pakistan and China has been closed for a year, and goods worth billions of rupees are stuck at Sost Port ‚Äî some damaged by rain and others expired,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Protesters said that the majority of GB residents depend on cross-border trade between Pakistan and China through the Khunjerab Pass.</p>
