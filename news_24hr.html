            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929745/defence-minister-rubbishes-indian-air-chiefs-comical-claims-of-downing-6-pakistani-aircraft-in-may-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Defence minister rubbishes Indian air chief’s ‘comical’ claims of downing 6 Pakistani aircraft in May conflict</strong></a>
            <p><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday rubbished what he said were “implausible” and “comical” claims by the Indian Air Force chief that the country had shot down five Pakistani fighter jets and one other military aircraft during clashes in May.</p>
<p>The comments are the first such statement by the Indian side three months after its worst military conflict in decades with its neighbour. During the conflict, Pakistan said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downed</a> five Indian planes in air-to-air combat on May 7, later stating that figure <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">as six</a>. India’s highest-ranking general has also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914500/indian-military-confirms-fighter-jets-shot-down-by-pakistan">acknowledged</a> that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft.</p>
<p>Speaking at an event in the southern city of Bengaluru, Indian Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh claimed: “We have at least five fighters confirmed killed, and one large aircraft,” adding that the large aircraft, which could be a surveillance plane, was shot down at a distance of 300 kilometres.</p>
<p>He alleged that most of the Pakistani aircraft were downed by India’s Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile system. He cited electronic tracking data as confirmation of the strikes.</p>

<p>Singh did not mention the type of fighter jets that were downed, but claimed that airstrikes also hit an additional surveillance plane and “a few F16” fighters that were parked in hangars at two air bases in <a class="link--external" href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/operation-sindoor-iaf-pakistan-5-fighter-jets-1-large-aircraft-air-marshal-10179475/lite/#:~:text=The%20IAF%20chief%20also%20showed%20that%20the-,Shahbaz%20Jacobabad%20airfield,-was%20one%20of%20the%20major%20airfields%20that%20were%20attacked.%20%E2%80%9CHere" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sindh and Punjab</a>. “This is actually the largest ever recorded surface-to-air kill,” he insisted.</p>
<p>Responding to the claims in a post on X, the defence minister said: “The belated assertions made by the Indian Air Force chief regarding alleged destruction of Pakistani aircraft during Operation Sindoor are as implausible as they are ill-timed.</p>
<p>“It is also ironic how senior Indian military officers are being used as the faces of monumental failure caused by strategic shortsightedness of Indian politicians. For three months, no such claims were voiced — while Pakistan, in the immediate aftermath, presented detailed technical briefings to the international media, and independent observers recorded widespread acknowledgment of the loss of multiple Indian aircraft, including Rafales, by sources ranging from world leaders, senior Indian politicians to foreign intelligence assessments.”</p>
<p>Asif said that “not a single Pakistani aircraft was hit or destroyed” by India, adding that Pakistan took out six Indian jets, S400 air defence batteries and unmanned aircraft of India while “swiftly putting several Indian airbases out of action”.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>He added that the losses on the Line of Control for Indian armed forces were “disproportionately heavier” as well.</p>
<p>“If the truth is in question, let both sides open their aircraft inventories to independent verification — though we suspect this would lay bare the reality India seeks to obscure. Wars are not won by falsehoods but by moral authority, national resolve and professional competence.</p>
<p>“Such comical narratives, crafted for domestic political expediency, increase the grave risks of strategic miscalculation in a nuclearised environment,” he warned.</p>
<p>The defence minister iterated that every violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity would invite “swift, surefire and proportionate response, and responsibility for any ensuing escalation will rest entirely with strategically blind leaders who gamble with South Asia’s peace for fleeting political gains”.</p>
<p>Former envoy Dr Maleeha Lodhi said the Indian air chief’s claim was “laughable”, noting that it took him “several months to count the planes to make this ridiculous assertion!”</p>

<p>Pakistan, with the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) primarily operating Chinese-made jets and US F-16s, has previously denied that India downed any aircraft during the May 7-10 fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours.</p>
<p>New Delhi had previously claimed it had downed “<a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/india-shot-down-high-tech-jets-of-pakistan-confirms-air-marshal-bharti-938212" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a few planes</a>”. United States President <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925193">Donald Trump</a> has echoed the figure of “five jets” shot down during the military confrontation, albeit without specifying which side’s craft he was referring to.</p>

<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has faced <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927416">scathing criticism</a> from opposition parties for its lack of “political will to fight” during the May clashes and “failures” to prevent the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>The May conflict was sparked by New Delhi’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">allegations</a> against Islamabad, which were without evidence and strongly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">refuted</a> by Pakistan, about a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. After the May 7 combat and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>France’s air chief, General Jerome Bellanger, has previously said that he has seen evidence of the loss of three Indian fighters, including a Rafale. The Indian Air Force has not commented on those claims.</p>
<p>Days after the air combat, <em>The Washington Post</em>, based on visual evidence analysed by experts, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910110">reported</a> that at least two French-made Indian fighter aircraft were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force.</p>
<p>According to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://thewire.in/security/iaf-lost-fighter-jets-to-pak-because-of-political-leaderships-constraints-indian-defence-attache" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Wire</a></em>, India’s defence attache to Indonesia, Indian Navy Captain Shiv Kumar, while speaking at a seminar in June, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921034/indian-defence-attache-claims-paf-downed-indian-fighter-jets-because-of-political-leaderships-constraints">acknowledged</a> that the PAF downed the Indian fighters.</p>
<p>During his presentation at the event, Kumar had acknowledged the loss of Indian planes. According to Kumar, Indian fighter jets were “operating under strict political orders from the Modi government not to target Pakistani military installations or air defence systems”, <em>The Wire</em> reported.</p>
<p>“This self-imposed limitation by the government was intended to prevent escalation of conflict in a nuclear environment,” the outlet added, quoting the Indian officer.</p>
<p>India’s intelligence failure was central to the hour-long air battle between Pakistan and India, which led to the downing of Rafale aircraft by the Pakistan Air Force’s J-10 fighters using PL-15s missiles, according to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928400">report</a>.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> interviews with two Indian officials and three of their Pakistani counterparts found that the performance of the Rafale wasn’t the key problem: central to its downing was an Indian intelligence failure concerning the range of the China-made PL-15 missile fired by the J-10 fighter. China and Pakistan are the only countries to operate both J-10s, known as Vigorous Dragons, and PL-15s.</p>
<p>The faulty intelligence gave the Rafale pilots a false sense of confidence that they were out of Pakistani firing distance, which they believed was only around 150km, the Indian officials said, referring to the widely cited range of PL-15’s export variant.</p>
<p>“We ambushed them,” the PAF official said, adding that Islamabad conducted an electronic warfare assault on Delhi’s systems in an attempt to confuse Indian pilots. Indian officials dispute the effectiveness of those efforts.</p>
<p>“The Indians were not expecting to be shot at,” said Justin Bronk, air warfare expert at London’s Royal United Services Institute think-tank. “And the PL-15 is clearly very capable at long range.” The PL-15 that hit the Rafale was fired from around 200km away, according to Pakistani officials, and even farther according to Indian officials. That would make it among the longest-range air-to-air strikes recorded.</p></p>

            <p><p>Security forces have killed 14 more terrorists attempting to infiltrate across the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Balochistan’s Zhob district, the military’s media wing said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The development adds to 33 terrorists, belonging to the “Indian proxy <em>Fitna al Khawarij</em>”, who were eliminated on the night of August 7 and 8.</p>
<p>“On [the] night 8/9 August 2025, a deliberate sanitisation operation was conducted in surrounding areas of Sambaza along Pakistan-Afghanistan border,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7384" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>“During the conduct of the operation, 14 more Indian-sponsored <em>khwarij</em> were hunted down and successfully neutralised. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed <em>khwarij</em>,” the ISPR noted.</p>

<p>This followed the “successful engagements by the security forces in general area Sambaza, Zhob District on 7-8 August 2025, during which 33 <em>khwarij</em> were sent to hell”.</p>
<p>“The number of <em>khwarij</em> killed in two days anti-infiltration operation has risen to 47,” the military highlighted.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna">Fitna al Khawarij</a></em> is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>“The security forces remain committed to secure the nation’s frontiers and thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Pakistan,” the statement asserted.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to the security forces and praised their professionalism.</p>
<p>“The nation looks with admiration at the successes of the security forces against the terrorists of the Indian conspiracy. The security forces have brought the Indian-sponsored terrorists involved in spreading chaos in Balochistan to an exemplary end,” he said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MOIofficialGoP/status/1954104835948646886" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X.</p>
<p>He added, “Security forces, through timely operations, sent 47 terrorists of <em>Fitna al-Hindu­stan</em> to hell in two days. By taking swift action, they foiled a sinister conspiracy to sabotage peace in Balochistan.”</p>
<p>In May, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525#:~:text=The%20government%20has%20designated%20all%20terrorist%20organisations%20in%20Balochistan%20as%20Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan,%20state%20media%20PTV%20News%20reported.">designated</a> all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna al-Hindu­stan</em> — a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">new phrase</a> aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>

<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>The country <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">ranked</a> second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>

            <p><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to engage with the US and China have reached a stalemate, which exposes limitations to India’s powers on the global stage, <em>The New York Times</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/world/asia/modi-india-trump-china-tariffs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Modi’s first attempt came in 2014 through a high-level engagement with China came. The Indian premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1132526">rolled out</a> the red carpet for China’s President Xi Jinping in his home town, organising an intimate riverside dinner in Ahmedabad.</p>
<p>The meeting at the time <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1132621#:~:text=Border%20issues%20are%20on%20the%20agenda%20for%20the%20visit%20of%20Mr%20Xi%2C%20who%20is%20accompanied%20by%20his%20wife%20Peng%20Liyuan.%20But%20both%20sides%20say%20they%20want%20to%20focus%20on%20economic%20cooperation%2C%20with%20India%20seeking%20Chinese%20funding%20for%20an%20overhaul%20of%20its%20dilapidated%20railways%20and%20cooperation%20in%20nuclear%20energy.">focused</a> on economic cooperation, with India seeking Chinese funding for an overhaul of its dilapidated railways and cooperation in nuclear energy.</p>
<p>However, the talks were overshadowed by a stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops along their shared border. “The flare-up in 2014 was the first of several acts of aggression that would ultimately leave Mr Modi embarrassed, his economy squeezed by the need to keep tens of thousands of Indian troops on a war footing high in the Himalayas for several years,” <em>The New York Times</em> said.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Modi steered towards the US direction. “Mr Modi developed such a bonhomie with US President Donald Trump in his first term that he broke with protocol to campaign for a second term for him at a stadium-packed event in Houston,” the outlet said, adding that the increasing alignment grew further after “the Biden administration looked past that partisan play to continue expanding relations with India, a bulwark against China”.</p>
<p>During a joint session of Congress last year, Modi remarked, “AI stands for ‘America and India’”, the report added.</p>
<p>India’s relations with the US have seemingly faltered during Trump’s second term.  Terming the recent trade tensions a “very public humiliation” of Modi, the outlet said that India was singled out for a whopping 50 per cent tariff, with the US citing India’s continued imports of Russian oil and calling India’s economy “dead”.</p>
<p>Trump also “stirred rancour among Indians” by giving Pakistan’s leadership an “equal footing” as he tried to settle the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military conflict</a> between the two nuclear-armed neighbours earlier this year, the outlet said.</p>
<p>In June, Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093">hosted</a> Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir at the White House in the weeks following the military confrontation between India and Pakistan. This <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925661/trumps-renewed-interest-in-pakistan-has-india-recalibrating-china-ties">prompted</a> a private diplomatic protest from India in a warning to Washington about risks to their bilateral ties while New Delhi is recalibrating relations with China as a hedge.</p>
<p>“All that has plunged India into a moment of soul-searching, exposing limitations to its power on the world stage despite its gargantuan size and growing economy,” <em>The New York Times</em> stated. The outlet also highlighted Modi’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929293/indias-modi-unwilling-to-compromise-on-agriculture-as-us-tariff-war-escalates">acknowledgement</a> this week that he might pay a “personal political price” for the trade dispute with the US.</p>
<p>Amid heightened tensions with the US, India has made moves indicating “increased activity toward warming ties with Beijing again”, the outlet said.</p>
<p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun on Friday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929662/china-welcomes-indian-pm-modis-planned-visit-for-sco">welcomed</a> Modi’s plan to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929105">visit</a> China for the first time in seven years to participate in the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. Last month, Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar made his first <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924167/avoiding-trade-curbs-vital-for-normalisation-of-ties-india-tells-china">visit</a> to Beijing since a deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1564042">2020 border clash</a> between Indian and Chinese troops.</p>
<p>The outlet suggested that relations with China “remain strained” due to border disputes and China’s support for Pakistan during the recent military escalation, adding: “China, for its part, has been wary of New Delhi’s efforts to create a manufacturing alternative to China.”</p>
<p>It further noted Modi’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929654/modi-has-good-conversation-with-putin">current engagement</a> with Russia, saying, “Russia’s steadfastness as a partner is being talked up by officials in India. Mr Modi’s national security adviser was in Moscow this week to finalise details of a trip by Mr Putin to New Delhi.”</p>
<p>India’s aim to rise as an economic and diplomatic power “appears deflated by the sudden uncertainty”, according to <em>The New York Times.</em></p>
<p>It said, “Stuck between two superpowers that have shown no hesitation to put India down in moments of friction, there is a growing sense among Indian officials and experts that the country will have to firmly return to its long-tested doctrine of ‘strategic autonomy’.”</p>
<p>This means that India was “on its own” and must “make do with a patchwork of contradictory and piecemeal ties, and avoid overcommitting to alliances”.</p>
<p>The outlet quoted Nirupama Rao, a former Indian ambassador to Beijing and Washington, who said that Trump’s punishing moves had upended “the strategic logic of a very consequential partnership” that had been carefully nurtured over more than two decades. “There will be ‘very pragmatic strategic recalibrations’ by New Delhi to protect its interests,” she said.</p>
<p>India’s growing economy allows its leaders breathing room, but it is still a moment of “deep introspection” for the country, Rao said, adding: “We have to draw our lessons from that and really focus on the national priorities and what we need to do to become strong and more influential.”</p></p>
