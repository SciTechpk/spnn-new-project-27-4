            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday reiterated Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1714822">willingness</a> to hold talks with India on the Kashmir dispute and counterterrorism, stressing New Delhi wanted the same “in all sincerity”.</p>
<p>The prime minister participated in the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit alongside presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ilham Aliyev. The meeting comes as the premier continued his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913237">tour to friendly countries</a> to appreciate their support for Pakistan during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">recent conflict</a> with India.</p>
<p>Speaking at the summit, PM Shehbaz said: “I have said in all humility that we want peace in the region […] and that requires talks on the table on issues which need urgent attention and amicable resolution, that is the issue of Kashmir according to the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council and as per the aspirations of the people of Kashmir.”</p>
<p>The premier also touched upon the issue of terrorism: “I have said in all earnest that if India wants to talk on countering terrorism in sincerity of purpose, Pakistan would be willing to talk to India on this issue as well.</p>
<p>“But this is a fact of life that we are the biggest victims of terrorism around the globe; we lost 90,000 valuable lives in Pakistan and $150 billion worth of economic losses over the last many decades,” he highlighted.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also expressed willingness to resume trade if India was willing to cooperate on the issues, including counterterrorism.</p>
<p>“There cannot be a bigger commitment and intention to beat this menace (terrorism) for all times to come, and in that, if India wants in all sincerity honest cooperation, Pakistan would be willing, along with the promotion of trade with India. All these issues need to be discussed on the table.</p>
<p>“I would be extremely grateful for your support in this regard,” he said, addressing the Turkiye and Azerbaijan presidents.</p>

<p>On India’s unilateral move to hold the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a> in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">abeyance</a>, the premier said: “India tried to weaponise the Indus Waters Treaty, which is a lifeline for the people of Pakistan — 240 million people — for their agricultural use, for drinking and many other purposes.</p>
<p>“I think this is most unfortunate that India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911383">tried to threaten</a> to stop our flow of water to Pakistan. This is not possible, was never possible, and will not be possible, God-willing. We are making proper arrangements to ensure that India never ever does it,” he asserted.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>During his address, Shehbaz noted: “The world we live in faces numerous grave challenges, including armed conflict, climate change, diseases and economic crises.</p>
<p>“This is why the three of us have assembled here today, opting for compassion while rejecting conflict. We are confident that patience and wisdom will ultimately usher in peace and prosperity.”</p>
<p>“In today’s unpredictable and volatile world, political security, architectures, connectivity, alignments and emerging technologies are shaping the new reality. In such a situation, Pakistan is very fortunate to have sincere brothers like Turkiye and Azerbaijan who have stood together with us as impregnable rocks and whom we can trust without a second thought.”</p>
<p>Reiterating his gratitude to Erdogan and Aliyev for their diplomatic support during the recent conflict with India, which “was obviously very serious”. “It was an aggression from India against Pakistan for no rhyme and reason.”</p>
<p>He noted Erdogan’s “firm stand and solidarity with the people of Pakistan”, as well as Aliyev’s unwavering commitment to the people of Pakistan“ had earned the highest level of appreciation from his government and the nation.</p>

<p>The prime minister hailed the role of Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir during Pakistan’s response, noting the “great bravery and the highest level of professional acumen” of the armed forces under his leadership.</p>
<p>“I saw him during those moments God-fearing, fearless, firm and with an iron resolve, with patience and obviously with fortitude to face that aggression.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Addressing Aliyev, the premier thanked him for the hospitality shown to him and his delegation, noting that today’s summit “reflects the meeting of hearts and souls of genuine friends and sincere well-wishers”.</p>
<p>Recalling the “most fruitful discussions” at the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1843759">Shanghai Cooperation Organisation</a> summit last year in Kazakhstan, PM Shehbaz said, “We are now eagerly looking forward to taking our trilateral partnership to new heights that would be in consonance with the wishes and desires of our people.</p>
<p>“This would be no surprise to anyone as Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Turkiye are bound together by deep historical, cultural and spiritual ties forged through centuries of shared values and mutual support,” he asserted.</p>
<p>“This historical relationship has been further strengthened as we have stood by each other, whether it be on Karabakh, Kashmir or northern Turkish Cyprus. Our strength lies in our solidarity and mutual respect.”</p>
<p>Noting the “outpouring of love and affection in both Turkiye and Azerbaijan” for Pakistan, PM Shehbaz noted: “We could not but be mesmerised by the intensity of the fervour and enthusiasm of our common citizens during Pakistan’s recent conflict with India.”</p>
<p>He noted that India “not only <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">failed</a> to bring any credible evidence against Pakistan but also rejected our sincere and generous offer of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral, transparent investigation</a> into the so-called <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">incident in Pahalgam</a> by any international body”.</p>
<p>At the outset of his speech, the premier congratulated Aliyev and the Azerbaijani nation on their Republic Day. “The way the Azeri nation fought for its liberation, you earned a high position in the community of nations.”</p>
<p>He also felicitated the Turkish president for “very skillfully resolving the issue” of the PKK, referring to the Kurdish rebels’ recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910519">decision to disband</a>. “That goes to explain in volumes, my brother, your diplomatic skills to resolve this issue, and by virtue of this, you have earned a high place and influence not only in the region, but beyond.”</p>

<p>Noting that the three countries collectively had an economic size of $1.5 trillion, the Turkish president said, “We stand behind each and every step towards transforming our relationship into a strategic partnership.”</p>

<p>Erdogan also slammed Israel’s “relentless cruelty and expansionist policies in Palestine”, terming it the “clearest example of crisis of the international system”. He called for increased global pressure on Israel for a permanent ceasefire and uninterrupted aid into the enclave.</p>

            <p><p>Amnesty International and four other human rights organisations called on Pakistan to release human rights defenders in Balochistan and end the crackdown on dissent, according to Amnesty’s website.</p>
<p>Last week, the Balochistan High Court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912743">rejected</a> constitutional petitions seeking the release of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) Chief Organiser Dr Mahrang Baloch and two other leaders detained under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance (MPO).

<p>Mahrang and other BYC activists were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899608">arrested</a> on March 22 for allegedly “attacking” Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after their members faced a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899479/tear-gas-water-cannon-employed-to-disperse-baloch-yakjehti-committee-protesters-in-quetta">police crackdown</a> in Quetta while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa33/9434/2025/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">letter</a> dated May 27 was addressed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and signed by Amnesty, the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (Forum-Asia), Front Line Defenders (FLD), the International Federation for Human Rights, and the World Organisation Against Torture, both of which work under the framework of the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders.</p>

<p>The groups said late on Tuesday night they strongly condemned the alleged “harassment and arbitrary detention of Baloch human rights defenders exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly in Pakistan, particularly in Balochistan.”</p>
<p>“The actions of your government to systematically harass and detain HRDs, raising their voice against enforced disappearances and other unlawful state practices, run afoul of Pakistan’s international human rights obligations,” the letter alleged.</p>
<p>It added that the “attacks on BYC leaders and supporters, who are peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and assembly, not only violate Pakistan’s constitution but also its international legal obligations.”</p>
<p>The letter noted that the Pakistani Constitution guarantees the right to assemble
peacefully under Article 16 and the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19.</p>
<p>The groups further alleged in the letter that the crackdown was launched “against a backdrop of harassment of journalists and a clampdown on freedom of expression.”</p>
<p>“It is imperative that human rights are upheld and never sacrificed in the name of security,” the letter said.</p>
<p>The organisations called on Pakistan to “immediately and unconditionally release all Baloch HRDs and their family members arbitrarily detained solely for peacefully exercising their rights in line with the right to liberty and safety.” They further urged Islamabad to “drop all charges against HRDs based solely on the exercise of their rights.</p>
<p>“Pending their release, ensure the safety of HRDs and family members, including by sharing accurate information about their whereabouts, and providing effective access to family members, legal counsel and medical treatment.</p>
<p>They called on Pakistan to “conduct a thorough, impartial, effective and transparent investigation into the allegations of torture and mistreatment by Pakistani authorities of Baloch HRDs under detention.”</p>
<p>The organisations also urged an end to the crackdown against HRDs, journalists, protesters and dissidents by ensuring their right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are fully protected.</p>
<p>They further called on Pakistani authorities to “cease all forms” of alleged reprisals against family members of HRDs.“</p></p>

            <p><p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911617/pm-tasks-bilawal-with-presenting-pakistans-case-for-peace-on-global-arena">high-level delegation</a> tasked with presenting Pakistan’s position on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911486/experts-sceptical-about-longevity-of-ceasefire-between-pakistan-and-india">ongoing dispute</a> with India has scheduled to meet on June 2, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911791">decided</a> to send a diplomatic delegation to important world capitals in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India. He entrusted the PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to lead the delegation.</p>
<p>The delegation comprises Senator Rehman, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt and Jalil Abbas Jilani.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Speaking on <em>DawnNewsTV</em> programme ‘Doosra Rukh’, Senator Rehman said that the diplomatic committee had decided to visit various countries before Eidul Azha.</p>
<p>“The committee, headed by Bilawal, will begin its tour of various countries on June 2, starting from New York,” she said.</p>
<p>She added, “The committee will first go to New York, then Washington, followed by London, and then Brussels.”</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Rehman further said that Bilawal had emphasised that there was no hurry as Pakistan “is not concerned with the Indian delegation.”</p>
<p>“Bilawal has said that we have our own stance and that we have enough content for our defence,” she said, adding that the PPP chairman wanted a “substantive [and] quality meeting”.</p>
<p>Speaking about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913855/pakistan-slams-modis-inflammatory-monologue-urges-india-to-honour-international-order">recent remarks</a> regarding the Indus Water Treaty, saying “No politician, especially a PM, says things like that.”</p>
<p>She added that Modi wanted the region to remain in “crisis” to prevent any space for negotiations.</p>
<p>In a separate interview with the Saudi television network <em>Al-Arabiya</em>, the senator warned that stability in a volatile region is not possible with Modi’s escalatory rhetoric.</p>
<p>“He is pushing the region toward a dangerous new abnormal, which cannot possibly be acceptable to anyone,” Senator Rehman said. “Nothing is normal or rational about this doctrinal shift in India’s foreign policy.”</p>
<p>She highlighted that India was also mining more groundwater than any other country in the world, especially from the Indus River Basin, while trying to cut off what they can of Pakistan’s water lifeline, stating that this is “totally unsustainable or acceptable in today’s climate-stressed world”.</p>

<p>The developments follow a recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military confrontation</a> between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad’s alleged involvement in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam — an allegation for which it provided no evidence.</p>
<p>New Delhi launched a series of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">responded</a> by downing five Indian jets.
