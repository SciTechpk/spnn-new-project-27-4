                <h2>FO says ‚Äòno information‚Äô on Trump‚Äôs reported visit to Pakistan in September</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan on Thursday said he had ‚Äúno information‚Äù regarding widespread reports of United States President Donald Trump‚Äôs visit to Pakistan in September.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, some local television news channels reported, citing sources, that Trump is expected to visit Pakistan in September. The news channels said that Trump would also visit India after arriving in Islamabad in September.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Talking to <em>Dawn.com</em> on the reported visit, the FO spokesperson said: ‚ÄúWe have no information about this matter.‚Äù</p>
<p>Similarly, a US embassy spokesperson in Islamabad told <em>Reuters</em>, ‚ÄúWe have nothing to announce,‚Äù and said that the White House might be able to provide confirmation on the president‚Äôs schedule.</p>
<p>US-Pakistan relations saw a major boost when Trump hosted Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House last month in an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093">unprecedented meeting</a>.</p>
<p>India is due to host the summit of the so-called Quad countries this year, but dates for the meeting have not been announced yet.</p>
<p>The Quad grouping includes the US, India, Australia and Japan and is focused on countering China‚Äôs rise in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

                <h2>Section 144 imposed across Punjab, ‚Äòemergency‚Äô in parts as rains claim dozens of lives in past 24 hours</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Section 144 was imposed across Punjab along with a state of emergency in several districts on Thursday as heavy rains triggered flooding and claimed over 60 lives across the province in the past 24 hours, according to authorities.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924232">issued</a> a warning of torrential rains with wind-thundershowers that would last throughout the country till today. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has forecasted that heavy rains will continue to lash parts of the country over the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSixty-three citizens have died while 290 were injured due to monsoon rains [across the province] in the past 24 hours,‚Äù read a statement by the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) spokesperson.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt least 15 were reported dead in Lahore, nine in Faisalabad, five in Sahiwal, three in Pakpattan and nine in Okara,‚Äù the PDMA statement detailed, adding that the families of the deceased will receive compensation from the government.</p>
<p>An order from the Punjab Home Department said there was a significant increase in the accumulation of rainwater in low-lying areas, streets and open spaces, posing serious risks to the safety of children who often bathed in standing water.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDams, rivers, canals, ponds, lakes and distributaries across the province of Punjab experience heightened water levels and stronger currents during these periods, making swimming and unauthorised boating activities extremely hazardous for human life, leading to a high potential for drowning and other tragic incidents.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPrevailing weather conditions and the inherent dangers associated with these activities, necessitates immediate preventive measures to safeguard public safety and prevent loss of precious human lives,‚Äù the order said.</p>
<p>It added that the home secretary was thus imposing a complete ban under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure across the province on bathing in accumulated rainwater on streets, roads, open spaces, or any other area where rainwater has collected; swimming in dams, rivers, canals, ponds, lakes and distributaries, and boating by any unauthorised person or for unauthorised purposes in dams, rivers, canals, ponds, lakes and distributaries.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis order shall remain in force for a period of 45 days from the date of issuance unless withdrawn.‚Äù</p>

<p>Punjab Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) Director General Tayyab Farid said that ‚Äúrivers have overflowed due to heavy rains in Rawalpindi, Chakwal and surrounding areas‚Äù, leading to a flood situation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCitizens have been advised to avoid unnecessary travel, stay away from power lines and open manholes,‚Äù the Wasa DG said in a statement.</p>
<p>The PMD‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://ffd.pmd.gov.pk/bulletin/A" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Flood Forecasting Division</a> (FFD) warned that urban flooding was expected in Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Faisalabad divisions during the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>However, it added that the wet spell was likely to subside in the next 48 hours.</p>
<p>In a post on X, the PMD said the heavy monsoon rains triggered a ‚Äúsignificant surge‚Äù in water levels at the <a class="link--external" href="https://ndmc.pmd.gov.pk/new/dam-reservoirs.php?dam=tarbela" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tarbela</a>, <a class="link--external" href="https://ndmc.pmd.gov.pk/new/dam-reservoirs.php?dam=mangla" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mangla</a>, <a class="link--external" href="https://ndmc.pmd.gov.pk/new/dam-reservoirs.php?dam=khanpur" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Khanpur</a>, <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Simly</a> and <a class="link--external" href="https://ndmc.pmd.gov.pk/new/dam-reservoirs.php?dam=rawal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rawal</a> reservoirs.</p>

<p>Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>According to the National Disaster Management Authority‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndma.gov.pk/sitrepm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>, monsoon rains since June 26 have killed 178 people across the country and injured 491 people.</p>
<p>The majority of casualties were recorded in Punjab, the country‚Äôs most populous province, with 103 deaths and 385 injuries. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 38 fatalities, Sindh 20, Balochistan 16 and one death in Azad Kashmir.</p>
<p>Over 57 per cent of nationwide deaths were caused by ‚Äúhouse-collapse‚Äù incidents. Monsoon rains so far have damaged 610 houses and led to the deaths of 126 livestock.</p>
