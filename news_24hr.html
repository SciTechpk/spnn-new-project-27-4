            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump on Friday said he had ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in regions near Russia in response to threats from former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev.</p>
<p>“I have ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that,” Trump said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114954549017557270" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on Truth Social.</p>
<p>“Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences. I hope this will not be one of those instances.”</p>

<p>Trump did not say whether he meant nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed submarines. He also did not elaborate on the locations, which are kept secret by the US military.</p>
<p>The United States and Russia control the vast majority of the world’s nuclear weaponry, and Washington keeps nuclear-armed submarines on patrol as part of its so-called nuclear triad of land, sea and air-launched weapons.</p>
<p>Trump and Medvedev, who is deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, traded taunts in recent days after Trump on Tuesday said Russia had “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927617">10 days from today</a>” to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine or be hit, along with its oil buyers, with tariffs.</p>
<p>Moscow, which has set out its own terms for peace in Ukraine, has shown no sign that it will comply with Trump’s deadline.</p>
<p>Medvedev on Monday accused Trump of engaging in a “game of ultimatums” and reminded him that Russia possessed Soviet-era nuclear strike capabilities of last resort after Trump told Medvedev to “watch his words”.</p>

<p>In response to a post by US Senator Lindsey Graham reiterating America’s seriousness to reach a peace deal, the former Russian president wrote: “It’s not for you or Trump to dictate when to ‘get at the peace table’. Negotiations will end when all the objectives of our military operation have been achieved.</p>

<p>Medvedev has emerged as one of the Kremlin’s most outspoken anti-Western hawks since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in 2022. Kremlin critics deride him as an irresponsible loose cannon, though some Western diplomats say his statements illustrate the thinking in senior Kremlin policy-making circles.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow hoped for more peace talks with Ukraine but that the momentum of the war was in its favour, signalling no shift in his stance despite a looming sanctions deadline from Washington.</p>
<p>Trump has said he will impose new sanctions on Moscow and countries that buy its energy exports — of which the biggest are China and India — unless Russia moves by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927617">August 8</a> to end the three-and-a-half-year war.</p>
<p>Trump has expressed mounting frustration with Putin, accusing him of “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922956">bullshit</a>” and describing Russia’s latest attacks on Ukraine as “disgusting”.</p>
<p>Putin, without referring to the Trump deadline, said three sessions of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926159">peace talks</a> with Ukraine had yielded some positive results, and Russia was expecting negotiations to continue.</p>

<p>“As for any disappointments on the part of anyone, all disappointments arise from inflated expectations. This is a well-known general rule,” he said.</p>
<p>“But in order to approach the issue peacefully, it is necessary to conduct detailed conversations. And not in public, but this must be done calmly, in the quiet of the negotiation process.”</p>
<p>He said Russian troops were attacking Ukraine along the entire front line and that the momentum was in their favour, citing the announcement by his defence ministry on Thursday that Moscow’s forces had captured the Ukrainian town of Chasiv Yar after a 16-month battle.</p>
<p>Ukraine denied that Chasiv Yar was under full Russian control.</p>
<p>Kyiv has, for months, been urging an immediate ceasefire, but Russia says it wants a final and durable settlement, not a pause. Since the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911511">peace talks</a> began in Istanbul in May, it has conducted some of its heaviest air strikes of the war, especially on the capital Kyiv.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian government has said the Russian negotiators do not have the mandate to make significant decisions and that President Volodymyr Zelensky has called on Putin to meet him for talks.</p>
<p>“We understand who makes the decisions in Russia and who must end this war. The whole world understands this too,” Zelensky said on Friday on X, reiterating his call for direct talks between him and Putin.</p>
<p>“The United States has proposed this. Ukraine has supported it. What is needed is Russia’s readiness.” Russia says a leaders’ meeting could only take place to set the seal on agreements reached by negotiators.</p>

<p>Ukraine and its European allies have frequently said they do not believe Putin is really interested in peace and have accused him of stalling, which the Kremlin denies.</p>
<p>“I will repeat once again, we need a long and lasting peace on good foundations that would satisfy both Russia and Ukraine, and ensure the security of both countries,” Putin said, adding that this was also a question of European security.</p>
<p>Putin was speaking alongside his ally Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, at talks on an island in Lake Ladoga that is the site of a famous Russian monastery.</p>
<p>Russian TV earlier showed the two men greeting monks at the Valaam Monastery, where they have met several times before, and holding candles during the chanting of prayers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ukrainian rescuers recovered more than a dozen more bodies from the rubble of a collapsed apartment block in Kyiv overnight, bringing the death toll from Russia’s worst air strike of the year on Ukraine’s capital to 31.</p>
<p>A two-year-old was among the five children found dead after Thursday’s sweeping Russian drone and missile attack, Zelensky said on Friday, announcing the end of a more than 24-hour-long rescue operation.</p>
<p>A total of 159 people were wounded in the multi-wave strike, in which Russia launched more than 300 drones and eight missiles early on Thursday, the latest in a campaign of fierce strikes on Ukrainian towns and cities.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The worst damage was to an apartment building that partially collapsed in the Sviatoshyn district in western Kyiv. Damage was also reported in at least three other districts of the capital.</p>
<p>Natalia Matviyenko, 65, sitting near the damaged apartment building, said she did not place much faith in Trump’s tough rhetoric.</p>
<p>“Trump just says, ‘I’m upset with President Putin’s behaviour.’ And what? No results,” she said.</p>
<p>The US leader, who returned to power on a pledge to swiftly end the war, has in recent weeks rolled back his earlier conciliatory approach toward Moscow and signalled openness to arming Ukraine.</p>
<p>But a diplomatic effort to end the war has stalled, with Moscow not backing down from what Kyiv and its allies describe as maximalist demands.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#will-putin-listen" id="will-putin-listen" title="Permalink"></a>‘Will Putin listen?’</h2>
<p>On Friday, mourners laid flowers and lit candles at the wrecked apartment block, where rumbling excavators hoisted heavy pieces of rubble. The makeshift shrine included brightly coloured stuffed animals.</p>
<p>Oksana Kinal, 43, who was placing flowers to honour a co-worker who had been killed alongside a son, said she hoped Trump would follow up on his threat but also expressed doubt.</p>
<p>“I think America has a lot of points of leverage that can be used against Russia,” she said. “But will Putin listen to this? I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Kyiv’s air force said on Friday that Ukrainian air defences had destroyed more than 6,000 drones and missiles across the country in July alone.</p>
<p>“The world possesses every instrument required to ensure Russia is brought to justice,” Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko wrote on X on Friday. “What is lacking is not power but will.”</p>

            <p><p>PTI founder Imran Khan’s sons on Friday said that United States President Donald Trump was a figure who “can make a difference” in their incarcerated father’s situation.</p>
<p>Imran, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a> since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.</p>
<p>Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim Khan, 26 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910789">called attention</a> to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Last month, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">said</a> they would go to the United States before coming to Pakistan as part of a movement calling for the ex-premier’s release. The siblings visited the US and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926052/imrans-sons-meet-trump-aide-to-kick-off-us-campaign-to-free-father">engaged US lawmakers</a> on the issue of their father’s incarceration.</p>
<p>In an interview on ‘Piers Morgan Uncensored’ aired today, Kasim was questioned on whether he had any message for Trump, to which he said: “If anyone can make a difference, he (Trump) can.”</p>
<p>Kasim said the two had met Trump’s key aide Richard Grenell — known for publicly calling for Imran’s release on X.</p>
<p>“We know that Trump has a great relationship with our father and vice versa.  They had great conversations when they were both in office and they seem to have mutual respect for one another.</p>
<p>“If Trump was able to make a statement or in any way speak to the establishment over there [in Pakistan] to get our father released, I know he’s one of the few people who can, so of course we would love to kind of have a conversation with him or hope for some help from him or support.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Sulaiman said it had been three years since he last met his father and four months since he spoke to him. Kasim said the experience had been “brutal” for the two since they used to regularly speak to him.</p>
<p>Kasim said the two were not ones to publicly speak out, but were now getting “desperate” after having gone so long without any contact with their father.</p>
<p>“When we floated the idea of going, we were told by people in the Pakistani government that we would be arrested and from other people, we heard, you know, we had warnings from family members, inside sources, all sorts of people saying similar [things]. So we’ve still tried to get our visas. We are still looking to go at some point. We’ve applied for our visas but we haven’t had our responses yet. We’ll see what happens.”</p>
<p>Sulaiman said the two were “doing everything we can” to help their father from abroad if they could not go to Pakistan. He added that the two had not yet spoken to anyone in the UK government on the matter.</p>
<p>In their message to state authorities, Sulaiman said: “ Respect democracy, first of all. Respect the will of the Pakistani people which was clear despite huge rigging in the general election in February last year and respect the rule of law and give him a proper, fair trial.“</p>
<p>Kasim said the two were prepared for being arrested upon going to Pakistan. “We’ve been attempting to go for a little while. We’re looking through whatever we can. So what will be, will be. We’ll see what happens. But we 100 per cent will be going at some point, whether he likes it or not,” he added.</p>
<p>Aleema had previously said that the sons would “definitely” come to Pakistan as they had a National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (Nicop) and they were “citizens of Pakistan”. “If anything were to happen to Imran’s sons, it would become an international matter,” she had told reporters.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the PTI <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927421">swiftly rubbished</a> media reports claiming that the incarcerated leader told reporters at Adiala Jail that his sons would not be coming to Pakistan and taking part in or leading any protest.</p>
<p>Although the government has not officially commented on the matter of Imran’s sons, Chaudhry previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926052/imrans-sons-meet-trump-aide-to-kick-off-us-campaign-to-free-father">questioned</a> what, if any, role they would be able to play, adding that they were welcome to visit Pakistan and there would be no obstacle for them. He continued that visas would be issued to them “in less than 24 hours”, provided they stayed within the law.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan">told</a> <em>Dawn.com</em> that Article 16 of the Constitution, which grants the right to gather, was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Malik also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923089">said</a> that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals, and that if they “violate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled”.</p>
<p>There were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan">conflicting statements</a> from PML-N leaders as well on whether the duo would be allowed entry into Pakistan, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they should be allowed to come and “carry out their activities”, but within the limitations of the law.</p>

<p>Earlier, Aleema said the two had applied for their Pakistani visas and were awaiting approval from the interior ministry ahead of their visit to the country.</p>
<p>In a post on X, she said: “A few days ago, Suleiman and Kasim applied for their visas with the Pakistan High Commission in London. The ambassador has intimated that he is awaiting approval from the Ministry of Interior in Islamabad.”</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to Aleema’s post, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry called her out for her previous assertion that the siblings had a  Nicop, questioning why they would need visas if that was the case.</p>
<p>“If they do need visas, that means they are not ‘Pakistani nationals’. What is the real truth behind it all?”</p>

            <p><p>The Haripur Police on Friday arrested a suspect in a honey-trap case that involved the gang rape of a young man after luring him.</p>
<p>The incident occurred within the limits of Haripur’s City Police Station on Wednesday, and a first information report (FIR) was lodged upon the victim’s complaint under Sections 355 (assault or criminal force with intent to dishonour a person) and 375A (gang rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p>
<p>Shaukat Ali, a muharrar at the police station, told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “One suspect has been arrested and raids are underway to apprehend the other two.</p>
<p>“The victim said in his statement that he had struck up a friendship with a girl, who called him from Abbottabad to meet her in Haripur.”</p>
<p>The FIR said that when the young man reached the location where he was called, “three men caught me and beat me up. They took me to one side of the orchard by gunpoint and then forcibly took off my clothes, forcing themselves upon me turn by turn while the third person was recording videos of the ordeal.”</p>
<p>The complainant said the culprits also took away his mobile phone, gifts he brought for the girl and Rs35,000 in cash.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Bahawalnagar police claimed to have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927492">busted</a> a honey-trap gang allegedly involved in the kidnapping, torture, extortion and murder of teenagers by misusing TikTok profiles of female university students and arrested three of its members.</p>
<p>The investigation team told <em>Dawn.com</em> that a 19-year-old boy was lured and later killed by the gang. The investigation led to the arrest of the gang’s suspected ringleader.</p>
<p>The gang reportedly used the TikTok IDs of various university girls to lure young victims. Investigators said the suspects first gained the trust of these students and then misused their social media identities.</p></p>
