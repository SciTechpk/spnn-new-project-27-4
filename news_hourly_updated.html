                <h2>Mastung blast derails 6 bogies as Jaffar Express targeted 2nd time in a week</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>No loss of life was reported after a bomb blast on a railway track in Balochistan‚Äôs Mastung district derailed six bogies of the Jaffar Express, an official said.</p>
<p>With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province‚Äôs transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways‚Äô Quetta division, told <em>Dawn.com</em>: ‚ÄúA bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train. Fortunately, there was no loss of life.‚Äù</p>
<p>The incident occurred near the Spezand station in Mastung‚Äôs Dasht tehsil, when the train was heading from Quetta to Peshawar City station.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecurity forces and rescue teams rushed to the site as soon as they were alerted about the incident, and began a search operation after cordoning off the area,‚Äù Kashif said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>A relief train of the Pakistan Railways will bring back passengers of the affected train to Quetta by evening, and all tickets will be refunded, according to Kashif.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFour bogies of the Jaffar Express had been placed back on the track, while efforts were underway to restore the other two,‚Äù the official noted.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, Kashif said that Jaffar Express trains between Quetta and Peshawar ‚Äî both upwards and downward journeys ‚Äî were cancelled today and tomorrow, as well as on August 13 and 14.</p>
<p>The Bolan Mail will depart from Karachi on August 16 (Saturday) ‚Äúin its proper turn‚Äù and will arrive in Quetta the next day, he added.</p>
<p>Today‚Äôs incident comes just three days after Quetta-bound Jaffar Express <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929447">narrowly escaped</a> a disaster in Balochistan‚Äôs Sibi, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train passed.</p>

<p>In another near-miss incident on July 24, a powerful explosion ripped through the Quetta-Sibi rail section, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926300">damaging a bogie</a> of the Bolan Mail.</p>
<p>A July 28 derailment of the Jaffar Express train in Sindh‚Äôs Sukkur was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927185">initially attributed</a> to an explosion ‚Äî even by government-run media ‚Äî but the Ministry of Railways later said a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927307">technical fault</a> was the cause.</p>
<p>In June, a powerful explosion of a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks caused four bogies of the Jaffer Express to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917945">derail in Jacobabad</a>. No one was hurt in the incident.</p>
<p>In April, the 3UP train heading from Karachi to Quetta was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904018">stopped</a> at Jacobabad railway station due to security reasons.</p>
<p>Train services betw¬≠een Quetta and the rest of the country were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900566">restored</a> on March 27, after they were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897306/all-trains-to-and-from-balochistan-suspended">suspended</a> due to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419">unprecedented hijacking</a> of the Pesha¬≠war-bound Jaffar Express earlier that month.</p>
<p>The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan‚Äôs Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897595/balochistan-standoff-ends-after-all-jaffar-express-hostages-rescued#:~:text=In%20all%2C%2021%20passengers%20lost%20their%20lives%2C%20while%20four%20FC%20personnel%20were%20martyred%2C%20the%20ISPR%20DG%20said.">21 passengers</a> and four security personnel. ‚ÄúAll 33 terrorists‚Äù were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.</p></p>

                <h2>PAA rejects rumours of Islamabad airport being closed for 8 days</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) on Sunday dismissed ‚Äúincorrect and misleading‚Äù media reports about an eight-day closure of Islamabad International Airport, clarifying the exact date and time of the planned shutdown.</p>
<p>A statement by PAA Spokesperson Saifullah Khan said, ‚ÄúAccording to the Notams issued, due to air activities ahead of Independence Day on August 14, arrival and departure flights will be suspended for only two hours on specific days and times.‚Äù</p>
<p>From August 6-9 and August 11-14, the airport will be shut from 11am-1pm PST.</p>
<p>On August 9 and 11, the airport will also be shut from 8-10pm.</p>
<p>‚ÄúApart from these brief interruptions, all flights at the airport will continue as usual,‚Äù the statement said, advising passengers to contact their airline for the latest information on their schedule.</p>
<p>The government has said that this year‚Äôs Independence Day would be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922864/govt-announces-independence-day-to-be-celebrated-under-theme-of-marka-i-haq">celebrated</a> under the banner of ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a>‚Äù (Battle of Truth) ‚Äî the period of conflict with India in May ‚Äî to demonstrate the nation‚Äôs resilience, progress and pride.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>While discussing the activities of the scheduled celebrations, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal stressed that every sector and official in charge should ensure that all universities and schools observe the day in the same format. The same was advised for provincial celebrations and celebrations abroad in collaboration with the Overseas Ministry.</p>
<p>During the four-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">conflict</a> between Pakistan and India, flight disruptions left hundreds of passengers <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909570">stranded</a> at the country‚Äôs major airports, including Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Sialkot airports.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defence informed the National Assembly on Friday that the PAA <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929682">lost</a> Rs4.1 billion from April 24 to June 30 due to the closure.</p>
<p>PAA also issued a schedule for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920506/lahore-airport-closure-scheduled-to-avoid-bird-strikes">temporary</a> runway closure at Lahore‚Äôs Allama Iqbal International airport owing to bird activity. The closure will be in effect daily from 5am to 8am, starting July 1 until September 15.</p></p>
