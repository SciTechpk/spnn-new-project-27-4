            <p><p>Lt General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, director general of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), has lauded Iran’s peace efforts in the recent Pakistan-India conflict and warned of “forces” seeking to create a rift among brotherly countries.</p>
<p>Just two days after India, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">without</a> any evidence, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack">blamed</a> Pakistan over last month’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, Iran had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">offered to mediate</a> between the two as tensions escalated.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is fully grateful to the international community, and we are especially grateful to brotherly countries, including the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Gen Chaudhry told <em>IRNA</em> in an <a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85835207/Exclusive-Pakistani-military-spokesperson-Islamabad-appreciates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> published today — the first by any Pakistani armed forces’ spokesperson to an Iranian outlet.</p>
<p>“We should be aware that there are forces in the region that, with the help of external factors, are seeking to create misunderstanding and confusion among brotherly countries in the region and want to create a rift between friends and brothers,” the DG ISPR added.</p>

<p>According to <em>IRNA</em>, Lt Gen Chaudhry spoke about the latest developments in South Asia as well as the “importance of regional and international diplomacy to help de-escalate tensions”. He also “focused” on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">recent visit</a> of Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to Islamabad, the report added.</p>
<p>During his visit to Islamabad, Araghchi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">met with</a> Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir. He later also made a trip <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909355/irans-foreign-minister-repeats-call-for-restraint-in-india-pakistan-standoff">to New Delhi</a>, reiterating his call for restraint.</p>

<p>The DG ISPR appreciated Tehran’s efforts and support to help de-escalate tensions in the region.</p>
<p>“We are pleased with all the efforts of the international community and brotherly countries, especially Iran, which played a role in reducing tensions,” he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as tensions over the Pahalgam attack continued to build up. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting drones</a> sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, for both sides to finally drop their guns as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> was reached.</p>
<p>The Pakistani army spokesman emphasised that Iran and Pakistan “have very historical and brotherly relations and have always stood by each other in all challenges and trials”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry highlighted that the two nations were “neighbouring and friendly countries that are in contact with each other on many issues and fields”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is eager and pursues that the borders of the two countries are the borders of peace and friendship, and we look forward to it,” the DG ISPR told <em>IRNA</em>.</p>
<p>The military’s spokesperson stressed that Tehran and Islamabad were “cooperating together for lasting peace and stability in the region”.</p>

<p>Separately, the ISPR said President Asif Ali Zardari visited Gujranwala Cantonment today where he lauded the “exemplary conduct and professional excellence” of the military in the successful execution of Marqa-i-Haq, acknowledging their “resolute determination and unshakable courage in the face of unprovoked aggression”.</p>
<p>“He paid solemn tribute to the military and civilian martyrs who laid down their lives in defence of the motherland, affirming that their sacrifice remains a sacred trust and a source of enduring national pride. He underscored that the sons of the soil, fortified by the enduring spirit of the nation, stood with unwavering resolve to defend the motherland and thwarted hostile designs with exceptional valour and operational acumen.”</p>
<p>The president said history would bear witness to how, “within a matter of hours, the Pakistan Armed Forces repelled aggression with unmatched precision and resolve, sending an unequivocal message” of the country’s strength, resilience and national unity.</p>
<p>During his interaction with officers and troops, the president commended their “exemplary morale, combat readiness and devotion to duty”.</p>
<p>The ISPR added that he extended congratulations on the successful culmination of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, and expressed “profound pride in the defenders of the nation, affirming that the people of Pakistan hold their brave soldiers in the highest esteem as the true custodians of national honour and sovereignty”.</p>

<p>Separately, PML-N President and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif praised the armed forces and parliament for national unity.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the PML-N said Nawaz lauded the professionalism and bravery of the armed forces, saying they “defended the motherland like an iron wall against Indian aggression”.</p>
<p>“We offer our deepest gratitude to God for granting us success,” he was quoted as saying during a meeting with PML-N Parliamentary Leader in the Senate and Chairman of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Senator Irfan Siddiqui, who called on him in Raiwind.</p>
<p>Nawaz also lauded the role of parliament, saying that “setting aside all political differences and speaking with one voice for the sake of national security” was a welcome and commendable step.</p>
<p>“By reflecting the emotions of 240 million citizens, the people’s representatives boosted the spirit of the brave armed forces,” he said.</p>
<p>He also commended Pakistani media for “presenting the truth before the world and exposing the enemy’s falsehoods”.</p>
<p>Senator Siddiqui briefed the PML-N president on the parliamentary party’s performance during the session. Nawaz underscored the importance of institutional collaboration, stating that parliament’s unified stance had reinforced national resolve and showcased Pakistan’s democratic maturity in times of crisis.</p>
<p>The statement concluded that the meeting underscored the PML-N’s commitment to upholding state interests and its confidence in democratic institutions.</p>

            <p><p>PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khanum and former party MNA Kanwal Shauzab had a tense exchange in court on Saturday over a video that surfaced of the latter criticising the former.</p>
<p>In the recently surfaced video, Shauzab can be allegedly heard and seen criticising Aleema for disrespecting party office-holders and interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, saying that Imran’s sister should not dent the party. Shauzab allegedly said she would confront Aleema herself over the issue.</p>
<p>That happened today as Shauzab approached Aleema in the Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court (ATC), saying she wanted to talk to her. However, Imran’s sister said: “Just leave it. What you said was right. Many other people speak against us. We are now used to such accusations.”</p>
<p>To this, Shauzab told her that she wanted to speak with her in this regard to which Aleema rebuffed her, saying: “I am not angry with you, [now] go.”</p>
<p>Shauzab replied: “A specific part of an old video of mine was used against me.” Aleema subsequently told her that many from the PML-N and other parties also spoke against her. Imran’s sister thereafter left while ignoring the party member.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah rejected Aleema’s petition requesting permission to exempt her from court appearances so she could travel abroad.</p>
<p>Talking to the media outside the court, she said she had been visiting the courts for the past week due to “newer and newer cases”, alleging that they were being filed to impede her travel abroad.</p>
<p>She questioned who was afraid of her and why for going abroad.</p>
<p>Aleema further alleged that there were around 50-60 cases against her for delivering her brother’s messages to the people.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Islamabad High Court Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910842/ihc-removes-raoof-aleema-from-no-fly-lists">directed the removal</a> of her name from the Provisional National Immigration List and Passport Control List.</p>
<p>Aleema had approached the court to challenge the inclusion of her name in the travel ban lists. The court had allowed her to seek permission to travel abroad by approaching the relevant trial court handling the cases registered against her.</p></p>

            <p><p>Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused Donald Trump on Saturday of lying when the US president said during his Gulf tour this week that he wanted peace in the region.</p>
<p>On the contrary, said Khamenei, the United States uses its power to give “10-ton bombs to the Zionist (Israeli) regime to drop on the heads of Gaza’s children”.</p>
<p>Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One after departing the United Arab Emirates on Friday that Iran had to move quickly on a US proposal for its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911291/trump-claims-n-deal-with-iran-likely-hopes-to-avoid-military-action">nuclear programme</a> or “something bad’s going to happen”.</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Trump speaks about peace while simultaneously making threats.</p>
<p>“Which should we believe?” Pezeshkian said at a naval event in Tehran.</p>
<p>“On the one hand, he speaks of peace and on the other, he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901324">threatens</a> with the most advanced tools of mass killing.”</p>
<p>Tehran would continue Iran-US nuclear talks but is not afraid of threats.</p>
<p>“We are not seeking war,” Pezeshkian said.</p>
<p>His remarks, said Khamenei, “aren’t even worth responding to.”</p>
<p>They are an “embarrassment to the speaker and the American people,” Khamenei added.</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly, the source of corruption, war, and conflict in this region is the Zionist regime — a dangerous, deadly cancerous tumour that must be uprooted; it will be uprooted,” he said at an event at a religious centre in Tehran, according to state media.</p>
<p>While Trump said on Friday that Iran had a US proposal about its nuclear programme, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi in a post on X said Tehran had not received any such proposal.</p>

<p>“There is no scenario in which Iran abandons its hard-earned right to (uranium) enrichment for peaceful purposes…” he said.</p>
<p>Araqchi warned on Saturday that Washington’s constant change of stance prolongs nuclear talks, state TV reported.</p>
<p>“It is absolutely unacceptable that America repeatedly defines a new framework for negotiations that prolongs the process,” the broadcast quoted Araqchi as saying.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian said Iran would not “back down from our legitimate rights”.</p>
<p>“Because we refuse to bow to bullying, they say we are source of instability in the region,” he said.</p>
<p>A fourth <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1910194'">round</a> of Iran-US talks ended in Oman last Sunday.</p>
<p>A new round has not been scheduled yet.</p></p>
