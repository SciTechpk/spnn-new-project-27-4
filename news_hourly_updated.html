                <h2>Not possible for govt to provide housing for all residents of dilapidated buildings: Sharjeel Memon</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>As people continue to be evacuated from nearby structures following a deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050">building collapse</a> in Karachi‚Äôs congested Lyari neighbourhood that left <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922486/death-toll-in-lyari-building-collapse-stands-at-27-as-rescue-operation-ends-on-3rd-day">27 people dead</a>, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said on Wednesday it would not be possible for the government to provide housing to all residents living in dilapidated buildings.</p>
<p>The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market collapsed on Friday morning, with the rescue operations concluding on Sunday. The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, with the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) saying it had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=SBCA%20says%20issued%20multiple%20prior%20notices%20to%20vacate%20building">issued multiple prior notices</a> to residents to vacate the structure since 2023.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>GeoNews</em>, Memon said that there were 740 dilapidated buildings across Sindh, out of which 51 were in ‚Äúextremely dangerous‚Äù condition, out of which 11 buildings had been vacated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOrders have been issued to vacate the others in the next 48 hours for residents‚Äô safety,‚Äù Memon said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, it won‚Äôt be possible for the government to provide housing to all residents living in dilapidated buildings,‚Äù the minister said, adding that there was no such law obligating the government to do so.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNonetheless, the government in the past had provided temporary shelters to flood victims and Covid-19 patients for quarantine,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhatever space is available with the government, we will provide that for housing to the most deserving residents who have no other option available [for housing].‚Äù</p>
<p>Memon‚Äôs comments come a day after the Sindh government announced the suspension of SBCA Director General Ishaque Khuhro over the building collapse.</p>
<p>According to Local Government (LG) Minister Saeed Ghani, other SBCA officials who were suspended included the director, deputy director and building inspectors assigned to Lyari. He also noted that the Sindh government has announced Rs1 million in compensation to the families of the 27 deceased people.</p>
<p>Major opposition parties ‚Äî the PTI, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and Jamaat-i-Islami ‚Äî have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922336/sindh-govt-sbca-earn-oppositions-ire-over-lyari-tragedy">condemned</a> the PPP‚Äôs Sindh government, the SBCA and other authorities, accusing them of ‚Äúcriminal negligence‚Äù that led to the disaster.</p>
<p>They not only demanded compensation and alternative residences for the affected families but also called for the registration of manslaughter cases against the officials responsible for the tragedy.</p>

<p>In April, a 10-year-old girl <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907402/minor-girl-dies-in-building-collapse">died</a> when a three-storey building in Bhains Colony suddenly collapsed, while a man and a woman were pulled alive from the debris.</p>
<p>In October 2023, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1780534/five-killed-as-another-building-going-up-illegally-collapses">five people</a> were killed and four others injured when an under-construction building collapsed in Shah Faisal Colony.</p>

<p>Lyari also faced a similar incident in June 2020, when <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1562672">22 people</a> were killed after a five-storey residential building housing about 40 apartments <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1561975/1-dead-4-injured-after-residential-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari-neighbourhood?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20dawn-news%20%28Dawn%20News%29">collapsed</a>.</p>

                <h2>Netanyahu nominates Trump for Nobel Peace Prize as Gazans await ceasefire</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he has nominated Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, presenting the US president with a letter he sent to the prize committee.</p>
<p>The move comes as Israel continues its onslaught on Gaza, which has so far killed 57,523 Palestinians. Last year, the UN-backed International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1874034">issued</a> arrest warrants for Netanyahu, citing allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court said he, along with ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, ‚Äúintentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival‚Äù, including food, water, medicine, fuel, and electricity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs forging peace as we speak, in one country, in one region after the other,‚Äù Netanyahu said at a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922520">dinner</a> with Trump at the White House.</p>

<p>Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514">nominations</a> from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years and has made no secret of his irritation at missing out on the prestigious award.</p>
<p>The Republican has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514#:~:text=Trump%20complains%20about%20not%20getting%20Nobel%20prize%20for%20%E2%80%98stopping%E2%80%99%20multiple%20wars">complained</a> that he had been overlooked by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">mediating role</a> in conflicts between India and Pakistan, as well as Serbia and Kosovo.</p>
<p>In 2024, he <a class="link--external" href="https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/trump-grumbles-about-obama-s-nobel-peace-prize-and-claims-he-deserved-it-more/ar-AA1sVZiM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">insisted</a> that he was more deserving of a Nobel than ex-president Barack Obama, and complained how it was unfair that ‚Äúanybody else‚Äù but him would have been honoured with one.</p>
<p>In June, Pakistan had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514/govt-to-recommend-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize-for-decisive-diplomatic-intervention-in-india-pakistan-crisis">decided</a> to formally recommend Trump for the coveted prize, given his role in de-escalating the India-Pakistan conflict when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">US mediation</a>.</p>
<p>However, as the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">joined</a> Israel‚Äôs war with Iran and launched attacks on three Iranian nuclear facilities, Pakistani lawmakers, activists, authors and ex-diplomats <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919128/fazl-others-urge-govt-to-review-decision-to-nominate-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize">criticised the move</a>. A resolution was also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919467#:~:text=In%20the%20resolution,in%20the%20region.%E2%80%9D">submitted</a> in the Senate by the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl to rescind the decision but led to no tangible outcome as Pakistan had not officially submitted the nomination.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Trump has also demanded credit for ‚Äúkeeping peace‚Äù between Egypt and Ethiopia and brokering the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements aiming to normalise relations between Israel and several Arab nations.</p>
<p>He campaigned for office as a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20what%20I%20want%20to%20be%3A%20a%20peacemaker%20and%20unifier.">peacemaker</a>‚Äù who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging more than five months into his presidency.</p></p>
