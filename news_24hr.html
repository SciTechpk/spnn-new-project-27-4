            <p><p>At least eight security personnel were martyred in a suicide blast in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district on Saturday, according to a statement issued by the KP chief minister’s office, updating the previous toll of four injured.</p>
<p>According to the statement, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur condemned the attack, which took place in the Mir Ali area in North Waziristan, and expressed his condolences and prayers for the martyrdom of the personnel.</p>
<p>“I salute security personnel and their families who have sacrificed their lives for the country and the nation,” Gandapur was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>“Security forces have made unprecedented sacrifices to establish peace in the country and eliminate terrorism,” the CM added. “These sacrifices further raise the resolve and morale of the nation against terrorism.</p>
<p>“Everyone in the nation stands with security forces in the war against terrorism,” the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Earlier, District Police Officer (DPO) Waqar Ahmed told <em>Dawn.com</em> that four civilians were injured in the “suicide attack” carried out through a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device.</p>
<p>The attack comes days after two soldiers were martyred and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919801/two-soldiers-martyred-11-terrorists-killed-in-south-waziristan-ibo-ispr">11 terrorists</a> were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in KP’s South Waziristan district.</p>
<p>No one has so far claimed responsibility.</p>
<p>On June 15, a Frontier Corps (FC) soldier was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917345/fc-soldier-cop-martyred-in-waziristan-orakzai-attacks">martyred</a> in a targeted gun attack in Ladha tehsil of Upper South Waziristan district.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915363">14 terrorists</a> were killed in North Waziristan’s Datta Khel town during a security operation.</p>

<p>The military has said India was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">using its “assets”</a> to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, with ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry detailing “irr­e­futable evidence” of an Ind­ian military personnel’s involvement.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>The country ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>

            <p><p>Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan has ordered the suspension of 26 opposition MPAs for 15 sittings of the provincial legislature after their protests disrupted the proceedings, it emerged on Saturday.</p>
<p>The members raised slogans and protested during Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920664">speech</a> in the assembly yesterday, when she responded to PTI leadership’s comments that ex-premier Nawaz Sharif — also an MNA — had been removed from the political arena.</p>
<p>According to an order issued by Malik on Friday, the suspended MPAs “became disorderly, beyond all parliamentary reasoning and practices”, including tearing the agenda papers and hurling torn pieces towards the treasury benches as well as using “offensive, abusive, and unparliamentary language and slogans”.</p>
<p>The order was issued under Rule 210 of the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pap.gov.pk/uploads/downloads/rules_of_procedure_5.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Punjab Assembly Rules of Procedure 1997</a> (power to order withdrawal or suspension of member) and stated that the 26 MPAs violated four provisions of Rule 223.</p>
<p>These were (c) (shall not interrupt any member while speaking by disorderly expression or noises or in any other disorderly manner), (f) (shall maintain silence when not speaking in the assembly), (h) (shall not chant slogans, display banners or placards, throw and tear table documents and reports, etc), and (i) (shall not indulge in rowdy behaviour).</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The MPAs also allegedly manhandled the treasury members, blocking their way as they tried to approach the treasury benches with “threatening gestures”.</p>
<p>Malik, in his order, said he repeatedly tried to call the assembly to order, but the opposition “declined to act in accordance with the Rules and persisted with misconduct and disorder and kept challenging my orders and authority”.</p>
<p>The speaker concluded that the opposition MPAs had “disregarded [his] authority as speaker […] consistently and willfully obstructing the business of the assembly”.</p>
<p>Out of the 26 MPAs suspended, 17 were listed as belonging to the Sunni Ittehad Council, which PTI-affiliated candidates <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1816169">joined</a> last year after their party was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1805488">deprived</a> of its election symbol. At least eight others, however, were stated as PTI MPAs.</p>

<p>Separately, the Punjab Assembly secretary general has also fined 10 MPAs Rs203,550 each for allegedly damaging public property during the June 16 session, according to a letter issued today.</p>
<p>According to Malik, opposition members had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920507#:~:text=The%20speaker%20recalled%20that%20on%20June%2016%2C%20opposition%20members%20tried%20to%20interrupt%20the%20budget%20speech">tried to interrupt</a> the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917559">budget speech</a> by Finance Minister Mian Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman. He claimed SIC’s Hassan Malik had hit the minister with the budget book repeatedly, causing the Rehman to stop his address.</p>
<p>The letter by Chaudhry Amer Habib to the 10 lawmakers stated that the fine was being imposed on account of damages, as eight microphones were broken after the named individuals climbed upon the desks. It also cited a video recording of the incident.</p>
<p>The statement added that if the payment was not made within seven days, action would be taken under the <a class="link--external" href="https://punjablaws.punjab.gov.pk/uploads/articles/punjab-government-dues-recovery-ordinance-1962-pdf.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Punjab Government Dues Recovery Ordinance 1962</a>.</p>

<p>The 10 MPAs included six who have been suspended over yesterday’s session — SIC’s Tanveer Aslam, Imtiaz Mahmood and Riffat, along with PTI’s Nisar, Ismael and Aurangzaib.</p>
<p>Others were Shahbaz Ahmed, PTI’s Chaudhry Javed Kausar and Mohammad Ahsan Ali, and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen’s Asad Abbas.</p>
<p>The MPAs, the letter said, had violated Rule 223 (r), which states that a lawmaker “shall not break or harm any furniture, equipment or device installed in the chamber”.</p>

            <p><p>The British government has distanced the incoming head of its foreign intelligence service from her grandfather following reports he was a Nazi spy known as “the Butcher”.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917604/mi6-appoints-first-woman-chief-in-its-116-year-history">Blaise Metreweli</a> will, in the autumn, become the first woman to lead MI6 in its 116-year-old history, the British government announced earlier this month.</p>
<p><em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14851451/grandfather-new-head-MI6-Nazi-spy-chief.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Daily Mail</a></em> newspaper reported this week that her grandfather Constantine Dobrowolski defected from the Soviet Union’s Red Army to become a Nazi informant in the Chernigiv region of modern-day Ukraine.</p>
<p>The newspaper said German archives showed Dobrowolski was known as “the Butcher” or “Agent No 30” by Wehrmacht commanders.</p>
<p>“Blaise Metreweli neither knew nor met her paternal grandfather,” a Foreign Office spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Blaise’s ancestry is characterised by conflict and division and, as is the case for many with eastern European heritage, only partially understood. It is precisely this complex heritage which has contributed to her commitment to prevent conflict and protect the British public from modern threats from today’s hostile states, as the next chief of MI6.”</p>
<p><em>The Daily Mail</em> said Dobrowolski had a 50,000 ruble bounty placed on him by Soviet leaders, and was dubbed the “worst enemy of the Ukrainian people”.</p>
<p>He also sent letters to superiors saying he “personally” took part in “the extermination of the Jews”, the newspaper added.</p>
<p>The head of MI6 is the only publicly named member of the organisation and reports directly to the foreign minister.</p>
<p>Metreweli, 47, will be the 18th head of MI6.</p>
<p>Like her predecessors, she will be referred to as “C”, not “M” as the chief is called in the James Bond film franchise.</p></p>
