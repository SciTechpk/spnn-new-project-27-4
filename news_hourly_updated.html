                <h2>PM, president stress protecting minority rights, hail their patriotism</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistani leadership, including President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the rights of minorities while hailing their services to the country on Monday, in celebration of National Minorities Day.</p>
<p>National Minorities Day is celebrated on August 11 every year. It commemorates the historic speech by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, made on Aug 11, 1947, where he emphasised equal rights for all citizens regardless of religion. The day aims to highlight the religious and socio-economic rights of minorities in Pakistan.</p>
<p>In separate addresses today, President Zardari and PM Shehbaz both reaffirmed their commitment to safeguarding and advancing the rights of minorities while acknowledging their contributions to the country.</p>
<p>The president reaffirmed his resolve to continue efforts to promote interfaith harmony, brotherhood and unity to build an inclusive and prosperous Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis day reflects Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah‚Äôs vision of a Pakistan where every citizen lives in equality, harmony, and mutual respect,‚Äù he said, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://ppp.org.pk/pr/34450/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>

<p>The president said that the Constitution guaranteed equal rights to all citizens ‚Äúirrespective of religion, caste, creed, or colour‚Äù, and that it safeguarded the political, economic, religious, social and cultural rights of minorities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan stands resolutely against all forms of discrimination, extremism, and religious intolerance,‚Äù he stressed. ‚ÄúWe remain determined to build a society free from prejudice ‚Äî one that embraces diversity as a strength and is anchored in mutual respect, interfaith harmony, and shared progress.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that the day was also an occasion to acknowledge the contributions of the minority communities to nation-building, saying that they had served the country with dedication in the armed forces, judiciary, civil services, education and healthcare.</p>
<p>Their patriotism and service remained a ‚Äúsource of pride for the entire nation‚Äù, he added.</p>
<p>The president noted measures taken by the country for the welfare and empowerment of minorities, including the establishment of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924935#:~:text=National%20Commission%20for%20Minority%20Rights%E2%80%99%20has%20been%20approved%20by%20both%20houses%20of%20parliament">National Commission for Minorities</a>, allocation of a Minorities Welfare Fund, restoration and preservation of places of worship and provision of scholarships and financial assistance to minority students.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe continue to promote interfaith dialogue and ensure meaningful participation of minorities in every sphere of national life,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, PM Shehbaz also reaffirmed the government‚Äôs commitment to the full inclusion of minorities in government institutions, the parliament and the national mainstream while appreciating their role in the country‚Äôs development and progress.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan is proud of its minorities‚Äô patriotism, professional hard work and attachment to national heritage and culture,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe welfare and well-being of all minorities in Pakistan, be they Sikhs, Christians, Hindus [or] Parsis, is one of the priority duties of the government of Pakistan,‚Äù the premier said.</p>

<p>He emphasised the services rendered by minorities ‚Äúin every walk of life‚Äù, including those who had sacrificed their lives defending Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe pay tribute to them from the bottom of our hearts,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The PM also stressed that protecting minority rights, aside from a constitutional obligation, was also a religious duty. ‚ÄúIslam specifically advocates the protection of civil, religious and social rights of minorities. Ulema and religious leaders play a key role in protecting religious freedom,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He called on all Pakistanis to practise unity and solidarity, mutual respect and tolerance.</p>
<p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also acknowledged National Minorities Day, appreciating the role of minorities in the development of the country.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe true strength and beauty of Pakistan lies in its diversity,‚Äù he said in a post on social media, calling the safeguarding and respecting of minority rights an ‚Äúunbreakable pillar of the country‚Äôs democratic vision‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur struggle is for a Pakistan where no citizen feels isolated or unsafe due to their religion, but where bonds of brotherhood rise above prejudice.‚Äù</p>

<p>Statements were also made by Human Rights Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar and Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah.</p>
<p>Tarar called the occasion a ‚Äúsolemn reminder of our shared responsibility to ensure that every citizen of Pakistan enjoys equality, justice, and respect, irrespective of faith‚Äù.</p>
<p>He echoed the messages of the PM and president, emphasising the vision of the country‚Äôs founding father for a state ‚Äúwhere religion would never hinder the rights, dignity, or equal standing of its people‚Äù, as well as Islamic teachings to ‚Äúuphold justice without exception‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet us pledge to build a Pakistan where diversity is celebrated, unity is our strength, and justice remains our guiding principle‚Äù, the minister said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CM Murad condemned intolerance against minorities and reaffirmed the province‚Äôs commitment to peaceful co-existence.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOur beloved Sindh has always been tolerant and progressive in terms of religious freedom,‚Äù he said while addressing a gathering at a Hindu temple in Karachi. During his speech, he compared the province to ‚Äúintolerant‚Äù Western democracies.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn our province, across the board, we condemn actions against minorities because we are the land of Sufis,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúThe Sufis of Sindh have always given the same lesson, which is that we should all co-exist in peace and harmony.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am happy to see today that our Hindu, Sikh and Parsi brothers are standing and celebrating the day together.‚Äù</p>
<p>He reaffirmed that the government of Sindh would ‚Äúalways stand with minorities‚Äù and that action would always be taken against any ‚Äúunfortunate incident‚Äù against minorities in Sindh.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the Sindh Workers Welfare Board decided to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929987/sindh-govt-to-extend-e-bike-scheme-to-minority-workers">extend</a> its upcoming electric bikes scheme beyond women to industrial workers from minority communities.</p>

<p>However, despite the leadership‚Äôs statements, religious freedom remains a challenge in Pakistan, with recurring incidents of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1837480">mob attacks</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918828">forced conversions</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1841740">blasphemy cases</a>, as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924935#:~:text=human%20rights%20defenders.-,Sebastien%20Lorion,-%2C%20Team%20Leader%2C%20Governance">noted</a> by the European Union‚Äôs Sebastien Lorion.</p>
<p>Last month, State Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Kesoo Mal Kheal Das <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924935">acknowledged</a> that religious minorities in the country face administrative and governance issues.</p>
<p>According to Kheal Das, the law for the establishment of the National Commission for Minority Rights has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904861">approved</a> by both houses of the parliament and awaits presidential assent.</p></p>

                <h2>Govt begins 2nd phase of receiving Haj 2026 applications</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony has opened the second phase of receiving Haj applications for 2026, which will be accepted from August 11 to August 16, state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/11-08-2025/2nd-phase-of-receiving-hajj-applications-begins" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> reported on Monday.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the ministry <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ptv.com.pk/mobileView/ptvWorldMobile/newsdetail/10626" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">successfully completed</a> the first phase for Haj next year, receiving more than 71,000 application submissions through its online portal and designated banks, the ministry‚Äôs spokesperson Muhammad Umar Butt said in a statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the second phase, which will continue till Saturday, unregistered intending pilgrims can also submit their applications. The process of receiving applications will continue through the ministry‚Äôs online portal and designated banks,‚Äù the report said.</p>

<p>Overseas Pakistanis can also apply for Haj through designated banks via a close relative. ‚ÄúThose living abroad will be required to submit their medical fitness certificates upon arrival in Pakistan,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870331">highest</a> Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Last month, the federal cabinet formally approved the Haj Policy 2026, outlining key procedural, financial, and logistic measures for the pilgrimage season.</p>
<p>Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, Sardar Muhammad Yousaf said during a presser that the Kingdom allocated a total quota of 179,210 pilgrims for Pakistan ‚Äî 119,210 under the government scheme and 60,000 for private operators ‚Äî pending final confirmation by Saudi authorities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe government scheme will offer both the traditional 38‚Äì42-day package and a shorter 20‚Äì25-day option,‚Äù the minister said, according to the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/govt-approves-hajj-policy-2026-quota-set-at-179210-hajj-payments-to-begin-from-august-4/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)</a></em>.</p>
<p>He added that estimated costs would range between Rs1.15 to Rs1.25 million, depending on the finalised agreements with service providers.</p></p>
