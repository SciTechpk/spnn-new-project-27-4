                <h2>2 martyred, 2 injured as gunmen attack Balochistan Constabulary convoy in Mastung: govt</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A Balochistan Constabulary acting deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and a constable were martyred and two others suffered injuries on Friday when unidentified gunmen opened fire on their vehicle on National Highway in the Mastung district, provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind said.</p>
<p>There has been an increase in the frequency of attacks against security forces in Balochistan in recent times. In April, three policemen were martyred and at least 16 others were injured in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904388">blast</a> that targeted a vehicle of the Balochistan Constabulary on Mastung‚Äôs Dasht Road.</p>
<p>According to Rind‚Äôs statement, ‚ÄúA police convoy coming from Kalat to Quetta was targeted by terrorists.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúActing DSP Inspector Abdul Razzaq and Constable Raza Muhammad Jam were martyred in the attack, while Constable Taj Muhammad and Constable Khursheed Ahmed were injured,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Rind further said that the dead bodies and injured personnel were transferred to Quetta by helicopter.</p>
<p>He continued, ‚ÄúTerrorist incidents are a manifestation of the despair of the enemies of peace. The morale of the people of Balochistan and the security forces cannot be diminished.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúA formal investigation into the attack has been launched, and the elements involved will be brought to justice,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MOIofficialGoP/status/1946184457519612385" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from his office, extending his condolences and assailing <em>Fitna-Al-Hindustan</em> ‚Äî a term the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525#:~:text=Govt%20designates%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20for%20terrorist%20groups%20in%20Balochistan">uses</a> for terrorist organisations in Balo¬≠chistan.</p>

<p>Earlier today, the spokesperson said that one Balochistan Constabulary officer was martyred and three others were injured in the incident.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAccording to initial reports, the acting DSP‚Äôs vehicle was targeted,‚Äù Rind said in a statement.</p>
<p>The assailants opened fire on the vehicle near the Choto area of Mastung on the National Highway, the statement elaborated.</p>
<p>Rind stated that ‚Äúa search operation is underway to apprehend the assailants, and security forces have been dispatched to the site of the attack‚Äù.</p>
<p>The injured officers were immediately rushed to Shaheed Nawab Ghaus Bakhsh Hospital in Quetta, he added.</p>
<p>On July 16, three people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924597">killed</a> and seven others were injured as a passenger bus was fired upon in Balochistan‚Äôs Kalat. Earlier this month, three cops were injured in an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922575/3-cops-injured-in-blast-on-highway-police-vehicle-in-balochistans-nasirabad">attack</a> on a highway police vehicle in Balochistan‚Äôs Nasirabad District.</p>
<p>In a separate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923165">incident</a> on July 9, unknown attackers hurled a grenade at a police checkpoint at the Sibi-Harnai railway crossing gate. The grenade exploded at the post, but no injuries were reported.</p>
<p>On June 21, two personnel of the Frontier Corps were martyred and four were injured in a bomb attack in Kalat‚Äôs Mongochar area.</p></p>

                <h2>Security forces foil infiltration bid by terrorists on Pak-Afghan border: state media</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Security forces have foiled an infiltration attempt by terrorists along the Pak-Afghan border and arrested five ‚Äúalleged suicide bombers‚Äù, state-run <em>PTV News</em> reported on Friday.</p>
<p>Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">witnessed</a> an uptick in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistani security forces have foiled an infiltration attempt by <em>Khawarij</em> along the Pak-Afghan border,‚Äù <em>PTV News</em> reported, citing security sources.</p>
<p><em>Khawarij</em> is a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna">term</a> the state uses to refer to terrorists.</p>
<p><em>PTV</em> said, quoting security sources, that on July 17, at around 5pm, <em>Khawarij</em> tried to cross the border and enter Pakistan, but the forces, on receiving immediate information, set up checkpoints at various places and prevented them from proceeding ahead with their attempt.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe <em>Khawarij</em> advanced towards Azizkhel and Mandikhel, but due to the heavy presence of security forces, they were forced to take refuge in the mosque in Besikhel, where the forces immediately surrounded them and forced them to surrender,‚Äù the state broadcaster said.</p>
<p>All five suspects arrested are Afghan citizens aged between 15 and 18. Three of them also have Afghan identity cards. They have been shifted to an undisclosed location for further interrogation.</p>
<p>Security authorities have issued an alert in the border areas and are continuing search operations to stop potential terrorists, <em>PTV</em> added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecurity sources say that India is giving full support to the <em>Khawarij</em> separatist movement to fuel terrorism in Pakistan,‚Äù <em>PTV News</em> said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#asi-constable-injured-in-quadcopter-attack-police" id="asi-constable-injured-in-quadcopter-attack-police" title="Permalink"></a>ASI, constable injured in quadcopter attack: police</h2>
<p>A police assistant sub-inspector (ASI) and a constable were injured when the Meryan police station in KP‚Äôs Bannu area was struck by terrorists with a quadcopter drone today.</p>
<p>Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told <em>Dawn.com</em> that this was the sixth time the police station was attacked by quadcopters, resulting in injuries to two police officials.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe injured ASI and police constable were moved to the district headquarters hospital for medical assistance,‚Äù DPO Kulachi said, adding that Meryan police station was ‚Äúcrucial for combating terrorists in the district‚Äù.</p>
<p>The DPO said that terrorists had started using quadcopters to target police infrastructure and personnel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNational unity and support are significantly needed to fight collectively against the terrorists and eliminate them,‚Äù the DPO said ‚ÄúPolice alone cannot handle them without the cooperation of the public.‚Äù</p>
<p>Earlier this month, security forces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922232/30-terrorists-killed-as-forces-thwart-border-breach">foiled</a> an infiltration attempt from Afghanistan by an ‚ÄúIndian proxy‚Äù, killing at least 30 terrorists in North Waziristan district, ISPR had said.</p>
<p>On July 9, security forces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908178">killed</a> eight militants attempting to infiltrate from Afghanistan into Bajaur district.</p>
<p>Official sources said the militants were killed in Lowi Mamund tehsil after they tried to cross into the district from Afghanistan‚Äôs Kunar province.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921445">witnessed</a> a slight overall decline in militant violence during June 2025 despite several high-profile attacks, according to data released by an Islamabad-based think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss).</p>
<p>The monthly security assessment shows there were a total of 78 militant attacks across the country in June, resulting in at least 100 fatalities, including 53 security personnel, 39 civilians, six militants, and two members of peace committees, the organisation said in a press statement.</p></p>
