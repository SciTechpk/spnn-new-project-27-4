            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday reiterated Pakistan’s willingness for a “meaningful dialogue” with India on all outstanding issues, state media <a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/23-07-2025/pakistan-ready-for-meaningful-dialogue-with-india-pm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Radio Pakistan</em></a> reported.</p>

<p>Pakistan previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911132">invited</a> India to a comprehensive dialogue to address all contentious issues, including the Kashmir dispute and the water distribution.</p>
<p>During a meeting with British High Commissioner Jane Marriott today, PM Shehbaz appreciated the UK’s role in de-escalating tensions during the Pakistan-India standoff.</p>
<p>He welcomed the British government’s decision to resume <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924570/uk-lifts-ban-on-pakistani-airlines-removes-country-from-air-safety-list">PIA flights</a> to the UK. He said, “This [decision] would go a long way in alleviating the hardships faced by the British-Pakistani community as well as enhancing people-to-people exchanges,” while appreciating the role of the high commissioner.</p>
<p>Both sides discussed the “positive trajectory” of bilateral relations. The prime minister said that the recently held <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924280/pakistan-uk-ink-accord-to-boost-economic-cooperation">trade talks</a> between the two countries would lead to mutually beneficial opportunities for both sides. “Pakistan is also cooperating closely with the UK at the UN Security Council, where Pakistan currently holds the monthly Presidency,” he said.</p>
<p>Marriott briefed PM Shehbaz about her recent visit to London, where she had extensive consultations on enhancing bilateral ties.</p>
<p>She lauded the Pakistani government’s recent economic performance which brought about a significant improvement in key macroeconomic indicators. She also discussed the UK’s perspective on regional developments in South Asia and the Middle East.</p>

<p>Last week, UK’s government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924354">launched</a> e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an “enhanced” border and immigration system.</p>
<p>The announcement came just a day after the two countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924280/pakistan-uk-ink-accord-to-boost-economic-cooperation">formally signed</a> the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#un-envoy-hits-back-at-india-for-cross-border-terrorism-claims" id="un-envoy-hits-back-at-india-for-cross-border-terrorism-claims" title="Permalink"></a>UN envoy hits back at India for cross-border terrorism claims</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Pakistan’s envoy to the UNSC, Ambassador Usman Jadoon, rejected Indian allegations of cross-border terrorism and asked India to change its behaviour, instead of resorting to its “tired narrative of victimhood and blame-shifting”, during the UNSC debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes” on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Indian envoy was reacting to Deputy PM Dar’s speech in New York during the reception hosted for Pakistan’s presidency of the UNSC, where the latter underscored the need for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute.</p>
<p>“It is India which actively sponsors, aids and abets terrorism in my country and beyond,” Ambassador Jadoon, deputy permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, told the 15-member body on Tuesday evening, while responding to allegations made by India’s UN Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish.</p>
<p>“Rather than being blinded by hubris and a misplaced sense of impunity, and instead of resorting to its tired narrative of victimhood and blame-shifting, India must introspect seriously, change its behaviour and comply with its international legal obligations on all counts,” he said, in the debate convened by Pakistan to promote pacific settlement of disputes between nations.</p>
<p>Ambassador Jadoon said that it was especially regrettable that the Indian ambassador targeted Pakistan yesterday, when earlier in the day, the council “spoke with a unanimous voice to reaffirm the purposes and principles of the UN charter and the imperative of peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for international law and effective implementation of the resolution of the security council”.</p>
<p>The Pakistani envoy pointed out that firstly, India was in illegal occupation of the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>“While claiming to abide by the UN charter, and purportedly the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes, India has been in violation of security council resolutions on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, and has refused to implement those resolutions, thereby denying the Kashmiri people the exercise of their inalienable right to self-determination,” he said.</p>
<p>“India’s egregious violations of human rights which extend beyond the occupied territory of Jammu and Kashmir and encompass its appalling treatment of minorities has been widely reported by international human rights organisations,” Jadoon added.</p>
<p>He also said that India had “stooped to a new low” of unilaterally and illegally holding in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">abeyance</a> the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, with the stated aim of depriving the people of Pakistan of water from the Indus river system.</p>
<p>“In gross violation of international law, India resorted to blatant aggression against my country between 7-10 May, targeting civilians, including women and children,” the ambassador said.</p>
<p>He highlighted Pakistan’s “befitting but measured response” in accordance with its right to self-defence, aimed exclusively at military targets, that resulted in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">downing</a> of six Indian aircraft that took part in the aggression, among other significant military losses.</p>
<p>“The hostilities came to an end owing to Pakistan’s position of strength and responsible approach, and facilitation of the US, as also highlighted in the statement of the US this morning, “ Jadoon told the delegates.</p>
<p>“It is ironic that India, which itself brought the Jammu and Kashmir dispute to the security council, refuses to implement the resolutions adopted by the council to peacefully resolve this dispute,” he added.</p>

<p>Obviously stung by the success of Pakistan’s signature event at the council, the Indian envoy had claimed that Pakistan was “steeped in fanaticism and terrorism”, and a “serial borrower from the International Monetary Fund”.</p>
<p>The debate will resume on July 24 to listen to the remaining speakers, after listening to scores of high-level representatives.</p></p>

            <p><p>Pakistan and Bangladesh on Wednesday agreed in principle to grant visa-free entry to holders of diplomatic and official passports, along with a pledge to stronger security cooperation.</p>
<p>The two countries were once one nation but split following a bloody civil war, which saw the territory previously referred to as ‘East Pakistan’ seceding to form the independent nation of Bangladesh. In the years since the split between Pakistan and Bangladesh, Dhaka’s leaders — especially the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245">ousted</a> regime of Sheikh Hasina — stayed firmly in the Indian camp, preferring to maintain close ties with New Delhi and keeping Islamabad at arm’s length.</p>
<p>However, ever since a popular uprising that saw Hasina’s government toppled in August of last year, with the deposed premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856408">fleeing</a> to her old ally India, there has been a thaw in ties between the two capitals, with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894028/countrys-trade-with-bangladesh-surpasses-1bn-report">trade</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878467">bilateral relations</a> seeing a marked improvement.</p>
<p>In May, Bangladesh High Commissioner to Pakistan Iqbal Hussain Khan said that the visa regime between Pakistan and Bangladesh was being eased for the business community to foster economic growth in the region.</p>
<p>Today’s development came during a visit of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to Bangladesh, where he met Home Minister retired Lieutenant General Jahangir Alam Chowdhury in Dhaka.</p>
<p>Naqvi was presented with a guard of honour before the two sides began discussions.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the two ministers held wide-ranging talks on bilateral issues and matters of mutual interest, with a particular focus on strengthening cooperation in internal security and law enforcement.</p>
<p>“Significant progress on visa-free entry for diplomatic and official passports during the meeting. Pakistan and Bangladesh make a principled decision to provide visa-free entry facility for diplomatic and official passports,” said a statement from the interior ministry.</p>

<p>Both sides expressed a strong desire to deepen collaboration in key areas, including counter-terrorism, combatting drug trafficking and preventing human smuggling.</p>
<p>The ministers also discussed plans to exchange training programmes between police academies, aiming to improve professional capacity and technical expertise.</p>
<p>Chowdhury thanked Naqvi for offering support in police training and described the visit as an “important milestone” in advancing ties between the two countries.</p>
<p>“I wholeheartedly welcome my brother upon his arrival in Dhaka. Your visit is of great importance for the promotion of Pakistan-Bangladesh relations,” he said.</p>
<p>To follow up on the decisions taken during the meeting, both sides agreed to form a joint committee with Interior Secretary Khurram Agha leading the Pakistani side in this coordination effort.</p>
<p>The committee will oversee implementation of the agreed initiatives and explore further avenues for cooperation.</p>
<p>As part of the growing partnership, a high-level delegation from Bangladesh is expected to visit Islamabad soon to study the Safe City Project and tour the National Police Academy.</p></p>

            <p><p>A Quetta anti-terrorism court on Wednesday extended the physical remand of tribal leader Sardar Sherbaz Satakzai, one of the main suspects in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925555">‘honour’ killing</a> of a man and a woman, for 10 more days.</p>
<p>The viral video of the murder showed a group of men leading a couple out of vehicles and into a desert before gunning them down with pistols and shooting the bodies. Political figures and activists said it was an ‘honour’ killing incident. Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said on Sunday that he had directed the provincial police to take immediate action, following which one suspect was apprehended.</p>
<p>Sardar Satakzai is one of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925613">main suspects</a> in the case and was presented before the Quetta ATC on Monday before being handed over to the Serious Crimes Investigation Wing  (SCIW) on a two-day physical remand on the judge’s order upon the police’s request.</p>
<p>He was presented in the ATC today before Judge Muhammad Mubeen, who accepted the police request and granted Satakzai’s physical remand for another 10 days, handing him over to the SCIW.</p>
<p>Separately, a video statement of the woman’s mother emerged today in which she defended the incident and said it occurred as per local custom and tradition. She said the decision was taken by a jurga and Satakzai had no role in it, calling for his release.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Ulema Council (PUC) strongly condemned the mother’s statement, declaring it contrary to Islamic teachings, as well as the Constitution and law.</p>
<p>The PUC said the remarks suggested that the murder was committed with the consent of the parents, a revelation it termed “deeply disturbing and unacceptable”.</p>
<p>The PUC declared that it was the responsibility of the state, law enforcement agencies, the Balochistan government and the provincial judiciary to take firm action against all those facilitating the perpetrators.</p>
<p>It categorically rejected the parents’ justification, stating that it violated Islamic principles and the Constitution.</p>
<p>Terming the incident both condemnable and tragic, the PUC called for a comprehensive investigation and stressed that justice must be served without delay or negligence. It urged the state to fulfil its constitutional and moral duty by ensuring that all those responsible were brought to justice.</p>

<p>In Pakistan, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849480">‘honour’ killings</a> continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881836">Data</a> from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p>
<p>The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.</p></p>
