            <p><p>Pakistan on Monday signed a United Nations (UN) agreement aimed at conserving marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, the Foreign Office (FO) said.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar signed the “Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction” (<a class="link--external" href="https://www.un.org/bbnjagreement/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BBNJ Agreement</a>) at the UN Headquarters in New York.</p>
<p>The BBNJ pact is the third implementing agreement under the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/legal/pages/unitednationsconventiononthelawofthesea.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UN Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> (Unclos), which was adopted in 1982 and entered into force in 1994.</p>

<p>Pakistan signing the BBNJ agreement “reflects on its commitment to multilateral cooperation and protection and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction”, the FO noted in a <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/pakistan-signs-agreement-under-unclos-on-the-conservation-and-sustainable-use-of-marine-biological-diversity-of-areas-beyond-national-jurisdiction-bbnj-agreement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>The BBNJ agreement was adopted on 19 June 2023 by an intergovernmental conference.</p>
<p>“Pakistan played a leading role in the negotiations to finalise the treaty,” the FO highlighted in a post on X.</p>
<p>“As chair of the Group of 77 and China during the two main sessions, Pakistan, representing developing countries, endeavoured to promote equity, in line with the principle of the common heritage of humankind.”</p>

<p>The FO statement recalled that Pakistan “consistently advocated for fair benefit-sharing, capacity-building, and technology transfer”.</p>
<p>According to the UN, the BBNJ agreement addresses four main issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Marine genetic resources, including the fair and equitable sharing of benefits</li>
<li>Measures such as area-based management tools, including marine protected areas</li>
<li>Environmental impact assessments</li>
<li>Capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Unclos, under which the BBNJ pact falls, <a class="link--external" href="https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/legal/pages/unitednationsconventiononthelawofthesea.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lays down</a> a “comprehensive regime of law and order for the world’s oceans, establishing rules for the allocation of states’ rights and jurisdiction in maritime spaces, the peaceful use of the oceans and the management of their resources”.</p>

            <p><p>At least 25 children were among the 27 dead pulled from scorched buildings after a Bangladesh Air Force jet on a training mission <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925645">crashed</a> into a college and school campus in Dhaka, officials said on Tuesday, with 88 people being treated in hospital.</p>
<p>The F-7 BGI aircraft crashed soon after it took off at 1:06pm (12:06pm PKT) on Monday from the airbase in Kurmitola in the capital on a routine training mission. The military said the plane experienced a mechanical failure.</p>
<p>Visuals showed rescue workers scouring the charred buildings for debris as distressed family members surrounded the site.</p>
<p>Sayedur Rahman, special assistant to the chief adviser on health, told reporters that 27 people had died and 88 were admitted to hospital with burn injuries. Those dead included 25 children, a teacher and the pilot.</p>
<p>The <a class="link--external" href="https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/govt-declares-state-mourning-tomorrow-3944571" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">government announced</a> a day of mourning, with flags at half-mast and special prayers at all places of worship.</p>
<p>The F-7 BGI is the final and most advanced variant in China’s Chengdu J-7/F-7 aircraft family, according to Jane’s Information Group. Bangladesh signed a contract for 16 aircraft in 2011 and deliveries were completed by 2013.</p>
<p>The incident comes as neighbour India is still grappling with the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade after an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916728">Air India plane crashed</a> into a medical college hostel in Ahmedabad last month, killing 241 of the 242 people on board and 19 on the ground.</p></p>

            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The Senate on Monday passed several private member bills, including one enhancing punishment for obscenity-related offences. The Criminal Laws (Amendment) Bill 2024, introduced by PPP Senator Shahadat Awan, seeks to amend Sections 292 to 294 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).</p>
<p>The bill has defined obscenity as per Article 37(g) of the Constitution, which states: “[The State shall:] prevent prostitution, gambling and taking of injurious drugs, printing, publication, circulation and display of obscene literature and advertisements”.</p>
<p>Under the proposed changes, Section 292 would increase the penalty for publishing, producing, exhibiting, distributing, or selling obscene material from a three-month sentence and an unspecified fine to two years’ imprisonment and a fine of Rs200,000. A proviso clarifies the law does not apply to religious content or objects used for religious purposes.</p>
<p>Section 293 would raise the punishment for selling obscene material to individuals under 20 years from six months’ imprisonment or fine to two years and Rs100,000 in fines. Amendments to Section 294, which pertains to obscene acts and songs in public, would increase the penalty from three months to one year and introduce a Rs100,000 fine.</p>

<p>The Senate also passed the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils (Amendment) Bill, moved by Senator Khalil Tahir. It raises the eligibility period for membership in provincial and Islamabad bar councils from five to ten years. Candidates must also have 15 years of advocacy experience and a minimum of 30 decided cases not involving government representation.</p>
<p>PTI’s Barrister Ali Zafar opposed the timing, saying changes should take effect after upcoming bar elections. Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar noted the election schedule would be issued in October and said the amendment had backing from all six bar councils.</p>
<p>Another key bill passed was the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals (Amendment) Bill, tabled by PPP Senator Saleem Mandviwalla. It proposes establishing a commission to support journalists facing violence and threats. PTI supported the bill, with Barrister Zafar stating journalism had become one of the most dangerous professions in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The other bills passed by the House included “The State-Owned Enterprises (Governance and Operations) (Amend­ment) Bill, 2024”, “The Abandoned Properties (Management) (Amendment) Bill, 2024”, “The National Institute of Health (Re-organisation) (Amendment) Bill, 2024”, “The Islamabad Capital Ter­ritory Charities Registration, Regulation and Facilitation (Amendment) Bill, 2023”, and “The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 2024”.</p>
<p><strong>Social media age restriction</strong></p>
<p>Also, various other bills, including the one seeking to regulate social media access for individuals aged less than 16, were introduced in the House. The bill seeks to reduce the risks of underage people of cyberbullying, harmful content, and online exploitation, besides providing for young users’ privacy, and preventing commercial exploitation and data breaches.</p>
<p>While speaking on a motion on Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP), PTI parliamentary leader Barrister Zafar demanded immediate action against all those involved in the sugar scandal and called for submission of a comprehensive report by a parliamentary body to the Senate within 14 days.</p>

<p>“Let us not delude ourselves: this mafia is not operating from the shadows. It sits within the ranks of this very government. The beneficiaries of this scandal are not hidden; they sit in power, and the people know it,” he alleged.</p>
<p>He said citizens could no longer afford to survive. “Why is this burden being dumped upon the people in the name of the IMF? Why is there no transparency in the working of Ogra and Nepra? Why is there no accountability? The answer is simple but shameful: the sugar mafia controls the government and the government serves them,” the PTI leader said.</p>
<p>He sought formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate the sugar scandal and the extent of the sugar mafia’s influence within the corridors of power.</p>
<p>Senator Danesh Kumar of BAP echoed the concerns, calling CCP ineffective against such cartels.</p>
<p>In response, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the CCP’s Cartels and Trade Abuse Department had completed 20 inquiries across key sectors, while the Office of Fair Trade had conducted 13 probes into deceptive practices. Since October 2023, the CCP’s Market Intelligence Unit uncovered 170 potential cases of anti-competitive behaviour in 28 sectors, including real estate, telecom, and banking.</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb urged the Senate Finance Committee to summon the CCP chairman and request a full progress report for the past two years. “For CCP to be effective, it must act proactively —not just reactively,” he admitted.</p>
