            <p><p>Rescue teams pulled more bodies from the rubble of a five-storey <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050">building collapse</a> in Karachi overnight, taking the toll on Saturday to 15 as the recovery operation continued for a second day,</p>
<p>The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, which was further weakened by recent rains, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922231#:~:text=DIG%20South%20Syed%20Asad%20Raza%20told%20Dawn">said</a> Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza.</p>
<p>Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed confirmed to <em>Dawn.com</em> that the toll had risen to 15. She added that there were nine wounded people since yesterday, out of whom six had been discharged and one had serious injuries.</p>
<p>“Rescue operation is still underway in Baghdadi, Lyari where the building had collapsed on Friday,” DIG Raza told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>

<p>Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.</p>
<p>Karachi, home to more than 20 million, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.</p>
<p>There were conflicting reports of the death toll, with Rescue 1122 stating it as 16 and DIG Raza saying that a 17th body was recovered from the rubble.</p>
<p>“On one side, debris has been removed up to the ground floor, while on the other side, the rescue team has removed debris up to the third floor,” the police officer added.</p>
<p>The deceased included nine men, six women and a child, according to a statement by Rescue 1122. Their bodies had been taken to the Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK).</p>
<p>“My daughter is under the rubble,” 54-year-old Dev Raj told <em>AFP</em> at the scene.</p>
<p>“She was my beloved daughter. She was so sensitive but is under the burden of debris. She got married just six months ago.”</p>
<p>Rescue teams worked throughout the night, and families said that at least eight people were still believed to be trapped as temperatures climbed to 33 degrees Celsius in the morning.</p>
<p>Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, leading the Rescue 1122 efforts at the scene, told <em>AFP</em> that the operation continued through the night “without interruption”. “It may take eight to 12 hours more to complete,” he said earlier today.</p>
<p>Up to 100 people had been living in the building, senior police officer Arif Aziz told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>The incident came days after a portion of a building <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921188/no-casualties-reported-as-22-rescued-from-partially-collapsed-building-in-karachis-kharadar">collapsed</a> in the city’s Kharadar area. However, no casualties or injuries were reported.</p>
<p>The Public Account Committee of the Sindh Assembly had directed the provincial government in December to take urgent steps to evacuate over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879565">570 buildings</a> declared “dangerous” by authorities across Karachi.</p>

<p>The Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=SBCA%20says%20issued%20multiple%20prior%20notices%20to%20vacate%20building">said</a> it had declared the plot as dangerous through its Technical Committee for Dangerous Buildings after a thorough inspection conducted in October 2022.</p>
<p>The authority said it had issued three ejectment notices to the residents since then, as well as asked K-Electric, Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) to disconnect utility services.</p>
<p>But Imran Khaskheli, an owner and resident watching the rescue operation on Saturday, denied receiving notices.</p>
<p>“Do you think we are out of our senses to stay in an unsafe building with our families?” he said, speaking to <em>AFP</em>. He said he had seen cracks in the pillars of the building early on Friday morning.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“I knocked on all the doors and asked families to leave immediately,” Khaskheli said, adding that around 40 families lived in the building but that many did not heed his warning.</p>
<p>More than 50 buildings in the district have been declared unsafe, with six evacuated since yesterday, Karachi (South) Deputy Commissioner Javed Nabi Khoso told <em>AFP</em>.</p>

However, they said they received the information late due to the suspension of communication networks, he added.</p>
<p>Mobile services are usually <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920725/army-to-be-deployed-across-country-for-security-during-muharram#:~:text=It%20was%20also%20agreed%20that%20any%20decision%20to%20suspend%20internet%20or%20mobile%20phone%20services%20will%20be%20made%20in%20consultation%20with%20provinces">suspended</a> in certain areas due to security concerns during Muharram.</p>
<p>Sindh Rescue 1122 Director General (DG) Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, in a statement, said yesterday there were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=Rescue%20DG%20lists%20%E2%80%98hinderances%E2%80%99%20in%20operations">hindrances</a> during the rescue operation due to the “unruly crowd, various road blockades and mobile network [issues]”.</p>
<p>Heavy machinery faced difficulty in reaching the site amid the narrow alleys of Lyari, a low-income neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Police even had to baton-charge a crowd that had gathered around the site to make way for machinery, officials added.</p>
<p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah sought a report on the collapse and details of dilapidated buildings from the SBCA.</p>
<p>Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani said a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=Saeed%20Ghani%20stresses%20timely%20evacuation%20of%20unsafe%20buildings">high-level committee</a> has been formed that will submit a report on the incident by Monday. He lamented that residents did not evacuate the building despite being served notices previously.</p>
<p>The minister also ordered the suspension of the related officials at the SBCA.</p>

            <p><p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916217">total debt</a> of Pakistan has swelled by 12 per cent compared to last year to reach nearly Rs76.05 trillion at the end of May, according to statistics released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).</p>
<p>In its <a class="link--external" href="https://www.sbp.org.pk/ecodata/cengovdebt.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">debt bulletin</a> issued on Friday, the SBP reported the central government debt at Rs76.045tr, showing an increase of more than Rs8.31tr (12.3pc) in a year, when it stood at Rs67.73tr in May 2024.</p>
<p>The domestic debt stood at Rs53.46tr, posting a year-on-year growth of 15.9pc. The external debt was stated as nearly Rs22.59tr, 4.52pc higher than the same month last year.</p>

<p>The government’s total debt and liabilities had stood at Rs89.83tr at the end of March, according to the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.sbp.org.pk/reports/stat_reviews/Bulletin/2025/Jun/Chap-5.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data</a> released by the SBP in June.</p>
<p>The SBP data showed that Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) contributed around Rs35.24tr to the public debt — surging from Rs27.70tr in May 2024 — compared to Rs8.04tr by the market treasury bills, which have declined from Rs9.44tr last year.</p>
<p>SBP data from earlier this year <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885574">showed</a> that PIBs’ long-term contribution to the central government’s debt had increased compared to the short-term treasury bills.</p>

            <p><p>The Punjab Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) said on Saturday it had killed five terrorists and successfully thwarted a terror plot in Taunsa Sharif in a “major counter-terrorism breakthrough”.</p>
<p>There has been a recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror attacks in Pakistan over the past year. The CTD regularly carries out operations to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence.</p>
<p>A press release issued today by the CTD said that an intelligence-based operation took place near the Tri-Border Village.</p>
<p>According to a CTD spokesperson, the operation was launched following “credible intelligence reports” about the presence of alleged armed terrorists in the area. Although the operation aimed to apprehend them, they opened fire on the CTD team, leading to a retaliatory crossfire.</p>
<p>The press release detailed that the exchange of heavy fire continued for several hours, during which five terrorists were eliminated, while five others sustained injuries and escaped into the nearby forest.</p>
<p>“The CTD teams acted swiftly and professionally, preventing what could have been a catastrophic attack,” the statement added.</p>
<p>During the combing operation, the team recovered a cache of lethal weapons including rifles, three improvised explosive devices, a large quantity of ammunition, hand grenades and explosive material.</p>
<p>The statement highlighted that these recoveries underscored the severity of the threat and the scale of the planned attack.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>It added that a search operation was currently underway to trace and apprehend the wounded terrorists who fled the scene. The press release said CTD teams established checkpoints near Romani, Taunsa, to secure the region and prevent further escape and the identification process of the deceased terrorists was ongoing.</p>
<p>It said four bodies were handed over to the hospital for legal formalities, while one was taken from the scene by the accomplices.</p>
<p>The CTD has been “continuously operating against the terrorists attacking police posts in the tri-border area of Dera Ghazi Khan”, the statement added.</p>
<p>A statement from Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi praised the CTD for its operation and said the terrorists were from the <em>Fitna al Hindustan</em>.</p>
<p>The government has designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna al Hindu­stan</em>. The term ‘Fitna al Hindu­stan’ is a new phrase coined by Pakistan’s military, aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>
<p>In May, the Punjab CTD said it foiled a “major terror plot” by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914520">arresting</a> 34 alleged terrorists of banned organisations during 415 intelligence-based operations across the province.</p>
<p>The previous month, it arrested <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904191">10 terrorists</a> belonging to banned organisations during 189 operations in different areas of Punjab.</p></p>
