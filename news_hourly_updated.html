                <h2>Trump, COAS Munir talk counterterrorism and trade in ‚Äòcordial‚Äô meeting: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir discussed joint counterterrorism efforts and expanding bilateral trade during their ‚Äúcordial‚Äù meeting in Washington, the military‚Äôs media wing said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Gen Munir met with Trump at the White House yesterday, becoming the first serving chief of army staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. The occasion also marked the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">first time</a> a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law.</p>
<p>The high-level engagement was scheduled at the Cabinet Room over luncheon, followed by a visit to the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Senator Marco Rubio and Special Representative for Middle Eastern Affairs Steve Witkoff were present during the meeting from the US side, while National Security Advisor <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907660/in-a-first-isi-chief-made-national-security-adviser">Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik</a> ‚Äî also the intelligence chief ‚Äî accompanied the COAS.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlthough initially scheduled for one hour, the meeting extended for over two hours, underscoring the depth and cordiality of the dialogue,‚Äù the ISPR said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7323" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Trump ‚Äúlauded Pakistan‚Äôs ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counterterrorism cooperation between the two states‚Äù, the statement said.</p>
<p>It noted that both sides reaffirmed their commitment to continued collaboration in the field of counterterrorism.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúDiscussions also encompassed avenues for expanding bilateral cooperation in multiple domains, including trade, economic development, mines and minerals, artificial intelligence, energy, cryptocurrency, and emerging technologies,‚Äù the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPresident Trump expressed keen interest in forging a mutually beneficial trade partnership with Pakistan based on long-term strategic convergence and shared interests,‚Äù it highlighted.</p>
<p>The US president also commended Field Marshal Munir‚Äôs ‚Äúleadership and decisiveness during a period of complex regional dynamics‚Äù.</p>
<p>The army chief extended an invitation to Trump, on behalf of the government, to undertake an official visit to Pakistan at a mutually convenient date, the ISPR said, calling it a ‚Äúgesture reflecting the warmth of bilateral ties‚Äù.</p>
<p>On his part, COAS Munir conveyed the deep appreciation of the government and people of Pakistan for Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúconstructive and result-oriented role in facilitating a ceasefire between Pakistan and India in the recent regional crisis‚Äù.</p>
<p>He ‚Äúacknowledged President Trump‚Äôs statesmanship and his ability to comprehend and address the multifaceted challenges faced by the global community‚Äù, the ISPR press release said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA detailed exchange of views also took place on the prevailing tensions between Iran and Israel, with both leaders emphasising the importance of resolution of the conflict,‚Äù it added, referring to the ongoing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918048/iran-israel-trade-fresh-air-attacks-as-trump-weighs-us-involvement">missile exchange</a> between the two regional arch foes that marks a week today.</p>
<p>The military noted that the engagement ‚Äúmarks a significant moment in the ongoing efforts to reinforce the longstanding partnership between Pakistan and the United States, built upon shared objectives of peace, stability, and prosperity‚Äù.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif termed the meeting a ‚Äúmilestone in Pak-US ties‚Äù and a ‚Äúsuccess of the current hybrid model of governance‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is the most important turning point in the 78-year history of relations. The way international and regional issues were discussed in this meeting highlighted the importance of the beloved homeland,‚Äù Asif <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KhawajaMAsif/status/1935616004857499862" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on X</a>.</p>
<p>He added that Pakistan‚Äôs abilities to help resolve issues were acknowledged, along with the Pak-India conflict being shed light on again.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe revival of the economy, the defeat of India, the glorious and highly successful improvement in relations with the US ‚Äî all these revolutionary changes were possible with the cooperation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir and the excellent relations between Islamabad and Rawalpindi.‚Äù</p>

<p>When questioned about the meeting in an interaction with the media, Trump said, ‚ÄúI was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917868/trump-says-honoured-to-meet-field-marshal-munir-iran-discussed-in-talks">honoured</a> to meet him (Field Marshal Munir) today.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe (Field Marshal Munir) agreed with me. The reason I had him here was that I wanted to thank him for not going into the war [with India]. And I want to thank PM [Narendra] Modi as well, who just left a few days ago,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working on a trade deal with India and Pakistan. These two very smart people decided not to keep going with a war that could have been a nuclear war. Pakistan and India are two big nuclear powers.‚Äù</p>

<p>Asked whether the talks included the current Iran-Israel conflict, Trump said: ‚ÄúThey (Pakistan) know Iran very well, better than most, and they‚Äôre not happy about anything. It‚Äôs not that they‚Äôre bad with Israel. They know them both, actually, but they know Iran better.‚Äù</p>
<p>Questioned by reporters about the meeting prior to it, Trump remarked, ‚ÄúThis man (Gen Munir) was extremely influential in stopping it (India-Pakistan fighting) from the Pakistan side.‚Äù</p>
<p>White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Trump was hosting Field Marshal Munir after he called for the president to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625/trump-says-us-stopped-pak-india-nuclear-war">preventing a nuclear war</a> between India and Pakistan, <em>Reuters</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/india-will-not-accept-third-party-mediation-relations-with-pakistan-modi-tells-2025-06-18/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>But insiders <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044#:~:text=But%20insiders%20suggested%20that%20the%20meeting%20was%20not%20arranged%20through%20routine%20diplomatic%20channels">suggested</a> that the meeting was not arranged through routine diplomatic channels, but rather was the outcome of ‚Äúunorthodox efforts‚Äù by a group of advisers, businessmen, and other influential figures.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources in Washington said this initiative had been cooking for months and kept under wraps until the White House released Trump‚Äôs official schedule on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sources said that deepened counter-terrorism cooperation, engagement with crypto-linked influence networks, and targeted lobbying via Republican-aligned firms in Washington helped Pakistan secure the meeting.</p>
<p>Previous military rulers ‚Äî such as Field Marshal Ayub Khan, Gen Ziaul Haq, and Gen Pervez Musharraf ‚Äî met US presidents only after they had assumed the role of head of state.</p>
<p>Former president Barack Obama did briefly ‚Äúwalk in‚Äù on a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/734318/mistrust-has-made-us-pakistan-ties-neurotic-wp">White House meeting</a> with then-COAS Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, but that too was not a formal engagement.</p></p>

            <p><p>India will send the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917018">black box</a> recovered from the recent fatally crashed Air India plane to the US for analysis, local newspaper <em>Economic Times</em> reported on Thursday, citing people aware of the development.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe recorder sustained heavy external damage from post-crash fire making it impossible to extract data in India,‚Äù the <em>ET</em> report said, citing people aware of the development.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) did not immediately respond to <em>Reuters</em>‚Äô request for comment. Air India declined to comment.</p>
<p>Indian authorities are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917107">investigating</a> the crash of an Air India Boeing Dreamliner, which last week <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916728">killed</a> 241 people on board and at least 30 on ground, marking the world‚Äôs worst aviation disaster in a decade.</p>
<p>The black box consists of two components ‚Äî the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR). It provides crucial insights for crash investigators, including altitude and airspeed data and pilot conversation records that help determine probable causes of crashes.</p>
<p>Data from the flight data recorder will be extracted at the Washington-based laboratory of the National Transportation Safety Board and shared with AAIB, the <em>ET</em> report added, citing sources.</p></p>
