            <p><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Wednesday stressed that planned tariff reforms that would reduce import duties were the key to an export-led economy in Pakistan.</p>
<p>He made the remarks during a post-budget press conference where he expanded upon the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292/budget-fy26-pakistan-targets-42pc-growth-slashes-overall-spending">federal budget</a> proposed yesterday for the upcoming fiscal year.</p>
<p>Maintaining an aggressive stance on fiscal consolidation, as required by the Int­ernational Monetary Fund (IMF), Aurangzeb yesterday still managed to offer some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916440/non-filers-to-face-the-music-as-income-tax-rates-come-down">notional relief</a> to the salaried class in the federal budget for FY2025-26, along with incentives for the real estate and construction sectors to revive the struggling industrial sector and stimulate economic growth.</p>
<p>Addressing a media briefing in Islamabad today, Aurangzeb reiterated the significance of the tariff reforms under the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911262">National Tariff Policy</a>.</p>
<p>“People ask us that the revenue will decline but if we have to take this country forward towards an export-led discussion […] I want to go into the details of the steps we have taken,” he said.</p>
<p>The minister noted that additional customs duties were removed in four “lines”, while they were reduced in 2,700 tariff lines, which were “directly linked with those raw materials on the basis of which exporters will benefit”.</p>
<p>He stressed these measures were just for the upcoming year and more will be taken gradually.</p>
<p>Expanding further on the topic while answering a query. Aurangzeb said: “This is an East Asia moment for Pakistan. Whatever was available in the fiscal space is the direction of travel. We have tried to reduce tariffs. This is not the eventual end state.”</p>

<p>At the outset of the press conference, the reporters voiced their concerns about not being given a technical briefing yesterday by the Federal Board of Revenue (FRB) on the Finance Bill 2025, which details the legislation for the proposed measures under the budget.</p>
<p>Subsequently, they walked out of the conference room in protest.</p>
<p>However, flanked by FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial and Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal, Aurangzeb soon continued with his press conference in the presence of some journalists.</p>
<p>Concluding his address, Aurangzeb acknowledged the “worry” caused to reporters and said he “regretted if there was anything of the sort”, referring to the journalists not being briefed.</p>
<p>However, the minister added, he and the FBR chairman “had been appearing before you in terms of having these types of discussions”. “We will continue to accelerate this,” he affirmed, hinting at a plan of engagements with journalists every four to six weeks.</p>
<p>Addressing journalist Mehtab Haider, who spearheaded the journalists’ concerns, Langrial acknowledged that there used to be a “technical briefing” but this time it was decided that Aurangzeb would hold an “essential briefing”.</p>
<p>“Its name is technical briefing but practically, the same questions are raised during it, […] which makes the ministerial press conference slightly less meaningful.</p>
<p>“But if you want, we would hold a separate technical session with you,” the FBR chairman told the journalists.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#salaries-and-pensions-linked-with-inflation" id="salaries-and-pensions-linked-with-inflation" title="Permalink"></a>‘Salaries and pensions linked with inflation’</h2>
<p>On salaries and pensions, the finance czar stressed the need for a benchmark.</p>
<p>“If we are saying the inflation is declining, similarly, the salary or pension has to benchmarked with inflation. This is not just the rule in Pakistan but across the world.”</p>
<p>The minister also pointed out the connection between pay and inflation when asked why the minimum wage of Rs37,000 was not to be increased in the upcoming year.</p>
<p>“Go to the industries and get their feedback on minimum wage. I think we are in a good place,” he asserted.</p>
<p>Echoing his remarks from yesterday, Aurangzeb stressed that the government tried to give relief “as much as possible” while considering the fiscal space. He also pointed out the 0.5pc reduction in super tax for the corporate sector.</p>
<p>Detailing the measures proposed for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916465/tax-relief-for-property-buyers-but-not-for-sellers">property buyers and sellers</a>, he said: “Selling side still gets capital gains but the buying side should get some relief.”</p>
<p>The minister also termed the mortgage financing “as important as the fiscal side of things and what we have to do on the taxation side”.</p>
<p>Speaking on the agricultural sector, Aurangzeb said an additional tax on fertilisers and pesticides was a “benchmark” but it was negotiated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the directions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that it was a “critical input into agriculture” and should not be imposed.</p>
<p>“Again, this is a step in the right direction”, the minister asserted.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb acknowledged that additional taxes and measures were also talked about last year. “We had to impose those as when we were speaking to international institutions, they were not agreeing with our stance that there can be enforcement in this country,” he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Expressing the aim to reach a tax-to-GDP ratio of 10.9pc by the next year, the minister said additional taxes were around Rs312m of the total 2.2tr target. “We have two ways — either we ensure enforcement or we introduce additional measures of up to Rs 400 to 500bn. This is why we will go to the parliament to help us out with the enabling amendments and legislation.”</p>
<p>The minister added: “We have laws, legislation and taxes but we were not able to enforce it, so in this fiscal year, we have worked on enforcement, which has exceeded Rs400 billion.”</p>
<p>Responding to a query, Aurangzeb underscored the need to reduce the role of the middleman in the agricultural sector and increase the financing for small farmers. “It is very critical […] that we have a policy in the devolved subjects.”</p>
<p>He noted that the relevant measures were underway, hence the growth target was decided considering that.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that past concerns about the government expenditures not reducing were the “right pushback”, the minister highlighted that the figure had gone up by just 1.9pc in the outgoing fiscal year.</p>
<p>“We have reduced subsidies and debt-servicing costs, and increased some expenditures because this country needed those. But this is our response to those people who are paying taxes in this country that ‘why are you not bringing the government expenditures under control’,” Aurangzeb asserted.</p>
<p>He pointed out that whatever the government was giving was doing so “by taking loans as we start with a deficit”, adding that if the expenditures were not reduced, then the loans would keep surging.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#na-senate-heads-salaries-hiked-after-9-years" id="na-senate-heads-salaries-hiked-after-9-years" title="Permalink"></a>‘NA, Senate heads’ salaries hiked after 9 years’</h2>
<p>Asked about a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916120">recent increase</a> in the salaries of the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker, the minister claimed that the last time their salaries were “adjusted” was in 2016. He emphasised that the hike was “all of a sudden” as it had not been done for the past nine years.</p>
<p>Responding to a question on how the federal government could delink population from the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, Auranzgeb asserted, “Everything will be done in consultation with provinces.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He added, “Nothing will be done [without them], including the national fiscal pact which we signed with the provinces.”</p>
<p>The minister also acknowledged a lack of implementation in suggested measures: “Over the past 10 years, I’ve been looking at the state of economy, first in the private sector and now in this job. I have never seen anything going up go downwards.</p>
<p>“I could be wrong; maybe it might have happened in some year,” he added. “It starts with acknowledgement, the undue burden that we had, as the prime minister has said before as well,” Aurangzeb said.</p>
<p>“The things that had never been reversed before have now been put into reversal, but that’s not the eventual end state,” the finance czar highlighted.</p>
<p>He made it clear that the segments that have been under undue burden, “whether it’s the formal sector, the beneficiary sector, the salaried class”, the government should at least give a signal that it was “serious”. “This is just signalling in my perspective from the right direction,” the finance minister said.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb noted that the government had taken two “very concrete measures” to bring the cash-based economy of Rs9.4tr or more towards documentation.</p>
<p>Answering a query on circular debt, the FBR chairman highlighted the revisions last year for power firms’ contracts. He stated that the power sector wanted “major reforms toward cheap credit and an enabling environment”.</p>
<p>When asked what the rationale was for the tax on solar panels, Langrial explained that solar comes in two forms: assembled and less assembled.</p>
<p>“The one which added value in Pakistan already had an 18pc tax rate. The assembled one from abroad did not, so the local assembly was at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>“We also closed the door for future local assembling, so this was not an option and we have to create a level playing field,” the FBR chairman said, asserting that incentives were unimportant now that the technology had become cheaper.</p>
<p>“The payback period was two years, so we are ending these anomalies.”</p>
<p>Asked what the youth was being offered under the proposed budget, Aurangzeb underscored the need for the government to provide an “enabling environment for the youth”.</p>
<p>Noting that freelancers earned $400 million last year, he said it was important to provide them with education.</p>
<p>“The coders are now earning $8 to 10 per hour; we hope they reach $100 per hour rate,” he said, urging the private sector to lead that goal.</p>
<p>Responding to a question on bond repayments, the finance czar stated that the first instalment of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870377">Eurobonds</a> worth $500m was due in September, while the next was due in March. “We are prepared and willing to pay.”</p>
<p>The minister reiterated his hopes of Pakistan launching yuan-denominated <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885078">Panda bonds</a> this year, adding that credit enhancement through the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was in progress.</p>
<p>“As the international credit rating improves, we want to access the euro and US dollar market, which is expected in 2026, but certainly not this calendar year,” Aurangzeb said.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916492/psx-hits-all-time-high-as-proposed-neutral-to-positive-budget-well-received-by-investors' target='_blank'><strong>PSX hits all-time high as proposed ‘neutral-to-positive’ budget well-received by investors</strong></a>
            <p><p>Shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) hit an all-time high of 124,000 points on Wednesday as the proposed federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year was well-received by investors for being “neutral to positive”.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index climbed 2,285.13, or 1.87 per cent, to stand at 124,309.57 from the last close of 122,024.44 at 11:49am.</p>
<p>While there had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915753">uncer­tainties</a> surrounding the taxation measures ahead of the budget announcement, the PSX <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916454/bulls-propel-psx-to-new-peak-of-122000">remained bullish</a> yesterday and gained nearly 400 points to cross the 122,000 point-mark, just before the budget was presented in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the budget announcement was “well-received by investors, primarily due to the absence of any new taxes or levies on the stock market, alleviating initial concerns”.</p>
<p>He noted: “Overall, the budget is viewed as neutral to positive for the listed sectors, with tax collection and fiscal deficit/primary surplus targets seen as non-events, as we believe they remain within the authority’s ability to meet for FY26.”</p>
<p>Despite a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914660">record tax shortfall</a> of Rs1.07 trillion recorded for the outgoing fiscal year, the government has set next year’s revenue target at Rs14.13tr — an 18.7pc increase from this year’s revised estimate of Rs11.9tr, against the original budget target of Rs12.97tr.</p>

<p>Expanding upon the factors related to the stock market, Ashraf said the increase in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916442#:~:text=the%20finance%20minister%20announced%20an%20increase%20in%20the%20tax%20rate%20on%20interest%20income%20from%2015pc%20to%2020pc%2C%20a%20move%20that%20may%20discourage%20savings">tax rate for profit on debt</a> and “proportionate imposition of tax on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913560">mutual funds</a> contingent to dividends received from debt and equities at rate of 25pc and 15pc mutual funds, respectively, is expected to provide further traction for the equity market”.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb yesterday announced an increase in the tax rate on interest income from 15pc to 20pc, a move that may discourage savings.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916466/budget-lacks-steps-to-cure-economic-ills-complain-industry-leaders">some businessmen</a> have labelled the proposed plan a “camouflage budget” due to its unrealistic targets and the lack of meaningful relief for both the business community and the general public.</p>

<p>Pakistan Business Council Chief Executive Ehsan Malik, while noting “small mercies”, termed the real estate sector the “real winner” from the budget.</p>
<p>Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) Secretary General M. Abdul Aleem expressed disappointment over the government’s limited progress in addressing inequitable corporate tax rates.</p>

            <p><p>US Department of State on Wednesday reiterated US President Donald Trump’s resolve to work on the Kashmir dispute, saying each step that he takes “is made to solve generational differences between countries”.</p>
<p>Donald Trump had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910785/fo-reiterates-support-for-trump-offer-to-resolve-kashmir-issue">offered</a> to work on the Kashmir issue after he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914608">brokered</a> a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after the two nations’ most intense <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military confrontation</a> in decades. In a message lauding the countries’ leaders for achieving peace, he remarked, “I will work with both of you to see if, after a ‘thousand years’, a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir.”</p>
<p>Responding to a question on the steps US plans to take in the wake of Trump’s offer, State Department’s spokesperson Tammy Bruce during a White House press briefing noted, “So, while I can’t speak to his plans, the world knows his nature, and I can’t speak to any details of what he might have in that regard,” adding that the White House would have plenty to say about the matter.</p>
<p>She further said, “[Trump] has been the only one to bring certain people to the table to have conversations that nobody thought was possible,” remaining hopeful that the Kashmir issue can also get resolved.</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t surprise anyone that he’d want to manage something like that,” said Bruce.</p>
<p>Detailing the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915359">visit</a> of a Pakistani delegation led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in response to a question, she said that the delegation met with state department officials in Washington, including Under Secretary for Political Affairs Allison Hooker.</p>
<p>She elaborated that the two parties discussed issues related to the Pak-US bilateral relationship, including counterterrorism cooperation. Hooker reiterated US support for the ongoing ceasefire.</p>
<p>“We also know that Deputy Secretary Landau met with the Indian parliamentary delegation last week, and he also reaffirmed the United States strong support of India in the fight against terrorism,” Bruce added.</p>

<p>Pakis­tan has launched a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence in the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, last week, while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump categorically claimed credit for talking India and Pakistan back from the brink of war.</p>
<p>“They don’t give me credit for anything, but nobody else could have stopped it,” he said.</p></p>

            <p><p>Florence in Italy could hit 39C as hot weather sweeps continent, while parts of South Africa brace for snow</p><p>The severe thunderstorms that have been lashing parts of Europe over recent days are expected to give way to high temperatures this week. Several regions could climb to 10C (50F) above seasonal norms, with Italy braced for the full force of the heat. Florence in Tuscany is forecast to soar to a sweltering 39C on Thursday and across the weekend.</p><p>Germany, France and Belgium will also face hot weather from Wednesday, with widespread highs at least 9C above the June average. Many other parts of Europe are forecast to experience temperatures 5-7C above normal. This is the result of a high-pressure system creating a heat dome over the region, whereby sinking air compresses and warms as it descends, trapping heat near the surface.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/09/weather-tracker-storms-summer-heat-europe-south-africa">Continue reading...</a></p>
