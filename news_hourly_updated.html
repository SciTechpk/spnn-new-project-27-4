                <h2>PSX continues positive trajectory to cross 135,000 points barrier</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) opened the trading week on Monday on a positive trajectory, crossing the intraday high of 135,000 due to increased investor sentiment and improved economic outlook.</p>
<p>The stock market resumed trading at 134,299.76 points and gained 1,170 points in early trading to cross the 135,000 points barrier. The benchmark KSE-100 gained 1841.11 points (1.37pc), and is currently trading at 136,119.27 points as of 12:15pm. The total volume of shares traded is 134,882,053 with a value of Rs 11.12 billion.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction as the stock market surged to cross the all-time high level.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office, he said the ‚Äúsignificant achievement by the PSX is a clear reflection of the business community‚Äôs growing confidence in Pakistan‚Äôs economy.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe recent positive economic indicators are a testament to his government‚Äôs policies moving in the right direction,‚Äù he emphasised, reiterating that providing a business-friendly environment remains the government‚Äôs top priority.‚Äú</p>
<p>He said the country had moved from economic stability towards the path of economic growth, adding that the government of Pakistan was working tirelessly for national development and public welfare.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis positive outlook follows a period of concerted efforts to stabilise the economy and implement structural reforms, which appear to be gaining traction and restoring investor trust,‚Äù he said, per the statement.</p>
<p>The previous week saw the stock market continue its record-breaking bullish run, crossing the 134,000-point threshold amid strong macroeconomic fundamentals and persistent buying by local mutual funds.</p>
<p>A surge in workers‚Äô remittances, robust auto sales, and improved foreign exchange reserves provided a solid backdrop for investor optimism, helping offset subdued participation and minor currency depreciation.</p>
<p>Workers‚Äô remittances rose to a historic $3.4bn in June, up 8pc year-on-year, taking full-year FY25 inflows to a record $38.3bn ‚Äî a 27pc increase over the previous year. The State Bank of Pakistan‚Äôs foreign exchange reserves surged by $1.8bn to $14.5bn for the week ending July 4, marking a 39-month high.</p>
<p>The auto sector further supported market gains. As per the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA), car sales in June rose 64pc year-on-year and 47pc month-on-month to 21,773 units. Full-year FY25 sales grew 43pc to 148,000 units, buoyed by pre-buying ahead of a proposed GST increase on smaller vehicles.</p></p>
