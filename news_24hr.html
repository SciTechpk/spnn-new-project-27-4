            <p><p>• President promulgates ordinance, empowering govt to transform Frontier Constabulary to meet ‘diverse security needs’<br />
• Legislation says shift necessitated by ‘changing dynamics of national security’; allows for countrywide deployment of Federal Constabulary<br />
• Force to have dedicated division for special protection and riot control</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday promulgated an ordinance empowering the federal government to transform the Frontier Constabulary (FC), a border security force, into the Federal Constabulary to maintain law and order, supplement the law enforcement agencies, and address the diverse security needs in a coordinated manner.</p>
<p>Soon after the promulgation of the ordinance, the Law and Justice Division issued an official notification to this effect. According to the ordinance, the Frontier Consta­bulary was originally established to maintain law and order in frontier and border areas, ensuring the security of these critical regions, and preserving public peace in remote territories.</p>
<p>However, the changing dynamics of national security, the increasing frequency of emergencies, natural disasters, civil unrest, and other emerging threats necessitated a more adaptable and versatile force to respond to such challenges.</p>
<p>“As the Senate and the National Assembly are not in session and the President of the Islamic Repu­blic of Pakistan is satisfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary to take immediate act­ion,” the ordinance said. The ordi­nance called the Frontier Cons­tabulary (Re-organization) Ordi­nance, 2025, came into force at once.</p>
<p>A former interior secretary told <em>Dawn</em> that the ordinance gave complete and legitimate authority to the federal government to use FC across the country and for any purpose, in the name of security.</p>
<p>He said the Frontier Consta­bulary was first deployed in Kara­chi about 25 years ago and then it was used in the federal capital. Later, it was deployed in Gilgit-Baltistan for the protection of the China-Pakistan Economic Corri­dor (CPEC) and major dam projects.</p>
<p>Before this ordinance, the use of force by the government for VIP security often attracted criticism, but now, under the name of protecting “escort”, the force can be freely used for the personal security of the elite.</p>
<p>The ordinance said that the force would be headed by an inspector general to be appointed by the federal government. The FC, it said, be used as a reserve force, to perform specialised duties in aid of the Islamabad Capital Territory Police, provincial police forces, and other security and law enforcement forces and agencies.</p>
<p>The Federal Constabulary shall be under the overall command of the inspector general, who shall be assisted by additional inspectors general, deputy inspectors general, and assistant inspectors general and such other officers of the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP), as may be appointed in the prescribed manner. It shall comprise two divisions, namely the Security Division and the Federal Reserve Division.</p>
<p>The structure of the Federal Constabulary shall comprise wings, companies and platoons, commanded by officers of the rank of superintendent of police, assistant superintendent of police, or deputy superintendent of police, inspector, sub-inspector, and assistant sub-inspector, respectively.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The FC’s Security Division shall comprise the existing strength of the Frontier Constabulary and shall consist exclusively of the personnel appointed through the traditional system as prescribed by regulations.</p>
<p>There shall be a dedicated division for anti-riot and special protection in the Federal Constabulary called the Federal Reserve Division. The Federal Constabulary shall have the powers as enshrined in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898), Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (XXVII of 1997), the Police Order, 2002 (Chief Executive’s Order No. 22 of 2002) and any other law for the time being in force.</p>
<p><strong>Shifting all powers</strong></p>
<p>In addition to such powers, the federal government may, by general or special order, confer or impose upon any member of the Federal Constabulary any of the powers or duties conferred or imposed on a police officer of any class or grade by any enactment for the time being in force.</p>
<p>The ordinance also shifts all powers and assets of the Frontier Constabulary to the Federal Constabulary, as it said: “Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force all members and employees of the Frontier Constabulary serving in the defunct Frontier Constabulary immediately before the commencement of this ordinance, immediately after the commencement of this ordinance shall stands transferred to the Federal Constabulary reconstituted under this ordinance on same terms and conditions as applicable to them before commencement of this ordinance.”</p>
<p>“All assets and liabilities of the Frontier Constabulary, of whatever nature and wherever situated, shall, upon commencement of the Federal Constabulary Ordinance stand transferred to and vest in the Federal Constabulary,” it added.</p>
<p>“All rules, regulations, notifications, and orders made or issued under the Frontier Constabulary Act, 1915, insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Federal Constabulary Ordinance, shall be deemed to have been made or issued under the corresponding provisions of the Federal Constabulary,” the ordinance said.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924025/no-headway-in-talks-on-punjab-mpas-fate' target='_blank'><strong>No headway in talks on Punjab MPAs’ fate</strong></a>
            <p><p>LAHORE: The issue of 26 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920792">suspended</a> PTI members of the Punjab Assembly continues to linger, as negotiations between the treasury and opposition remained inconclusive on Sunday.</p>
<p>The two sides met for more than two hours on the weekend. The meeting, chaired by Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan,  was also attended by Opposition Leader Ahmed Khan Bhachar.</p>
<p>The meeting was a follow-up to Friday’s huddle, where both sides agreed to resolve issues through talks after days of acrimony and recriminations.</p>
<p>The PTI lawmakers were suspended for 15 sittings after their protest during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920664">speech</a> of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif on June 27.</p>
<p>In addition, 10 members of the provincial assembly were fined Rs200,000 each for “damaging public property”, while disqualification references were also filed against them.</p>
<p>A number of treasury members had also moved for their opposition colleagues’ disqualification. It was these applications which were the subject of Sunday’s discussions.</p>
<p><strong>‘Not a deadlock’</strong></p>
<p>Speaking to the media after Sunday’s meeting, Mr Bhachar acknowledged the talks had not been fruitful so far.</p>
<p>He clarified that neither side had apologised for any verbal altercations, noting that “insults came from both sides.”</p>
<p>He emphasised that more meetings will take place and “no agreement has been reached on any point,” particularly concerning the Rules of Procedure of the House.</p>
<p>“A deadlock means walking away. Until there is no agreement, discussions will continue,” he stated.</p>
<p>He confirmed that discussions on the fines and suspension of the 26 members would also continue.</p>
<p>The PTI leader also talked about the persisting concerns of his party, including legal cases against opposition members and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">imprisonment</a> of Imran Khan, which “will not end immediately”.</p>
<p>He said PTI will move forward after consulting with the parliamentary party.</p>
<p>The meeting came a day after PTI’s top leadership, including Khyber Pakh–tunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, arrived in Lahore to support the penalised lawmakers.</p>
<p><strong>Mutual respect</strong></p>
<p>PML-N leader Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman said the two-and-a-half-hour-long talks had been “good”, but nothing was finalised yet.</p>
<p>Mr Rehman, who’s also Punjab’s finance minister, emphasised the importance of upholding the assembly’s dignity.</p>
<p>“There is much to discuss with the opposition,” Mr Rehman said, adding the people of Punjab were watching these negotiations.</p>
<p>He acknowledged public pressure from constituencies to end “hooliganism, verbal abuse,  and violent culture” within the assembly.</p>
<p>He indicated that PTI would consult with its parliamentary party, and the government would also hold consultations before the two sides reconvene for future talks.</p>
<p>“Our goal is not to de-seat anyone,” he said, adding negotiations among elected representatives “should lead to a point of agreement”.</p>
<p>He revealed that four or five agenda points were discussed and agreed upon during Sunday’s meeting.</p>
<p>Regarding the reference against the suspended members, Mr Rehman said the speaker had sent the reference as per articles 62 and 63.</p>
<p>He compared the speaker’s move to the reference against former prime minister Nawaz Sharif under Articles 62 and 63, which led to the loss of his premiership.</p>
<p>He also mentioned a harassment complaint received by the speaker, clarifying the current discussions were about assembly rules and not a compromise.</p>
<p>He hoped the situation inside the assembly matters would soon improve.</p>
<p>“The assembly rules and law stipulate how punishment and reward are meted out,” he said, adding both opposition and government should play a role in running the House smoothly.</p>
<p>Bilal Yasin, another PML-N lawmaker, also addressed the media.</p>
<p>He said PML-N leaders have trained party workers to engage in political dialogue with politicians.</p>
<p>Mr Yasin said CM Maryam also wants things to “move forward”.</p>
<p>However, he added that being CM Maryam, should be treated with respect whenever she entered the assembly.</p>
<p>Similar respect was also “obligatory” for the opposition leader.</p>
<p>He said protest was a democratic right, but agitations should be “within some limits”.</p>

            <p><p>• No plan given for Imran-announced protest; workers ask if 90-day plan has replaced Aug 5 movement<br />
• KP CM claims party will decide after three months ‘whether to continue with politics’<br />
• Days after founder eschewed talks, Gandapur claims Imran ready to sit with powers that be</p>
<p>LAHORE: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur seemed to throw a wrench in the works of a nationwide <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923856/pti-brass-gathers-in-lahore-to-kick-start-aug-5-movement">protest</a>, annou­nced by PTI founder Imran Khan, which is expected to climax on Aug 5, marking two years of the former PM’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisonment.</a></p>
<p>At a press conference on Sunday, where party leaders were expected to announce the plan for this protest, CM Gandapur caused confusion when he came up with a new 90-day timeline for what he called ‘a final push’.</p>
<p>Flanked by PTI leaders who had arrived in Lahore to launch their movement for the release of  Imran Khan and his spouse, CM Gandapur said that the 90-day countdown had already begun.</p>
<p>However, the mixed messages left party workers questioning whether this meant a postponement of the Aug 5 protest plan, or something else altogether.</p>
<p>At the press conference, the KP CM appeared to surprise even his party colleagues when he said, “The protest campaign had started last night and would reach its crescendo in 90 days for a final showdown”.</p>
<p>The KP CM did not mention any date, but when quizzed by reporters, he reiterated the party’s position that the protest campaign would be taken to its peak by Aug 5 using political means.</p>
<p>“We have to decide within 90 days whether we should even do politics in this country… if [political means] do not lead to a result, then we will let you know about our plan of action that will come forward,” he said, adding that he had given himself three months to prepare for the protest.</p>
<p>“We will either do or die,” the KP CM said, adding there was no use of politics in the country as “there is no politics”.</p>
<p><strong>Dissent from Aliya</strong></p>
<p>PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik was conspicuous by her absence from the presser. While PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja explained that she was “busy”, Ms Malik questioned this claim in a subsequent tweet.</p>
<p>“What strategy has been announced for the release of Imran Khan, how and where the protest campaign will begin? Who replaced the Aug 5 plan with 90 days?”</p>
<p>“I myself do not know where I was busy for the past two days,” she said, in a jibe at Mr Raja.</p>
<p>Some PTI workers also said that it appeared as if the party had let them off the hook for the Aug 5 protest. Some voices also questioned why the party leadership had yet to announce a proper plan for the movement, given that Aug 5 was just a few weeks away, and wondered whether this meant the protest plan had been postponed.</p>
<p><strong>‘Door open for talks’</strong></p>
<p>Even though the idea of dialogue was shunned in a tweet from Imran Khan’s official X account last week, the KP chief minister, apparently on behalf of the former premier, once again offered the military establishment to engage in dialogue with the party.</p>
<p>“Now we are giving an open offer (to the establishment) to hold dialogue with us or we will get to ‘tread on our own path’ with clear timeline and targets”.</p>
<p>He also criticised the powers that be for indulging in politics. Reiterating that the establishment had hijacked the system, the KP CM said the PTI would hold dialogue with the powers that be and went on to add that “they can let the (puppet) politicians sit beside them”.</p>
<p>“We no longer want to waste time talking to the ruling politicians, who carry no power to make a decision,” he added.</p>
<p>While the PTI has consistently been demanding <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923918">talks</a> with the establishment, these overtures have not received a positive response from the concerned quarters thus far.</p>
<p>The KP CM also blamed state institutions for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923476">spike</a> in terrorism in Balochistan and KP.</p>
<p>“When it is asked about making and breaking governments, it simply says the institution is apolitical,” he quipped, while asking the establishment to accept its mistakes and rectify them. He said the army was earning a ‘bad reputation’, and asked where it wanted to take the country.</p>
