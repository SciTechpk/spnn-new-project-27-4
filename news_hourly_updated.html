                <h2>Dar appreciates China for backing Pakistan’s sovereignty</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has appreciated China’s for firmly supporting Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, according to said a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1924668430944502134" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by the Foreign Office on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The foreign minister met with the Minister of International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Liu Jianchao, in Beijing, where he is on a visit to discuss regional stability following the recent escalation between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>According to the statement, both leaders agreed to deepen linkages between the political parties of Pakistan and the CPC. Liu reiterated that as “All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partner” and “ironclad friend”, China would continue to prioritise its relations with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Dar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911977/dar-arrives-in-china-on-3-day-official-visit-to-discuss-regional-situation">arrived</a> in China’s capital of Beijing yesterday on a three-day official visit on the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi amid regional tensions, state-owned <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>The visit comes as tensions remain high in the region following the ceasefire between Pakistan and India after a tense military standoff over the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> in Occupied Kashmir — which India blamed on Pakistan without evidence.</p>
<p>On May 6–7, Indian air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir killed civilians, prompting Islamabad to shoot down <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909794/watch-paf-shares-locations-of-5-downed-indian-fighter-jets">five Indian jets</a>. After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">drone interceptions</a> and airbase strikes, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">US intervention</a> on May 10 led to a ceasefire. India has maintained its aggressive stance, while Pakistan has warned against further escalation and offered dialogue.</p>
<p>During the visit, Dar is set to hold in-depth discussions with his Chinese counterpart on the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability.</p>
<p>The two sides will also review the entire spectrum of Pakistan-China bilateral relations and exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest.</p>
<p>Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is also expected to be in Beijing and participate in the talks to disc­uss regional peace and security.</p>
<p>Prior to his departure, Dar told the media that China was a major trading partner of Pakistan and that both countries enjoyed an iron-clad close relationship, <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>Dar said that his meetings with the Chinese leadership would mark discussions on political, local, regional and global issues, besides the recent tensions between Pakistan and India.</p></p>

            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912153/indian-foreign-secretary-says-no-us-mediation-in-ceasefire-with-pakistan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <h2>Indian foreign secretary says no US mediation in ceasefire with Pakistan</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri has said that the United States had no role in mediating the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> between New Delhi and Islamabad, according to Indian media reports on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Misri’s statement comes despite US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911576/us-averted-likely-pak-india-nuclear-war-says-trump#:~:text=US%20averted%20likely%20Pak%2DIndia%20nuclear%20war%3A%20Trump">taking credit</a> multiple <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910565/trump-says-warned-pakistan-india-of-no-trade-if-fighting-not-halted">times</a> for his administration’s role in the truce, which Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">thanked</a> him for.</p>
<p>New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating last month’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">strongly denied</a> the allegations and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>. As the situation turned into a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military confrontation</a> between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>During a meeting yesterday of the parliamentary committee on external affairs, led by Congress lawmaker Shashi Tharoor, Misri claimed that the offer for a ceasefire came from Pakistan and that no other country was involved in the negotiations, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-n-signal-pak-wasn-t-tipped-off-misri-to-panel-101747680035793.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hindustan Times</a></em> reported, citing a “senior lawmaker”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Asked by parliamentarians about Trump’s statements that Washington had helped India and Pakistan “settle” the “problem”, the report quoted Misri as saying: “New Delhi had routine talks with the US but there was no mediation.”</p>
<p>According to the report, this was Misri’s first appearance before the 31-member parliamentary panel. The meeting went on for more than three hours as members asked the foreign secretary numerous questions.</p>
<p>India’s <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.ptinews.com/story/national/india-and-pakistan-conflict-was-always-in-conventional-domain-misri-to-parliamentary-panel/2569079" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Press of Trust India</a></em>, citing sources, also stated that Misri “reiterated the government’s stand that the decision to stop military actions was taken at a bilateral level”, indicating no third-party role.</p>
<p>During the parliamentary panel’s moot, Misri was questioned about why the Indian government was giving Trump the centre stage and not refuting the US president’s claims on mediating the ceasefire.</p>
<p>However, Misri “did not give any answer” to the questions, <em>Hindustan Times</em> reported, quoting the lawmaker, whose name it did not specify.</p>
<p>“Trump publicly claimed at least seven times that he facilitated the ceasefire. Why was India silent?” <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/no-us-role-ceasefire-nuclear-signalling-pakistan-foreign-secretary-vikram-misri-tells-parliament-panel-2727150-2025-05-19" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">India Today</a></em> quoted an unnamed member of the panel as asking.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Another asked him why India “allowed Trump to repeatedly seize the narrative”, referring to the US president’s statements on the truce.</p>
<p>“The sense the MPs got was that India neither involved the US in the discussions with Pakistan nor was India involved in the US’s decision to announce it,” <em>India Today</em> stated.</p>
<p><em><a class="link--external" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-restoration-of-normalcy-with-pakistan-in-near-future-foreign-secretary-vikram-misri/articleshow/121279714.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Times of India</a></em> similarly reported that Misri reportedly said Trump made his remarks on the ceasefire on social media and not through any official channel, where India could have put its point across.</p>
<p>During the in-camera session, the foreign secretary also ruled out the “restoration of normalcy with Pakistan in [the] near future”.</p>

<p>Misri also said that the recent military confrontation with Pakistan was “entirely in the conventional domain and involved no ‘nuclear signalling’ from the other side”, the <em>Hindustan Times</em> added.</p>

<p>While Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned of an “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906661">all-out war</a>” prior to the conflict, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said last week that a nuclear war was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910847">never an option</a> for the government.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Misri was also “pressed about the number of Indian aircraft lost during the hostilities”, referring to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911307/indias-false-pride-stands-shattered-says-pm#:~:text=downing%20not%20five%20but%20six%20fighter%20planes%2C%20including%20three%20Rafale%20jets">six</a> fighters <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downed</a> by the Pakistan Air Force, <em>India Today</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/no-us-role-ceasefire-nuclear-signalling-pakistan-foreign-secretary-vikram-misri-tells-parliament-panel-2727150-2025-05-19#:~:text=Pressed%20about%20the%20number%20of%20Indian%20aircraft%20lost%20during%20the%20hostilities%2C%20the%20Foreign%20Secretary%20declined%20to%20comment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
