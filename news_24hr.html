            <p><p>Military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has rubbished rumours of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir becoming the president.</p>
<p>His statement follows a similar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923280/interior-minister-rebuts-rumours-about-president-zardari-resigning-from-office">rebuttal</a> by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi early in July, when he clarified that no idea existed “about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency”.</p>
<p>Gen Chaudhry, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general, told <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2025/08/03/pakistans-army-chief-is-cosying-up-to-donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Economist</a></em> that “talk of his boss becoming president is ‘nonsense’”.</p>
<p><em>The Economist</em> noted that COAS Munir’s popularity has surged since the May <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">conflict with India</a>. It added that the ruling coalition’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921643">recently acquired</a> two-thirds majority in the parliament needed for a Constitutional Amendment “ignited rumours that the army chief could become president too”.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856908">government</a>, as well as the military, have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1876905">repeatedly</a> warned about “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=fake%20news%20and%20propaganda%20have%20become%20so%20common%20and%20there%20is%20no%20accountability%20for%20it.%E2%80%9D">fake news and propaganda</a>” proliferating on social media, with Gen Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=theories%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20added.-,%E2%80%98Digital%20terrorism%E2%80%99,-Questioned%20about%20criticism">digital terrorism</a>” under the laws.</p>
<p>On July 10, Naqvi asserted that President Asif Ali Zardari “enjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces”.</p>
<p>He quoted the president as having “clearly” stated: “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”</p>
<p>Naqvi stressed that the “sole focus” of COAS Munir was Pakistan’s strength and stability, and “nothing else”.</p>
<p>In May, President Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formally decorated COAS Munir with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912748/president-pm-decorate-coas-munir-with-rank-of-field-marshal">rank of field marshal</a> for his “sagacious leadership and exceptional strategy” during the recent conflict with India.</p>

<p>The rank of field marshal is the highest rank of armies built on the pattern of the British Army. It has only been awarded to one other — Gen Ayub Khan — by the presidential cabinet in 1959. It is a ceremonial five-star rank that usually signifies extraordinary leadership and wartime achievement.</p>
<p>In a subsequent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913061">dinner</a> hosted by the army chief, Field Marshal Munir lauded the political leadership for their “strategic foresight” during <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> against India.</p>
<p>The next month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who belongs to PM Shehbaz’s PML-N, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918558/whats-behind-khawaja-asifs-praise-for-hybrid-system">hailed</a> the “existing hybrid model of governance” in the country. In a separate interview, he also termed it as a “practical necessity” for Pakistan, saying the system was “doing wonders”.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) continued its record-setting rally for a fourth consecutive session on Wednesday, soaring past 144,000 points during intraday high.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,041.24 points (0.73 per cent) to reach 144,078.40 points at 1:29pm, from the previous close of 143,037.16 points.</p>
<p>The market reached an intraday high of 144,285.74 points at 11:37am, gaining 1,248.58 points (0.87pc) from yesterday’s close.</p>
<p>Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “The market is up as corporate results are expected to be better.”</p>
<p>A key factor behind the market’s upbeat performance was the release of Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929033/non-tax-bonanza-pushes-tax-ratio-to-21-year-high">fiscal data</a> for FY25. The government reported a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929033/non-tax-bonanza-pushes-tax-ratio-to-21-year-high#:~:text=These%20windfalls%20reduced%20the%20fiscal%20deficit%20to%20a%209%2Dyear%20low%20of%205.4pc%20in%20FY25">nine-year low</a> fiscal deficit of 5.38pc, with revenue growth of 36pc year-on-year (YoY), outpacing an 18pc rise in expenditures.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>This performance surpassed both the government’s and the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) forecast of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911133">5.6pc GDP deficit</a>. The positive fiscal data, along with market optimism over fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability, is expected to fuel further market momentum in the coming sessions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation pointed to the government’s approval to resume subsidies for the fully-funded <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920470#:~:text=Pakistan%20Remittance%20Initiative%20%E2%80%94%20a%20government%20scheme%20designed%20to%20incentivise%20banks%20and%20exchange%20companies%20to%20solicit%20the%20flow%20of%20remittances">remittances scheme</a>, as well as speculations regarding steps to resolve the power sector’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903565">circular debt</a>, as catalysts for the bullish close.</p>

            <p><p>Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal stressed Pakistan’s interest in benefitting from China’s technological progress for the development of electric vehicles (EVs), state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/06-08-2025/planning-minister-reaffirms-pakistans-interest-in-partnering-with-chinese-ev-firms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pakistan and China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/china-says-it-backs-pakistan-in-defending-sovereignty">share</a> a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure — with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884628">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media in Beijing during an official visit, the planning and development minister expressed Pakistan’s “desire to benefit from Chinese technological advancements”, according to <em>Radio Pakistan</em>.</p>
<p>This includes the development of next-generation batteries, such as sodium-ion batteries, which offer advantages over traditional lithium technology.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Iqbal also reaffirmed Pakistan’s interest in developing the EV sector in partnership with China, noting electric vehicles as a “key area of future cooperation between Pakistan and China”.</p>
<p>He stressed that establishing EV manufacturing in Pakistan would offer cost advantages for Chinese companies, adding that it would also help Pakistan to reduce its dependence on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923612/centres-policies-hindering-development-of-sindhs-energy-sector-murad">fossil fuels</a>.</p>
<p>The planning minister is currently on an official visit to China, where he is conducting meetings with officials to strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries and advance plans for economic cooperation and development.</p>
<p>Last week, Iqbal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928392">met</a> with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong in Beijing, where the two parties discussed the second phase of CPEC, industrial development and business-to-business cooperation.</p>
<p>On Sunday, he <a class="link--external" href="https://pc.gov.pk/web/press/get_press/1611" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">met with</a> the president of China’s Development Research Centre and Centre for International Knowledge on Development, Lu Hao. During the meeting, Iqbal stated that strong economic collaboration between Pakistan and China was key to national development.</p>

<p>Separately, the government yesterday approved a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929034/new-car-levy-to-power-ev-revolution">five-year subsidy scheme</a> for the rollout of 116,000 electric bikes and 3,170 electric rickshaws/loaders, with an estimated cost of around Rs100bn.</p>
<p>The scheme is part of efforts to encourage the adoption of EVs in Pakistan, reduce oil imports, and foster environmental sustainability. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to launch the initiative on August 14 formally.</p></p>
