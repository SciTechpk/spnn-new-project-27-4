                <h2>Pakistani delegation briefs UNSC members on Indian ‚Äòthreat to regional peace‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A top Pakistani delegation briefed elected members of the United Nations Security Council on Monday about the ‚Äúthreat to regional peace‚Äù posed by India‚Äôs actions amid the recent spike in tensions between the two countries.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">high-level team</a> ‚Äî consisting of three former foreign ministers, two former foreign sec¬≠¬≠retaries, two former ambassadors to the US, and a serving federal minister ‚Äî arrived in New York yesterday for consultations at the United Nations, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/visits-of-high-level-delegations-to-important-capitals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> today.</p>
<p>The delegation will also visit Washington DC, London and Brussels, the FO said.</p>
<p>Ex-FMs PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; and Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh¬≠mina Janjua are members of the first delegation.</p>
<p>The PPP said in a post on X that the delegation met elected UNSC members ‚Äúto expose Indian propaganda‚Äù and present Pakistan‚Äôs position to representatives from Denmark, Greece, Panama, Somalia, Algeria, Guyana, Japan, South Korea, Sierra Leone and Slovenia.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs targeting of urban areas and suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty are a threat to regional peace,‚Äù Bilawal told the representatives.</p>
<p>The statement said he refuted ‚Äúbaseless Indian allegations‚Äù with arguments before the representatives, saying that ‚Äúaccusing Pakistan without any research or evidence is unacceptable.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe international community should not be limited to post-conflict resolution efforts but should find pre-conflict solutions for lasting peace in South Asia.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan‚Äôs response to Indian aggression was measured, responsible and in accordance with the UN Charter,‚Äù he briefed the representatives about the country‚Äôs response in the recent military escalation with India.</p>
<p>Other members of the delegation also briefed the UNSC representatives that India‚Äôs suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty could lead to water shortage, food crisis and environmental destruction in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The statement said the representatives appreciated Pakistan‚Äôs diplomatic efforts.</p>

<p>In a separate post, Bilawal said the two sides held a ‚Äúsubstantive exchange‚Äù in which Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúprincipled and responsible stance in the face of India‚Äôs escalating provocations‚Äù was conveyed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúReaffirmed our abiding commitment to restraint, diplomacy, dialogue, and a rules-based international order. Underscored the dangers of India‚Äôs weaponisation of water by violating [Indus Water Treaty] and resolving the Kashmir dispute in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions. Pakistan unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and remains a victim of terrorism, planned and sponsored from beyond our borders. We do not seek conflict, but stand fully prepared to defend our sovereignty and territorial integrity. South Asia cannot afford another crisis.‚Äù</p>

<p>The delegation earlier met China‚Äôs United Nations envoy Fu Cong to discuss the regional security situation and Indian aggression.</p>
<p>Bilawal expressed gratitude for China‚Äôs support during the tensions with India and briefed the Chinese official on Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúresponsible conduct‚Äù after the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia rejected Pakistan‚Äôs offer for a transparent and impartial investigation. Resolution of Kashmir issue is essential for lasting peace in South Asia,‚Äù Bilawal told the Chinese envoy and appealed to China to play its role in this regard as per the UN resolutions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe international community has moved beyond crisis management and towards solutions. India‚Äôs suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty is tantamount to weaponising water,‚Äù Bilawal said.</p>
<p>The delegation also expressed serious concerns over ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs targeting of Pakistani citizens‚Äù.</p>
<p>The two sides agreed to oppose unilateral actions and aggression and vowed to restore peace in the region through multilateral cooperation. They also emphasised the need to respect the UN Charter, international laws and agreements.</p>

<p>The group is scheduled to meet UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Gute¬≠rres, the president of the UN General Assembly and ambassadors of all five permanent members of the Security Council. It will also address a joint session of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation envoys.</p>
<p>In a post on X, Bilawal said he was carrying a ‚Äúclear message‚Äù with him.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan seeks peace with dignity, dialogue with purpose, and partnerships built on justice. The unresolved issue of Kashmir continues to threaten regional peace. Any aggression over shared water resources challenges not just Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty, but global stability. We reject terrorism in all forms, yet oppose its misuse as a political tool to target Pakistan. Trade must become a bridge, not a battleground. It‚Äôs time for the world to engage, not ignore.‚Äù</p>

<p>The delegation will kick off its engagements on June 3, with planned meetings with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, senior administration officials, lawmakers, think-tank analysts, and leading media organisations.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe visits of these delegations are aimed at projecting Pakistan‚Äôs perspective on the recent Indian aggression,‚Äù the FO statement read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe delegations will highlight Pakistan‚Äôs responsible and restrained conduct ‚Äî seeking peace with responsibility ‚Äî in the face of India‚Äôs reckless and belligerent actions in violation of international law.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>Responsibility of SC judges to speak truth demands courage to defy political pressure: Justice Shah</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Supreme Court (SC) Senior Puisne Judge Mansoor Ali Shah has said that SC justices have a responsibility to ‚Äúspeak truth to power, guided by the Constitution as their unwavering normative anchor‚Äù, in an interview seen by <em>Dawn.com</em> on Monday.</p>
<p>Shah has previously expressed that the judiciary needs to stand against influence or pressure from the executive. In November 2024, he said, ‚ÄúThe independence of the judiciary is the cornerstone of justice, and its true test lies in a judge‚Äôs ability to stand firm under authoritarian regimes.‚Äù</p>
<p>Speaking exclusively to law magazine <em><a class="link--external" href="https://the-legal.org/the-legal-international-13th-issue-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Legal</a></em>, Shah said that the role of SC justices must be understood as that of protectors of the Constitution and fundamental rights rather than as policymakers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúJudges must balance respect for legislative intent with a commitment to constitutional principles, ensuring that the judiciary acts as an impartial arbiter rather than a policymaker,‚Äù he said in response to a question about the role of SC judges amid a shifting legal landscape.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTheir role demands not only legal expertise but also wisdom, courage, and humility, as their decisions profoundly impact individuals and society at large,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt the heart of this role lies a deeper philosophical imperative: judges must speak truth to power, guided by the Constitution as their unwavering normative anchor.‚Äù</p>
<p>Justice Shah noted that this responsibility ‚Äúrequires not compromise but courage to defy political pressures, resist majoritarian impulses, and stand firm in the face of injustice‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet future jurists not be defined by fear or fatigue, but by purpose. Let them carry forward a judiciary that is not complicit in silence, but committed to struggle. The Constitution doesn‚Äôt just need protection it needs protectors,‚Äù he emphasised.</p>
<p>Previously, Shah <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878549">termed</a> the passing of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866452/26th-constitutional-amendment-awaits-presidential-assent-after-sailing-through-na-in-late-night-session">26th Constitutional Amendment</a> ‚Äúone of its (the judiciary‚Äôs) weakest moments in our history‚Äù, expressing concern that executive overreach was interfering in judicial affairs and processes.</p>
<p>In a letter to SC Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail written in December, Shah wrote, ‚ÄúThis unprecedented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1877116">shift</a> in the composition of the JCP (Judicial Commission of Pakistan) poses grave risks, including the potential for political appointments and the packing of courts with judges lacking an ideological commitment to the rule of law.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909718">landmark decision</a> in May, the SC allowed civilians accused in the May 9, 2023 riots ‚Äî triggered by the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan ‚Äî to be tried in military courts, overturning an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783065/may-9-riots-sc-declares-military-trials-of-civilians-null-and-void">earlier ruling</a> that declared military trials of civilians null and void.</p>
<p>However, the decision was not unanimous ‚Äî the two dissenting judges, Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Naeem Akhtar Afghan ‚Äî declared military court convictions ‚Äúwithout jurisdiction‚Äù and unconstitutional. Rights groups and leaders of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) have likewise decried the ruling, citing concerns over due process.</p>
<p>The legal fraternity weighed in too, warning that the judgment threatened the right to a fair trial and chipped away at civilian justice system.</p></p>
