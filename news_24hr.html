            <p><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has reiterated that “Indian state-sponsored terrorism against Pakistan” — which he said had been ongoing since the inception of the country — was also responsible for the recent attack in Balochistan’s Khuzdar.</p>
<p>On May 21, at least six people, including three students, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912572/bla-and-ttp-are-indian-proxies-govt-will-prove-indias-involvement-in-khuzdar-bus-attack-asif">slain</a> while over 40 others — mostly students — were injured after a bomb targeted a school bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the army’s top brass, during the 270th Corps Commander Conference (CCC), had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912622/armys-top-brass-vows-to-stop-externally-sponsored-terrorists-from-destroying-national-peace-ispr">pointed out</a> India’s involvement in the incident, vowing that the armed forces will prevent the country’s peace from being compromised by “externally-sponsored terrorism.”</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Key points</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Initial findings confirm that Khuzdar attack fits pattern of violence sponsored by India through Fitnah al Hindustan</li>
<li>“Pakistan has irrefutable evidence of Indian involvement in terrorism,“says DG ISPR</li>
<li>DG ISPR, interior secretary reiterate that Pakistan will not let India succeed</li>
<li>Says BLA has expressed willingness to be Delhi’s “practical and military arm”</li>
<li>DG ISPR vehemently criticises BYC, says media needs to “unmask” the group</li>
<li>Says attacks have no relation to Baloch identity</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry was addressing a press conference in Islamabad today alongside the Interior Secretary, Captain (retd) Khurram Muhammad Agha.</p>
<p>“India was planning and instructing terrorist activities taking place in Pakistan, the funding for which is also provided by India,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. “The attack in Balochistan had nothing to do with the Baloch identity, rather it was just India’s provocation.”</p>
<p>The DG ISPR highlighted that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870033">attack</a> on the Chinese envoy in Karachi in Oct 2024 also had Indian backing. “The Indian social media accounts affiliated with the Indian intelligence agency RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) posted about the attack beforehand.”</p>

<p>He added that the same thing happened during the hijacking of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419/jaffar-express-hijacking-state-media-reports-190-rescued-2nd-day-of-operation-underway-in-balochistan">Jaffar Express</a> train in March when more than 400 passengers were taken hostage by the banned Balochistan Liberation Army terrorists.</p>
<p>“Before the Jaffer Express incident occurred, they [the social media accounts] were asking followers to ‘keep an eye on Pakistan today and tomorrow’.”</p>
<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry pointed out that the Indian media was “celebrating” the attack in Khuzdar.</p>
<p>“These are all Indian accounts, affiliated with RAW [and] posting for BLA and <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em>, he said, referring to the government-designated term for all terror outfits in Balochistan. “What kind of a country celebrates acts of terrorism?”</p>

<p>The DG ISPR also maintained that New Delhi had been involved in perpetrating terrorism across the country “since the inception of Pakistan.”</p>
<p>“In 2009, the Pakistani government handed a dossier containing irrefutable evidence [of India’s involvement in terror attacks across Pakistan] to the Indian prime minister,” he said. “The publicly disclosed documents released in 2010 are part of history. In 2016, the world saw another ugly face of India-sponsored terrorism in Balochistan in the form of [Indian spy] Kulbushan Jadhav, a serving Indian naval officer,” he said.</p>
<p>Jadhav was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1326535#:~:text=Jadhav%20was%20arrested%20on%20March%203%2C%202016%2C%20in%20a%20counter%2Dintelligence%20operation%20in%20Balochistan%27s%20Mashkel%20area%20for%20his%20involvement%20in%20espionage%20and%20sabotage%20activities%20against%20Pakistan.">arrested</a> on March 3, 2016, in a counter-intelligence operation in Balochistan’s Mashkel area for his involvement in espionage and sabotage activities against Pakistan.</p>
<p>“Then in [2020], a dossier full of evidence was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1590333">presented</a> to the United Nations. Very recently, the international media has seen confessions and acknowledgement of multiple surrendered terrorists of this <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em>,” he said.</p>
<p>Interior Secretary Agha also said that India was behind the terrorist incident in Khuzdar on May 21.</p>
<p>“In the aftermath of the despicable terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar in the early morning of May 21, this cowardly attack targeted innocent children, our future, resulting in the tragic loss of six children and injuries to 31 others.</p>
<p>“Let me be unequivocal that this was not an attack on a bus alone, it was an attack on our values, our education, and the very fabric of our society,” Capt (retd) Agha said.</p>

<p>“On behalf of the government of Pakistan, I extend my deepest condolences to the families of the victims, we share their grief and we stand by them in this hour of immense suffering. The Ministry of Interior, in close cooperation with the provincial authorities and the law enforcement agencies, is looking into all [aspects] of this dastardly attack.”</p>
<p>Capt (retd) Agha said initial findings confirmed that this attack was a continuation of a broader pattern of violence sponsored by India through <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em>, operating under the tutelage and intelligence of the Indian intelligence agency, RAW [Research and Analysis Wing].</p>
<p>“Having miserably failed in the so-called Operation Sindoor, the terror proxies of Hindustan have been tasked to accentuate their heinous attacks of terrorism in Balochistan and elsewhere. Let me be absolutely clear here, the people of Pakistan will not let them succeed.</p>
<p>“Pakistan and its people, particularly in Balochistan, reject this nefarious design. The state has the capacity and the will to dismantle these networks and bring the perpetrators and their handlers to justice. Such actions will have consequences.”</p>
<p>He said in the past couple of years, having suffered immense casualties in their attempts against hard targets, <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em> has resorted to hitting soft targets, wayfarers, labourers working on development projects, infrastructure and machinery to paint a picture of loosening control of the State.</p>
<p>“Much against the tradition and culture of the Baloch, these terrorists have stooped so low that innocent school children have now been targeted. I assure you that the State, in collaboration with the provincial governments and the state apparatus, will defeat them.</p>
<p>“These Indian-sponsored terrorists have no place in Pakistan and our national discourse. We have … commitment to bring an end to this violence. Our resolve is firm and our response will be decisive. They will not succeed.”</p>

<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry then spoke about the Indian attacks on Pakistan on May 6 and 7, which were carried out by New Delhi after blaming Islamabad for April’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> in occupied Kashmir and led to civilian deaths.</p>
<p>“Never in modern history have you seen any nation, any media celebrating the killing of children and women the way [India] is celebrating.</p>
<p>“This is the low moral fibre and level that the current Indian political elite has brought the society to.”</p>

<p>He said that one of the proxies of the <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em> on May 11 issued a press release displaying a post from BLA.</p>
<p>In the post, he said that the BLA had assured India that if it received “political, diplomatic and defence support” from New Delhi, “We, along with the entire nation, is ready to attack from the western border and we will become its [India’s] practical and military arm”.</p>
<p>He said that RAW made BLA issue this press release “because they are unable to deter the state of Pakistan … They attack but the resolve of Pakistani people has not diminished.”</p>
<p>“Will we be deterred by the <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em> with such press releases and cowardly actions? Absolutely not. Never,” he said.</p>

<p>He further said, “Instead of refraining from their oppression of minorities or finding a solution, India is carrying out terrorist activities in Pakistan and the region.”</p>
<p>“They are externalising internal issues and when anyone asks for evidence, they do not have evidence. Who is the state sponsor of terrorism and the epicentre of destabilisation in this region?” he questioned.</p>
<p>The DG ISPR also called out the Indian media for spreading propaganda and said: “The Indian media is not free but controlled by the state,” he said, adding that those who were questioning media freedom in Pakistan were now aware of how free it was, compared to the “conditions of media in a so-called democracy [India].”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#terrorists-who-surrendered-confessed-to-having-links-with-india" id="terrorists-who-surrendered-confessed-to-having-links-with-india" title="Permalink"></a>‘Terrorists who surrendered confessed to having links with India’</h2>
<p>Speaking about terrorists who had surrendered before the State, the DG ISPR said: “There were some brave ones who stood up and surrendered because they realised that they were not there to fight India’s war. They [surrendered terrorists] come and tell us how India was involved.”</p>
<p>He highlighted the case of Adeela Baloch, a former militant who had surrendered herself to the authorities.</p>
<p>“She was exploited and blackmailed by the <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em> to become a suicide bomber,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said, adding that India was “exploiting young women from Balochistan.”</p>
<p>In response to a question about a policy to counter <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em>, the DG ISPR replied: “I would say that our one-liner policy is that the nation, this iron wall, we fought in a gallant and exemplary manner against the Indian military aggression on the night of [May] 6 and 7, and you saw it again on May 10.</p>
<p>“This steel wall needs to be in unison and turned against the forces of terrorism.”</p>
<p>The DGR ISPR further said: “We need to understand certain facts. Why did the Indians feel the need to resort to this military escalation? One of the very important reasons was that all elements of national power over the last two years have gelled together.”</p>
<p>He went on to say that Pakistan had begun “squeezing the space for terrorists to operate” and that in the first five months of this year, 203 terrorists had been killed in Balochistan alone.</p>
<p>“Illegal Afghans are being pushed out and actions are being taken against the crime-terror nexus. In Balochistan, illegal trade routes are being shut down to stop funding for these terrorists,” DG ISPR added.</p>
<p>Answering another question, the DG ISPR vehemently criticised the Baloch Yakjehti Committee and its leader Dr Mahrang Baloch, saying that the media needed to “unmask” the group and its membership.</p>
<p>“The state has taken action against the BYC [and] their space has been squeezed,” he said.</p>
<p>He said that India’s military escalation was a necessity to create space for their proxy groups in the region, but stated that Pakistan did not disengage a single soldier from its counterterrorism force.</p>
<p>“Did we take even one soldier out? No. Because we knew they would operate in unison.”</p>
<p>He added that India was growing frustrated and desperate, stating that the country’s media was “howling” about Balochistan.</p>
<p>“It is clear that this is not a war of the Baloch, it is a war against Indian terror proxies who are killing children for money. Once they know it, then they get worried,” DG ISPR said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#a-rational-player" id="a-rational-player" title="Permalink"></a>‘A rational player’</h2>
<p>DG ISPR reiterated that Pakistan was the “rational player” in the scenario with India and stated that the Pahalgam attack took place due to “India’s own oppression in Kashmir”.</p>
<p>“Their response was totally irrational, illogical and unilateral,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. “Pakistan is approaching the issue of terrorism in Balochistan rationally because we are resolving it in unison and with the synergetic application of all elements of national power.</p>
<p>“[The] military is one part, where we have carried out more than 93,000 operations across Pakistan in one and a half years,” he added. Another part is socioeconomic, another is diplomacy, while the other part is us sitting here telling the people and the international community that this has nothing to do with Balochistan.</p>
<p>“This is state-sponsored terrorism by India.”</p>
<p>DG ISPR added that Pakistan “striking Indian cities and temples” would not resolve the problem, adding that “that is not how a rational state acts.</p>
<p>“We are going to tell the world … that this is the epicentre of destabilisation in this region, India,” he added. “[They have] a history that starts from 1971 with the Mukti Bahini, and even before. And in multiple countries of this region. I will not name it now but there is proof, the world knows it.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Adviser to the Finance Minister, Khurram Schehzad, on Friday announced that the federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-26 will be presented on June 10.</p>
<p>Earlier, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909569">announced</a> that the federal government will present the next fiscal year’s budget on June 2, with a 16 per cent lower development allocation of Rs921 billion, resulting in the likely closure of about 200 ongoing development projects.</p>
<p>The adviser published a post on X today, which read, “The Federal Budget for FY 2025–26 of Pakistan will be presented on June 10, 2025.</p>
<p>“The Pakistan Economic Survey 2024–25 will be released a day before the Federal Budget, on June 9, 2025,” he added.</p>

<p>Last year, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1839433">presented</a> his first federal budget with a total outlay of Rs18.9 trillion, which analysts said was broadly “in line with IMF guidelines”.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb, during the budget presentation, said that the goal was to widen the tax base to avoid burdening existing taxpayers.</p>

<p>Pakistan’s total revenue for the current fiscal year was budgeted at Rs17,815bn. After accounting for provincial transfers of Rs7,438bn, the net revenue stood at Rs10,377bn, representing a significant 48.7pc increase from the fiscal year 2023-24.</p>
<p>The government also set an ambitious tax collection target for the Federal Board of Revenue at Rs12,970bn, a 38pc increase from last year’s goal.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said that its executive board approved funding for Pakistan after the country “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912850/pakistan-met-all-economic-targets-eff-decisions-taken-by-consensus-imf">met all the targets</a>” under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme, adding that the loan programme for Islamabad was only for stabilisation of foreign exchange reserves and not related to the budget financing.</p>

It had made progress on some of the reforms, and for that reason, the Board went ahead and approved the programme.”</p></p>

            <p><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday said that its executive board approved funding for Pakistan after the country “met all the targets” under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme, adding that the loan programme for Islamabad was only for stabilisation of foreign exchange reserves and not related to the budget financing.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691/imf-approves-disbursement-of-1bn-to-pakistan-under-7bn-deal#:~:text=A%20statement%20from%20the%20Prime%20Minister%E2%80%99s%20Office%20(PMO)%20said%20PM%20Shehbaz%20Sharif%20expressed%20satisfaction%20over%20the%20approval%20and%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20failure%20of%20India%E2%80%99s%20high%2Dhanded%20tactics%E2%80%9D%20against%20Pakistan.">Indian attempts</a> to derail Pakistan’s loan programme, the IMF approved the immediate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912609">disbursement</a> of about $1 billion to Pakistan under the ongoing EFF and allowed an additional arrangement for the $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).</p>
<p>During a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2025/05/22/tr-05222025-com-regular-press-briefing-may-22-2025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press briefing</a> in Washington D.C., IMF Director of the Communications Department, Julie Kozack, said, “Our Board found that Pakistan had indeed met all of the targets.  It had made progress on some of the reforms, and for that reason, the Board went ahead and approved the programme.”</p>
<p>An Indian journalist asked the spokesperson on the recent bailout package by IMF to Pakistan, saying “the Indian government has expressed a lot of displeasure with Pakistan planning to use this package to build—rebuild—areas that allegedly support cross-border terrorism.” She also asked a question related to the “majority vote that was received in approving this bailout package for Pakistan on May 9.”</p>
<p>Another journalist asked about the implications of the escalation between Pakistan and India on both economies, while another questioned what “safeguards the IMF has that its funds won’t be used for military or in support of military actions.” The journalist also asked about the controversy about the termination of India’s IMF Executive Director, KV Subramanian.</p>
<p>In response to the questions, Kozack said the IMF’s Executive Board approved Pakistan’s EFF programme in September of 2024.</p>
<p>“The first review at that time was planned for the first quarter of 2025.  And consistent with that timeline, on March 25th of 2025, the IMF Staff and the Pakistani authorities reached a Staff-Level Agreement on the First Review for the EFF,” she said.</p>
<p>She added that the agreement was then presented to the Fund’s Executive Board, which completed the review on May 9.  “As a result of the completion of that review, Pakistan received the disbursement at that time,” she said.</p>
<p>Kozack explained that the global money-lender had a standard procedure in place under its programmes which allowed its executive board to conduct periodic reviews of lending programs to assess countries’ progress. The board, she said, particularly looked at whether the programme was on track, whether the conditions under the programme were met, and whether any policy changes were needed to bring the programme back on track.</p>
<p>She then said that Pakistan’s programme was approved after the country successfully met all of the required targets.</p>
<p>Regarding the question on safeguards, she clarified that IMF financing was provided to members for the purpose of resolving balance of payments problems, therefore, in the case of Pakistan, all the disbursements received under the EFF were allocated to the reserves of the central bank.</p>
<p>“So, those disbursements are at the central bank, and under the programme, those resources are not part of budget financing.  They are not transferred to the government to support the budget,” she said.</p>
<p>The IMF spokesperson added the programme provides additional safeguards through conditionality that includes targets on the accumulation of international reserves.</p>
<p>“It includes a zero target, meaning no lending from the central bank to the government.  And the programme also includes substantial structural conditionality around improving fiscal management,” she said, adding that any deviation from the established programme conditions would impact future reviews.</p>
<p>Kozack said that the appointment and resignation of an executive board member was the prerogative of any country, and it was completely up to the country’s authorities to determine who represented them at the Fund.</p>
<p>On the Pakistan-India tension, Kozack expressed regrets and sympathies for the loss of life and hoped for a peaceful resolution of the conflict.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the IMF had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">approved</a> two major financing arrangements for the country — a $1 billion disbursement under the EFF and a new RSF aimed at supporting climate-related initiatives.</p>
<p>In a statement, the IMF said its Executive Board completed the first review of Pakistan’s economic reform programme supported by the EFF Arrangement.</p>
<p>“This decision allows for an immediate disbursement of around $1bn (SDR or special drawing rights 760 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to about $2.1bn (SDR 1.52bn). In addition, the IMF Executive Board approved the authorities’ request for an arrangement under the RSF, with access of about $1.4bn (SDR 1bn),” it said.</p>
<p>It noted that Pakistan’s policy efforts under the EFF had already delivered “significant progress” in stabilising the economy and rebuilding confidence, amidst a challenging global environment.</p>
<p>“Fiscal performance has been strong, with a primary surplus of two per cent of gross domestic product achieved in the first half of FY25, keeping Pakistan on track to meet the end-FY25 target of 2.1pc of GDP. Inflation fell to a historic low of 0.3pc in April, and progress on disinflation and steadier domestic and external conditions, have allowed the State Bank of Pakistan to cut the policy rate by a total of 1100 bps since June 2025. Gross reserves stood at $10.3bn at end-April, up from $9.4bn in August 2024, and are projected to reach $13.9bn by end-June 2025 and continue to be rebuilt over the medium term.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it said the RSF would support the authorities’ efforts to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and build economic and climate resilience.</p>

<p>In a separate development on Friday, President Asif Ali Zardari held a meeting with a delegation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), led by the Director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department Jihad Azour, highlighting the Fund’s positive role in promoting economic development in developing nations.</p>
<p>Discussing Pakistan’s current economic situation and the ongoing IMF programme, the president acknowledged and appreciated the IMF’s contribution to Pakistan’s economic progress, according to the state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/president-lauds-imf-programs-role-in-pakistans-economic-stability-growth/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)</a></em>.</p>
<p>The delegation members expressed satisfaction over Pakistan’s efforts for economic reforms and implementation of the IMF programme, which they observed was progressing in the right direction.</p>
<p>“The delegation further emphasised that the programme assisted in reducing inflation and fiscal deficit and strengthening Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves,” per the report.</p>
<p>President Zardari thanked the IMF for its continued support and cooperation with Pakistan and also appreciated the finance ministry for its efforts to improve the national economy, it added.</p>
<p>A day prior, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also held a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912609">meeting</a> with the delegation, reaffirming his government’s commitment to fast track institutional reforms alongside macroeconomic stabilisation, asserting that Pakistan was now firmly on the path to economic development.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is now moving from economic stability toward sustainable growth,” the prime minister had said, emphasising that the government’s top priority was not only to sustain macroeconomic gains but to expedite comprehensive institutional reforms, crucial for long-term resilience.</p>
