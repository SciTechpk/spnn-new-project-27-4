                <h2>Officials say over 200 stranded tourists rescued amid GB floods; govt issues landslide alert</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Over 200 trapped tourists have been rescued in Gilgit-Baltistan‚Äôs Diamer after flash floods triggered by heavy rain swept through the district, the local government spokesperson said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued a landslide alert for various areas in GB, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>A day ago, at least four tourists were killed, two others injured, and 15 went missing due to the floods in Diamer‚Äôs Babusar area. The devastating impacts of climate cha¬≠nge have become more visible in GB as cloudburst-induced floods wreaked havoc across the region.</p>
<p>Government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said in a statement, ‚ÄúMore than 200 rescued tourists have been shifted to Chilas and provided shelter in hotels and guest houses.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that the tourists were now able to contact their families after being stranded for hours.</p>
<p>The death toll since yesterday currently stands at five, according to Diamer District Commissioner Attaullah Kakar.</p>
<p>Kakar detailed that rescue operations were still underway to look for missing tourists, while four of the five deceased have been identified. According to Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abdul Hameed, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719/four-tourists-killed-15-missing-as-rains-lash-gilgit-baltistan#:~:text=He%20estimated%20that%2020%20to%2030%20tourists%20from%20different%20parts%20of%20the%20country%20might%20be%20missing.">20 to 30 tourists</a> from different parts of the country might be missing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe military is participating in the rescue operation and evacuating tourists to safer places,‚Äù he said in a statement.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Diamer administration declared a state of emergency along Thack-Babusar Road, suspending all tourist movement between Zero Point and Babusar Top.</p>
<p>A notification by Diamer District Magistrate Ataur Rehman, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, said all travellers ‚Äúshould be stopped at both ends‚Äù of the road until further notice.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll tourists and local residents are strongly advised to evacuate to designated safe zones immediately and to avoid any travel on Babusar Road until its complete rehabilitation,‚Äù the notification read.</p>
<p>An emergency control room was also established that will operate ‚Äúround the clock‚Äù. It can be contacted at 05812-920181 and 05812-930037. The district magistrate also ordered six companies to dispatch at least two excavators each to the Babusar area to assist in road rehabilitation and retrieval of bodies, if any.</p>
<p>According to DC Kakar, the Force Command Northern Areas (FCNA) of the Pakistan Army has been providing medical assistance and food to stranded tourists on Babusar via helicopters.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOne of the five bodies will be transported via helicopter later today,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Muhammad Ali, a local social worker, told <em>Dawn.com</em>: ‚ÄúThirty vehicles were swept away by the floods, and most people have been rescued by the locals.‚Äù</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The GB govt spokesperson told <em>Dawn.com</em>: ‚ÄúBabusar road was still blocked due to heavy mud on the road, but authorities have been instructed to reach the area‚Äù.</p>
<p>Outlining the damage, Faraq said that ‚Äúmore than 50 houses have been damaged in the flood since yesterday‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn Babusar, a wheat depot, a girls‚Äô school, a police checkpoint, a tourism police shelter and four bridges have been washed away, while two mosques and a windmill have also been damaged.‚Äù</p>
<p>Faraq shared that construction has begun on the restoration of highways and connecting roads, after the floods damaged a portion of the Karakoram Highway (KKH), leaving thousands of tourists and passengers stranded on both sides.</p>

<p>Skardu Rescue 1122, in its WhatsApp channel, said three people were injured due to the flood in the Sadpara village, while the deluge has also hit the Kharmang district.</p>
<p>Ghulam Muhammad, spokesperson for the Baltistan Division Police Department, said in a statement: ‚ÄúIn Deosai, 413 tourist vehicles were stranded on the road connecting Sadpara and Deosai, after it was closed at ten different points due to the floods.‚Äù</p>

<p>Retired Colonel Ishaq Qazi, aged approximately 62‚Äì64 years and a resident of Defence Housing Authority Phase 5, ‚Äúleft his home along with his daughter, aged around 25 years, in a grey Honda City vehicle‚Äù, said a statement by Islamabad‚Äôs Sihala police station.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDue to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>A search operation by the police, Rescue 1122, DHA Phase 5 staff and a team of divers was underway, the statement said.</p>

<p>Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country.</p>
<p>According to the NDMA‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndma.gov.pk/sitrepm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>, monsoon rains since June 26 have killed 234 people across the country and injured 596. Of these, 13 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours.</p>

                <h2>Young student allegedly beaten to death by seminary teachers in Swat: police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A young student was allegedly beaten to death by his madressah teachers on Monday evening in Swat‚Äôs Chaliyar village, according to the police.</p>
<p>Swat District Police Spokesperson Moin Fayaz said in a statement that the victim, Farhan, had missed classes for a few days before the incident occurred.</p>
<p>Police and eyewitnesses said that three teachers reportedly beat Farhan in front of fellow students.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe had just returned to school after being absent for some days,‚Äù said one of Farhan‚Äôs classmates, who chose not to be named.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur teachers started hitting him hard. Later, they dragged him into a side room and kept beating him. I was called in to bring water. He drank a little, then put his head in my lap ‚Äî and just went silent.‚Äù</p>
<p>Farhan was rushed to the nearest hospital by students and teachers, but doctors declared him dead upon arrival, according to Fayaz.</p>
<p>A first information report (FIR), a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, has been registered against all three suspects under Sections 302 (premeditated murder) and Section 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code, as well as Section 37 (punishment for violence) of the Child Protection Act (CPA).</p>
<p>‚ÄúOne of the suspects has been taken into custody, while efforts are underway to arrest the other two.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is a deeply disturbing case. A thorough investigation is ongoing, and we are committed to ensuring justice for the child and his family,‚Äù Fayaz said.</p>
<p>Farhan‚Äôs uncle, Saddar Ayaz, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that when his nephew was at home, he was afraid to go back to the madressah and did not want to return.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI took him to the seminary myself, handed him over to the teachers, and went back,‚Äù Ayaz said. ‚ÄúLater that evening, one of the teachers called me and told me that my nephew had fallen in the toilet and died.‚Äù</p>
<p>Human rights groups and local residents have demanded action ‚Äî not just to punish those responsible, but to prevent future tragedies.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFarhan could have been any of our children,‚Äù said Haider Ali, a local elder. ‚ÄúHe went to study. He never came back.‚Äù</p>
<p>Under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act 2010 and its 2018 regulations, corporal punishment is a punishable offence, violation of which can result in up to six months of imprisonment or a Rs50,000 fine, or both.</p>
<p>In May this year, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Private Schools Regulatory Authority, through a <a class="link--external" href="https://psra.gkp.pk/notification/15/detail" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a>, strictly prohibited corporal punishment in all private schools across the province after receiving complaints.</p>
<p>Violations, however, continue to prevail. According to a recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924804/crisis-of-protection-child-rights-violations-surge-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa">report</a> by the KP Child Protection and Welfare Commission (KPCPWC), children across the province were subjected to 33 different forms of abuses, including 14 incidents of corporal punishment.</p>
<p>In April, a seminary teacher in Kasur was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905109">arrested</a> for allegedly beating a student with a hot iron for not memorising his lesson at Bangla Kambovan.</p></p>
