                <h2>UK lifts ban on Pakistani airlines, removes country from Air Safety List</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The United Kingdom on Wednesday removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, thereby allowing Pakistani airlines to now apply to operate flights to the UK, according to a statement from the British High Commission in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Debt-ridden Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1566153">banned</a> from flying to the European Union, UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi‚Äôs Model Colony, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1558944">killing nearly 100 people</a>. The ban on operating to Europe was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875575">lifted</a> in November last year.</p>
<p>Today‚Äôs development comes after a team from the UK Department for Transport <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923408/uk-audit-approves-pakistan-aviation-security">concluded</a> an aviation security ins¬≠pection at Islamabad Inter¬≠nat¬≠ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan‚Äôs security arrangements ‚Äúsatisfactory and in line with international standards‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFollowing air safety improvements, the UK‚Äôs Air Safety Committee has lifted UK restrictions on Pakistani carriers,‚Äù said a statement from the British High Commission.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndividual airline carriers will still need to apply for permits to operate to the UK through the UK Civil Aviation Authority.‚Äù</p>
<p>British High Commissioner Jane Marriott was quoted as saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful to aviation experts in the UK and Pakistan for their collaborative work to drive improvements to meet international safety standards.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile it will take time for flights to resume, once the logistics are in place, I look forward to using a Pakistani carrier when visiting family and friends.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a post on X, Marriott called the approval ‚Äúan important step, and a testament‚Äù to PIA‚Äôs air safety improvements.</p>

<p>Decisions on de-listing states and air carriers from the UK Air Safety List are made through an independent aviation safety process, according to the statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is overseen by the UK‚Äôs Air Safety Committee, who have <em>[sic]</em> been closely engaging with the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority over several years.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe committee has judged that necessary safety improvements have been made since its original decision in 2021. Therefore, based on this independent and technically-driven process, it has decided to remove Pakistan and its air carriers from the list.‚Äù</p>
<p>PIA said it was all set to resume flights to the UK now.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt became possible after adherence to the most stringent flight safety standards, reviewed by the UK‚Äôs Air Safety Committee.‚Äù</p>

<p>Reacting to today‚Äôs development, Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif commended the government led by his party for ‚Äúcrossing another milestone‚Äù. ‚ÄúThree years of continuous hard work have borne fruit,‚Äù he <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KhawajaMAsif/status/1945389259881406550" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X.</p>

<p>In a press conference in Islamabad, Asif said the aviation ministry would now apply for licences to restore routes to Britain.</p>
<p>The minister said Airblue had also been removed from the safety list: ‚ÄúAccording to my knowledge, they have allowed not just PIA but also Airblue.‚Äù</p>
<p>Asif affirmed that the government was making efforts to resume New York flights.</p>
<p>The move adds to another positive development, with the UK government yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924354">launching</a> e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù border and immigration system.</p>
<p>A day prior to that, the two countries formally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924280/pakistan-uk-ink-accord-to-boost-economic-cooperation">signed</a> the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.</p>

<p>Asif hailed the removal of Pakistani airlines from UK‚Äôs Air Safety list, but stressed the need for fixing responsibility for the loss caused to the national carrier.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, Asif strongly criticised the PTI government for the fiasco and reputational damage caused to PIA, which he called a ‚Äúcrime against state‚Äù.</p>
<p>He pinned the responsibility on former prime minister Imran Khan and then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan, who had stated in the National Assembly after the 2020 crash that almost <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1567845">40 per cent</a> of the country‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1565352">pilots</a> had fake licenses.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The minister called on the government to pursue whoever was responsible for this loss, as the nation‚Äôs image was affected and a negative impression was created about the national airline and its pilots.</p>
<p>‚ÄúImran Khan and Ghulam Sarwar turned PIA into a graveyard,‚Äù Asif quipped.</p>
<p>In reply to a question, he said Sarwar‚Äôs speech was ‚Äúenough to fix responsibility‚Äù as the national flag carrier‚Äôs image was affected. He suggested that the prime minister could order an enquiry to conduct an investigation and hold individuals accountable.</p>
<p>The minister noted that PIA suffered a drop in business, planes became <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1771459">dysfunctional</a> and the pilots‚Äô reputation was tarnished. He highlighted that overseas Pakistanis used the airline due to cheaper and direct routes.</p>
<p>Asif hailed the civil aviation regulator and ministry officials for the ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù day, saying that the decision has restored confidence in the national airline and aviation industry. He also thanked the UK and EU regulators for their guidance to plug loopholes and meet international standards.</p>
<p>The next step was privatising PIA, Asif noted, adding that the restoration of routes will assist the process as the government will receive a higher bid price. He asserted that the private sector would be able to revive the airline with higher investment, induct a new fleet and open new routes.</p></p>

                <h2>Iran‚Äôs envoy to Pakistan ‚Äòwidely respected‚Äô, says FO after FBI adds him to most wanted list</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan on Wednesday stressed that Iran‚Äôs envoy in Islamabad, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923795/iranian-envoy-appreciates-pakistans-support-during-israeli-aggression">Reza Amiri Moghadam</a>, was ‚Äúwidely respected‚Äù after the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) added him to its Most Wanted list for his alleged role in the 2007 disappearance and suspected abduction of retired FBI agent Robert A. ‚ÄúBob‚Äù Levinson.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs far as Pakistan is concerned, the ambassador of Iran is widely respected for his role in the promotion of Pakistan-Iran relations,‚Äù FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em> in response to a request for comment on the matter.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe is entitled to all the privileges, immunities and respect due to an ambassador, that too from a friendly neighbouring country,‚Äù Shafqat highlighted.</p>
<p>Levinson arrived on Iran‚Äôs Kish Island on March 8, 2007 and went missing the following day.</p>
<p>Notably, a 2013 <em>Associated Press</em> (<em>AP</em>) investigation <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/announcements/why-ap-is-publishing-story-about-missing-american-tied-to-cia/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">revealed</a> that Levinson had been sent on a spy mission by Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analysts who had no authority to run such an operation. Levinson‚Äôs family had received a $2.5 million annuity from the CIA to stop a lawsuit revealing details of his work, <em>AP</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-robert-levinson-donald-trump-united-arab-emirates-cia-3fa9ae9e6abf448c86b4170f4df811ef#:~:text=Levinson%E2%80%99s%20family%20had%20received%20a%20%242.5%20million%20annuity%20from%20the%20CIA%20in%20order%20to%20stop%20a%20lawsuit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>In 2020, after the US concluded that Levinson had passed away ‚Äúsome time ago‚Äù, Iran <a class="link--external" href="https://www.rferl.org/a/tehran-denies-knowledge-of-missing-former-fbi-agent-as-u-s-presses-for-answers/30510682.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> he had left the country ‚Äúlong ago‚Äù and that Tehran had no knowledge of his whereabouts, rejecting claims by his family of him dying in Iranian custody.</p>

<p>On Tuesday evening, the FBI‚Äôs Washington Field Office released ‚Äò<a class="link--external" href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/washingtondc/news/fbi-washington-field-office-releases-seeking-information-posters-for-senior-iranian-intelligence-officers-involved-in-the-abduction-of-robert-a-levinson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seeking information</a>‚Äô posters of three senior Iranian intelligence officials, whom it blamed for playing key roles in Levinson‚Äôs disappearance and in efforts to conceal Tehran‚Äôs alleged involvement.</p>
<p>While Pakistani authorities have not been linked to the incident, the case now has a direct connection to Islamabad through Moghadam‚Äôs diplomatic posting.</p>
<p>The FBI <a class="link--external" href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/washingtondc/news/fbi-washington-field-office-releases-seeking-information-posters-for-senior-iranian-intelligence-officers-involved-in-the-abduction-of-robert-a-levinson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> said <a class="link--external" href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorinfo/reza-amiri-moghadam" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moghadam</a> had previously headed the operations unit of Iran‚Äôs Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), adding that he reportedly oversaw agents operating across Europe during that time.</p>
<p>However, according to the Iranian foreign ministry‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://pakistan.mfa.gov.ir/en/generalcategoryservices/8569/ambassador" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>, Moghadam has worked as deputy of Iran‚Äôs Supreme National Security Council in foreign and international policy affairs.</p>
<p>Per the FBI, Moghadam was ‚Äúsuspected of supervising the operation that led to Levinson‚Äôs reported abduction and later taking part in the cover-up‚Äù.</p>
<p>The FBI‚Äôs move comes amid heightened tensions between the US and Iran.</p>
<p>The US, which had been in talks with Tehran since April 12 for a nuclear deal, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">joined Israel‚Äôs war</a> with Iran on June 22, striking three Iranian nuclear sites. The strikes came after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901324/trump-says-there-will-be-bombing-if-iran-does-not-make-nuclear-deal">warnings</a> by US President Donald Trump to attack Iran if it did not come to an agreement with Washington over its nuclear programme.</p>
<p>A US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917691">intelligence assessment</a> had even found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was ‚Äúyears away from producing one‚Äù before the US military launched the strikes.</p>
<p>The US periodically sanctions Iran and companies involved in trading Iranian oil, with the latest such <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-issues-additional-iran-related-sanctions-treasury-website-shows-2025-07-09/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">move</a> made on July 9.</p>

<p>Iran also strongly condemned the US government <a class="link--external" href="https://en.mfa.gov.ir/portal/newsview/760999" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in February</a> for imposing fresh sanctions on various individuals and entities for being involved in the sale of Iranian crude oil, terming the move as completely unjustified and contrary to international rules and regulations.</p>

<p>In a statement, the FBI said the posters were released as part of an ongoing investigation into Iranian officials ‚Äúwho allegedly played roles in Bob‚Äôs abduction and Iran‚Äôs attempt to obfuscate its responsibility‚Äù.</p>
<p>The two other officials named were <a class="link--external" href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorinfo/taghi-daneshvar" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Taghi Daneshvar</a> and <a class="link--external" href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorinfo/gholamhossein-mohammadnia" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gholamhossein Mohammadnia</a>.</p>
<p>The FBI claimed that Daneshvar, who it said had the alias Sayyed Taghi Ghaemi, was a senior MOIS counter-espionage officer who reportedly supervised <a class="link--external" href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorinfo/mohammad-baseri" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mohammad Baseri</a> ‚Äî another person in the bureau‚Äôs most wanted list ‚Äî around the time Levinson disappeared.</p>
<p>Mohammadnia, the FBI said, was a senior MOIS deputy who served as Iran‚Äôs ambassador to Albania in 2016. He was expelled from Albania in December 2018 for allegedly ‚Äúdamaging its national security‚Äù ‚Äî a move <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/albania-expels-iranian-diplomats-on-national-security-grounds-idUSKCN1OI2R6/#:~:text=backed%20Albania%27s%20decision" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hailed</a> by the US. The FBI claims he led efforts to shift blame for Levinson‚Äôs disappearance to a terrorist group in Balochistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese three intelligence officers were among those who allegedly facilitated Bob‚Äôs 2007 abduction and the subsequent cover-up by the Iranian government,‚Äù said Steven Jensen, assistant director in charge of the FBI‚Äôs Washington Field Office.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBob likely later perished in captivity far away from his family, friends and colleagues.‚Äù</p>
<p>In March 2025, the US Department of the Treasury <a class="link--external" href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0059" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imposed sanctions</a> on Moghadam and several others in connection with the case.</p>
<p>Images and a video showing Levinson in captivity surfaced in 2010 and 2011, but there has been no confirmed sighting of him since.</p>
<p>The FBI maintains that its investigation remains active as it seeks to identify further Iranian officials allegedly involved in the abduction.</p></p>
