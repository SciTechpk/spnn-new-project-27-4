                <h2>FO rejects ‚Äòunfounded allegations‚Äô of involvement of Pakistani nationals in Russia-Ukraine conflict</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Tuesday rejected claims of Pakistani nationals being involved in the Ukraine conflict after a statement by Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
<p>Zelensky <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928754/pakistani-mercenaries-fighting-for-russia-claims-zelensky">claimed</a> on Monday that his troops in northeastern Ukraine were fighting foreign ‚Äúmercenaries‚Äù from various countries, including China, Pakistan and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/pakistan-rejects-baseless-and-unfounded-allegations-of-the-involvement-of-pakistani-nationals-in-the-conflict-in-ukraine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by the FO today said Pakistan ‚Äúcategorically rejects the baseless and unfounded allegations of the involvement of Pakistani nationals in the conflict in Ukraine‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo date, Pakistan has not been formally approached by the Ukrainian authorities, nor has any verifiable evidence been presented to substantiate such claims.‚Äù</p>
<p>The statement added that the government would take up this matter with the Ukrainian authorities, ‚Äúand seek clarification in this regard‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan reaffirms its commitment to the peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict through dialogue and diplomacy, in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter,‚Äù the statement said.</p>

<p>In a post on X on Monday, Zelensky said: ‚ÄúWe spoke with commanders about the frontline situation, the defence of Vovchansk, and the dynamics of the battles.</p>

<p>The Russia-Ukraine war began when President Vladimir Putin ordered the latter‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676939">invasion</a> on Feb 24, 2022.</p>
<p>The government has on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1737577">separate</a> occasions <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1776567">rebuffed</a> allegations that the country was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1789255/pakistan-signed-contracts-with-two-us-companies-for-arms-sales-to-ukraine-claims-bbc-report">providing arms</a> to Ukraine.</p>

                <h2>Occupation of Kashmir ‚Äòdefining conflict‚Äô in the region: PM</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Calling India‚Äôs illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir the defining conflict of the South Asia region, and a driver of its rogue behavior, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has termed the continued denial of basic human rights, dignity and identity to Kashmiris living under illegal occupation ‚Äúa recipe for regional instability‚Äù.</p>
<p>The prime minister, in a message on Youm-i-Istehsal ‚Äî the anniversary of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1498227/india-revokes-occupied-kashmirs-special-autonomy-through-rushed-presidential-decree">revocation</a> of India-held Kashmir‚Äôs special status by the Narendra Modi government on Aug 5, 2019 ‚Äî  reiterated ‚Äústrongest condemnation‚Äù of India‚Äôs illegal and unilateral actions to alter the demographic structure and political landscape of the India-occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>He also flayed India‚Äôs efforts to silence genuine Kashmiri leaders as part of the wider hegemonic and extremist agenda that informs its illegal occupation of the disputed region.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe imprisonment of Kashmiri leaders and activists, including Shabbir Ahmed Shah, Muhammad Yasin Malik and Masarrat Alam Bhatt will never dim the resolve of our Kashmiri sisters and brothers,‚Äù he added.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Ahead of Youm-i-Istehsal, ISPR says India‚Äôs repressive actions, belligerent posture and incendiary rhetoric only exacerbate regional instability</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also reasserted Pakistan‚Äôs unflinching stance, moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>On the occasion, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir along with the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, Chief of Naval Staff, Chief of Air Staff, and the Pakistan armed forces reaffirmed their unwavering solidarity with the resilient and courageous people of India-held Kashmir.</p>
<p>According to an Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) statement, the armed forces of Pakistan fully support the legitimate and ongoing struggle of the Kashmiri people for their inalienable right to self-determination, as enshrined in international law and UN Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p>Separately, Kashmir Affairs Minister Amir Muqam, while addressing a presser, slammed Indian efforts to convert the Kashmiri Muslims into a disempowered community in their own land. Ever since Aug 5, 2019, he said, the Indian government had taken scores of measures aimed at changing the demographic structure and political disposition of occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>Some of the newly-introduced or modified laws pertain to issuance of domicile certificates to non-Kashmiris and ownership of land and property by the outsiders, he said.</p>
<p>The delimitation of electoral constituencies has also been changed and the lieutenant governor has been given more powers in administrative matters, he added.</p>
