                <h2>5 including assistant commissioner martyred in Bajaur blast</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least five people, including an assistant commissioner, were killed and 11 others injured on Wednesday in a bomb explosion in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Bajaur district.</p>
<p>Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafique told <em>Dawn.com</em> that five people were killed in the explosion targeting a government vehicle on Nawagai Road in Siddiqabad railway attack area of Khar tehsil.</p>
<p>Two policeman and a civilian are among the dead, Rafique said.</p>

<p>Health Adviser Ihtisham Ali strongly condemned the blast and expressed grief over the demise of the assistant commissioner and others in the incident.</p>
<p>He contacted the district health officer and the medical superintendent of the DHQ hospital in Bajaur and enquired after the well-being of the people injured in the attack.</p>

                <h2>PSX scales 130,000 barrier as record-breaking rally continues</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Bulls continued their reign over the trading floor at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday as shares scaled the 130,000-point barrier to reach a new high.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index opened on a positive note, rising by 1,430.07 points (1.12 per cent) to reach 129,629.49 points at 10:07am, from the previous close of 128,199.42 points.</p>
<p>Shares then rose further to reach 130,344.03 points at 3:30pm, gaining 2,144.61 points (1.67pc) from yesterday.</p>
<p>The PSX extended its record-breaking <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920553">rally</a> for the fourth consecutive session today, which analysts have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921539">attributed</a> to easing inflation and signs of macroeconomic stability.</p>
<p>The annual inflation rate has dropped sharply to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921571/inflation-slumps-to-9-year-low-at-449pc">nine-year low</a> of 4.49 per cent during the fiscal year 2024-25 from 23.41pc in the previous year. Pakistan is currently experiencing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902445">disinflation</a>, which reflects a slowdown in the rate of inflation, as opposed to deflation, which indicates a general decline in overall price levels.</p>
<p>Optimism around fiscal reforms announced in the federal budget also contributed to the rally.</p>
<p>‚ÄúContinuation of monetary easing due to falling inflation driven by fiscal discipline, strong external account and focus on structural reforms would keep equities in the limelight,‚Äù Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, said yesterday.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921539#:~:text=Prime%20Minister%20Shehbaz%20Sharif%20expressed%20gratitude">statement</a>, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif asserted the KSE-100‚Äôs record close reflected growing confidence in the government‚Äôs economic policies. He described the index‚Äôs performance as a testament to the strengthening and stabilising sentiment surrounding the national economy.</p>
