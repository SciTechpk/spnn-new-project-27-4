            <p><p>Six Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel were injured in a “terrorist attack” at a checkpoint in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Wednesday, a police spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Bannu Police spokesperson Aamir Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “Terrorists attacked a Frontier Constabulary checkpoint situated in the border area of Takhti Khel Wazir in Bannu.</p>
<p>“As a result of the attack, six personnel of the FC were injured, but the immediate response of the constabulary forced the terrorists to flee.”</p>
<p>Over a week ago, President Asif Ali Zardari promulgated an ordinance empowering the federal government to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924024/fc-upgraded-to-status-of-federal-force">transform the FC</a>, a border security force, into the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924291/revamped-fc-not-police-force-but-security-unit">Federal Constabulary</a>.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Aamir added that the injured constables have been taken to the Combined Military Hospital in Bannu for treatment.</p>
<p>“Police teams have been sent to the area and have begun a search operation to track down the terrorists,” he said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">surge</a> in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces.</p>
<p>Attacks increased after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">broke</a> a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a>, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773/3-terrorists-killed-during-joint-operation-in-kps-bannu-police">this month</a>.</p>
<p>A day ago, a police official identified as Constable Hayatullah was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925895/police-constable-martyred-in-bannu-terrorist-attack">martyred</a> when terrorists attacked him in the district while he was returning home from duty.</p>
<p>On July 21, over a dozen terrorists <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1925535">attacked</a> a police station in the Bakkakhel town of Bannu. However, the cops responded effectively and thwarted their nefarious plan to take over the building. The police also thwarted a sabotage bid by defusing explosives in the Ghoriwala town of Bannu. An official said the explosives were seized during an intelligence-based operation in the area.</p>
<p>On July 19, two police officials, including an officer, were injured when terrorists carried out a quadcopter <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925051">attack</a> on Bannu’s Miryan police station.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926053/swat-student-death-case-authorities-seal-madressah-police-return-students-to-families' target='_blank'><strong>Swat student death case: authorities seal madressah, police return students to families</strong></a>
            <p><p>Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Omar on Wednesday said that authorities sealed the madressah in Swat, where a student was killed earlier this week, and returned its other students to their parents.</p>
<p>A young student was allegedly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925841/young-student-allegedly-beaten-to-death-by-seminary-teachers-in-swat-police">beaten to death</a> by his madressah teachers on Monday evening in Swat’s Chaliyar village, according to the police. He was rushed to the nearest hospital by students and teachers, but doctors declared him dead upon arrival.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in his office accompanied by Superintendent of Police (Investigation) Badshah Hazrat Khan, DPO Omar said: “When we came to know of this incident, we also thought to check with the other students studying in the madressah if there was any other case such as this or not. We sent our team to this madressah and when statements were taken from the children, it was found out that some others had been subjected to violence as well.”</p>
<p>Omar said police detained all madressah staff upon receiving this information with nine more taken into custody and a case registered on the police’s complaint under the Child Protection Act.</p>
<p>“Around 160 to 170 students were retrieved and we returned them safely to their families after contacting them and the madressah was sealed.”</p>
<p>He said investigations into any possible sexual assault under way with samples taken, adding that the relevant section would be added to the first information report (FIR) on any confirmation.</p>
<p>DPO Omar said there were four suspects nominated in the FIR and two were subsequently arrested, with teams formed to trace and arrest the others.</p>
<p>“They will not be able to escape the law. We will arrest them as soon as possible,” he said of the absconding suspects.</p>
<p>He said the police took action immediately upon being alerted of the incident and the case was registered.</p>
<p>Omar said the items used to allegedly beat and bind the student were also recovered.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, KP Chief Khateeb Maulana Tayyab Qureshi strongly condemned the incident in a statement, saying that “the death of a student at the hands of a madressah teacher is the height of brutality.</p>
<p>“The elements involved in the incident should be severely punished. Such so-called reciters and teachers are a stain on the name of madressahs. The public should avoid admitting children to unregistered madressahs.”</p>
<p>He said the condemnation of the incident by the Wifaq-ul-Madaris was a positive development</p>
<p>“We will never allow brutality under the guise of religious education. Islam does not allow us to beat children. A teacher is not allowed to beat, regardless of their field. The government should take retribution from the teacher involved in the beating.”</p>
<p>Talking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, he reiterated his strong condemnation, saying no amount would be enough.</p>
<p>He demanded exemplary punishments for the culprits who were becoming a basis to defame religion and madressahs so that no one ever dared to commit such crimes, especially in regards to students and children.</p>
<p>Qureshi said students were the responsibility of madressahs to be taken care of, adding that such violence and treatment harmed students’ psyche and health. He also hailed the sealing of the madressah and the return of the students to their families.</p>
<p>He also appealed to ulema to ensure that violence and physical beatings did not occur at seminaries, saying that the law and religion did not allow it.</p>
<p>Under the KP Child Protection and Welfare Act 2010 and its 2018 regulations, corporal punishment is a punishable offence, violation of which can result in up to six months of imprisonment or a Rs50,000 fine, or both.</p>
<p>In May this year, the KP Private Schools Regulatory Authority, through a <a class="link--external" href="https://psra.gkp.pk/notification/15/detail" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a>, strictly prohibited corporal punishment in all private schools across the province after receiving complaints.</p>
<p>Violations, however, continue to prevail. According to a recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924804/crisis-of-protection-child-rights-violations-surge-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa">report</a> by the KP Child Protection and Welfare Commission, children across the province were subjected to 33 different forms of abuses, including 14 incidents of corporal punishment.</p>
<p>In April, a seminary teacher in Kasur was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905109">arrested</a> for allegedly beating a student with a hot iron for not memorising his lesson at Bangla Kambovan.</p></p>

            <p><p>A 19-year-old girl in Karachi’s Lyari succumbed to her injuries after an alleged marital rape at the hands of her husband, police said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the newlywed girl was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922609/newlywed-19-year-old-girl-in-coma-after-alleged-brutal-sexual-violence-by-husband">admitted</a> to Civil Hospital Karachi in critical condition after allegedly enduring “brutal sexual violence” from her husband, who was arrested by the police.</p>
<p>The victim was in a coma and her physical examination findings were “consistent with sexual violence”, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed had stated.</p>
<p>“Ms Shanti, 19, rape victim, passed away at the trauma centre of the Civil Hospital Karachi at 10:45am today,” Syed said today.</p>
<p>She was admitted to the trauma centre in a “critical condition”, having undergone a surgical procedure at another hospital, she added.</p>
<p>“Her initial findings were positive for sexual violence,” she said.</p>
<p>The police surgeon told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the hospital informed police and family to conduct a post-mortem examination of the body and was waiting for their response.</p>
<p>Baghdadi police Station House Officer Majid Alvi also confirmed her death to <em>Dawn.com.</em></p>
<p>He said that the girl got married on June 15. “Two days later, the husband subjected her to sodomy and installed a metal pipe into her body, leading to deterioration of her health condition.”</p>
<p>The brother of the victim had registered a first information report (FIR) at the Baghdadi Police Station on July 5 under Sections 324 (attempt to commit murder) and 376-B (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p>
<p>“On the third day of her marriage, my sister was subjected to brutal sexual violence allegedly by her husband. She remained admitted at a private hospital in the city and was later taken to Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre of Civil Hospital Karachi in a critical condition the other day,” the FIR read.</p>
<p>In the FIR, the complainant said his 19-year-old sister married the suspect on June 15. Her health condition deteriorated on June 30, compelling the family to bring her back home. She informed the parents that on July 17, her husband subjected her to an “unnatural sexual act”.</p>
<p>He said that the husband also sexually assaulted her with a foreign object. Subsequently, the husband subjected her to sexual violence, leading to bleeding. As per the FIR, the suspect threatened his wife with “dire consequences” if she disclosed anything to anyone.</p>

<p>Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1761373">death penalty</a> or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899694/two-arrested-for-kidnap-gang-rape-of-minor-girl-in-bahawalnagar">prevail</a> in the country.</p>
<p>In May, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913717/two-sisters-raped-tortured-in-north-karachi-home">two sisters</a> were subjected to a sexual assault in their home in North Karachi, police and doctors had said.</p>
<p>In April, in a rare verdict, an additional district and sessions judge in Gujranwala handed down <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903932">10-year rigorous imprisonment</a> to a man for subjecting his wife to an unnatural sexual offence.</p></p>
