            <p><p>A magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck off Russia’s Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula on Wednesday, the strongest in the region since 1952, damaging buildings and generating a tsunami of up to 4 metres (13ft) that prompted warnings and evacuations in Hawaii, Japan and across the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Several people were injured in the remote Russian region, while much of Japan’s eastern seaboard — devastated by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in 2011 — was ordered to evacuate as Tsunami waves hit the Pacific coast of the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hawaii recorded tsunami waves measuring up to 5ft, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre. However, no waves of consequence have hit Hawaii yet.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>What we know so far:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>8.8-magnitude quake hit Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula at 8:24am local time (4am PKT)</li>
<li>Several people injured, no casualties reported</li>
<li>Tsunami warnings issued in Japan, Mexico, Hawaii, Ecuador, China, Chile, Costa Rica</li>
<li>Tsunami waves up to 4ft hit Japan, Hawaii; 10-13ft recorded in parts of Kamchatka</li>
<li>Russian mayor says ‘everyone’ on tsunami-hit islands evacuated</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>The magnitude 8.8 quake struck at 8:24 am (4am PKT) off Petropavlovsk on Russia’s remote Kamchatka peninsula and was one of the 10 biggest recorded, according to the US Geological Survey.</p>
<p>The USGS said the earthquake was shallow at a depth of 19.3 km, and was centred 119 km east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a city of 165,000.</p>
<p>The epicentre of the earthquake is roughly the same as the massive 9.0 temblor in 1952, which resulted in a destructive, Pacific-wide tsunami, according to the USGS.</p>

<p>“Today’s earthquake was serious and the strongest in decades of tremors,” Kamchatka Governor Vladimir Solodov said in a video posted on the Telegram messaging app.</p>
<p>A tsunami with a height of 3-4 metres (10-13 ft) was recorded in parts of Kamchatka, said Sergei Lebedev, regional minister for emergency situations, urging people to move away from the shoreline.</p>
<p>Russian authorities said a tsunami hit and flooded the port town of Severo-Kurilsk, while local media said one wave of between three and four metres high was recorded in the Elizovsky district of Kamchatka.</p>
<p>“The strongest earthquake since 1952 has just occurred in the Kamchatka seismic zone … Given the scale of the event, strong aftershocks with a magnitude of up to 7.5 should be expected,” Kamchatka’s geophysical service said on Telegram.</p>
<p>Thirty additional tremors were recorded following the main earthquake off the Kamchatka Peninsula, a regional branch of the Geophysical Service of the Russian Academy of Sciences said.</p>
<p>In December 2004, a 9.1 magnitude earthquake struck off the Indonesian island of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that killed around 220,000 people in 11 nations.</p>
<p>Several people sought medical assistance following the quake, Oleg Melnikov, regional health minister, told Russia’s <em>TASS</em> state news agency.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, there are some people injured during the seismic event. Some were hurt while running outside, and one patient jumped out of a window. A woman was also injured inside the new airport terminal,” Melnikov said.</p>
<p>“All patients are currently in satisfactory condition, and no serious injuries have been reported so far.”</p>
<p>While a kindergarten was also damaged, most buildings withstood the quake, and no fatalities had been reported, the ministry added.</p>
<p>Russia’s Ministry for Emergency Services said on Telegram that the port in the Sakhalin town of Severo-Kurilsk and a fish processing plant there were partially flooded by a tsunami. The population has been evacuated.</p>
<p>“Everyone was evacuated. There was enough time, a whole hour. So everyone was evacuated, all the people are in the tsunami safety zone,” Mayor Kuril Islands district Alexander Ovsyannikov said at a crisis meeting with officials.</p>
<p>Authorities in Russia’s far eastern Sakhalin region declared a state of emergency in the northern Kuril Islands.</p>
<p>“A state of emergency has been declared in the North Kuril District, where an earthquake and tsunami occurred today,” the Sakhalin government said in a statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team recorded that the Klyuchevskoy volcano —  a highly active volcano in the region — ejected ash to a height of up to 3 km (1.8 miles) above sea level as a result of the quake, <em>Al Jazeera</em> reported.</p>
<p>“The volcano is continuing to erupt explosively at the summit. Ash emissions at altitudes up to 8km [4.9 miles] above sea level may occur at any time,” said KVERT in a statement.</p>
<p>KVERT has assigned an orange colour code for aviation hazards to the volcano, which indicates an increased likelihood of eruption.</p>

<p>The whole Pacific coast of Japan has reported tsunami waves, <em>Al Jazeera</em> reported, citing Japanese broadcaster <em>NHK World.</em></p>
<p>Waves as high as 60cm (1.9ft) were recorded along some parts of the coast, including Kuji Port and Hamanaka town, according to <em>NHK.</em></p>
<p>The size of the waves has grown steadily from 20cm (0.6ft) earlier this morning, and authorities say they could reach as high as 3 metres (9.8ft).</p>
<p>Tsunami warning advisories will be in place across Japan for at least the next 24 hours, the Japanese broadcaster said.</p>
<p>According to Japan’s Meteorological Agency, the country’s Pacific coast has already been hit by four to five rounds of tsunami waves, and has warned that there are no signs of the Tsunami waves receding, <em>Al Jazeera</em> reported.</p>
<p>There is also a chance of powerful and unexpected surges, it added.</p>
<p>Earlier, Japan’s weather agency issued a warning, saying it expected tsunami waves of up to 3 metres (10ft) to reach large coastal areas starting around 1am GMT (6am PKT).</p>
<p>Tsunami alarms sounded in coastal towns across Japan’s Pacific coast with authorities urging people to seek higher ground.</p>
<p>Footage on public broadcaster <em>NHK</em> showed scores of people in the northern island of Hokkaido on the roof of a building, sheltering under tents from the beating sun, as fishing boats left harbours to avoid potential damage from the incoming waves.</p>
<p>“We came here hoping to swim, but once we heard a tsunami warning had been issued, we didn’t go in at all, not even close to the water,” local Tomoyo Fujita, 35, told <em>AFP</em> as she left the area with her young daughter.</p>
<p>Television footage showed several whales washed up on a beach.</p>
<p>Workers evacuated the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant, where a meltdown following the 2011 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/612370">tsunami</a> caused a radioactive disaster, operator TEPCO said.</p>
<p>There were no injuries or damage reported so far, and no irregularities at any nuclear plants, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said.</p>

<p>The Pacific Tsunami warning centre recorded waves measuring up to 5.7ft in Maui, Hawaii, while another high wave of 4.9ft was recorded in Hailo, the <em>BBC</em> reported.</p>
<p>Tsunami waves were “now impacting Hawaii”, the Centre said in an update.</p>
<p>The US National Weather Service confirmed the reports, according to <em>Al Jazeera.</em></p>
<p>Hawaii Governor Josh Green said so far, no waves of consequence have hit the islands, but all flights in and out of Maui were cancelled, <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>
<p>In light of the tsunami situation, the Department of Transportation in Hawaii announced, in a social media post, the cancellation of all flights to and from Kahului Airport, the main airport in Maui, <em>Al Jazeera</em> reported.</p>

<p>Earlier, the US Tsunami Warning Centres issued a Tsunami Warning — its highest level alert — for the entire US state of Hawaii, with the first waves expected at 7:17pm local time (10:17pm PKT).</p>
<p>“People are also advised to stay away from the beach and not to go to the coast,” the seismology centre said in a warning.</p>
<p>Hawaii ordered evacuations from some coastal areas. “Take Action! Destructive tsunami waves expected,” the Honolulu Department of Emergency Management said on X.</p>

<p>The Hawaii warning urged residents of low-lying areas to either move to higher ground or to the fourth floor of a building.</p>
<p>“Due to a massive earthquake that occurred in the Pacific Ocean, a Tsunami Warning is in effect for those living in Hawaii,” US President Donald Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114939759564715119" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a social media post.</p>
<p>“A Tsunami Watch is in effect for Alaska and the Pacific Coast of the United States. Japan is also in the way. Please visit tsunami.gov/ for the latest information. Stay strong and stay safe!”</p>
<p>Tsunami alerts were pushed to mobile phones in California, according to local <em>AFP</em> reporters.</p>
<p>The US Tsunami Warning System also warned of “hazardous tsunami waves” within the next three hours across the Pacific. According to the seismology centre, waves reaching more than 3 metres were possible along some coasts of Russia and Ecuador, while waves of 1-3 metres were possible in Japan, Hawaii, Costa Rica, French Polynesia, Guam, Chile and the Solomon Islands, it said. Smaller waves were possible along coastlines across much of the Pacific, including the US West Coast.</p>
<p>Waves of up to one metre were possible elsewhere, including Australia, Colombia, Mexico, New Zealand, Tonga and Taiwan.</p>
<p>It described the potential conditions as “hazardous.”</p>
<p>In Mexico, the Navy warned that strong currents are expected at port entrances from Baja California in the northwest to Chiapas in the south of Mexico, <em>AFP</em> reported.</p>
<p>The country has mobilised authorities at all levels of government to keep its population away from Pacific beaches.</p>
<p>Following suit, Peru also issued a statement warning of a possible tsunami.</p>
<p>“After an analysis and evaluation by the National Tsunami Warning Centre, it has been determined that this event generates a tsunami warning for the Peruvian coast,” the Directorate of Hydrography and Navigation of the Peruvian Navy said in a statement, adding that the situation “will be kept under constant surveillance.”</p>
<p>Ecuador officials ordered ‘preventive evacuations’ from Galapagos beaches and the suspension of all maritime activities, <em>AFP</em> reported.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, China’s tsunami warning centre said that waves of between 30 centimetres and one metre were expected to hit parts of the eastern seaboard.</p>
<p>“Based on the latest warning and analysis results, the Tsunami Advisory Centre of the Ministry of National Resources has determined that the earthquake has triggered a tsunami, which is expected to cause damage to certain coastal areas of China,” the advisory centre said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#ring-of-fire" id="ring-of-fire" title="Permalink"></a>‘Ring of fire’</h2>
<p>Kamchatka and Russia’s Far East sit on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a geologically active region that is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</p>
<p>The Russian Academy of Sciences said it was the strongest quake to hit the region since 1952.</p>
<p>“However, due to certain characteristics of the epicentre, the shaking intensity was not as high … as one might expect from such a magnitude,” said Danila Chebrov, director of the Kamchatka Branch of the Geophysical Service, on Telegram.</p>
<p>“Aftershocks are currently ongoing … Their intensity will remain fairly high. However, stronger tremors are not expected in the near future. The situation is under control.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshall Asim Munir on Wednesday reaffirmed the military’s resolve to eradicate the menace of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1925209">terrorism</a> from the country,  underscoring the nation’s preparedness to respond decisively to any external or internal threats, a statement from the military’s media wing said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has lately <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906333/3-traffic-cops-injured-in-terrorist-attack-in-kps-lakki-marwat-district-police">seen</a> a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">surge</a> in terrorism across the country, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has also worsened, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419/jaffar-express-hijacking-state-media-reports-190-rescued-2nd-day-of-operation-underway-in-balochistan">attacks</a>. The outlawed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856227">Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA</a>), in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army chief was speaking to a group of stakeholders at the 16th National Workshop in Balochistan.</p>
<p>“[The] COAS resolutely reaffirmed Pakistan Army’s unwavering commitment to uproot the menace of terrorism and [the] inevitability of socio-economic uplift of Balochistan for national cohesion and integration,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Field Marshall Munir also shed light on Pakistan’s recent military escalation with India, condemning New Delhi’s “blatant sponsorship of terror proxies, characterising them as a failed attempt to target the deep-rooted patriotism of the people of Balochistan.”</p>
<p>The two countries entered a brief but intense military escalation after India, without evidence, blamed Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a>. On May 6–7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">missile exchange</a>. A US-brokered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> ended the war.</p>
<p>He elucidated that India, having suffered defeat in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> — the period of conflict from April 22 to May 10 — had “now escalated its proxy war to advance her nefarious designs.”</p>
<p>He said New Delhi was using <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> — terms the state uses to refer to the TTP and terrorist groups in Balochistan, respectively — as “pawns of Indian hybrid war against Pakistan.”</p>
<p>“The COAS said that these proxies will face a similar fate and humiliation as faced in Marka-i-Haq,” the statement said.</p>
<p>During his talk, the army chief also emphasised that terrorists knew no bounds of religion, sect, or ethnicity, necessitating a unified national response, stressing the imperative of collective resolve in confronting this menace.</p>
<p>He highlighted the “pivotal role of development initiatives in Balochistan, advocating for enhanced inter-agency cooperation and a cohesive national approach to propel provincial progress and national advancement.”</p>
<p>While reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace, the COAS underscored the nation’s preparedness to respond decisively to any external or internal threats, protecting national prestige and ensuring the well-being of its citizens, the statement concluded.</p></p>

            <p><p>Britain on Wednesday rejected criticism that it was rewarding fighter group Hamas by setting out <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927583/oic-welcomes-britains-intention-to-recognise-palestinian-state">plans</a> to recognise a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927434/">Palestinian state</a> unless Israel took steps to improve the situation in Gaza and bring about peace.</p>
<p>The sight of emaciated <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926309/1-in-5-children-malnourished-in-gaza-city-unrwa">Gaza children</a> has shocked the world in recent days, and on Tuesday, a hunger monitor warned that a worst-case scenario of famine was unfolding there and immediate action was needed to avoid widespread death.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s ultimatum, setting a September deadline for Israel, prompted an immediate rebuke from his counterpart in Jerusalem, who said it rewarded Hamas and punished the victims of their 2023 cross-border attack.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump said he did not think Hamas “should be rewarded” with recognition of Palestinian independence.</p>
<p>Asked about that criticism, British Transport Minister Heidi Alexander — designated by the government to respond to questions in a series of media interviews on Wednesday — said it was not the right way to characterise Britain’s plan.</p>
<p>“This is not a reward for Hamas. Hamas is a vile terrorist organisation that has committed appalling atrocities. This is about the Palestinian people. It’s about those children that we see in Gaza who are starving to death,” she told <em>LBC</em> radio.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to ratchet up pressure on the Israeli government to lift the restrictions to get aid back into Gaza.”</p>
<p>France <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926526">announced</a> last week it would recognise Palestinian statehood in September.</p>
<p>Successive British governments have said they would recognise a Palestinian state when it was most effective to do so.</p>
<p>In a televised address on Tuesday, Starmer said that moment had now come, highlighting the suffering in Gaza and saying the prospect of a two-state solution — a Palestinian state co-existing in peace alongside Israel — was under threat.</p>
<p>Starmer said Britain would make the move at the UN General Assembly in September unless Israel took substantive steps to allow <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926644/quarter-of-gaza-hasnt-eaten-for-days-wfp">more aid</a> to enter Gaza, made clear there will be no annexation of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927288/israeli-settlers-attack-west-bank-christian-village">West Bank</a> and committed to a long-term peace process that delivered a two-state solution.</p></p>
