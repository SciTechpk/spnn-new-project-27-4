                <h2>Pakistan reacted responsibly despite India‚Äôs provocative actions: PM Shehbaz</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said that Pakistan‚Äôs reaction had been responsible and measured so far despite India‚Äôs provocative actions following severe tensions between the two countries in wake of the Pahalgam incident.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> and India‚Äôs premier granting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">‚Äúoperational freedom‚Äù</a> to the military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an Indian incursion within 24‚Äì36 hours, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension">diplomatic channels</a> have been engaged to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>A statement from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office (PMO) said PM Shehbaz held a meeting with Ambassador of the Republic of Turkiye Dr Irfan Neziroglu at the PM House.</p>
<p>The premier reiterated that Pakistan had always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.</p>
<p>The prime minister emphasised that India had failed to share any evidence and was falsely trying to link Pakistan to the Pahalgam incident, the statement said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia has yet to respond to Pakistan‚Äôs offer to have a credible, transparent and neutral international investigation to ascertain the facts behind the Pahalgam incident,‚Äù he said, adding that Pakistan would cooperate fully with such an investigation and would welcome if Turkiye joined it.</p>

<p>The prime minister also highlighted that Pakistan had rendered great sacrifices in its counter-terrorism efforts, including 90,000 casualties and over $152 billion in economic losses over the years.</p>
<p>He further said that India‚Äôs actions would distract Pakistan from its counter-terrorism efforts.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz expressed his gratitude to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for his strong statement that supported Pakistan during the prevailing situation in South Asia as well as his call for peace in the region.</p>
<p>The prime minister noted that Turkiye‚Äôs support to Pakistan was reflective of the ‚Äúhistoric, deep-rooted and time-tested brotherly relations‚Äù between the two countries and their peoples.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed the government‚Äôs focus on economic recovery and growth for which it required peace and security in its neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The Turkish ambassador informed the prime minister that Turkiye appreciated Pakistan‚Äôs position and expressed its solidarity with Pakistan while calling for de-escalation and urging restraint in the current crisis to maintain peace and security in South Asia.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#fm-dars-diplomatic-engagements" id="fm-dars-diplomatic-engagements" title="Permalink"></a>FM Dar‚Äôs diplomatic engagements</h2>
<p>Separately, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to regional peace and stability while resolutely protecting its sovereignty and national interests in a telephone conversation with Greek counterpart George Gerapetritis.</p>
<p>FM Dar briefed him on current regional developments, categorically rejecting India‚Äôs ‚Äúbaseless allegations, disinformation campaign and illegal unilateral measures‚Äù that threatened regional peace and security.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe strongly condemned India‚Äôs unilateral decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance ‚Äî a blatant violation of its international obligations,‚Äù the Foreign Office (FO) said in a press release.</p>

<p>Dar reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs call for an independent and transparent investigation to establish the facts.</p>
<p>FM Gerapetritis emphasised the importance of restraint to prevent escalation and preserve peace and stability. He welcomed Pakistan‚Äôs proposal for a neutral and transparent inquiry.</p>
<p>Both leaders agreed to maintain close coordination on regional and global developments, particularly in multilateral forums, including their engagement as non-permanent members of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>FM Dar also held a telephone conversation with Swiss Federal Councillor and Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis.</p>
<p>He briefed FM Cassis on the evolving regional security situation, ‚Äúexpressing grave concern over India‚Äôs recent provocative actions, including baseless allegations, inflammatory propaganda, and its unilateral decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance ‚Äî an outright violation of international legal obligations‚Äù, the FO said in a press release.</p>
<p>Dar reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs call for an independent and transparent international investigation to establish the facts and underscored Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to exercising restraint in the interest of regional peace and security, while reserving the right to protect its sovereignty and national interests.</p>
<p>FM Cassis appreciated Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to peace and endorsed its proposal for an investigation.</p>
<p>He expressed Switzerland‚Äôs readiness to offer its good offices and explore appropriate mechanisms to facilitate an impartial investigation.</p>
<p>The two leaders agreed to remain in close contact on the evolving situation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Azad Jammu Kashmir Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq said on Friday that India was hatching conspiracies to create unrest in the territory.</p>
<p>In his address to the All Parties Kashmir Conference hosted in the state metropolis, he warned,  ‚ÄúIf India attacks Pakistan, we will respond with full force. India is actively plotting to destabilise AJK.‚Äù</p>
<p>He emphasised that Pakistan‚Äôs political leadership must demonstrate complete solidarity and stand firmly behind the armed forces against the Indian aggression.</p>
<p>Reaffirming his stance on the Kashmir issue, Haq said his narrative drew strength from the people of Pakistan, the armed forces and the country‚Äôs military leadership.</p>
<p>He said that a single action by the Indian government had brought the situation back to what it was before August 5, 2019.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Liberation Cell is ready to support if the political leadership from the All Parties Kashmir Conference forum wants to participate in the protest demonstration,‚Äù the AJK premier said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs far as the Kashmir policy is concerned, we are open for debate and ready to remove any shortcomings,‚Äù he remarked.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have to think about how to take forward the issue of Kashmir, for which we have lost three generations,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Highlighting the significance of national unity, Haq said, ‚ÄúThe enemy attacks you only when he thinks that the nation is divided.‚Äù</p></p>

<p>‚ÄúIt could be an important part of President [Donald] Trump‚Äôs legacy to attend to this situation ‚Äî not with a Band-Aid solution, but by addressing the core issue: the Kashmir dispute,‚Äù Pakistan‚Äôs Ambassador to the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855847">Rizwan Saeed Sheikh</a> said in an interview with <em>Fox News Digital</em> published earlier today.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is one nuclear flashpoint,‚Äù the envoy said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Sheikh‚Äôs statement echoes his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907760/pm-shehbaz-thanks-china-for-endorsing-pakistans-proposal-of-neutral-probe-into-pahalgam-attack#:~:text=Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20envoy%20calls%20on%20Trump%20to%20ease%20tensions%20with%20India%3A%20report">recent call to Trump</a> to step in and help ease soaring tensions with India. He had highlighted that as a president ‚Äústanding for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration‚Äù, there was no ‚Äúhigher or flashier flashpoint‚Äù than the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>Trump, in his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=Overseas%20wars%20and%20plans%20for%20peace">inaugural speech</a> as the US president, had said: ‚ÄúMy proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.‚Äù</p>
<p>A ceasefire ‚Äî which has since been broken ‚Äî was secured between <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886289">Israel and Hamas</a> following Trump‚Äôs election, and he has also been engaging with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906950">Ukraine and Russia</a> to halt their war.</p>
<p>During his interview with <em>Fox News</em>, Sheikh also called on nations around the globe to help with a lasting settlement to the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>He said: ‚ÄúPreviously, when the situation has been at this level or the tensions have escalated, the international community has attended to the situation, but taken their eyes [and] attention away, even before the situation could fully defuse.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis time, perhaps it would be [‚Ä¶] timely in terms of the situation elsewhere on the globe, with similar instances, [‚Ä¶] to perhaps not afford a Band-Aid solution, but to address the broader problem.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúAny misadventure or miscalculation can lead to a nuclear interface,‚Äù the ambassador was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúThat is certainly not desirable in such a densely populated region.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe want a peaceful neighbourhood,‚Äù Sheikh emphasised, adding that Pakistan did not want any instability in the region.</p>
<p>However, he stressed, Pakistan‚Äôs desire for peace ‚Äúshould not in any way be misconstrued as a sign of weakness‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe want peace with dignity.‚Äù</p>
<p>Sheikh described India‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">response</a> to the Pahalgam attack as dangerously premature and inflammatory, according to the report.</p>
<p>The envoy reiterated Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif‚Äôs offer to hold a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral and transparent</a>‚Äù probe into the Pahalgam attack. He pointed out that both the investigation offer and Pakistan‚Äôs request for evidence linking it to the attack had gone ‚Äúunanswered‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWithin minutes of the attack, India began levelling accusations against Pakistan,‚Äù he said, noting that a post-investigation report was filed just 10 minutes after the incident occurred, despite the remote and rugged terrain near the scene.</p>
<p>The ambassador warned that the region was once again being held ‚Äúhostage to the war of hysteria‚Äù by India‚Äôs government and media, who immediately ‚Äúbegan beating war drums‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>On the allegations implied by India, which has not yet named Pakistan or any entity directly, Sheikh said the suspects were reportedly Indian nationals whose homes have already been raided.</p>
<p>He questioned why India is looking outside its borders rather than addressing ‚Äúadministrative inadequacies‚Äù in occupied Kashmir. He slammed India‚Äôs broader policies in held Kashmir, including the alleged settlement of non-residents into the region.</p>
<p>Speaking about India‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">unilateral suspension</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>, Ambassador Sheikh said: ‚ÄúThat is as grossly illegal as it can get. This is one treaty that has withstood wars between India and Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>Law Minister Azam Naz¬≠eer Tarar said yesterday that Pakistan‚Äôs final response to India‚Äôs letters on the IWT <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908128/multiple-ministries-to-craft-pakistans-response-on-iwt">would be crafted</a> in consultation with all relevant ministries, including foreign affairs, water resources and law.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik has also said Islamabad would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907454">approach international forums</a>, including the World Bank that brokered it, regarding the treaty‚Äôs suspension.</p></p>
