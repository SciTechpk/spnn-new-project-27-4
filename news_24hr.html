            <p><p>• After Tirah tribesmen, Bajaur peace Jirga tries to convince militants to quit the area<br />
• Elders assure army, FC of full support for anti-militancy efforts</p>
<p>BAJAUR / NORTH WAZIRISTAN: A complete curfew was imposed across <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922123/north-waziristan-people-oppose-anticipated-military-operation">North Waziristan</a> in view of the security situation, while a peace <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927600/jirgas-to-be-held-from-aug-2-to-address-woes-of-kp-residents-cm-gandapur">jirga</a> tried to prevail upon local militant leaders to leave <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927454/curfew-imposed-as-forces-launch-operation-sarbakaf-in-bajaur">Bajaur</a>.</p>
<p>The moves were part of efforts to restore peace to these merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which have witnessed a spike in militant activity of late, especially along the border with Afghanistan.</p>
<p>On Friday, a peace march was held in the Shewa tehsil of North Waziristan district against the deteriorating law and order situation in the area.</p>
<p>Tribal elders, representatives of all political parties, the Utmanzai Jirga, Youth of Kabul Khel, and activists of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) attended the gathering.</p>
<p>Addressing the participants, Utmanzai jirga spok­esman Mufti Baitullah and other speakers expressed concern over rising lawlessness across the district.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The speakers emphasised that people were living in constant fear, primarily due to the re-emergence of militant elements and poor government strategies, and called upon state institutions to ensure immediate and sustainable peace in the region.</p>
<p>Following the imposition of curfew in the area, the district administration has advised people to stay indoors and avoid travelling on roads.</p>
<p><strong>Jirga efforts</strong></p>
<p>In Bajaur, where ‘Opera­tion Sarbakaf’ was laun­c­hed earlier this week to clear the area of militants, a peace Jirga met local militant leaders to convince them to return to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>But sources said that the local leadership of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have sought another day’s time to consult with their leaders in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The meeting, held at a mosque in the Lar Kalan area of Lowi Mamund teh­sil, was attended by a 50-member delegation of the Bajaur Peace Commi­ttee and a group of TTP leaders.</p>
<p>Sources said that Jirga members, led by Sahibzada Haroon Rashid and consisting of local PTI MPAs Dr. Hamidur Rehman, <a class="link--external" href="https://%3Ciframe%20src=%22https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=476&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FAnwarZebkhan123%2Fvideos%2F1457019102100571%2F&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=267&amp;t=0%22%20width=%22267%22%20height=%22591%22%20style=%22border:none;overflow:hidden%22%20scrolling=%22no%22%20frameborder=%220%22%20allowfullscreen=%22true%22%20allow=%22autoplay;%20clipboard-write;%20encrypted-media;%20picture-in-picture;%20web-share%22%20allowFullScreen=%22true%22%3E%3C/iframe%3E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anwar Zeb Khan</a>, and former PTI MNA Gul Zafar Khan — among others — presented a two-point agenda to the TTP leaders.</p>
<p>The delegation asked the militants to either return to Afghanistan, or go into the mountains rather than staying among the local population, as their presence posed a serious threat to locals, Dr Khailur Rehman, a PTI senior leader who was also a part of the delegation, told <em>Dawn</em>.</p>
<p>He said that the TTP leaders had sought time until noon on Saturday to respond to the Jirga’s demands.</p>
<p>Sahibzada Haroon Rashid also confirmed this, telling reporters after the meeting that the next round of talks would be held today (Saturday).</p>
<p>The meeting with militant leaders followed a similar engagement in Khyber’s Tirah valley, where a Jirga from the Bar Qambarkhel tribe had called upon TTP commanders to quit the area.</p>
<p>That meeting had also had a similar outcome — with the militants seeking time to consult their leadership in Afghanistan.</p>
<p><strong>Bajaur scouts</strong></p>
<p>A separate Jirga held at the Bajaur Scouts headquarters in Khar, said the peace-loving people of Bajaur stand shoulder to shoulder with the Pakistan Army and Frontier Corps to restore peace in the region.</p>
<p>According to the statement issued by the Bajaur Scouts, local lawmakers and senior officials of the security forces, district administration, and police were also in attendance in the jirga, which aimed to finalise a result-oriented strategy to establish durable peace and stability in the district.</p>
<p>Addressing the participants, Frontier Corps (North) Inspector General Major General Rao Imran Sirtaj said that anti-terrorism operations are aimed at establishing long-lasting peace and normalcy in the district, with the goal of enabling the people of the region to live in a peaceful environment conducive to progress and prosperity.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928142/pakistan-vows-to-help-defuse-tensions-between-us-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan vows to help defuse tensions between US & Iran</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Friday pledged to help defuse tensions between Iran and the United States, reaffirming its quiet role as a go-between ahead of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928047">upcoming visit</a> to Islamabad.</p>
<p>“Iran is our close friend and a brotherly neighboring country. We remain committed to making positive contribution to bring the tensions down and promote diplomatic solutions to problem. We are open to play that role, and we will continue to play that role,” Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said at the weekly media briefing.</p>
<p>His comments came just a day before Pezeshkian is due to arrive in Pakistan for a two-day state visit from Aug 2-3, his first to Islamabad as president. The trip comes amid a quiet but growing Pakistani role in facilitating indirect US - Iran engagement, according to diplomatic sources.</p>
<p>Islamabad’s acknowledgement of the role comes after US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Secretary of State <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926499/rubio-lauds-pakistans-role-in-global-and-regional-peace-in-1st-meeting-with-fm-dar">Marco Rubio appreciated</a> Pakistan’s “continued willingness to play a constructive role in mediating conversations with Iran” during his recent meeting with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar.</p>

<p>FO says BLA, TTP are ‘Indian proxies’ working on agenda of de-stabilising Pakistan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pezeshkian’s visit will include meetings with President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, as well as delegation-level talks. The Iranian leader will be accompanied by Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi and a high-level delegation of senior ministers and officials.</p>

<p>Mr Shafqat said the discussions would cover “the entire agenda of the bilateral relations” and would be held in a “spirit of cooperation, amity and friendship”.</p>
<p>While Pakistan lacks the diplomatic clout of regional heavyweights like China, officials say it has been quietly facilitating the exchange of messages between Washington and Tehran. This role is largely being carried out by the military and intelligence establishment, with limited involvement from Dar.</p>
<p>According to diplomatic sources, Pezeshkian’s trip may also be seen as recognition of Pakistan’s behind-the-scenes efforts to maintain dialogue amid fraught US-Iran ties, especially after the 12-day Iran-Israel war.</p>
<p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir had offered to play the role during his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093">meeting with President Trump</a> at the White House, days before US jets bombed Iranian nuclear sites.</p>

<p>Responding to a question about a recent <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1927960">UN Security Council report</a> mentioning the growing cooperation between terrorist groups, Baloch Liberation Army and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the spokesman said both BLA and TTP were Indian proxies, whose goal was to destabilise Pakistan.</p>
<p>“All of them do enjoy sanctuaries inside Afghanistan,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr Shafqat recalled that the issue had been under discussion with Afghanistan and lately “better receptivity” of Pakistani concerns was seen in Kabul.</p>

            <p><p>QUETTA: Pakistan has issued a new call for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915407/200000-afghans-left-pakistan-since-deportations-renewed">Afghans</a> living in the southwest to leave the country, triggering thousands to rush to the border, officials said.</p>
<p>“We have received directives from the home department to launch a fresh drive to repatriate all Afghans… in a respectful and orderly manner,” Meharullah, a senior government official in Quetta, the capital of Balo­chistan province, told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>On Friday, there were “around 4,000 to 5,000 people at the Chaman border” waiting to return, said Habib Bingalzai, a senior government official in Chaman.</p>
<p>Abdul Latif Hakimi, the head of Refugee Registration in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province across the border, said they were aware of an increase in returning Afghans on Friday.</p>
<p>![ .]8https://www.dawn.com/news/1913322/110000-refugees-in-pakistan-have-high-risk-profiles-unhcr)</p>
<p>Millions of Afghans have poured into Pakistan over the past several decades, fleeing successive wars, as well as hundreds of thousands who arrived after the return of the Tali­ban government in 2021.</p>
<p>A deportation drive first <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1785519/govt-initiates-nationwide-operation-to-deport-illegal-foreign-nationals">launched in 2023</a> was renewed in April when the government rescinded hun­dreds of thousands of residence permits for Afghans, warning them of arrests if they did not leave.</p>
<p>Analysts say the expulsions are designed to pressure the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan to control militancy in the border regions.</p>
<p>In total, more than a million Afghans have left Paki­stan since 2023, incl­uding more than 200,000 since April this year.</p>
<p>The campaign targeted the more than 800,000 Afghans with temporary residence permits, some of whom were born in Pakistan or have lived here for decades.</p>
<p>However, many Pakistanis have grown weary of hosting a large Afghan population as security and economic woes deepen, with the result that the deportation drive has widespread support.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s security forces are under enormous pressure along the border with Afgh­anistan, battling a growing insurgency in parts of Khy­ber Pakh­tunkhwa and Balochistan.</p>
<p>Last year, Pakistan recorded the highest number of deaths from attacks in a decade and the government frequently accuses Afghan nationals of taking part in attacks.</p>
<p>Iran has launched a similar large-scale deportation campaign of Afghans, which has seen more than 1.5 million sent back across the border.</p>
