<p>The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, which was further weakened by recent rains, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922231#:~:text=DIG%20South%20Syed%20Asad%20Raza%20told%20Dawn">said</a> Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza.</p>
<p>Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed confirmed to <em>Dawn.com</em> that the toll had risen to 15.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRescue operation is still underway in Baghdadi, Lyari where the building had collapsed on Friday,‚Äù DIG Raza told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>

<p>Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.</p>
<p>Karachi, home to more than 20 million, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.</p>
<p>The deceased included nine men, six women and a child, according to a statement by Rescue 1122. Their bodies had been taken to the Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK). Five others were injured, the rescue service said.</p>
<p>However, a list of casualties provided by Dr Syed stated that the deceased included six men, as many women, a girl and a boy.</p>
<p>Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, leading the Rescue 1122 efforts at the scene, told <em>AFP</em> the operation continued through the night ‚Äúwithout interruption‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt may take eight to 12 hours more to complete,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Up to 100 people had been living in the building, senior police officer Arif Aziz told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>The incident came days after a portion of a building <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921188/no-casualties-reported-as-22-rescued-from-partially-collapsed-building-in-karachis-kharadar">collapsed</a> in the city‚Äôs Kharadar area. However, no casualties or injuries were reported.</p>
<p>The Public Account Committee of the Sindh Assembly had directed the provincial government in December to take urgent steps to evacuate over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879565">570 buildings</a> declared ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù by authorities across Karachi.</p>

However, they said they received the information late due to the suspension of communication networks, he added.</p>

<p>Sindh Rescue 1122 Director General (DG) Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, in a statement, said yesterday there were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=Rescue%20DG%20lists%20%E2%80%98hinderances%E2%80%99%20in%20operations">hindrances</a> during the rescue operation due to the ‚Äúunruly crowd, various road blockades and mobile network [issues]‚Äù.</p>
<p>Heavy machinery faced difficulty in reaching the site amid the narrow alleys of Lyari, a low-income neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Police even had to baton-charge a crowd that had gathered around the site to make way for machinery, officials added.</p>
<p>The Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=SBCA%20says%20issued%20multiple%20prior%20notices%20to%20vacate%20building">said</a> it had declared the plot as dangerous through its Technical Committee for Dangerous Buildings after a thorough inspection conducted in October 2022.</p>

<p>The authority said it had issued three ejectment notices to the residents since then, as well as asked K-Electric, Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) to disconnect utility services.</p>
<p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah sought a report on the collapse and details of dilapidated buildings from the SBCA.</p>
<p>Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani said a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=Saeed%20Ghani%20stresses%20timely%20evacuation%20of%20unsafe%20buildings">high-level committee</a> has been formed that will submit a report on the incident by Monday.

                <h2>Microsoft closes office in Pakistan, lays off staff</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1658993">Microsoft</a> has decided to close its office in Pakistan and laid off five employees, <em>Dawn</em> has learnt.</p>
<p>Earlier, media reports suggested that the global tech giant had moved its operations out of the country.</p>
<p>These were based on a LinkedIn post by Jawad Rehman, the former head of Microsoft in Pakistan. Citing sources, he claimed the company ‚Äúis officially closing its operations in Pakistan‚Äù.</p>
<p>Microsoft had an on-ground presence in Pakistan until recently, albeit with a significantly reduced local workforce. Most of its operations were handled from foreign offices and by partners in Pakistan, people familiar with the matter told <em>Dawn</em>.</p>
<p>In response to <em>Dawn</em>‚Äôs query, a Microsoft spokesperson said, ‚ÄúWe will serve our customers through both our strong and extensive partner organisation, and other closely located Microsoft offices. We follow this model successfully in a number of other countries around the world.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Spokesperson says company to provide services through local partners, offices abroad</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision to move out of Pakistan was part of the company‚Äôs ongoing series of layoffs worldwide as it looks to pivot towards artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Microsoft announced it would lay off nearly four per cent of its around 228,000 employees, <em>Reuters</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/microsoft-lay-off-many-9000-employees-seattle-times-reports-2025-07-02/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rep¬≠orted</a>. In May, the company announ¬≠ced layoffs affecting around 6,000 workers.</p>
<p>The company said on Wednesday it planned to manage its operations with fewer managers and streamline its products, procedures and roles.</p>
<p><strong>Evolving business models</strong></p>
<p>In a statement on Wednesday, the IT and Telecommunications ministry said global tech companies are moving from on-premises software deployment to the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. Microsoft‚Äôs decision is also reflective of this shift.</p>
<p>According to technology expert Habibullah Khan, large software enterprises have two business models: on-premise and Saas.</p>
<p>Under the former model, the company installs and runs software on the customer‚Äôs servers or infrastructure, with hardware and data centres managed internally by customers. The company gets a one-time payment through the sale of licences.</p>
<p>On-premise software deployment is a capital-intensive model and results in high upfront costs with recurring needs for maintenance and upgradation.</p>
<p>In comparison, SaaS allows a company to serve a particular location without any on-ground presence as the software is hosted in the cloud. In the model, the company makes money through subscription costs.</p>
<p>With the evolution of technology, more companies have transitioned to SaaS models, as it reduces upfront costs, Mr Khan explained.</p>
<p><strong>Not an ‚Äòexit‚Äô</strong></p>
<p>The IT ministry also said Microsoft‚Äôs move couldn‚Äôt be construed as an exit from Pakistan, but rather a shift to a ‚Äúpartner-led, cloud-based delivery model‚Äù.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, several multinational companies in various sectors have either shut down their operations in Pakistan or sold them to local enterprises. Last month, ride-hailing service Careem announced it would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917884/careem-announces-end-of-ride-hailing-service-in-pakistan-from-next-month">end operations</a> in Pakistan from July 18.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>However, Mr Khan believes Microsoft‚Äôs move is different from other exits, as the company now earns almost all of its revenue through cloud-based subscriptions.</p>
<p>He added the company is on a global cost-cutting drive and its decision to close the office in Pakistan was reflective of the move towards SaaS-and-AI operating model, ‚Äúand is not in any way a reflection on Pakistan‚Äôs tech ecosystem or its economy‚Äù.</p>
