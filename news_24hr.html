            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922576/army-chief-dismisses-factually-incorrect-claims-of-external-input-in-operation-bunyanum-marsoos' target='_blank'><strong>Army chief dismisses ‘factually incorrect’ claims of external input in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</strong></a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir on Monday dismissed Indian claims of Pakistan receiving external support in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent tensions with India, terming them “irresponsible and factually incorrect”.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">US-brokered ceasefire</a> for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> reported that the deputy chief of India’s army alleged last week that China gave Islamabad “live inputs” on key Indian positions during the conflict. India fought two adversaries during the conflict, with Pakistan being the “front face” while China provided “all possible support”, Lieutenant General Rahul Singh had said at a defence industry event in New Delhi.</p>
<p>“When the DGMO (director general of military operations) level talks were going on, Pakistan … said that we know that your such and such important vector is primed and it is ready for action … he was getting live inputs from China,” he said. Singh did not elaborate on how India knew about the live inputs from China.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the Inter-Services Publications said that Field Marshal Munir addressed the matter today while speaking at the National Defence University (NDU) in Islamabad.</p>
<p>He said that India’s “inability” to achieve its military objectives during Operation Sindoor and the subsequent claims signified “its lack of operational readiness and strategic foresight”.</p>
<p>“Insinuations regarding external support in Pakistan’s successful Operation Bunyanum Marsoos are irresponsible and factually incorrect and reflect a chronic reluctance to acknowledge indigenous capability and institutional resilience developed over decades of strategic prudence.</p>
<p>“Naming other states as participants in the purely bilateral military conflagration is also a shoddy attempt at playing camp politics and desperately trying that India remains the beneficiary of larger geopolitical contestation as the so-called net security provider in a region which is getting increasingly weary of its hegemonic and extremist Hindutva ideology.”</p>
<p>It further stated that “in contrast to India’s strategic behaviour resting on parochial self-alignment”, Pakistan had forged “lasting partnerships based on principled diplomacy, anchored in mutual respect and peace, establishing itself to be a stabiliser in the region”.</p>
<p>In his remarks, the army chief reiterated the country’s “principled stance”, warning that any misadventure or attempts to undermine national sovereignty or territorial integrity would be met with a “swift and resolute response”.</p>
<p>“Any attempt to target our population centres, military bases, economic hubs and ports will instantly invoke a ‘deeply hurting and more than reciprocal response’. The onus of escalation will squarely lie on the strategically blind arrogant aggressor who fails to see the grave repercussions of such provocative actions against a sovereign nuclear state,” the statement quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>“Wars are not won through media rhetoric, imported fancy hardware, or political sloganeering, but through faith, professional competence, operational clarity, institutional strength and national resolve,” the army chief concluded.</p>
<p>He lauded the armed forces and urged the graduating officers to remain steadfast in the values of integrity, selfless service, and unwavering commitment to the nation, the statement added.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Monday announced that Sweden has resumed visa services in Islamabad and Pakistani nationals will be able to apply for a Schengen visa from today onwards</p>
<p>Sweden in April 2023 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1747335">indefinitely closed</a> its embassy in Islamabad, citing the security situation as the reason. As a result, the Migration Section was unable to handle requests, nor could any documents be sent to consulates, Gerry´s, or applicants’ addresses.  “We understand that this will cause inconvenience; however, the safety of our applicants and staff members are of highest priority,” a notice placed on the embassy’s website had read at the time.</p>
<p>The embassy reopened in April this year, according to its <a class="link--external" href="https://www.swedenabroad.se/en/embassies/pakistan-islamabad/current/news/reopening-info-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>According to the FO, the Swedish and Pakistani foreign ministries held bilateral consultations in Stockholm on July 2, where the decision to resume visa services was announced by the Swedish side.</p>
<p>“Effective July 7, 2025, Pakistani nationals can apply for a Schengen visa from within Pakistan for visits to Sweden of up to 90 days,” the FO said.</p>

<p>It welcomed the positive development, saying it “reflects the strengthening of bilateral relations between the two countries”.</p>

            <p><p>The Sindh government on Monday suspended Sindh Building and Control Authority (SBCA) Director General Ishaque Khuhro over the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050">building collapse</a> in Karachi that claimed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922486/death-toll-in-lyari-building-collapse-stands-at-27-as-rescue-operation-ends-on-3rd-day">27 lives</a>.</p>
<p>The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market collapsed on Friday morning, with the rescue operations concluding yesterday. The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, with the SBCA saying it had issued <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=SBCA%20says%20issued%20multiple%20prior%20notices%20to%20vacate%20building">multiple prior notices</a> to residents to vacate the structure since 2023.</p>
<p>A notification issued by Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, stated that the SBCA DG’s services were “placed under suspension with immediate effect for the reason of misconduct and inefficiency”.</p>
<p>It added that Khuhro’s headquarters during the suspension period would be at the Services, General Administration and Coordination Department. He would “draw his salaries and allowances during the suspension period as admissible under the rules”.</p>
<p>Shahmir Khan Bhutto, a Grade-20 officer serving as the secretary of the chief minister’s Inspection, Enquiries and Implementation Team Department, was notified as the new SBCA DG.</p>
<p>Speaking on the development, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said: “Today, the chief minister has also suspended the DG SCBA and has ordered the home minister to immediately register an FIR (first information report) on the incident and that strictest action be taken against all those involved.”</p>

<p>Memon was addressing a press conference in Karachi alongside Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar and Local Government (LG) Minister Saeed Ghani.</p>
<p>According to Ghani, other SBCA officials who were suspended included the director, deputy director and building inspectors assigned to Lyari. He also noted that the Sindh government has announced Rs1 million in compensation to the families of the 27 deceased people.</p>
<p>Major opposition parties — the PTI, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and Jamaat-i-Islami — have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922336/sindh-govt-sbca-earn-oppositions-ire-over-lyari-tragedy">condemned</a> the PPP’s Sindh government, the SBCA and other authorities, accusing them of “criminal negligence”.</p>
<p>They not only demanded compensation and alternative residences for the affected families, but also called for the registration of manslaughter cases against the officials responsible for the tragedy.</p>
<p>Noting the loss of 27 lives, Memon said: “The entire province, nation and all of us as the government representatives are saddened and equally share the grief of the bereaved families.”</p>
<p>“The chief minister has taken a very strict notice of this,” he asserted.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Memon said CM Murad’s notice of the incident was aimed at ensuring strict action “against those who did not fulfil their duties or even if they fulfilled, they were not able to implement them”.</p>
<p>He added that the fact-finding committee formed on the incident, which was given three days to present a report, would submit its report within two days due to the Ashura public holidays over the weekend.</p>
<p>Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi will now head the committee, according to Ghani.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#51-extremely-fragile-buildings" id="51-extremely-fragile-buildings" title="Permalink"></a>51 ‘extremely fragile’ buildings</h2>
<p>During the media briefing, Ghani also mentioned that there were 51 buildings in Karachi that were “extremely fragile and should be demolished”.</p>
<p>He said the city commissioner has been directed to provide the number of residents and units in those buildings, as well as the details of whether they own the property or have rented it, so that the process of demolishing them can be started.</p>
<p>“The Karachi commissioner has to also provide assessments of the 588 buildings which were declared dangerous within two weeks so that we can decide which of the buildings need to be destroyed and which can be fixed through major repair,” he added.</p>
<p>In a recent statement, the SBCA noted that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=According%20to%20SBCA%20records%2C%20588%20buildings%20have%20been%20declared%20dangerous%20throughout%20Karachi">588 buildings</a> have been declared dangerous throughout Karachi, with 107 such buildings in Lyari alone.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Ghani asserted that all SBCA officers appointed in Lyari since 2022 will be identified and included in the inquiry, adding: “If the committee finds involvement or criminal negligence of any officer, they will be included in the FIR and face legal action.”</p>
<p>“If any negligence even by the [SCBA] DG is found in the inquiry, then he will also be included in the FIR,” the LG minister said, noting that Khuhro was in the role in 2022, when the building’s survey was conducted.</p></p>
