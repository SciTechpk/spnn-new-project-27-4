<p>Speaking to <em>Geo News</em>, he said Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti had taken notice of the incident and sought a report from police and law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBased on initial info, terrorists were sitting in ambush, they stopped the bus and then attacked. We cannot confirm the number of terrorists, but it was carried out from both sides of the road,‚Äù Rind said.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the shooting in Kalat in a statement from his office, extending his condolences and assailing <em>Fitna-Al-Hindustan</em> ‚Äî a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">term</a> the government uses for terrorist organisations in Balo¬≠chistan ‚Äî for targeting civilians.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe targeting of innocent passengers by <em>Fitna-Al-Hindustan</em> terrorists is a very cowardly act,‚Äù he was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúThese terrorists are hatching a heinous conspiracy to sabotage peace by targeting soft targets. With the support of the nation, we will foil these conspiracies by Indian-sponsored terrorists.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe attack on the passenger coach in Qalat is a cowardly and despicable act of terrorism. The loss of precious lives is an irreparable tragedy. The terrorist organisations of <em>Fitna-Al-Hindustan</em> have previously carried out attacks based on identity, but now they are indiscriminately targeting civilians, which clearly shows that this war is against every ordinary Pakistani, and we will defeat it at all costs!‚Äù CM Bugti said in a post on X.</p>

<p>The incident comes a week after at <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923342/passengers-kidnapped-in-sardhaka-rescue-operation-underway-balochistan-govt">least nine passengers</a> travelling on two Punjab-bound coaches were abducted and killed by unidentified armed men in the Sur-Dakai area, situated on the border between Balochistan‚Äôs Zhob and Loralai districts.</p>
<p>The government had said that <em>Fitna-al-Hindu¬≠stan</em> had carried out attacks at three different places ‚Äî Kakat, Mastung and Sur-Dakai.</p>
<p>The Balochistan Liberation Front, a banned outfit, later claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group said it had killed the nine individuals after blocking the highway between Musakhail-Makhtar and Khajuri.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923476/bodies-of-slain-passengers-in-balochistan-bus-killing-sent-to-punjab-hometowns-official">sources</a>, two passenger coaches en route to Punjab were intercepted in the Sur-Dakai area near the N-70 highway, close to Dab ‚Äî a place along the Loralai-Zhob border. A group of armed men had blocked the road and stopped the two vehicles.</p>
<p>The armed assailants boarded the coaches, checked the identity cards of passengers and forced 10 persons off the vehicles at gunpoint. ‚ÄúThey dragged out 10 passengers ‚Äî seven from one coach and three from the other ‚Äî and took them away (to an unknown place),‚Äù a surviving passenger had told Levies. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what they did to them, but I heard gunfire as we were leaving.‚Äù</p>
<p>After abducting the nine passengers, the assailants allowed both coaches to leave the area. According to sources, the attackers had checked the national identity cards of all passengers and specifically targeted individuals with Punjab addresses. They also opened fire on the coaches during the abduction to prevent any escape.</p>
<p>In May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna-al-Hindu¬≠stan</em>.</p>
<p>In March, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900559/several-killed-vehicles-torched-in-balochistan">five people</a> were killed by armed men who blocked the highway in the Kalmat area of Gwadar district, while three long-body trailers carrying urea from Gwadar port were set on fire in the Tajaban area.</p>
<p>In February, seven Punjab-bound passengers were offloaded from a bus and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892974/">shot dead</a> in Barkhan district. The incident came days after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892214">12 were killed</a> in a blast targeting a bus carrying coal miners in Harnai.</p>
<p>Balochistan has witnessed a spate of attacks targeting those hailing from Punjab. In two separate incidents in April 2024, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1827193">nine people</a> were killed after being forced off a bus near Noshki, while <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1830243">two labourers</a> from Punjab were shot in Kech.</p>
<p>In May last year, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832433">seven barbers</a> from Punjab were shot dead near Gwadar, while August saw <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854830">23 travellers</a> offloaded from trucks and buses and shot in the Musakhail district.</p>
<p>The Musakhail incident was part of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855006">flare-up of violence</a>, where dozens of militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army ‚Äî a separatist outfit ‚Äî <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854776/gun-grenade-attacks-in-balochistan">launched numerous attacks</a> across Balochistan, targeting security personnel as well as civilians.</p>

<p>Later, a roadside bomb exploded in Quetta‚Äôs Hazar Ganji area, leaving three women injured. Shalkot police Station House Officer (SHO) Khair Muhammad Samalani told <em>Dawn.com</em> that a bomb planted in a motorcycle was remotely detonated near Murree Camp.</p>
<p>‚ÄúImmediately after the explosion, police and security agencies surrounded the area and the process of collecting evidence began,‚Äù the SHO said, adding that no group claimed responsibility.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe injured women were immediately transported to Civil Hospital Quetta for medical treatment,‚Äù he stated, adding that their condition was said to be ‚Äúout of danger‚Äù.</p>
<p>SHO Samalani added that police and bomb disposal personnel launched search operations at the scene to avert any other potential threats.</p>

                <h2>Israel strikes key Syrian institutions in Damascus attack as Druze clashes continue</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>An Israeli airstrike hit next to the presidential palace in Syria‚Äôs capital Damascus on Wednesday, according to a <em>Reuters</em> witness, after the Syrian defence ministry and military headquarters were also attacked.</p>
<p>Earlier, Israeli strikes hit near the Syrian army and defence ministry headquarters in Damascus, the state-run <em>Alekhbariya</em> channel reported on Telegram, after Israel‚Äôs military said it stepped up attacks on the authorities with the declared aim of protecting the Druze minority from harm by government forces.</p>
<p><em>AFP</em> correspondents heard a loud explosion echoing throughout much of the capital, shortly after a first air strike had targeted the same building in the city centre.</p>
<p>It marked the third day in a row that Israel has struck Syria where government security forces have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924259">clashed</a> with local Druze fighters in the southern city of Sweida.</p>
<p>Security sources from within the defence ministry told <em>Reuters</em> that at least two drone strikes had hit the building and that officers were taking cover in the basement. State-owned <em>Alekhbariya TV</em> said the Israeli strike wounded two civilians.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said it had ‚Äústruck the entrance gate of the Syrian regime‚Äôs military headquarters complex‚Äù in Damascus and that it continued ‚Äúto monitor developments and the actions being taken against Druze civilians in southern Syria‚Äù.</p>
<p>Massive airstrikes damaged the defence ministry in Damascus, live footage on <em>Al Jazeera TV</em> showed.</p>

<p>Syria‚Äôs state media and witnesses said Israeli strikes throughout Wednesday also struck the predominantly Druze city of Sweida, where a fourth day of fighting swiftly collapsed a ceasefire announced the previous evening.</p>
<p>Syrian government troops were dispatched to the Sweida region on Monday to quell fighting between Druze fighters and Bedouin armed men, but ended up clashing with the Druze militias themselves.</p>
<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor with sources inside Syria, said 21 Druze civilians had been killed ‚Äúin summary executions by government forces‚Äù and allied groups.</p>
<p>Local news outlet <em>Sweida24</em> said the city of Sweida and nearby villages were coming under heavy artillery and mortar fire early on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Syria‚Äôs defence ministry, in a statement carried by state news agency <em>SANA</em>, blamed outlaw groups in Sweida for breaching the truce.</p>
<p>The defence ministry called on residents of the city to stay indoors. Some residents that <em>Reuters</em> was able to reach by phone said they were holed up at home in fear, with no electricity.</p>

<p>The European Union said it was ‚Äúalarmed‚Äù by the continued clashes in Syria‚Äôs Druze-majority Sweida, calling on all sides to implement a ceasefire and protect civilians.</p>
<p>A statement by the EU‚Äôs diplomatic arm also urged ‚Äúall external actors‚Äù to ‚Äúfully respect Syria‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity‚Äù after Israel carried out strikes in support of the Druze.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Druze not to try to enter Syria, after dozens crossed the armistice line in both directions following deadly fighting in the Druze heartland.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDo not cross the border,‚Äù Netanyahu said in a statement, warning of a ‚Äúvery serious‚Äù situation in Sweida.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be working on that issue as we speak. I just got off the phone with the relevant parties.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very concerned about it, and hopefully we‚Äôll have some updates later today. But we‚Äôre very concerned about it,‚Äù Rubio said, adding that the US wants the fighting to stop.</p>

<p>France called for an end to ‚Äúabuses targeting civilians‚Äù in Syria‚Äôs Sweida, after a war monitor accused government forces of summary executions and other abuses.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe abuses targeting civilians, which we strongly condemn, must stop,‚Äù the foreign ministry said, calling for an ‚Äúimmediate cessation of clashes‚Äù and urging all sides to respect a ceasefire.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFrance supports the efforts of the Syrian transitional authorities and the leaders of the Sweida region to restore dialogue and hopes for a lasting agreement to strengthen the unity, stability, and sovereignty of Syria, as well as the safety of all Syrians,‚Äù Paris said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Turkiye condemned Israel‚Äôs strikes on Syrian army headquarters. ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äôs attacks on Damascus, following its military interventions in the south of Syria, constitute an act of sabotage against Syria‚Äôs efforts to secure peace, stability, and security,‚Äù the foreign ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Germany criticised the airstrikes, urging Tel Aviv to refrain from actions that could destabilise the country, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/germany-criticizes-israeli-airstrikes-on-southern-syria-warns-of-destabilization/3632531" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anadolu</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>Speaking at a news conference in Berlin, Foreign Ministry spokesman Christian Wagner said that Germany is closely following the situation in Syria, including recent unrest in Suwayda province and Israeli airstrikes targeting Syrian forces. ‚ÄúWe are calling on all sides to refrain from taking steps that could destabilise Syria,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear that Syria must not become a plaything of foreign powers, that Syria‚Äôs sovereignty must be safeguarded,‚Äù he stressed.</p>
<p>The six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) also condemned the attacks on Damascus in the ‚Äústrongest terms‚Äù, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://aje.io/oy4iku?update=3841022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>In a statement, GCC Secretary-General Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi said the air campaign represented a ‚Äúflagrant violation‚Äù of Syria‚Äôs sovereignty, ‚Äúa breach of international laws and norms, and a serious threat to regional security and stability‚Äù.</p>
<p>Albudaiwi reiterated the GCC‚Äôs support for Syria‚Äôs territorial integrity, adding that the continuation of the repeated Israeli attacks had constituted an ‚Äúirresponsible escalation‚Äù and disregarded international efforts to achieve stability in Syria and the region.</p>
<p>He also called for international action to stop the ‚Äúserious violations, hold the perpetrators accountable, and work diligently to protect the Syrian people and preserve its sovereignty in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law‚Äù.‚Äã</p></p>
