                <h2>Trump says escalation ‚Äòa shame‚Äô, Guterres urges restraint</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump has said said the escalation between India and Pakistan was a ‚Äúshame‚Äù.</p>
<p>He was the first world leader to react to the tense situation after India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">carried out strikes</a> inside Pakistan which also retaliated and reportedly shot down Indian jets.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame. We just heard about it as we were walking in the doors of the Oval [Office],‚Äù he said inside the White House after overseeing the swearing-in ceremony for his special envoy, Steve Witkoff.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past. They‚Äôve been fighting for a long time,‚Äù the US president added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI hope it ends very quickly.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a statement, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called for restraint from both countries, Associated Press  reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Secretary-General is very concerned about the Indian military  operations across the Line of Control and international border. He calls  for maximum military restraint from both countries. The world cannot  afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan,‚Äù said  the statement.</p>
<p>The US State Department also said it is ‚Äúclosely monitoring developments,‚Äù <em>CNN</em> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are aware of the reports, however we have no assessment to offer at this time,‚Äù the spokesperson said. ‚ÄúThis remains an evolving situation,and we are closely monitoring developments.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>PSX bleeds as fears of Indian military action come true</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday witnessed yet another bloodbath this year ‚Äî tumbling by as many as 6,500 points in intraday trade ‚Äî as investors‚Äô fears of a military action by India against Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">came true last night</a>.</p>
<p>The Pakistani military brought down five Indian jets in retaliation for late-night strikes launched by its neighbouring country at six sites in Punjab and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index decreased by 6,560.82 points, or 5.78 per cent, to stand at 107,007.68 from the last close of 113,568.50 when the market opened at 9:30am.</p>
<p>Due to the massive dip, the market was immediately suspended briefly.</p>
<p>This marked the second-largest intra-day plunge (points-wise), ranking next to the nearly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902788#:~:text=The%20benchmark%20KSE%2D100%20index%20witnessed%20a%20record%20intra%2Dday%20plunge%20(points%2Dwise)%20of%208%2C687.68%20points">8,700-point loss</a> that followed the United States‚Äô <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810">tariff announcement</a> last month.</p>
<p>However, the market started recovering slightly, reaching 112,457.37 points at around 10:34am, before declining to 111,171.92 points at 12pm ‚Äî nearly 2,400 points below yesterday‚Äôs close.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe market opened under pressure today following Indian strikes on unarmed civilians in Pakistan,‚Äù said Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSome selling has been observed, though volumes remain low as investors assess the evolving situation,‚Äù Farooq said, adding that recovery was expected once tensions begin to de-escalate.</p>
<p>Shahbaz Ashraf, chief investment officer at Frim Ventures, also attributed the sell-off to ‚Äúheightened geopolitical tensions following reports of Indian strikes on multiple Pakistani locations‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe flare-up has rattled investor sentiment, with fears of further escalation weighing on the market,‚Äù he said. However, Shahbaz added, analysts remained ‚Äúcautiously optimistic, hoping the conflict will remain short-lived with likely mediation from global powers‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúImportantly, with macroeconomic indicators showing signs of recovery, market watchers believe this correction could be temporary. Many view the pullback as a potential buying opportunity, especially for long-term investors looking to accumulate quality stocks at lower valuations,‚Äù he noted, explaining the gains witnessed later.</p>
<p>Samiullah Tariq, head of research at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, said the impact of today‚Äôs selling pressure would be short-term and the market would ‚Äúrecover once this ends‚Äù.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, also observed that the PSX was ‚Äúfeeling the impact‚Äù of last night‚Äôs developments.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Echoing Shahbaz‚Äôs opinion, Awais said the plunge ‚Äúmay present a buying opportunity, as we do not expect the situation to escalate further‚Äù.</p>
<p>In the past few days, panicky investors have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908797/shares-at-psx-fail-to-sustain-early-gains-dip-by-500-points">continued</a> to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907535/shares-at-psx-slump-on-heightened-pakistan-india-tensions">reduce their holdings</a> as Pakistan had expressed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">heightened possibility</a> of a military action <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">by India</a> in the wake of the latter‚Äôs allegations regarding a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">killed 26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000.

<p>International rating agency Moody‚Äôs has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908608">warned</a> that sustained India-Pakistan tensions could negatively affect Pakistan‚Äôs growth.</p>
<p>It also said that escalating tensions could cause a setback to nascent macroeconomic stability and also disrupt Pakistan‚Äôs access to foreign funding flows.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Moody‚Äôs noted that macroeconomic conditions in India would remain stable. However, it did stress that higher defence spending could impact India‚Äôs ‚Äúfiscal strength and slow its fiscal consolidation‚Äù.</p></p>
