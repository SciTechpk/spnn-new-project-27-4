                <h2>DG ISPR rubbishes rumours of army chief becoming president</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has rubbished rumours of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir becoming the president.</p>
<p>His statement follows a similar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923280/interior-minister-rebuts-rumours-about-president-zardari-resigning-from-office">rebuttal</a> by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi early in July, when he clarified that no idea existed ‚Äúabout the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency‚Äù.</p>
<p>Gen Chaudhry, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general, told <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2025/08/03/pakistans-army-chief-is-cosying-up-to-donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Economist</a></em> that ‚Äútalk of his boss becoming president is ‚Äònonsense‚Äô‚Äù.</p>
<p><em>The Economist</em> noted that COAS Munir‚Äôs popularity has surged since the May <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">conflict with India</a>. It added that the ruling coalition‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921643">recently acquired</a> two-thirds majority in the parliament needed for a Constitutional Amendment ‚Äúignited rumours that the army chief could become president too‚Äù.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856908">government</a>, as well as the military, have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1876905">repeatedly</a> warned about ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=fake%20news%20and%20propaganda%20have%20become%20so%20common%20and%20there%20is%20no%20accountability%20for%20it.%E2%80%9D">fake news and propaganda</a>‚Äù proliferating on social media, with Gen Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=theories%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20added.-,%E2%80%98Digital%20terrorism%E2%80%99,-Questioned%20about%20criticism">digital terrorism</a>‚Äù under the laws.</p>
<p>On July 10, Naqvi asserted that President Asif Ali Zardari ‚Äúenjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces‚Äù.</p>
<p>He quoted the president as having ‚Äúclearly‚Äù stated: ‚ÄúI know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.‚Äù</p>
<p>Naqvi stressed that the ‚Äúsole focus‚Äù of COAS Munir was Pakistan‚Äôs strength and stability, and ‚Äúnothing else‚Äù.</p>
<p>In May, President Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formally decorated COAS Munir with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912748/president-pm-decorate-coas-munir-with-rank-of-field-marshal">rank of field marshal</a> for his ‚Äúsagacious leadership and exceptional strategy‚Äù during the recent conflict with India.</p>

<p>The rank of field marshal is the highest rank of armies built on the pattern of the British Army. It has only been awarded to one other ‚Äî Gen Ayub Khan ‚Äî by the presidential cabinet in 1959. It is a ceremonial five-star rank that usually signifies extraordinary leadership and wartime achievement.</p>
<p>In a subsequent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913061">dinner</a> hosted by the army chief, Field Marshal Munir lauded the political leadership for their ‚Äústrategic foresight‚Äù during <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> against India.</p>
<p>The next month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who belongs to PM Shehbaz‚Äôs PML-N, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918558/whats-behind-khawaja-asifs-praise-for-hybrid-system">hailed</a> the ‚Äúexisting hybrid model of governance‚Äù in the country. In a separate interview, he also termed it as a ‚Äúpractical necessity‚Äù for Pakistan, saying the system was ‚Äúdoing wonders‚Äù.</p></p>

                <h2>4 security personnel among 7 martyred in separate KP gun attacks</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Four security personnel were among seven martyred in two separate incidents of firing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Karak district and Peshawar city, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906333/3-traffic-cops-injured-in-terrorist-attack-in-kps-lakki-marwat-district-police">witnessed</a> an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Four security personnel including a driver were martyred when unknown assailants attacked a Federal Constabulary (FC) vehicle in the Garagri area of Karak, which the provincial chief minister and governor strongly condemned.</p>
<p>KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur directed relevant authorities to arrest those involved in the incident as he expressed condolences to the families of those martyred.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe salute the security personnel and their families who sacrificed their lives for the country and the nation,‚Äù said a statement today from the office of the press secretary to the KP CM.</p>
<p>Governor Faisal Kundi also condemned the incident, saying: ‚ÄúThe sacrifice of those martyred in the war against terrorism will not go in vain.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a separate incident on Tuesday night, three people died in a gun attack on Peshawar‚Äôs Warsak Road, including police inspector Ali Hussain.</p>
<p>Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Operations Peshawar Masood Ahmed told <em>Dawn.com</em> that Hussain was travelling in a car with two friends last night when four assailants on two motorbikes opened fire on the car, killing all three.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA pistol and submachine gun (SMG) was used in the attack,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are investigating the incident, and geofencing work is ongoing as well.‚Äù</p>
<p>Kundi condemned the ‚Äúunfortunate and inhumane‚Äù incident as he expressed his condolences to the families of the deceased.</p>
<p>Last month, a police official was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926664">martyred</a> in Karak while deployed at a police post in the Koh-i-Maidan area, which borders the Lakki Marwat and Mianwali districts. He embraced martyrdom while the assailants fled into the mountains.</p></p>
