                <h2>SIC seeks fresh bench for reserved seats case review</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910923">Sunni Ittehad Council</a> (SIC) has obj­e­cted to the composition of an 11-judge constitutional bench hearing the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">reserved seats matter</a>, with a request to refer the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847508/ppp-takes-cue-from-pml-n-files-review-petition-on-sc-reserved-seats-verdict">review petitions</a> against the last year ruling to the relevant committee constituted under Supreme Court (Pra­c­tice and Procedure) Act, 2023, for the formation of a new bench.</p>
<p>The objection was raised through an application filed by senior counsel Faisal Sid­diqi on behalf of the SIC after the party had requested the constitutional bench to decide the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911471">26th Amendment issue</a> before hearing the review petitions against the apex court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">decision of July 2024</a> in the reserved seats case.</p>
<p>Also through senior counsel Hamid Khan, the SIC had requested the constitutional bench to postpone the next hearing of the review petitions scheduled for May 19 (tomorrow).</p>
<p>Mr Siddiqi, who filed the application seeking reconstitution of bench, had also expressed an intention of challenging the composition of the 11-judge bench during the May 13 proceedings after which the court postponed the proceedings till May 19 to allow the party to file a formal application.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Five major objections to the composition of the 11-judge constitutional bench raised</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the fresh application, the party raised mainly five objections to the composition of the bench hearing the review petitions in the reserved seats case.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>It highlighted that the July 2024 judgement was issued by a full court comprising 13 judges. It pointed out that the constitutional bench while taking up the review petitions comprised 13 members but later the strength was reduced to 11 members. It argued that the any judgement can only be reviewed by a bench having same numerical strength that the original bench had. Thus, the existing 11-judge constitutional bench could not review the petitions, the SIC reiterated.</p>
<p>Besides, it argued, since the two dissenting judges of the original 13-judge bench namely Justice Ayesha A. Malik and Justice Aqil Ahmed Abbasi had not recused themselves from hearing the matter, they could not be excluded from the review bench.</p>
<p>It was a settled law, the SIC added, once a bench was constituted and seized of a matter on the judicial side, it could not be reconstituted in exercise of any administrative powers by the SC unless those members had recused themselves or there was some constitutional or legal bar requiring the reconstitution of the bench.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Otherwise, it would amount to stifling the independent view of an individual judge, the party argued. “Any effort to muffle disagreement or to silence dissent or to dampen an alternative viewpoint of a member on the bench, would shake the foundations of a free and impartial justice system, thereby eroding the public confidence on which the entire edifice of judicature stands,” the party emphasised.</p>
<p>According to the SIC, if the two dissenting members were excluded by the present CB, then under no provision or principle of constitutional and statutory law, could they be considered a part of the existing bench by fictional irrationality making it a 13-judge bench and then again by fictional irrationality counting their dismissal decision at the time of final adjudication. “There is no principle of the constitution or law that allows judges, by fiction, be considered to be sitting on a bench, hearing and adjudicating a particular case without these judges being actually present during such hearings,” it reasoned.</p>
<p>The SIC further argued that the July 2024 judgement was not delivered under pre-existing appellate jurisdiction as envisaged under Article 191A(3) and thus, the present challenges could not be considered review petitions to be transferred to the existing constitutional bench under Article 191A(5) of the Constitution. The review petitions must be heard and adjudicated by all the same serving judges who were part of the full court that delivered the July judgement, it emphasised.</p>
<p>Also, the SIC argued that since the constitutional bench under Article 191A(6) had not formulated any rules regulating its practice and procedure, the SC Rules, 1980, Order 26 dealing with review jurisdiction would apply to the CB under which the review applications have to be placed before the same bench that had delivered the original decision.</p>

                <h2>PM tasks Bilawal with presenting Pakistan’s case ‘for peace’ on global arena</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday tasked PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to present Pakistan’s “case for peace” on the global arena in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as tensions over last month’s Pahalgam attack continued to build up. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting drones</a> sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, for both sides to finally drop their guns as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> was reached. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911473/islamabad-delhi-gained-nothing-but-miseries-from-wars-pm-shehbaz">offered talks</a>.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The military flare-up saw China expressing solid diplomatic support to Pakistan, but there wasn’t a country other than Israel to stand with India without hyphenating it with Pakistan. Reports said a day ago that finding itself friendless in the conflict, India has started taking revenge on countries who helped Islamabad in the recent military flare-up.</p>
<p>Amid the current situation, Bilawal posted on X that he was contacted earlier today by the prime minister who requested that the former top diplomat “lead a delegation to present Pakistan’s case for peace on the international stage”.</p>
<p>Bilawal said he was honoured to accept the responsibility and remained committed to serving the country in “these challenging times”.</p>

<p>The PPP said the committee would also “inform the international community about Indian aggression and its false propaganda”.</p>

<p>The government has yet to share more details on who else would be included in the delegation and which specific countries would be engaged.</p>
<p>In a similar development, the Indian government announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, later this month to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.</p>
<p>“Members of parliament from different parties, prominent political personalities and distinguished diplomats will be part of each delegation,” said a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2129254" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> from India’s Press Information Bureau.</p>
<p>It said the following Indian lawmakers would lead the seven delegations: Indian National Congress’ Shashi Tharoor; Bharatiya Janata Party’s Shankar Prasad and Baijayant Panda; Dravid Munnetra Kazhagam’s Kanimozhi Karunanidhi; Janata Dal-United’s Sanjay Kumar Jha; Nationalist Congress Party’s Supriya Sule and Shiv Sena’s Shrikant Eknath Shinde.</p>
<p>Pakistan has said Britain and other countries, in addition to the United States, played a major role in de-escalating the fighting. Diplomats and analysts say the ceasefire <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911472">remains fragile</a>.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump said after the ceasefire was struck that talks should take place in a third-country venue but no dates or location for the talks have been announced.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#pm-shehbazs-peace-offer" id="pm-shehbazs-peace-offer" title="Permalink"></a>PM Shehbaz’s peace offer</h2>
<p>A day ago, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered India to sit for a comprehensive dialogue to settle contentious issues, including Kashmir and joi­ntly fight terrorism, remi­nding New Delhi that the neighbouring countries fought three wars in the past and gained nothing but miseries of the people.</p>
<p>“After settling disputes like Kashmir and water distribution, we can talk on trade and counter-terrorism as Pakistan is the worst affected country by terrorism which lost 90,000 lives and over $150 billion economic losses,” PM Shehbaz said while addressing a ceremony marking Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanks­giving Day) at Pakistan Monument.</p>
<p>Addressing the ceremony, PM Shehbaz had said, “We have won the war but we want peace. We have taught our enemy a lesson but we condemn aggression. We want this part of the world to be as prosperous and progressive as others through hard work, undying efforts and living like peaceful neighbours.”</p>
