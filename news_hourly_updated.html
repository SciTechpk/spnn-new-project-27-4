<p>An <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> on April 22 in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has directed Pakistan‚Äôs Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar, to take immediate steps to convene a meeting of the Security Council.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan will inform the UNSC about India‚Äôs aggressive actions, provocations, and provocative statements,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan will specifically highlight India‚Äôs illegal actions to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty,‚Äù it said, adding that the country would clarify how New Delhi‚Äôs aggressive actions are jeopardising ‚Äúpeace and security‚Äù in the region.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis important diplomatic move is part of Pakistan‚Äôs efforts to present accurate facts to the international community.‚Äù</p>

<p>A briefing on the prevailing national security situation, delivered by the federal information minister and the military‚Äôs spokesperson, began on Sunday night, <em>DawnNewsTV</em> reported.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>According to <em>Radio Pakistan</em>, the high-level background briefing would focus on national security in the context of Pakistan-India relations and the ‚Äúimplications of recent developments‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúParticipants will be briefed on the defensive preparedness of Pakistan‚Äôs armed forces, ongoing diplomatic efforts, and the official stance of the state on key issues,‚Äù the report read.</p>
<p><em>PTV News</em> highlighted that in the current circumstances, the briefing was a ‚Äúgreat example of national unity, solidarity and consensus‚Äù.</p>
<p>Without <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">investigation</a>, India had accu¬≠s¬≠ed ‚Äúcross-border linkages‚Äù of the att¬≠a¬≠¬≠¬≠c¬≠kers and escalated tensions with Pak¬≠¬≠i¬≠s¬≠tan through military and diplomatic actions.</p>

<p>Pakistan denied involvement and issued retaliatory steps.</p>

<p>The standoff, marked by exchange of fire on the LoC and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908171/pakistan-bans-all-ports-to-indian-flag-carriers-in-tit-for-tat-move">tit-for-tat actions</a>, has raised fears of broader conflict, prompting international <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907930/us-hopes-that-indias-response-to-pahalgam-attack-doesnt-lead-to-broader-regional-conflict-vance">calls for restraint</a> and renewed dialogue.</p>
<p>In the latest show of strength, Pakistan yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908176/pakistan-successfully-tests-launch-of-short-range-abdali-ballistic-missile">successfully tested</a> an improved version of its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908281/pakistan-tests-enhanced-version-of-abdali-missile">nuclear-capable</a> Abdali missile, significantly increasing its range to 450 kilometres.</p>
<p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir on Thursday asserted that any ‚Äúmisadventure‚Äù by India would be met with a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907785/any-military-misadventure-by-india-will-be-met-with-swift-resolute-notch-up-response-coas">swift, resolute and notch-up response</a>‚Äù. The next day, the army‚Äôs top brass also warned India of a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war">sure and decisive</a>‚Äù response should it attempt to impose war.</p>

<p>To prepare itself for any military action by India, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) has accelerated efforts to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908278/ajk-ramps-up-flour-supply-to-loc-areas-amid-tensions">replenish wheat flour stocks</a> in vulnerable areas along the LoC.</p>

<p>Separately, in a statement on X, PTI said its participation in the briefing was ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù as the party believed there was ‚Äúno serious attempt to create a national consensus‚Äù by the government and that there was no intention to include PTI founder Imran Khan either.</p>

<p>The party said it had always unequivocally condemned every kind of terrorism in all its forms.</p>
<p>It said that the government should have immediately convened a multi-party conference, so that a common course of action could have been drawn up by taking all parties into confidence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUnfortunately, the government wasted this opportunity,‚Äù the party said, adding that not only was the multi-party conference not convened, but instead, ‚Äúa one-sided briefing is being given by a government minister‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúConsidering all these factors, the PTI political committee has unanimously decided that the party will not participate in the briefing,‚Äù the statement read.</p>

<p>As several friendly countries and global powers have been attempting to reduce Pak-India tensions, Iran‚Äôs Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is expected to visit Pakistan tomorrow, according to Iranian media.</p>
<p>Araghchi was expected to visit Pakistan on Monday to ‚Äúdiscuss the recent developments at the regional and international levels‚Äù, Iran‚Äôs state news agency <em><a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85821878/Foreign-Minister-Araqchi-plans-to-visit-Pakistan-on-Monday" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IRNA</a></em> quoted Iran‚Äôs Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei as saying.</p>

<p>Iran on April 25 had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">offered to mediate</a> between Pakistan and India as tensions heightened in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.

<p>Meanwhile, continuing his diplomatic engagements, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar today spoke on phone with his Malaysian counterpart, Dato Seri Mohamad Hassan, to brief him on the current regional developments.</p>
<p>FM Hasan, expressing support for Pakistan‚Äôs position, called for restraint by all parties, the Foreign Office <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1918889826188656845" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>

<p>During their call, Dar ‚Äúcategorically rejected India‚Äôs provocative actions, including its baseless allegations [and] inflammatory propaganda‚Äù. He termed India‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">suspension</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a> ‚Äúan outright violation of treaty provisions and international legal obligations‚Äù.</p>
<p>While reaffirming Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to regional peace and security, Dar asserted that Pakistan reserved the ‚Äúright to safeguard its sovereignty and national interest‚Äù.</p>
<p>Both leaders agreed to maintain close contact on the evolving situation, the FO added.</p>
<p>Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif conveyed ‚Äúserious concerns‚Äù to Malaysian Prime Minister Dato‚Äô Seri Anwar Ibrahim over the prevailing tensions because of India‚Äôs provocative behaviour since the Pahalgam incident.</p>
<p>During a telephone conversation with his counterpart, PM Shehbaz categorically rejected any attempts to link Pakistan to the incident, without any evidence from the Indian government and reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs offer for an international, transparent, credible and neutral investigation to ascertain the facts.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan would welcome Malaysia‚Äôs participation in this investigation.</p>
<p>While stressing that Pakistan had always condemned terrorism in all forms and manifestations, PM Shehbaz highlighted Pakistan‚Äôs role as a frontline state in the war against terror and the tremendous sacrifices of the country.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs actions are distracting Pakistan from its counter-terrorism efforts on the western border,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>He emphasised that it was unthinkable for Pakistan to get involved in such a controversy, particularly at a time when the country had just emerged from a ‚Äúserious economic crisis and was back on the path to economic stability‚Äù.</p>
<p>The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) yesterday had called for restraint and the ‚Äúurgent resumption of dialogue‚Äù between Pakistan and India to de-escalate the situation.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/OIC_OCI/status/1918407229729865760" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, the OIC General Secretariat expressed its ‚Äúdeep concern over the deteriorating security situation in the South Asian region‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt stressed the need to resolve differences through peaceful means, in accordance with international law and the United Nations Charter, to safeguard peace, security, and stability in South Asia.‚Äù</p>
<p>The OIC recalled the decisions of the Islamic Summit and the resolutions adopted by the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers that reaffirmed the organisation‚Äôs ‚Äúunwavering support for the Jammu and Kashmir question‚Äù.</p>
<p>Noting that the unresolved issue of Kashmir remained the ‚Äúcore challenge to lasting peace and stability in the region‚Äù, the OIC urged the international community to intensify efforts to find a peaceful resolution to it, in line with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.</p>

<p>In a statement issued today, according to <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em>, Bilawal House spokesperson Surendar Valasai condemned India‚Äôs move to block the X account of PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.</p>
<p>He described the action as a retaliatory response to the party leader‚Äôs ‚Äúunequivocal and bold stance on the Pahalgam incident‚Äù.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said India‚Äôs move to block the PPP chairman‚Äôs X account proved that India was an undemocratic country and its premier was an ‚Äúextremely cowardly person‚Äù.</p>
<p>Separately, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman, in reaction to the Indian step to block Bilawal‚Äôs X account, said that suppressing voices does not hide the truth.</p>
<p>She added that the Indian government should present evidence and not resort to censorship.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEfforts to suppress critical voices are increasing concern not only in Pakistan but also globally,‚Äù the PPP leader said.</p>

                <h2>Trump says ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know‚Äô if must uphold US Constitution as president</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump said in a television interview airing on Sunday that he does not know whether he must uphold the US Constitution.</p>
<p>He also said he is not seriously considering running for a third White House term, after musing publicly over an idea clearly barred by the nation‚Äôs founding legal document.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Trump responded when the host of <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.nbc.com/meet-the-press/video/trump-asked-if-he-has-to-uphold-the-constitution-says-i-dont-know/NBCN872645674" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NBC News</a></em> programme ‚ÄòMeet the Press‚Äô, Kristen Welker, asked directly whether he believes he needs to uphold the supreme law of the land.</p>
<p>Asked specifically whether American citizens and non-citizens alike deserve the due process of law, as the US Constitution states, Trump said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a lawyer. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù</p>
<p>The president‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907891/trumps-use-of-law-for-deportations-unlawful">aggressive moves</a> to deport undocumented migrants ‚Äî some without the benefit of a court hearing ‚Äî have drawn widespread criticism, but Trump insists it is necessary in the face of what he has declared to be a ‚Äúnational emergency‚Äù.</p>
<p>The suggestion of possibly seeking a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1848515#:~:text=In%20May,%20speaking%20at%20a%20National%20Rifle%20Association%20gathering,%20Trump%20quipped%20about%20serving%20more%20than%20two%20terms%20as%20president.">third term in office</a> has been sharply questioned by legal and constitutional scholars.</p>
<p>The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution states that ‚Äúno person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.‚Äù</p>
<p>But Trump said in March he was ‚Äúnot joking‚Äù about seeking a third term, adding without elaboration that there are ‚Äúmethods‚Äù that would allow it to happen.</p>
<p>Changing the Constitution to allow a third term would be a heavy lift, requiring a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress and ratification by at least 38 of the 50 US state legislatures.</p>
<p>But ‚Äúthis is not something I‚Äôm looking to do‚Äù, Trump told <em>NBC‚Äôs</em> Welker, adding: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody, ideally a great Republican, a great Republican to carry it forward.‚Äù</p>
<p>Asked who that might be, he mentioned Vice President JD Vance ‚Äî calling him a ‚Äúfantastic, brilliant guy‚Äù ‚Äî and Secretary of State <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908186/now-a-trusted-ally-little-marco-gets-trumps-big-jobs">Marco Rubio</a>, while adding that ‚Äúwe have a lot of good people in this party.‚Äù</p></p>
