                <h2>Army‚Äôs top brass vows to stop ‚Äòexternally-sponsored terrorists‚Äô from destroying national peace: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The armed forces have vowed to prevent the country‚Äôs peace being compromised by externally-sponsored terrorism, the military‚Äôs media wing said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A day earlier, at least six people, including three students, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912572/bla-and-ttp-are-indian-proxies-govt-will-prove-indias-involvement-in-khuzdar-bus-attack-asif">slain</a> while over 40 others ‚Äî mostly students ‚Äî were injured after a bomb targeted a school bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.</p>
<p>According to a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7300" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the vow was made during the 270th Corps Commander Conference (CCC) at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, chaired by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA comprehensive review of the prevailing internal and external security environment was undertaken, with particular emphasis on the successful conclusion of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910729/operation-bunyanum-marsoos-11-soldiers-martyred-78-wounded-while-defending-pakistan">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a>, a decisive chapter of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566/marka-i-haq-pakistan-army-names-period-of-conflict-with-india-since-april-22-may-10">Marka-i-Haq</a>,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>It was observed that ‚Äúfollowing its military failure in the wake of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam incident</a>, India so-called and self-claimed victim of terrorism, but actually a perpetrator of terrorism and the epicentre of regional instability, has upscaled the use of covert means, employing non-state actors to pursue its destabilisation agenda,‚Äù the ISPR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe forum resolved that Pakistan will never allow its peace to be compromised by externally-sponsored terrorism. The Armed Forces, in close synergy with intelligence and law enforcement agencies, will pursue all proxies and facilitators of terrorism with unrelenting resolve.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese hostile elements, trained and financed to incite chaos and fear, will be dismantled and decimated with the full force of national will and institutional strength.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>It further said that the nation will take ‚Äúall measures necessary to safeguard its vital interests‚Äù.</p>
<p>The conference also deliberated on the regional environment in India-occupied Kashmir and along the working boundary with India, expressing ‚Äúdeep concern‚Äù over human rights violations committed by Indian forces against Kashmiris. The forum also congratulated COAS Munir on his promotion to the rank of field marshal.</p>
<p>‚Äú[The] forum underscored the urgent need for international attention and intervention to prevent further deterioration of peace and security in South Asia,‚Äù the statement read. ‚Äú[The] forum reiterated full diplomatic, political, moral and humanitarian support for Kashmiri brothers and sisters and their just resistance for [the] right of self-determination.‚Äù</p>
<p>Additionally, the meeting paid tribute to the martyrs of Marka-i-Haq and reaffirmed that the ‚Äúsacred blood of the <em>shuhuda</em> (martyrs)‚Äù would not go in vain, while also recognising the spirit and dynamic contributions of the youth and Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúmedia and information warriors‚Äù for their role during the brief conflict.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357">statement</a> by the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office on Wednesday claimed that the Khuzdar attack was carried out by ‚Äústate-sponsored proxies of India (<em>Fitna al Hindustan</em>)‚Äù and added that ‚Äúdastardly terrorist incidents‚Äù were being orchestrated through proxies in Balochistan and KP, ‚Äúdeliberately targeting civilians in a futile attempt to destabilise Pakistan‚Äù.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">ranked second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>
<p>However, a significant improvement was seen in Pakistan‚Äôs internal security landscape in April 2025, ‚Äúas both militant attacks and resultant casualties dropped sharply compared to March‚Äù, according to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907799">data</a> released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) on May 2.</p>

<p>Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday presented Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Asim Munir with the baton of field marshal, formally marking the latter‚Äôs promotion to the highest rank in the military.</p>
<p>The rank of field marshal is the highest rank of armies built on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912572/bla-and-ttp-are-indian-proxies-govt-will-prove-indias-involvement-in-khuzdar-bus-attack-asif">pattern</a> of the British Army.

It is a ceremonial five-star rank that usually signifies extraordinary leadership and wartime achievement.</p>
<p>The federal cabinet on Tuesday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910729/operation-bunyanum-marsoos-11-soldiers-martyred-78-wounded-while-defending-pakistan">approved</a> the promotion of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir to field marshal for his leadership in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and the period of conflict against India known as Marka-i-Haq. He was formally promoted to the position with immediate effect in a notification from the Ministry of Defence under ‚ÄúRule 199-A of the Pakistan Army Regulations (Rules), 1998‚Äù.</p>

<p>The ceremony to confer the baton was held at the Presidency in Islamabad on Thursday, attended by the president, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and civilian and military officials.</p>
<p>After he and President Zardari conferred the baton to Field Marshal Munir, PM Shehbaz said during his address, ‚ÄúToday is a moment of profound national pride and historic importance for Pakistan. We salute our national heroes, COAF Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou have led our brave armed forces to a remarkable victory against an enemy caught in its own web of arrogance and hubris,‚Äù the PM said, addressing Munir.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe aggressor was brought to its knees and taught a lesson. What transpired during those challenging days will not only be remembered for all times to come as an outstanding military victory but also as a moral and diplomatic triumph.‚Äù</p>
<p>The PM said that the field marshal ‚Äúled our armed forces with great tenacity and indomitable resolve‚Äù. He thanked Munir for ‚Äúhis command during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and his resolute courage in safeguarding Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe nation was granted a most glorious victory, which we will remember for the rest of our lives,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúHe not only thwarted the nefarious designs of the adversary, but rewrote the history of warfare.‚Äù</p>
<p>President Zardari paid tribute to the armed forces for defending ‚Äúthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of our motherland against unprovoked Indian aggression‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe entire nation is proud of all of you,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The president officially promoted Munir to the rank of field marshal and conferred the baton ‚Äúin recognition of extraordinary services to Pakistan through the turbulent period and with full confidence in his command and character‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYour military career is forged with courage and defined by wisdom and commitment to lead with vision, strength and honour at the highest level of our armed forces,‚Äù Zardari said. ‚ÄúThroughout this week of Marka-i-Haq Field Marshal Asim displayed a pragmatic understanding of the need to avoid escalation.‚Äù</p></p>

                <h2>BLA and TTP are Indian proxies, govt will prove India‚Äôs involvement in Khuzdar bus attack: Asif</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has said that two major terrorist groups operating in Pakistan were ‚ÄúIndian proxies‚Äù, adding that Islamabad will present ‚Äúcomplete evidence‚Äù to prove New Delhi‚Äôs involvement in the attack on a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912542/pm-vows-strong-action-against-perpetrators-after-school-bus-blast-in-khuzdar">school bus</a> in Balochistan‚Äôs Khuzdar district that killed three children and injured several others.</p>
<p>At least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others ‚Äî mostly students ‚Äî sustained injuries after a bomb targeted the bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.</p>
<p>The condition of at least a dozen is said to be serious due to critical injuries, officials <a class="link--external" href="https://https:/https://www.dawn.com/news/1912542/pm-vows-strong-action-against-perpetrators-after-school-bus-blast-in-khuzdar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>, adding that at least 15 girl students were among the injured. Security forces vowed to ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357/4-students-killed-several-injured-as-school-bus-comes-under-attack-in-khuzdar-dc">relentlessly pursue</a>‚Äù the culprits of the attack as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir visited the injured in Quetta yesterday.</p>
<p>Speaking on <em>Geo News</em> programme ‚ÄòAaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath‚Äô late on Wednesday, Asif asserted there was evidence that the proscribed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) was working as an Indian proxy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will present evidence of India‚Äôs involvement. We will corroborate whatever we have claimed,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúThe relation between BLA and India is well-known as their leadership is in New Delhi. The allegation against us was unsubstantiated but BLA is fighting like an Indian proxy,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>He was referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> last month in occupied Kashmir that killed 26 people, following which India, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">without evidence</a>, had blamed Pakistan for backing the attackers.</p>
<p>Asif further said, ‚ÄúBLA and TTP are Indian proxies. They have nothing to do with religion or nationalism, India is financing them and they‚Äôre involved in bloodshed here.‚Äù</p>
<p>In reply to a question on dealing with the situation, the minister said that ‚ÄúPakistan will strike with full force and there will be no leniency‚Äù, stressing that attacking non-combatants, including school children, was unacceptable.</p>
<p>Asif said Pakistan called for an investigation into the Pahalgam attack, which India didn‚Äôt agree to, adding that the world should be informed that the Narendra Modi-led regime was ‚Äúvery irresponsible for using a false incident as a pretext to wage a nuclear war‚Äù.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan ‚Äúwill not start nuclear confrontation but cannot stay silent if nuclear devices are thrown at us‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan showed restraint, but still India attacked our bases in the dark of the night,‚Äù he highlighted.</p>
<p>A day ago, the military‚Äôs media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), also said that ‚ÄúIndian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians‚Äù.</p>
<p>It noted that India had ‚Äúfailed‚Äù against Pakistan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/india-attacks-pakistans-air-bases-pakistan-retaliates#:~:text=Force.%20Pakistan%20Zindabad.%E2%80%9D-,Operations%20commence,-At%20around%203">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a> during the recent conflict, and its [proxies] were ‚Äúbeing hunted [down] by military and law enforcement agencies‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUse of terrorism as a state policy by [the] Indian political government is abhorrent and reflective of their low morality and disregard of <em>[sic]</em> basic human norms,‚Äù the ISPR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPlanners, abettors and executors of this cowardly Indian-sponsored attack will be hunted down and brought to justice and [the] heinous face of India will be exposed in front of the entire world,‚Äù the military vowed.</p>

<p>On Monday, the ISPR said <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005/3-terrorists-of-indian-proxy-blf-killed-in-balochistan-engagements-ispr">12 terrorists</a> of ‚ÄúIndian proxy‚Äù outfits were killed by security forces in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.</p>
<p>Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said India was activating its ‚Äúassets‚Äù to inte¬≠nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan. He had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">detailed the arrest</a> of a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India as ‚Äúirr¬≠e¬≠futable evidence‚Äù of state-sponsored terrorism directed by Ind¬≠ian military personnel.</p>

<p>Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, Dar discussed the possibility of increasing diplomatic engagement with Kabul, referring to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912541">statement</a> by Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. He said, ‚ÄúWe will look into all these aspects. I fully support the idea that we should settle issues with all neighbours.
