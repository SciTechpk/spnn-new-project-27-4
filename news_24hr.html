            <p><p>Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub combined for a 138 opening partnership and Pakistan defeated the West Indies by 13 runs on Sunday to capture their T20 International Series.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928069">won</a> the series opener by 14 runs but <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928460/last-ball-hero-holder-lifts-west-indies-over-pakistan-in-t20">dropped</a> the second match by two wickets to set up a Sunday night decider at Lauderhill, Florida.</p>
<p>After winning the toss and choosing to bat first, Pakistan were rewarded with a powerhouse performance by Farhan and Ayub.</p>

            <p><p>Five members of a family trapped because of a flood four days ago in Ghizer district of Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) have been rescued and taken to a safe place on the other side of the river by boat, Rescue 1122 Ghizer said on Monday.</p>
<p>Pakistan has been grappling with severe flooding caused by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">glacial lake outburst floods</a> (Glofs) and intense monsoon rains since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919360">June</a>. These extreme weather events have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930">resulted</a> in several deaths and injuries across the country, with the Gilgit-Baltistan region among the hardest hit.</p>
<p>According to Rescue 1122 Ghizer’s media coordinator, Shakraiz, a lightning strike washed away the road connecting the flood-hit area on the evening of July 31, causing five members of a family to be stranded on the other side of the river in Gopus Khatam village.</p>
<p>“Today, the team rescued all the members and moved them to a safe place by boat,” Shakraiz told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>“Food was also delivered to other affected families during the operation. Sixty-two houses, water supply and electricity systems, along with health and education centres, were severely affected by the flood in the Ishkoman and Gopus valleys of Ghizer.”</p>
<p>According to local political leader Zafar Muhammad Shadamkhel, lightning struck at eleven places simultaneously, causing severe damage to houses, buildings, schools, roads and power plants. He added that 600 people have been deprived of drinking water.</p>
<p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927955">cloudburst-induced floods</a> in Ghizer and Hunza districts caused significant damage to the irrigation channel in Ghalapan village in Gojal, upper Hunza, which provides water for over 50,000 forest trees, according to residents.</p>
<p>On the same day, a glacier burst in GB’s Bagrot Valley had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928021">resulted</a> in the death of one person, while his father was injured, according to the regional government’s spokesperson.</p></p>

            <p><p>A high-speed trailer truck crashed in Karachi’s upscale Defence Housing Authority (DHA) on Monday morning, injuring two people, according to Rescue 1122.</p>
<p>The city has lately witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905488/elderly-man-run-over-by-water-tanker-amid-rise-in-heavy-vehicle-fatalities-across-karachi">rise</a> in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891767">killed</a> nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson for Rescue 1122 Sindh, the trailer was travelling at a high speed when it crashed into a bungalow in DHA Phase 2.</p>
<p>He said that as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the urban search and rescue team, along with two ambulances and one disaster response vehicle, rushed to the scene.</p>
<p>“Two people trapped as a result of the collision were rescued safely,” he said, adding that they were transported to the hospital via ambulance with minor injuries.</p>
<p>Both of the injured victims were trailer staff, he added.</p>
<p>Accidents frequently occur in the metropolis due to violations of traffic rules, with speeding and unsafe overtaking being major contributing factors. Speeding increases the risk of crashes and the severity of injuries, while unsafe overtaking often leads to head-on collisions.</p>
<p>Last month, a 59-year-old man was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924967/dumper-truck-kills-motorcyclist-in-karachis-saudabad-police">killed</a> when a dumper truck ran over his motorcycle in Karachi’s Saudabad. The incident angered area residents, who damaged the truck and beat the driver before police intervened.</p>
<p>Earlier in the same week, at least four people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924364">lost their lives</a> and another six were injured — all from the same family — after their speeding car crashed into a wall on Hawkesbay Road in the city’s Mauripur area, while a separate collision between a trailer and a truck left one dead and three injured near New Sabzi Mandi on the Super Highway.</p></p>
