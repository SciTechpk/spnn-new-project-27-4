            <p><p>At least six tourists were killed in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer district as heavy floods battered the region, an official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudburst-induced</a> floods wreaked havoc across the region. The flood-related <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829">death toll</a> in the region rose to five on Tuesday, after four lost their lives and 15 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719">went missing</a> on Monday.</p>
<p>GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that rescue teams recovered another body in Babusar valley, taking the total number of deaths to six. “The search operation to locate the remaining tourists at Babusar is underway,” he added.</p>
<p>According to Rescue 1122, GB’s Ghanche district experienced floods in various areas. Flash floods in Kandos villages damaged a dozen homes, a dispensary, mosques, agricultural land and crops, it said.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 also stated that flash floods in Sikarkoi damaged several houses and other infrastructure in Dass Mohallah and the surrounding areas in Gilgit.</p>

<p>Separately, rescue teams on Thursday recovered the body of a retired colonel who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/pmd-issues-glof-alert-for-gb-kp-as-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-from-diamer-amid-floods#:~:text=Two%20swept%20away%20in%20Rawalpindi%E2%80%99s%20DHA'">went missing</a> after his car was swept away by floodwaters and slipped into a drain in Rawalpindi last week, while a search for his daughter continues, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>Rescue efforts have been underway since Tuesday, when Retired Colonel Ishaq Qazi, aged approximately 62–64 years, and his 25-year-old daughter went missing after the car they were in was swept away by rainwater.</p>
<p>District Emergency Officer (DEO) Sibghatullah said, “The body of Ishaq had been found near the Soan River bridge, while rescue operations are underway to look for his daughter.”</p>
<p>Earlier today, Sibghatullah had said that rescue operations had entered a third day to search for the duo, while parts of their car had been found.</p>
<p>“Rescue 1122 found the bonnet and a door of the car under the Soan River bridge,” he said.</p>
<p>According to a statement by Islamabad’s Sihala police station on Tuesday, the duo were in a grey Honda vehicle and were residents of Defence Housing Authority’s Phase 5.</p>
<p>“Due to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain,” the police statement from Tuesday said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, two girls were among four people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925919">swept away</a> in separate incidents due to flash flooding in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>Pakistan experiences <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925461">monsoon rainfall</a> from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>Last week, Section 144 was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924761">imposed</a> across Punjab along with a state of emergency in several districts as heavy rains triggered flooding and claimed over 60 lives across the province in 24 hours.</p>

<p>On the other hand, residents of a housing society blocked Rawalpindi’s Grand Trunk Road after the rescue teams could not recover the body of a teenager who had drowned a day earlier.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, a 17-year-old boy drowned while crossing a nullah near the Metro City Housing Society. He was walking on a small passage when high-speed torrents swept him away in deep waters.</p>
<p>Two of his relatives jumped in the water to rescue him, but they told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the water was moving at high speed and the boy could not be saved.</p>
<p>Gujar Khan assistant superintendent of police and assistant commissioner also reached the spot and called the Rescue 1122 team, who were unable to retrieve the body as of the filing of this report. The residents of the area blocked the GT Road, citing the “inaction and incapacity of Rescue 1122 in recovering the victim’s body after many hours”.</p></p>

            <p><p>An Islamabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) issued a bailable arrest warrant for National Assembly Opposition Leader Omar Ayub on Thursday in a case related to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1862987">protest</a> in October last year.</p>
<p>PTI protesters and the Islamabad police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1862987">clashed</a> on Oct 4, 2024, as hundreds of party activists defied security measures and road <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1862926/allies-foes-alike-urge-pti-to-postpone-protests">blockades</a> to gather at multiple locations days before the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1865567">summit</a>. Over 100 PTI supporters, along with ex-premier Imran Khan’s two sisters, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1863167/dozens-arrested-as-pti-defies-blockades-to-reach-d-chowk">taken into custody</a>.</p>
<p>ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra presided over today’s hearing of a case filed at the Shahzad Town police station.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Advocates Sardar Masroof Khan, Zahid Bashir Dar, Murtaza Toori and Mirza Asim were among the lawyers present on the PTI leaders’ behalf.</p>
<p>During the hearing, Judge Sipra issued a bailable arrest warrant for Ayub and ordered that any previous bail granted to suspects who were absent today be cancelled.</p>
<p>However, the judge accepted Senator Azam Swati’s plea seeking exemption from attendance, which was filed yesterday, according to Masroof.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned till July 30.</p>
<p>In a video statement yesterday, Advocate Masroof lamented the “speed with which these cases are being heard”.</p>
<p>He noted that some suspects had come from faraway areas such as Azad Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mardan, having no place to stay overnight in Islamabad to attend today’s hearing.</p>
<p>“If these trials will be bulldozed in such a manner and you won’t give them a fair trial, then it will become very difficult for you to fulfil the requirements of justice,” the lawyer said, requesting courts to punish those guilty but not convict those who were not involved.</p>

<p>Today’s development comes within days of two ATCs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925931">sentencing PTI bigwigs</a> to as many as 10 years in jail in cases related to the violent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9, 2023</a> countrywide riots.</p>
<p>A Lahore ATC handed down at least eight leaders 10-year rigorous imprisonment, while acquitting six others. A Sargodha ATC also convicted as many as 32 accused, including MNA Ahmad Chattha and Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Ahmed Khan Bhachar.</p>
<p>In May, the Islamabad police’s prosecution nominated the PTI’s top leadership — including Ayub, Chairman Gohar Khan, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Barris­ter Muhammad Ali Saif — in another case over the October 4 protests filed at the Koral police station.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926298/chinas-byd-to-assemble-evs-in-pakistan-from-2026' target='_blank'><strong>China’s BYD to assemble EVs in Pakistan from 2026</strong></a>
            <p><p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD plans to roll out its first car assembled in Pakistan by July or August 2026 to capture growing demand for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in the region, a company executive said on Wednesday.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926216">BYD</a>, the world’s top EV maker, has been expanding rapidly outside its home market, where it is in a strong price war. The Pakistan plant addresses rising demand from emerging markets and allows the company to take advantage of incentives offered by the government.</p>
<p>The plant has been under construction since April near Karachi in a partnership between BYD and Mega Motor Company, a subsidiary of Hub Power, Danish Khaliq, vice president of sales and strategy at BYD Pakistan, told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>It would initially have the capacity to produce 25,000 units a year on a double shift, he said. He did not elaborate on when the plant would achieve full capacity or say when mass production would begin there.</p>
<p>The plant will start by assembling imported parts, with some local production of non-electric components, Khaliq said, adding it would initially produce vehicles for the domestic market, with potential to export to right-hand drive countries in the region depending on freight costs and business economics.</p>
<p>“We do not foresee excess capacity in our system as demand in Pakistan will catch up,” he said.</p>
<p>BYD started delivering imported EVs in Pakistan in March. Khaliq did not give an exact sales number but said the sales of a few hundred cars had exceeded internal targets by 30 per cent.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  ">
        <div class="media__item  "><img alt="" src="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1926216" /></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Khaliq said he expected the market size of EVs and plug-in hybrid cars in Pakistan to grow three to four times in 2025 from around 1,000 total units in 2024. BYD is targeting a 30-35pc share of the segment, Khaliq said.</p>
<p>Based on a Hubco filing, BYD Pakistan made around Rs444 million ($1.56m) in profit in the 2025 March quarter.</p>
<p>BYD will launch its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926216/byd-to-roll-out-first-plug-in-hybrid-pickup">Shark 6</a> plug-in hybrid pickup truck in Pakistan on Friday. China’s MG already sells a PHEV SUV, while rival Haval is set to join the segment soon.</p>
<p>Plug-in hybrids offer a more practical option in Pakistan as the country faces a lack of charging stations for all-electric vehicles. The government slashed power tariffs for chargers <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885345">by 45pc</a> in January to encourage EV uptake and private charging stations.</p></p>
