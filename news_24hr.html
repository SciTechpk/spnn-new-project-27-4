            <p><p>Iran struck Israel early on Saturday with barrages of missiles in response to an latter’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/tel-aviv-in-smoke-as-iran-launches-missiles-under-operation-true-promise-3-after-day-long-israeli-attacks">onslaught</a> on the Islamic republic’s nuclear and military facilities yesterday that killed several <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916918/who-was-hossein-salami-the-revolutionary-guards-chief-killed-in-israeli-attacks">top generals</a>.</p>
<p>The missile salvo comes after nearly 80 people, including top army officers, were killed while over 300 were wounded in Iran a day ago as a result of Israel’s strikes on military sites and private residences, according to the country’s UN envoy Saeed Iravani.</p>

<p><strong>What we know so far:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Military officers, scientists, civilians among 78 killed in Israeli strikes on Friday; 320 injured</li>
<li>One dead, ‘some 40’ injured in Israel as Iran launches ‘Operation True Promise 3’ in response</li>
<li>Khamenei appoints new military brass after top commanders, including IRGC chief Hossein Salami, killed</li>
<li>Radiation ‘unchanged’ in Iran’s Natanz area; ‘limited damage’ to Fordo and Isfahan nuclear sites</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>In the morning, Iran launched a fresh wave of attacks, state media said, after Israel’s military reported it detected inbound missiles from Tehran.</p>
<p>A senior Iranian military official, General Ahmad Vahidi, said “Operation True Promise 3” — as the retaliatory strikes are dubbed — will continue for as long as necessary“, according to Iranian state media <em>IRNA</em>.</p>

<p>Air raid sirens and explosions rang out across Israel overnight, with its military calling on residents to take refuge in bomb shelters in the morning.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said dozens of missiles — some intercepted — had been fired in the latest salvos from Iran.</p>
<p>One woman was killed and “some 40 people” were injured by the Iranian strikes, Israel’s Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter said.</p>
<p>“We faced three salvos of ballistic missiles fired from Iran today, about 150 in total,” Leiter <a class="link--external" href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-news-06-12-25-hnk-intl#cmbviaw2v00003b6wvywxa11k" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>CNN</em>’s Kaitlan Collins.</p>
<p>“We expect that the Iranians, who have a considerable volume of ballistic missiles, somewhere in the neighbourhood of 2,000, will continue to fire them,” he said.</p>
<p>“Israel is in war, not with the people of Iran … we are in a war against a regime that is intent on achieving nuclear power,” Leiter said.</p>
<p>He added that Israel wouldn’t know “precisely how much” damage it could inflict on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure until its forces “continue and complete the campaign”. “Ask me that question in four or five days,” the envoy added.</p>
<p>Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz took shelter inside a bunker, conducting a situation assessment after Iran’s retaliatory strikes, an Israeli official <a class="link--external" href="https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-news-06-12-25-hnk-intl#cmbvc0ru000113b766n6zew28" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>CNN</em></a>.</p>

<p>Smoke was billowing above skyscrapers in downtown Tel Aviv, an <em>AFP</em> journalist reported, as Iran’s Revolutionary Guard said it had attacked dozens of targets in Israel.</p>
<p>Israel’s firefighting service said its teams were responding to the aftermath of Iranian missile strikes, including working to rescue people trapped in a high-rise building.</p>
<p>Resident Chen Gabizon told <em>AFP</em> he ran to an underground shelter after receiving an alert notification.</p>
<p>“After a few minutes, we just heard a very big explosion, everything was shaking, smoke, dust, everything was all over the place,” he said.</p>

<p>The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) said the missiles targeted Israel’s airbases that were used as launch sites for attacks on Iran, the <em>Tasnim</em> news agency <a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/06/14/3334935/irgc-targets-israeli-airbases-used-as-launch-sites-for-attack-on-iran" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>“In this operation, the missile and drone units of the IRGC Aerospace Force employed a combination of precision-guided and smart missile systems to strike military centres, airbases used as launch sites for the criminal aggression against our nation,” the IRGC statement said.</p>
<p>It added that other targets included “military-industrial facilities instrumental in producing missiles and other weaponry for the Zionist regime’s army to commit crimes against the resistant nations of the region — particularly the oppressed people of Palestine and Gaza”.</p>
<p>“Field reports, satellite imagery and intelligence intercepts confirm the effective impact of dozens of ballistic missiles on strategic targets in occupied Palestine. Despite the enemy’s claims of interception, they failed to counter the waves of missile attacks launched by the Islamic Republic of Iran,” the statement added.</p>
<p>A senior Iranian official <a class="link--external" href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-news-06-12-25-hnk-intl#cmbvg0j3u002w3b76nxw5vcfd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>CNN</em></a> that Iran would intensify its attacks on Israel and target the regional bases of any country that “attempts to defend the regime”.</p>

<p>In Tehran earlier today, fire and heavy smoke billowed from Mehrabad airport, an <em>AFP</em> journalist said, as local media reported a blast in the area.</p>
<p>Iran’s ambassador to the UN said on Friday that 78 people had been killed and 320 wounded in the first wave of strikes by Israel.</p>

<p>Iran said earlier it had activated its air-defence system and explosions could be heard across the capital.</p>
<p>Dozens of people took to the streets of Tehran overnight to cheer their country’s military response, with some waving national flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans.</p>
<p>Separately, <em>IRNA</em> said the country’s forces downed two Israeli fighter jets during a massive Israeli air raid, although Israel denied this.</p>
<p>Iranian outlets <em><a class="link--external" href="https://en.mehrnews.com/news/233090/Iran-detains-Israeli-female-fighter-jet-pilot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mehr</a></em> and <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/06/13/3334885/iran-s-air-defenses-down-2-israeli-warplanes-female-pilot-captured" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tasnim</a></em> also reported that a female Israeli pilot was captured.

<p>After a day of back-and-forth bombardments, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for the two nations to cease fire.</p>

<p>US officials said they were helping Israel defend against the missile attacks, even as Washington insisted it had nothing to do with Israel’s strikes on Iran.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump agreed on a call with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer that “dialogue and diplomacy” were needed to calm the crisis, Starmer’s office said.</p>
<p>Trump also spoke with Netanyahu on Friday, US officials said, without elaborating.</p>
<p>Iran’s missile salvo came hours after Israel said its widespread air raids had killed several top Iranian generals, including most of the senior leadership of the Revolutionary Guards’ air force.</p>
<p>It had launched several rounds of strikes that hit about 200 targets, including nuclear facilities and air bases.</p>
<p>Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to bring Israel “to ruin” during a televised address.</p>

<p>In Israel, Netanyahu issued a statement calling on the Iranian public to unite against their own government. But he also warned more attacks were coming.</p>
<p>“In the past 24 hours, we have taken out top military commanders, senior nuclear scientists, the Islamic regime’s most significant enrichment facility and a large portion of its ballistic missile arsenal,” Netanyahu said.</p>
<p>While stressing that it was not involved in the Israeli attacks, the United States warned Iran not to attack its personnel or interests.</p>
<p>Tehran nevertheless said Washington would be “responsible for consequences”.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#commanders-killed" id="commanders-killed" title="Permalink"></a>Commanders killed</h2>
<p>The strikes killed Iran’s highest-ranking military officer, armed forces chief of staff Mohammad Bagheri, and the head of the Revolutionary Guards, Hossein Salami, Iranian media <a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85861042/Top-Iranian-military-commanders-and-civilian-figures-are-assassinated" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Khamenei swiftly appointed new commanders to replace those killed. Major General Seyyed Abdulrahim Mousavi was appointed to replace Bagheri, while Major Gen Mohammad Pakpour was chosen as the new head of the Revolutionary Guards, according to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85861543/Leader-appoints-new-top-military-brass" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IRNA</a></em>.

<p>“The senior chain of command of the air force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps had assembled in an underground command centre to prepare for an attack on the State of Israel,” the Israeli military said, adding that its attacks had killed most of them.</p>
<p>Iran confirmed that the Guards’ aerospace commander had been killed, along with “a group of brave and dedicated fighters”.</p>
<p><em>AFP</em> images showed a gaping hole in the side of a Tehran residential building that appeared to have sustained a targeted strike.</p>
<p><em>Tasnim</em> news agency said six nuclear scientists were among the dead.</p>

<p>The conflict raised questions as to whether Sunday’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">sixth round of talks</a> planned between the United States and Iran to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906722">seek a deal</a> on Iran’s nuclear programme would go ahead in Oman.</p>
<p>After the first wave of strikes on Friday, Trump urged Iran to “make a deal” while noting that a 60-day ultimatum had expired. He added that Washington was “hoping to get back to the negotiating table”.</p>

<p>After months of urging Israel not to strike Iran while he worked toward a nuclear deal, Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-tells-reuters-its-unclear-if-iran-still-has-nuclear-program-2025-06-13/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Reuters</em></a> in a phone interview on Friday that he and his team had known the attacks were coming — and still saw room for an accord.</p>
<p>“We knew everything, and I tried to save Iran [from] humiliation and death. I tried to save them very hard because I would have loved to have seen a deal worked out,” Trump said.</p>
<p>“They can still work out a deal, however, it’s not too late,” he added.</p>
<p>Trump’s shifting stance around the Israeli strikes, which he called “<a class="link--external" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-tells-abc-israel-strikes-iran-excellent-warns/story?id=122807155" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">excellent</a>” and “<a class="link--external" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/12/politics/trump-israel-iran-strike#:~:text=called%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20strikes%20on%20Iran%20overnight%20%E2%80%9Ca%20very%20successful%20attack" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">very successful</a>” in a series of media interviews on Friday, offered one of the most striking examples yet of how he conducts high-stakes negotiations through both frank public rhetoric and behind-the-scenes maneuovers.</p>

<p>Iran currently enriches uranium to 60 per cent, far above the 3.67pc limit set by a largely moribund <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1194411">2015 agreement</a> with major powers, but still short of the 90pc threshold needed for a nuclear warhead.</p></p>

            <p><p>Israel’s strikes on Iranian nuclear and military facilities constitute a “grave danger and a serious threat” to the peace, security, and stability of the entire region and beyond, Pakistan told the United Nations Security Council during an emergency session convened on Friday, the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/foreign-correspondent/pakistan-warns-unsc-of-grave-threat-to-world-peace-posed-by-israeli-strikes-on-military-targets-in-iran/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>Israel on Friday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">launched</a> widescale strikes on Iran, claiming that it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories, and military commanders. Iran’s ambassador told the UN that 78 people had been killed and 320 wounded in the first wave of strikes by Israel.  In a message, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks were the beginning of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.</p>
<p>Iranian media and witnesses reported explosions, including at the country’s main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, <em>Reuters</em> reported. Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards corps said its top commander, Hossein Salami, was killed, and state media reported the unit’s headquarters in Tehran had been hit. Six Iranian nuclear scientists were killed, Iranian state media reported.</p>
<p>In his remarks, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, strongly condemned the “unjustified and illegitimate” aggression by Israel against Iran, reaffirming that Islamabad stood in resolute solidarity with the Iranian government and people.</p>

<p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi requested the Security Council meeting, saying Israel “has now crossed every red line, and the international community must not allow these crimes to go unpunished”.</p>
<p>Among those supporting the request for a meeting were Algeria, Pakistan, China and Russia.</p>
<p>Amid escalating tensions, the Pakistani envoy urged the Security Council to discharge its responsibility to uphold international law and stop this aggression immediately.</p>
<p>Ambassador Asim strongly called for the resolution of the crisis through dialogue and diplomacy</p>
<p>Briefing the Security Council, UN Under-Secretary-General for political affairs Rosemary DiCarlo, told ambassadors that the repercussions of the attacks were already reverberating.</p>
<p>“I reaffirm the Secretary-General’s condemnation of any military escalation in the Middle East,” she said, urging both Israel and Iran to exercise maximum restraint and “avoid at all costs a descent into deeper and wider regional conflict”.</p>
<p>She also noted that the military escalation came just as “some significant diplomatic developments” were unfolding, including the planned <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">resumption</a> of United States-Iranian talks in Oman at the weekend. Latest reports indicate that Iran will no longer attend.</p>
<p>DiCarlo urged parties to stay the diplomatic course.</p>
<p>“A peaceful resolution through negotiations remains the best means to ensure the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme,” she said.</p>
<p>“We must at all costs avoid a growing conflagration which would have enormous global consequences.”</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916989/un-security-council-warned-of-deepening-crisis-in-middle-east">briefing</a> the Council, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi said his agency was in constant contact with the Iranian Nuclear Regulatory Authority to assess the status of affected facilities and determine broader impacts on nuclear safety and security.</p>
<p>He stressed that nuclear sites must never be targeted — under any circumstances.</p>
<p>“Such attacks have serious implications for nuclear security, nuclear safety and safeguards, as well as regional and international peace and security,” Grossi said.</p>
<p>He stands ready to travel to the region at the earliest opportunity, he added, to assess the situation and support safety, security and non-proliferation efforts in Iran.</p>
<p>“It is clear that the only sustainable path forward for Iran, for Israel, the entire region and the international community is one grounded in dialogue and diplomacy to ensure peace, stability and cooperation.”</p>
<p>Grossi concluded by offering the IAEA as a neutral platform where “facts prevail over rhetoric” and where technical engagement replace escalation.</p>
<p>“I reaffirm my personal and the agency’s readiness to facilitate dialogue and support efforts that promote transparency, security and the peaceful resolution of nuclear issues in Iran.”</p>
<p>Pakistan came out strongly in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917004">support</a> of Iran’s right to self-defence, following Israeli military strikes on Iranian targets, distinguishing its position from most other regional and global powers.</p>
<p>The Pakistani position was more than a diplomatic footnote; rather a bold assertion of principle in a region accustomed to cautious ambiguity.</p>

<p>When the Foreign Office described Isr­­ael’s action as “unjustified and illegitim­a­­te aggression” that violated “the soverei­g­nty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran” and flouted the UN Charter, it did not stop at condemnation.</p>
<p>It explicitly mentioned Article 51: “Iran has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.” The statement further urged the world to “hold the aggressor accountable for its actions.”</p>
<p>In a call with the Iranian foreign minister, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar condemned the blatant Israeli aggression and reiterated Islamabad’s strong support to Iran for the sake of peace in the region.</p>
<p>He also conveyed the deepest sympathies on the loss of many precious lives in Israeli attacks on Iranian territory.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917024/review-of-salary-hike-offered-after-outcry' target='_blank'><strong>Review of salary hike offered after outcry</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Ayaz Sadiq distances himself from unprecedented increase in salaries of speaker, Senate chairman<br />
• NA’s sound system develops fault ‘due to PTI’s protest’<br />
• Opposition continues to face ‘censorship’ as budget debate begins</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: A key government minister on Friday announced that a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916120">decision</a> to award an unprecedented and massive increase in the salaries and allowances of the National Assembly speaker, Senate chairman and their deputies as well as federal ministers, could be reviewed and potentially even withdrawn in the wake of widespread and ‘somewhat justified’ criticism.</p>
<p>The announcement was made by Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on the floor of the National Assembly during a debate on the federal budget, after Speaker Ayaz Sadiq distanced himself from the ongoing controversy, clarifying that neither he nor the finance committee of the house had any role in this decision.</p>
<p>The speaker even declared that he would have no objection, if the decision to increase the salaries was withdrawn.</p>
<p>The speaker gave the “explanation” while interrupting the opening speech of Opposition Leader Omar Ayub Khan when the latter was about to mention the issue.</p>
<p>“Let me give an explanation. Neither the finance committee [of the house] nor the National Assembly has made this decision. Those who have done so, they can do so,” he said without elaborating, adding that those who could make a decision about the salaries of ministers, speaker or the Senate chairman, could even withdraw it.</p>
<p>“There is no harm, if it [the raise] is withdrawn,” he said. However, the speaker said that the decision to increase the salaries of the members of the parliament had been made by the house finance committee, thus implying that it could not be reversed.</p>
<p>Though, the speaker had not named any individual or institution, the parliamentary affairs minister while mentioning the issue, admitted that it was his ministry which had prepared a summary for the increase in the salaries of the ministers and the custodians of the two houses, stating that the summary was approved by the federal cabinet.</p>
<p>This assertion from the minister came as a surprise for many amid reports that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has taken a notice of the increase in the salaries and a harsh criticism from Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who is also a member of the federal cabinet.</p>
<p>Quoting sources, the media had reported on Friday that the prime minister’s action came in the wake of widespread public criticism over the increase in the salaries of the custodians of the two houses from Rs205,000 to Rs1.3 million a month, besides huge increase in the allowance bringing the total financial benefit to over Rs2m a month.</p>
<p>However, during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916663/budget-2025-26-threat-of-rs500bn-tax-hike-if-enforcement-measures-blocked">post-budget press conference</a> on June 11, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb had defended the steep hikes — some as large as 550 per cent — in the salaries of the speaker, Senate chairman and ministers.</p>
<p>The parliamentary affairs minister in his speech declared that since there was a criticism in the “concerned quarters”, therefore, the decision to increase the salaries could be “reviewed and withdrawn”, stating “it is not impracticable.”</p>
<p>After taking the whole responsibility on his shoulder by admitting that his ministry had sent the summary to the federal cabinet for the approval, Dr Chaudhry then stated that altho­ugh there was no big financial impact of the increase in the salaries of the MPs, ministers and the NA speaker and the Senate chairman, the government was ready to “rectify” the decision.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Due to the general feelings among the government employees and those [sections of the society] living below the poverty line having no resources and for whom we have not added so much in the budget as our hands are tied, we can try to rectify [the decision] which has sent a bad message and caused a bad taste”, said the minister.</p>
<p>Dr Chaudhry, however, said they had to make this accumulative increase in the salaries as there had been no raise in the salaries of the MPs and the ministers in proportionate to the constant increase in the salaries of the government employees in the previous budgets over the past many years.</p>
<p><strong>Faulty sound system</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, the proceedings of the lower house of the parliament on the opening day of the bud­get debate were marked by disruptions and a controversy when the speaker anno­unced that the microphones and sound system inst­alled on the first four rows of the house were not functioning after developing a technical fault due to the protest of the opposition PTI members during the budget speech of the finance minister on June 10.</p>
<p>The speaker also stated that the repair of the system would cost upto Rs350m.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the opposition members had to come to the opposition leader’s seat to deliver their speeches as the NA Secretariat staff had made special arrangements to provide mic facility to the opposition members.</p>
<p>Initially, the proceedings of the house were not telecast live on the national as well as official social media websites, including YouTube and Facebook, but as soon as the opposition leader finished his speech and the parliamentary affairs minister took the floor, the live transmission of the proceedings began on the official social media channels.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>The speeches of the opposition members were completely censored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The parliamentary reporters also faced difficulties in the coverage of the proceedings as the National Assembly Secretariat staff had removed the speakers placed at the press lounge, besides the transmission was also not available on the screens installed there. The journalists had to sit in the press gallery to take notes of the speeches.</p>
<p>Due to complete censoring of their speeches, some of the opposition members, including Omar Ayub Khan, were seen making videos from their mobile phones during the proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>Budget debate</strong></p>
<p>Most of the speakers from both sides of the aisle delivered political speeches, instead of talking about budgetary measures.</p>
<p>All front treasury benches remained empty most of the time during the opposition leader’s speech in which he harshly criticised the government’s economic policies.</p>
<p>The opposition leader in his speech also talked about the alleged political victimisation of the opposition, and demanded immediate release of the “political prisoners, including Imran Khan.”</p>
<p>Alleging that there was no independent media and judiciary in the country, Mr Khan demanded fresh elections in the country after carrying out some poll reforms.</p>
