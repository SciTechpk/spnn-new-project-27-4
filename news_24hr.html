            <p><p>PTI leader Sayed Zulfikar Bukhari, a former aide to ex-premier Imran Khan, is set to offer testimony on “political repression” in Pakistan before the United States Congress’ Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, it emerged on Monday.</p>
<p>According to its <a class="link--external" href="https://humanrightscommission.house.gov/about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>, the bipartisan commission was established in 2008 and is charged with promoting, defending and advocating for international human rights as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant human rights instruments.</p>
<p>The commission’s <a class="link--external" href="https://humanrightscommission.house.gov/events/hearings/pakistan-ongoing-political-repression" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hearing notice</a> states that the session will take place on Tuesday (tomorrow) at 3:30pm (12:30am PKT on Wednesday) and will “examine the government of Pakistan’s persecution of opposition political figures and journalists, and its actions to control media communications and prevent free and fair elections in Pakistan”. The session is open to the public and the media.</p>
<p>“Many date the current phase of repression in Pakistan to 2022, when, with the involvement of the Pakistan military, popular Prime Minister Imran Khan was ousted, and soon after, arrested, convicted of corruption and imprisoned,” the notice read.</p>
<p>“Parliamentary elections in February 2024 were, according to the US State Department, marked by ‘undue restrictions on freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly’, as well as ‘electoral violence, and restrictions on the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms’,” it added.</p>

<p>The commission provided a list of witnesses who would provide testimony during Tuesday’s hearing. Besides Bukhari, the list includes Amnesty International’s Advocacy Director for Europe and Central Asia, Ben Linden; Perseus Strategies Managing Director Jared Genser; and Afghanistan Impact Network founder Sadiq Amini.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=414866" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> from the commission’s co-chairman, Republican Congressman Christopher Smith, who will chair the session, said the meeting would “discuss the government of Pakistan’s ongoing political repression, the US response, and offer recommendations for Congress”.</p>
<p>Bukhari announced that he would be testifying before the commission in a post on X dated July 9, expressing gratitude to the commission’s co-chairs, Democratic Congressman James McGovern and Smith, for the opportunity to testify.</p>
<p>“I will be highlighting the arbitrary detention of Imran Khan, his wife, and other political prisoners, as well as the erosion of democracy, the undermining of the rule of law, and escalating crackdowns on freedom of expression in Pakistan,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Genser replied to Bukhari’s post, writing, “I am honoured and grateful to be able to testify alongside you before the [Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission] on Pakistan, human rights and the situation of Imran Khan and all political prisoners being held by the current regime.”</p>

<p>Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831/legal-woes-deepen-as-imran-and-bushra-convicted-in-ps190m-al-qadir-trust-case">£190 million corruption case</a> and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9, 2023, protests.</p>
<p>In May, Freedom Network’s annual <em>Freedom of Expression and Media Freedom Report</em> for 2025 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907652">said</a> Pakistan’s media is standing at a crossroads amid an existential threat and increased restrictive environment, deteriorating safety and job security, significant challenges to professional integrity of media and its practitioners.</p>
<p>Titled ‘Free speech and public interest journalism under siege’, the report finds that the existential crisis was triggered by amendments to Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) in January 2025 that now “makes it easier” for authorities to arrest, fine and imprison journalists and dissidents — both offline and online — besides other challenges.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), the country’s leading human rights watchdog, has also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921746">expressed deep concern</a> over the steadily shrinking space for human rights advocacy in the country.</p>
<p>In a statement issued earlier this month, the HRCP said it had faced a series of arbitrary, illegal, and unjustified actions over the past few months, which have impeded the organisation’s ability to carry out its mandate.</p></p>

            <p><p>At least six people have died, including four children, while one person was injured over the last 24 hours in rain-related incidents as heavy downpours continue to lash parts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said on Monday.</p>
<p>Last week, PDMA alerted the district administrations across KP to the possibility of floods due to a new <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923519">spell</a> of torrential rains from July 11 to 17. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have wreaked havoc in the province in June and are set to continue.</p>
<p>Pakistan experiences Monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>In Bajaur, a woman died after the boundary wall of her house collapsed due to heavy rain and gusty winds, according to the PDMA report, while in Khyber district, two children were swept away in a flash flood after heavy rains.</p>
<p>Per the report, Rescue 1122 officials found the body of one of the children, adding that efforts were underway to find the other missing child. Another child — who was injured after being struck by lightning  — was taken to the hospital and is now in a stable condition.</p>
<p>In Kohat, a man died after the roof of his house caved in, while two children. aged seven and 12,  died as a result of a wall collapse in Malakand.</p>

            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte announced a plan on Monday to rearm Ukraine with missiles and other weaponry in its fight to fend off Russian invaders and warned of severe tariffs if Moscow does not end the war.</p>
<p>The announcement by the two leaders followed weeks of frustration on the part of Trump with Russian President Vladimir Putin over his refusal to make an agreement to end the conflict.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has made frequent appeals to Trump and Nato leaders for more weapons.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Trump said the United States will supply weapons that will be paid for by Nato countries. Rutte said massive numbers of weapons would be sent, including missiles, as part of a first wave of equipment.</p>
<p>“It’s a full complement with the batteries,” Trump said when asked whether he would send Patriot missiles specifically. “We’re going to have some come very soon, within days … a couple of the countries that have Patriots are going to swap over and will replace the Patriots with the ones they have.”</p>
<p>Trump also warned that he would impose “very severe tariffs” on Russia if no deal is made in 50 days.</p>
<p>“If I was Vladimir Putin today, and you’re speaking about what you are planning to do in 50 days … I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously,” Rutte said.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Trump has been reluctant to punish Russia, but he came away from a recent phone call with Putin disappointed that the Russian leader appeared prepared to continue the war.</p>
<p>“Putin really surprised a lot of people. He talks nice and then he bombs everybody in the evening,” Trump said on Sunday, as he returned from watching the FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The White House has U-turned from an announcement earlier this month that it would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921665/ukraine-left-scrambling-after-us-says-halting-some-arms-shipments">pause</a> some arms deliveries to Kyiv, instead announcing a new deal which would involve Nato <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922174/berlin-offers-to-buy-us-air-defence-system-for-kyiv">purchasing</a> some US weapons to send to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Last week, Trump accused Putin of throwing “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922956">bullshit</a>” at Washington on Ukraine, openly frustrated with the impasse on peace efforts.</p>
<p>As he began his second stint in office in January, Trump insisted he could work with the Russian leader to end the war in Ukraine swiftly, and held off on hiking sanctions, unlike Kyiv’s European allies.</p>
<p>But Russia has for months refused a ceasefire proposed by the United States and Ukraine.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#sledgehammer" id="sledgehammer" title="Permalink"></a>‘Sledgehammer’</h2>
<p>Republican senators, meanwhile, are touting a bipartisan bill that would arm Trump with a “sledgehammer” to use against Russia.</p>
<p>The sanctions bill would allow Trump “to go after Putin’s economy, and all those countries who prop up the Putin war machine,” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told broadcaster <em>CBS News</em>.</p>
<p>It “would give President Trump the ability to impose 500pc tariffs on any country that helps Russia,” said Graham, adding that those could include economies that purchase Russian goods like China, India or Brazil.</p>
<p>“This is truly a sledgehammer available to President Trump to end this war,” said Graham.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Graham and Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal were also due to meet Nato’s Rutte on Monday.</p>
<p>Blumenthal told <em>CBS News</em> they would also discuss the legally thorny issue of unlocking frozen Russian assets in Europe and the United States for access by Ukraine.</p>
<p>“The $5 billion that the United States has also could be accessed, and I think it’s time to do it,” said Blumenthal.</p>
<p>Zelensky said the proposed bill “is exactly the kind of leverage that can bring peace closer and make sure diplomacy is not empty”.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has previously said that sending arms to Ukraine would only prolong the conflict.</p>
<p>Putin launched the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676939">full-scale invasion</a> of Ukraine in 2022 and has shown little appetite for ending the conflict despite pressure from Trump.</p>
<p>Over the summer, Russia has escalated its offensive and advanced the front line, launching some of the largest missile and drone attacks of the war.</p></p>
