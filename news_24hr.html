            <p><p>Pakistani pilgrims will be barred from travelling by road to Iran and Iraq for the Arbaeen pilgrimage due to public and national security, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Pilgrims <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855955">visit Iraq</a> to attend the chehlum commemoration — also known as Arbaeen (40 in Arabic) — to mark the 40th day of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922472/ashura-processions-in-major-cities-of-country-conclude-peacefully">mourning</a> for the martyrdom of Imam Husain, the grandson of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</p>
<p>“After extensive consultations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [the] Balochistan Government, and security agencies, it has been decided that <em>zaireen</em> (pilgrims) will not be allowed to travel to Iraq and Iran by road for Arbaeen this year,” Naqvi said on X.</p>
<p>He added that the “difficult decision was taken in the interest of public safety and national security”.</p>
<p>However, the pilgrims will be able to travel by air, the minister noted.</p>

<p>Naqvi stressed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed authorities to “arrange maximum flights to facilitate their pilgrimage in the coming days”.</p>
<p>Naqvi’s statement came after he met with PM Shehbaz earlier today to brief him on the new policy for pilgrims, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> (<em>APP</em>) <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/interior-minister-calls-on-pm-briefs-over-zaireens-new-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The premier also directed Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif to arrange “special flights for the pilgrims, <em>APP</em> stated, citing a press release from the PM Office.</p>
<p>Iraq’s Karbala, where Imam Hussein and his brother Abbas are buried in two enormous mausoleums facing each other, is the centre of the Shia world during this time. More than <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854804/millions-of-pilgrims-rally-for-arbaeen">21 million</a> devotees took part in the pilgrimage last year.</p>
<p>Pakistan is set to introduce a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922178">new travel management system</a> from Jan 1, 2026, under which pilgrims will only be allowed to undertake the journey under registered organisers.</p>

<p>Under the new measures, the traditional Salar System will be abolished and replaced with a Zaireen Group Organisers model. Alongside weekly flights to Iran being increased from six to 15, 107 additional special flights will also be arranged for pilgrims heading to Iraq.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousuf <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925358/religious-affairs-minister-retracts-40000-missing-pilgrims-remark">retracted</a> his statement that 40,000 pilgrims had not returned from trips to Iran and Iraq. He clarified that a “misunderstanding” of outdated paper records that had not yet been fully digitised resulted in the statement.</p>

<p>Senator Marri had sought a report on a critical discrepancy — the Gwadar Development Authority officials blamed a lack of funds for the project delays, while the Finance Division said it had received no funding demand from the Balochistan government.</p>

            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has said that Pakistan received “recent assurances” from Afghan authorities that the neighbouring country’s soil would not be used for terrorism — a key issue of contention between Islamabad and Kabul.</p>
<p>Both countries have witnessed an improvement in bilateral relations after taking steps to improve ties, such as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904628">revival</a> of the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914506/kabul-also-levels-up-its-pakistan-diplomat-to-ambassador-as-ties-see-normalisation">upgrading</a> diplomatic ranks. Dar visited Kabul earlier this month where an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924880/pakistan-uzbekistan-afghanistan-ink-deal-on-railway-project">agreement</a> was signed for the Pakistan, Uzbek­istan and Afghanistan railway project to boost regional trade and connectivity.</p>
<p>According to a statement issued on Saturday, the foreign minister, during an interaction with the Pakistani community at the Pakistan Consulate in New York, highlighted the country’s outreach to Afghanistan with a view to enhancing regional connectivity through rail and trade corridors to Central Asia.</p>
<p>He shared Pakistan’s expectation that Afghan soil would not be used for terrorism, noting recent assurances received from Afghan authorities in that regard, according to a statement by the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925440/interior-minister-naqvi-discusses-counterterrorism-in-kabul-meeting-with-afghan-counterpart">visited</a> Kabul earlier this month and discussed counterterrorism efforts and mechanisms for regulating cross-border movement in a meeting with his Afghan counterpart, Sirajuddin Haqqani. Naqvi had expressed concerns over the infiltration by terrorist organisations causing “chaos and instability” and the need to stop them.</p>
<p>Islamabad accuses Afghan-based terror groups of launching cross-border attacks and planning and executing terrorist attacks here, facilitated by the Afghan Taliban administration’s indifference to Pakistan’s concerns. In response, Pakistan has conducted military strikes against terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan and initiated a mass deportation drive targeting Afghan nationals.</p>
<p>In April, Afghanistan’s acting prime minister, Mullah Hasan Akhund, had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905407">assured</a> Pakistan that Afghan territory would not be used for hostile activities against any country.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#country-witnessing-economic-revival" id="country-witnessing-economic-revival" title="Permalink"></a>Country witnessing ‘economic revival’</h2>
<p>During the interaction in New York, Dar stated that Pakistan is experiencing a significant positive boost in its standing on the world stage, saying it had emerged from a period of diplomatic isolation and is witnessing economic revival.</p>
<p>“We have made considerable progress, especially in political and economic fields, in the past three years, despite heavy odds. We are indeed a resilient nation,” he said. Dar underscored that Pakistan was actively engaging on the international stage, including through recent high-level visits and multilateral diplomacy.</p>
<p>He invited the diaspora to actively contribute to Pakistan’s development, particularly in investment, trade, education, and digital innovation. He appreciated the contributions of the Pakistani diaspora to both Pakistan and the United States, acknowledging their vital role in strengthening bilateral relations and enhancing Pakistan’s image globally.</p>
<p>The foreign minister informed the community gathering on Pakistan’s economic recovery, noting that the country had successfully completed the IMF programme, significantly reduced inflation, and restored investor confidence.</p>
<p>Sharing that global credit rating agencies had recently acknowledged Pakistan’s improved macroeconomic outlook, he reaffirmed the government’s aspiration for Pakistan to join the ranks of G-20 economies.</p>
<p>He outlined key initiatives of the government, particularly the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), designed to streamline investment procedures and unlock opportunities in priority sectors.</p>
<p>Dar assured the community that the government was actively working toward the early resumption of PIA flights to New York, including steps toward <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924570/uk-lifts-ban-on-pakistani-airlines-removes-country-from-air-safety-list">restoring</a> routes to Europe and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to engaging the Pakistani-American diaspora as strategic partners in national development as well as in strengthening mutually beneficial Pakistan–US bilateral cooperation.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#pakistan-to-defend-sovereignty" id="pakistan-to-defend-sovereignty" title="Permalink"></a>‘Pakistan to defend sovereignty’</h2>
<p>Speaking to the Pakistani community in New York, FM Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to defend its sovereignty and regional stability, recalling the country’s firm and resolute response during Operation <em>Bunyanum Marsoos</em> that led to the downing of six Indian aircraft. He praised the unity demonstrated by the nation and the diaspora during this critical moment.</p>
<p>He appreciated the solidarity and support extended by Pakistani-Americans during the recent tensions with India and their constructive role in amplifying the voice of the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>The government termed its retaliatory operation against India as ‘Bunyan-un- Marsoos’ after Pakistan and India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186">clashed</a> in May. After India launched a series of strikes under ‘Operation Sindoor’, Pakistan’s military swiftly responded and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">downed</a> 6 Indian jets before a ceasefire came into effect following US mediation.</p>
<p>The foreign minister earlier on Saturday returned from Washington, DC where he held a “cordial” <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926499/rubio-lauds-pakistans-role-in-global-and-regional-peace-in-1st-meeting-with-fm-dar">meeting</a> with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. “The meeting went very well. We discussed key global and regional issues,” he said, expressing hope that bilateral ties would be further strengthened.</p>
<p>Rubio had lauded Pakistan’s role in “global and regional peace” in his first meeting with Dar.</p></p>

            <p><p>Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) activists marked the 12th day of their sit-in in Islamabad on Sunday, demanding the release of their jailed leaders, as protesters alleged police were asking to see their Computerised National Identity Cards (CNICs).</p>
<p>BYC, a Baloch advocacy group active since 2018, has been campaigning against enforced disappearances. Its chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other activists were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899608">arrested</a> on March 22 for allegedly attacking Quetta Civil Hospital and inciting violence, a day after police cracked down on their protest. Earlier this month, an anti-terrorism court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925000/quetta-atc-sends-mahrang-baloch-others-on-15-day-physical-remand-again">remanded</a> them into 15-day police custody.</p>
<p>The Islamabad sit-in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925313">began</a> on July 16, with BYC leaders and members demanding the release of its activists. Political leaders, journalists and activists have joined the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925000#:~:text=BYC%E2%80%99s%20Islamabad%20sit-in%20continues%20for%203rd%20day">sit-in</a> over the past few days.</p>
<p>Last week, the BYC continued the demonstration on the road leading to the National Press Club in Islamabad, as the route had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925221">blocked</a> by police with barbed wire, preventing activists from returning to their original protest site.</p>
<p>An alleged video recorded by the protesters showed police demanding to see their CNICs and warning that failure to comply would result in them not being allowed to continue the demonstration.</p>
<p>In the video, protesters can be heard questioning why police were demanding identification after 12 days of demonstrating, to which an officer responds, “This rule was implemented today.”</p>
<p>A protester can be heard in the video refusing to show their ID card, saying their lawyer was on the way to the protest site.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a post on X, the BYC condemned the police’s demand for ID cards, accusing them of “further escalating the harassment” and attempting to “suppress and intimidate” the protesters.</p>
<p>“Last night, personnel from law enforcement and intelligence agencies began tailing protestors, following elderly mothers and women back to their temporary residence,” the BYC alleged in the post, adding that these personnel allegedly photographed the residences.</p>

<p>“These threatening tactics are taking place with the full backing and coordination of [the] Islamabad Police. Inside the protest space itself, LEA officials are regularly entering and capturing videos of students’ faces to instil fear,” the post further alleged.</p>
<p>According to the BYC, the route to the National Press Club remains blocked and demonstrators have not been allowed to set up a protest camp, despite heavy rain and extreme heat in the city.</p>
<p>“Every day, multiple elderly women and children faint from heat exhaustion,” the post added.</p></p>
