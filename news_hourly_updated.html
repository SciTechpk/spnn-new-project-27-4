                <h2>Army chief dismisses ‚Äòfactually incorrect‚Äô claims of external input in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir on Monday dismissed Indian claims of Pakistan receiving external support in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent tensions with India, terming them ‚Äúirresponsible and factually incorrect‚Äù.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">US-brokered ceasefire</a> for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> reported that the deputy chief of India‚Äôs army alleged last week that China gave Islamabad ‚Äúlive inputs‚Äù on key Indian positions during the conflict. India fought two adversaries during the conflict, with Pakistan being the ‚Äúfront face‚Äù while China provided ‚Äúall possible support‚Äù, Lieutenant General Rahul Singh had said at a defence industry event in New Delhi.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen the DGMO (director general of military operations) level talks were going on, Pakistan ‚Ä¶ said that we know that your such and such important vector is primed and it is ready for action ‚Ä¶ he was getting live inputs from China,‚Äù he said. Singh did not elaborate on how India knew about the live inputs from China.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the Inter-Services Publications said that Field Marshal Munir addressed the matter today while speaking at the National Defence University (NDU) in Islamabad.</p>
<p>He said that India‚Äôs ‚Äúinability‚Äù to achieve its military objectives during Operation Sindoor and the subsequent claims signified ‚Äúits lack of operational readiness and strategic foresight‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInsinuations regarding external support in Pakistan‚Äôs successful Operation Bunyanum Marsoos are irresponsible and factually incorrect and reflect a chronic reluctance to acknowledge indigenous capability and institutional resilience developed over decades of strategic prudence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNaming other states as participants in the purely bilateral military conflagration is also a shoddy attempt at playing camp politics and desperately trying that India remains the beneficiary of larger geopolitical contestation as the so-called net security provider in a region which is getting increasingly weary of its hegemonic and extremist Hindutva ideology.‚Äù</p>
<p>It further stated that ‚Äúin contrast to India‚Äôs strategic behaviour resting on parochial self-alignment‚Äù, Pakistan had forged ‚Äúlasting partnerships based on principled diplomacy, anchored in mutual respect and peace, establishing itself to be a stabiliser in the region‚Äù.</p>
<p>In his remarks, the army chief reiterated the country‚Äôs ‚Äúprincipled stance‚Äù, warning that any misadventure or attempts to undermine national sovereignty or territorial integrity would be met with a ‚Äúswift and resolute response‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAny attempt to target our population centres, military bases, economic hubs and ports will instantly invoke a ‚Äòdeeply hurting and more than reciprocal response‚Äô. The onus of escalation will squarely lie on the strategically blind arrogant aggressor who fails to see the grave repercussions of such provocative actions against a sovereign nuclear state,‚Äù the statement quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWars are not won through media rhetoric, imported fancy hardware, or political sloganeering, but through faith, professional competence, operational clarity, institutional strength and national resolve,‚Äù the army chief concluded.</p>
<p>He lauded the armed forces and urged the graduating officers to remain steadfast in the values of integrity, selfless service, and unwavering commitment to the nation, the statement added.</p></p>

                <h2>Sweden to resume visa services in Pakistan: FO</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Monday announced that Sweden has resumed visa services in Islamabad and Pakistani nationals will be able to apply for a Schengen visa from today onwards</p>
<p>Sweden in April 2023 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1747335">indefinitely closed</a> its embassy in Islamabad, citing the security situation as the reason. As a result, the Migration Section was unable to handle requests, nor could any documents be sent to consulates, Gerry¬¥s, or applicants‚Äô addresses.  ‚ÄúWe understand that this will cause inconvenience; however, the safety of our applicants and staff members are of highest priority,‚Äù a notice placed on the embassy‚Äôs website had read at the time.</p>
<p>The embassy reopened in April this year, according to its <a class="link--external" href="https://www.swedenabroad.se/en/embassies/pakistan-islamabad/current/news/reopening-info-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>According to the FO, the Swedish and Pakistani foreign ministries held bilateral consultations in Stockholm on July 2, where the decision to resume visa services was announced by the Swedish side.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEffective July 7, 2025, Pakistani nationals can apply for a Schengen visa from within Pakistan for visits to Sweden of up to 90 days,‚Äù the FO said.</p>

<p>It welcomed the positive development, saying it ‚Äúreflects the strengthening of bilateral relations between the two countries‚Äù.</p>
<p>The FO added that the Pakistani delegation to the bilateral consultations in Stockholm was led by the additional foreign secretary (Europe), while the Swedish side was led by the director general for global affairs from the Swedish foreign ministry.</p></p>
