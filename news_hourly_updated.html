                <h2>Punjab Assembly speaker bins pleas for PTI MPAs‚Äô disqualification</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Punjab Assembly speaker says allegations of constitutional violations need to be first proven in ‚Äòcourt or tribunal‚Äô<br />
‚Ä¢ Notices issued to 10 MPAs for payment of damages caused during budget session withdrawn</p>
<p>LAHORE: In a significant step towards de-escalation of political tensions in the Punjab Assembly, PA Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan has formally rejected the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921937">petitions</a> seeking the disqualification of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920792">26 PTI members</a>.</p>
<p>This decision followed successful <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924877/punjab-assembly-talks-progress-but-pti-stands-firm-on-suspensions">negotiations</a> between the government and the opposition, and is expected to pave the way for the swift reinstatement of these suspended lawmakers.</p>
<p>The ruling comes after weeks of parliamentary deadlock, which saw the opposition members <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920792">suspended</a> for ‚Äúdisorderly conduct‚Äù during the budget session on June 27. The suspension for 15 sittings was a direct response to protests that disrupted Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920664">speech</a> and involved the use of ‚Äúoffensive, abusive, and unparliamentary language and slogans‚Äù, as well as alleged physical altercations.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In his detailed written decision, the speaker firmly rejected the petitions. He underscored that the speaker‚Äôs role was not merely to act as a ‚Äúpostman‚Äù by forwarding such requests to the Election Commission. He cautioned that such an unscrutinised process could ‚Äúweaken the constitutional framework‚Äù and ‚Äúcurtail freedom of expression‚Äù within the provincial assembly.</p>
<p>He clarified that while disruptive behaviour in parliaments worldwide often faced stringent measures, the serious allegations of legal and constitutional violations, including those related to oaths, must first be proven in a competent court or tribunal. He asserted that only after a judicial verdict would he be in a position to determine if disqualification under Article 63(2) of the Constitution was warranted, and if the matter should be subsequently referred to the Election Commission.</p>
<p>Four separate applications had been submitted demanding the disqualification of these members, with petitioners citing precedents like the Panama Papers case involving then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif and alleging violations of the speaker‚Äôs ruling and constitutional oaths. However, the speaker dismissed the disqualification requests that referenced the Panama case and similar decisions made under Articles 199 and 184-3 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>He stated that the petitioners retained the option to approach his office again, but only after securing a definitive decision from a competent court. The speaker also decided to withdraw the notices issued to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920792/26-opposition-mpas-barred-from-punjab-assembly-for-15-sittings-over-disorderly-conduct#:~:text=10%20MPAs%20fined%20for%20%E2%80%98vandalism%E2%80%99">10 PTI MPAs for payment of damages</a> caused to the furniture and other assets of the house during the June 27 session. The opposition members obstructed the proceedings of the house on June 27 by tearing agenda papers, hurling them at the treasury, using extreme derogatory language and physically impeding members who approached the treasury benches, according to the ruling, which shared the background of the petitions.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>It was learnt that the policy of removing opposition members from the chairmanship of 13 standing committees was also being reversed, and the four chairpersons already removed from their offices through no-trust votes would also be reinstated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the opposition has intensified its pressure tactics, holding a ‚Äòpublic assembly‚Äô on the road outside the Punjab Assembly. During this ‚Äòoutdoor session‚Äô, the opposition leaders, like Ahmad Khan Bhachar, criticised the government‚Äôs handling of recent floods, soaring prices of essential commodities like sugar and petrol, and alleged political victimisation.</p>
<p>Mr Bhachar reiterated that the opposition would not return to the assembly until their suspended members were reinstated. He also presented a resolution condemning the government‚Äôs actions, which was passed by the ‚Äòoutdoor assembly‚Äô. According to political analysts, the decision by the speaker stressed the importance of due process and constitutional principles in parliamentary affairs and aimed to foster a more functional and less volatile political environment in Punjab.</p>
<p>While the government and opposition have agreed on activating the Advisory and Ethics Committees and avoiding indecent language in future sessions, the full reinstatement of the 26 members is now the immediate next step in restoring full parliamentary cooperation.</p>

                <h2>Religious affairs minister retracts 40,000 ‚Äòmissing‚Äô pilgrims remark</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousuf on Saturday walked back a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.geo.tv/latest/614220-40000-pakistani-zaireen-did-not-return-from-iraq-syria-and-iran-in-recent-years" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> that 40,000 religious pilgrims were missing, clarifying that the figure stemmed from a ‚Äúmisunderstanding‚Äù of outdated paper records that have not yet been fully digitised.</p>
<p>He told reporters that approximately 40,000 pilgrims‚Äô records remain in paper form and have not been transferred to the digital registry system.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was never said that thousands of Pakistanis are missing,‚Äù Mr Yousuf said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe records of around 40,000 pilgrims were previously maintained in paper form and have not yet been fully transferred to the central digital registry.‚Äù</p>
<p>The initial report, which said tens of thousands of pilgrims (zaireen) had not returned from trips to Iran and Iraq, was first floated by the minister himself as he announced a travel system overhaul.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>To prevent future errors and enhance security, the Ministry of Religious Affairs launched a modern online registration system for all pilgrims travelling to Iran, Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p>The move is also aimed at curbing instances where individuals use the pilgrimage as a cover to migrate illegally to Europe through Turkiye.</p>
<p>Under the new system, tour operators must be officially registered, a practice similar to the one implemented by Saudi Arabia for Umrah pilgrimages.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUnder the new system, every pilgrim and group organiser will be issued a QR code for easy identification and coordination,‚Äù Mr Yousuf said.</p>
<p>He added that the government will now share complete pilgrim lists with authorities in Iran, Iraq and Syria ahead of travel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis proactive step will eliminate the possibility of any misunderstanding or propaganda regarding the movement of Pakistani pilgrims,‚Äù the minister said.</p>
