            <p><p>A high-level delegation led by PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has stressed the need for dialogue with India in a series of meetings with US Congress members in Washington, state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/05-06-2025/multiparty-delegation-holds-series-of-meetings-with-us-congressmen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Pakis­tan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">launched</a> a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence there. As part of its global outreach, the team will also visit London and Brussels.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow">delegation</a> comprises former foreign ministers Bilawal, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.</p>
<p>During Wednesday’s discussions at Capitol Hill, the delegation underscored the urgency of dialogue on the Kashmir issue, noting it was an “unfinished agenda of the United Nations”.</p>
<p>It stressed the imperative of respect for international law, UN Security Council resolutions and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), <em>Radio Pakistan</em> added.</p>
<p>Bilawal emphasised that sustainable peace in South Asia hinged on dialogue, restraint and a just resolution of the Kashmir dispute, rather than “unilateralism or intimidation”.</p>
<p>He briefed members of Congress on India’s recent acts of unprovoked aggression, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910848">targeting of civilians</a>, as well as the “deeply concerning” and unilateral <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">suspension</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>.</p>
<p>Bilawal appreciated the US, particularly “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915520/pakistan-wants-trump-to-arrange-talks-with-india">President Donald Trump</a>, for his constructive role in helping <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">de-escalate tensions</a> and supporting efforts towards a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>”, according to the report.</p>
<p>The delegation reiterated Pakistan’s principled stance on regional peace, counterterrorism efforts and recent Indian aggression, reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment “to peace, responsible conduct, and rejection of baseless allegations”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, members of the Congress welcomed the Pakistani delegation, urging “both countries to demonstrate restraint and prioritise regional peace and stability”, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> stated.</p>
<p>They reiterated the US support for the people of Pakistan and its commitment to aiding the country’s economic progress.</p>
<p>Bilawal took to X earlier today, <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/BBhuttoZardari/status/1930424636124123533" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying</a> he had a “constructive exchange with Senator Chris Van Hollen on Pakistan’s deep concerns over India’s increasingly belligerent posture and its refusal to engage, whether through dialogue, joint investigation, or third-party facilitation”.</p>

<p>He also met with Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove, Ranking Member of the House Subcommittee on South and Central Asia, “for a frank discussion on peace and stability in our region”.</p>
<p>“Shared Pakistan’s concerns over the new abnormal imposed by Mr. Modi, where every incident by nameless actors triggers unprovoked aggression, risking war between two nuclear-armed neighbours,” Bilawal <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/BBhuttoZardari/status/1930425560074711461" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X.</p>
<p>Bilawal further <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/BBhuttoZardari/status/1930438391453397234" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">met with</a> Senator Jim Banks for a “candid discussion” on regional peace and security […] and appreciated the “critical peacemaker role played by President Trump in facilitating the ceasefire understanding, intended as a pathway to broader, sustained peace and dialogue”.</p>
<p>“Reiterated that there is no military solution to our challenges. Only diplomacy and dialogue can deliver lasting peace in South Asia,” the ex-foreign minister added.</p>

<p>A day ago, the delegation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915359/bilawal-led-delegation-reaches-washington-after-wrapping-up-ny-visit">concluded</a> its two-day visit to the United Nations Headquarters in New York, where it met with UN Secretary General <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915162#:~:text=The%20delegation%20separately%20met%20UN%20Secretary%20General%20Antonio%20Guterres">Antonio Guterres</a>, along with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914959">elected</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915162#:~:text=envoys%20of%20the%20UNSC%E2%80%99s%20permanent%20me%C2%ADm%C2%ADbers">permanent</a> members of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>Another delegation, led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi, visited Moscow from June 2 to June 4.

<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915520/pakistan-wants-trump-to-arrange-talks-with-india">said</a> the recent four-day conflict had revealed the “Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909771/dg-ispr-says-india-has-no-evidence-for-pahalgam-incident-or-alleged-attacks-in-last-48-hours">incident</a> was a false-flag operation”, and credited Trump for playing a decisive role in ensuring a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>Addressing an event at the US Embassy in Islamabad marking the 249th anniversary of American independence, the premier said Trump had shown beyond any doubt that “he is a man for peace … and beneficial business deals”.</p>
<p>He added, “President Trump is a man against escalation and a man against cold and hot war.”</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz said Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">downed</a> six Indian fighter jets in self-defence after Indian aggression on May 6-7 resulted in the deaths of 33 Pakistani civilians.</p>
<p>“We responded with restraint and patience,” he said. “Our offer for an impartial international probe into the Pahalgam incident was met with aggression instead.”</p>
<p>He said that India “should have come out with solid evidence and convinced the world about the occurrence of the incident”.</p></p>

            <p><p>Muslim pilgrims prayed atop Mount Arafat on Thursday during the high point of the annual Haj pilgrimage, as Saudi officials called on participants to refrain from being outside during the hottest hours of the day.</p>
<p>Thousands of pilgrims began to gather before dawn around the hill and the surrounding plain where Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is believed to have given his last sermon.</p>
<p>While some arrived early to take advantage of the relatively cool morning, carrying colourful umbrellas, many pilgrims will remain for hours of prayers and Holy Quran recitals until the evening in the most arduous portion of Haj.</p>

<p>After sunset, they will head to Muzdalifah, halfway between Arafat and the sprawling tent city of Mina, where they will gather pebbles so they can perform the symbolic “stoning of the devil”.</p>
<p>“This is something that I used to see every year on the TV screen during Haj and I always thought: ‘I wish I could be here’,” said 33-year-old Ali from Pakistan, one of 1.5 million pilgrims who had arrived in Saudi Arabia for the pilgrimage.</p>
<p>“I’ve been trying to get here… for the past 3 years,” he added as he gazed at the mount. “I feel very blessed.”</p>
<p>Hundreds of pilgrims dressed in white dotted the mount itself, with many more at its foot praying or taking pictures.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Saudi authorities called on pilgrims to stay inside their tents between 10am and 4pm (12pm and 6pm PKT) and on Thursday, when the desert sun is at its harshest.</p>
<p>Fans spraying mist and providing cool air were dispersed at the foot of the mount.</p>

<p>Temperatures this year have already exceeded 40 degrees Celsius as one of the world’s largest annual religious gatherings, bringing together devotees from around the globe, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915010">kicked off</a> earlier this week.</p>
<p>Officials have beefed up heat mitigation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915198/saudi-readies-for-worst-case-scenario-in-sweltering-haj">efforts</a>, aiming to avoid a repeat of last year’s Haj, which saw 1,301 pilgrims <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1840835">die</a> as temperatures reached 51.8C.</p>
<p>“I came here early to [avoid] the sun and later I will pray inside my tent,” said 54-year-old Adel Ismail, from Syria.</p>
<p>To make this year’s pilgrimage safer, authorities have expanded infrastructure, deployed thousands of extra personnel and relied on an arsenal of high-tech tools to help better manage crowds.</p>
<p>Authorities have mobilised more than 40 government agencies and 250,000 officials, doubling their efforts against heat-related illness following the lethal heatwave of 2024.</p>
<p>Shaded areas have been expanded by 50,000 square metres, thousands more medics will be on standby, and more than 400 cooling units will be deployed, the Haj minister has told <em>AFP.</em></p>

<p>Through tears of joy, Iman Abdel Khaleq said she had wanted to perform Haj for 10 years and was overwhelmed with emotion as she arrived at Arafat.</p>
<p>“It’s a big dream for me that I had almost given up hope of realising,” the woman in her fifties told <em>AFP</em> from the foot of the mount.</p>
<p>Authorities said a majority of the deaths in 2024 were among unregistered pilgrims who lacked access to amenities like air-conditioned tents and buses.</p>
<p>This year, they have also cracked down on unregistered pilgrims looking to sneak into Makkah, relying on frequent raids, drone surveillance and a barrage of text alerts.</p>
<p>Haj permits are allocated to countries on a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870331">quota</a> basis and distributed to individuals by a lottery.</p>
<p>But even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs prompt many to attempt Haj without a permit, even though they risk arrest and deportation if caught.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia earns billions of dollars a year from Haj, and Umrah, which is undertaken at other times of the year.</p></p>

            <p><p>US President Donald Trump signed a new travel ban on Wednesday targeting 12 countries — including Afghanistan, Iran and Yemen — reviving one of the most <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1311483">controversial measures</a> from his first term.</p>
<p>Trump said the measure was spurred by a makeshift <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914996">flamethrower attack</a> on a Jewish protest in Colorado that US authorities blamed on a man they said was in the country illegally.</p>
<p>The move bans all travel to the United States by nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Trump also imposed a partial ban on travellers from seven countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Some temporary work visas from these countries will be allowed.</p>
<p>The bans go into effect on Monday, the White House said.</p>
<p>“The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted,” Trump said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1930412786271547485" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video message</a> from the Oval Office posted on X.</p>

<p>The ban will, however, not apply to athletes competing in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909271">2026 World Cup</a>, which the US is co-hosting with Canada and Mexico, as well as the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, <a class="link--external" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/restricting-the-entry-of-foreign-nationals-to-protect-the-united-states-from-foreign-terrorists-and-other-national-security-and-public-safety-threats/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump’s order</a> said.</p>
<p>Trump separately on Wednesday announced a ban on visas for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913788">foreign students</a> who are set to begin attending Harvard University, ramping up his crackdown on what he regards as a bastion of liberalism.</p>
<p>The US leader compared the new measures to the “powerful” ban he imposed on a number of mainly Muslim countries in his first term, which caused travel disruption across the world.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Trump said that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1360820">2017 ban</a> had stopped the US from suffering terror attacks that happened in Europe.</p>
<p>“We will not let what happened in Europe happen in America,” Trump said.
“We cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen.”</p>
<p>Venezuela hit back by warning that the United States itself was a dangerous destination.</p>
<p>“Being in the United States is a great risk for anyone, not just for Venezuelans,” Venezuela’s Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said after the announcement, warning citizens against travel there.</p>
<p>Trump’s new travel ban could, however, face legal challenges, as have many of the drastic measures he has taken in his whirlwind return to office.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#terrorists" id="terrorists" title="Permalink"></a>‘Terrorists’</h2>
<p>The White House unveiled the new ban with virtually no warning, minutes after Trump had addressed some 3,000 political appointees from his balcony at a celebratory “summer soiree”.</p>
<p>Trump also made the announcement with no reporters present, an unusual move after sharing many of his most headline-grabbing policy announcements at signing ceremonies in the Oval Office.</p>
<p>But rumours of a new Trump travel ban had circulated following the attack in Colorado, with his administration vowing to pursue “terrorists” living in the US on visas.</p>

<p>Suspect Mohammed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national according to court documents, is alleged to have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914996">thrown fire bombs</a> and sprayed burning gasoline at a group of people who had gathered on Sunday in support of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.</p>

<p>“President Trump is fulfilling his promise to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors that want to come to our country and cause us harm,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ATJackson47/status/1930408784712646949" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on X</a>.</p>

<p>Trump’s proclamation gave specific reasons for each country in his proclamation, which says it is aimed at protecting the United States from “foreign terrorists and other national security” threats.</p>
<p>Notably, Egypt was not on the list of countries facing travel restrictions.</p>
<p>For Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and war-torn Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen, it said they lacked “competent” central authorities for processing passports and vetting.</p>
<p>Iran, with which the United States is in negotiations on a possible nuclear deal, was included as it is a “state sponsor of terrorism”, the order said.</p>
<p>“The impact of the ban will once again be felt by Americans who were denied the ability to see their loved ones at weddings, funerals, or the birth of a child,” said National Iranian American Council president Jamal Abdi.</p>
<p>For most of the other countries, Trump’s order cited an above-average likelihood that people would overstay their visas.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#trump-administration-ramps-up-attack-on-harvard-columbia" id="trump-administration-ramps-up-attack-on-harvard-columbia" title="Permalink"></a>Trump administration ramps up attack on Harvard, Columbia</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Trump ramped up his campaign against top US universities on Wednesday, banning visas for all foreign students coming to attend Harvard and threatening to strip Columbia of its academic accreditation.</p>
<p>Trump is seeking to bring the universities to heel with claims that their international students pose a national security threat, that they ignored anti-Semitism on campus, and perpetuate liberal bias.</p>
<p>A proclamation issued by the White House late on Wednesday declared that the entrance of international students to begin a course at Harvard would be “suspended and limited” for six months, and that existing overseas enrollees could have their visas terminated.</p>
<p>“Harvard’s conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers,” said the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/enhancing-national-security-by-addressing-risks-at-harvard-university/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">order</a>.</p>
<p>“I’m trembling. This is outrageous,” Karl Molden, a Harvard government and classics student from Austria, told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>“He is abusing his executive power to harm Harvard as much as he can.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>“My god!” said another international student at Harvard, who declined to be named for fear of retribution, on learning of the executive order.</p>
<p>“This is such a disgrace.”</p>
<p>The announcement came after the Trump administration’s earlier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912645">efforts to terminate</a> Harvard’s right to enrol and host foreign students were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913242">stalled</a> by a judge.</p>
<p>The government has already cut around $3.2 billion of federal grants and contracts benefiting Harvard and pledged to exclude the Cambridge, Massachusetts institution from any future federal funding.</p>
<p>Trump has also singled out international students at Harvard, who in the 2024-2025 academic year accounted for 27 per cent of total enrollment, and a major source of income.</p>
<p>“This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights,” a university spokesman said.
“Harvard will continue to protect its international students.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The latest sweeping action against Harvard came as Trump’s education secretary threatened on Wednesday to strip Columbia University of its accreditation.</p>
<p>The Republican has targeted the New York Ivy League institution for allegedly ignoring harassment of Jewish students, throwing all of its federal funding into doubt.</p>
<p>Unlike Harvard, several top institutions — including Columbia — have already <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899575">bowed to far-reaching demands</a> from the Trump administration, which claims that the educational elite is too left-wing.</p>
<p>But Wednesday’s official action suggested it was not enough for Trump.
“Columbia University looked the other way as Jewish students faced harassment,” US Education Secretary Linda McMahon <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/EDSecMcMahon/status/1930358299205025803" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on X</a>.</p>

<p>She accused the school of breaking rules prohibiting recipients of federal funding from discriminating on the basis of race, colour, or national origin.</p>
<p>In the statement, the US Education Department said its civil rights office had contacted Columbia’s accreditation body about the alleged violation.</p>
<p>Withdrawing Columbia’s accreditation would see it lose access to all federal funding — a very significant proportion of the university’s income. Students attending the university would also not be able to receive federal grants and loans towards tuition.</p>
<p>Critics accuse the Trump administration of using allegations of anti-Semitism to target educational elites and bring universities to their knees.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The administration has already put $400 million of Columbia’s funding under review, prompting the university in March to announce a package of concessions to the government around defining anti-Semitism, policing protests and conducting oversight for specific academic departments.</p>
<p>Following Wednesday’s announcement, a Columbia spokesperson said the university is “aware of the concerns” raised by the government with its accreditation body.</p>
<p>“We have addressed those concerns directly with Middle States,” the spokesperson said, adding that “Columbia is deeply committed to combating anti-Semitism on our campus”. “We take this issue seriously and are continuing to work with the federal government to address it. “</p></p>
