                <h2>Enduring Pak-China partnership to keep playing pivotal role in regional stability: COAS</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Friday stressed that the ‚Äúenduring partnership‚Äù between Pakistan and China will continue to play a pivotal role in regional stability.</p>
<p>Pakistan and China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/china-says-it-backs-pakistan-in-defending-sovereignty">share</a> a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors ‚Äî including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure ‚Äî with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884628">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.</p>
<p>The army chief made the remarks at the 98th anniversary of the founding of the People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) of China, which was commemorated at General Headquarters in Rawalpindi today, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7374" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> by the military‚Äôs media affairs wing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe emphasised that their enduring partnership will continue to play a pivotal role in promoting regional stability and safeguarding shared strategic interests,‚Äù said the statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).</p>
<p>China‚Äôs Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong graced the occasion as the chief guest, while Defence Attach√© Major General Wang Zhong, Chinese Embassy officials and senior military officers from the Pakistani tri-services were also present.</p>
<p>COAS Munir extended a warm welcome to the Chinese guests and congratulated the PLA on its 98th founding anniversary, lauding the army‚Äôs ‚Äúpivotal role in China‚Äôs defence, security and nation-building‚Äù, the ISPR said.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The army chief emphasised that ‚Äúdespite shifting strategic dynamics, the friendship between the two nations has remained steadfast and unshakable‚Äù, according to the press release.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe COAS underscored the strength and strategic significance of Pakistan-China relations, emphasising that the bond between the two nations is unique, time-tested, and exceptionally resilient amid evolving regional and global challenges.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Field Marshal highlighted that the Pakistan-China strategic relationship exemplifies mutual trust, unwavering support, and shared commitment,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>Concluding his address, COAS Munir ‚Äúreaffirmed that the Pakistan Army and the PLA are true brothers-in-arms‚Äù, the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>Addressing the gathering, Ambassador Zaidong expressed his sincere gratitude to the army chief for hosting the event commemorating the PLA‚Äôs 98th anniversary.</p>
<p>He acknowledged the steadfast role of the armed forces in the ‚Äúfight against terrorism and reaffirmed China‚Äôs unwavering support for and commitment to its strategic partnership with Pakistan‚Äù, according to the ISPR.</p>

<p>Today‚Äôs renewed affirmation of the strong bilateral ties comes just a week after COAS Munir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926523/chinese-leadership-lauds-pakistans-role-in-regional-peace-during-meeting-with-coas-munir">paid an official visit</a> to China, where he met with Vice President Han Zheng and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.</p>
<p>During the visit, the Chinese leadership hailed the Pakistan Army as a ‚Äúcornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor‚Äù for peace in the region.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924658">reaffirmed</a> their commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation and promoting regional peace, stability, and development.</p>

                <h2>Senior lawyer gunned down in Karachi‚Äôs DHA: police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A senior lawyer was shot dead while his son was hurt in a suspected targeted attack in Karachi‚Äôs Defence Housing Authority on Friday afternoon, according to police.</p>
<p>South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the firing took place after a funeral prayer at a mosque in DHA.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs advocate Khawaja Shamsul Islam and his son came out of the mosque, a lone gunman apparently resorted to firing on them and fled,‚Äù the DIG said. ‚ÄúBoth father and son were shot and transported to a private hospital in Clifton, where Islam succumbed to his injuries.‚Äù</p>
<p>The DIG added that during the preliminary investigation, it transpired that a complainant nominated the slain advocate in a murder case, while in a later incident, Islam sustained injuries in Clifton.</p>
<p>Elaborating on the cases, DIG Raza recalled that in 2021, the complainant filed a first information report (FIR) with Boat Basin police against six to seven unidentified suspects for allegedly killing his father.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe complainant also attempted to nominate Khawaja Shamsul Islam, but he failed to provide evidence. Thus, the case was disposed of as ‚ÄòA‚Äô Class (untraced) by Investigation DSP Clifton division Jahanzaib Khan,‚Äù the DIG told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>Regarding the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1872404">second incident</a>, which occurred in 2024, the DIG said that the complainant, another advocate, filed an FIR alleging that while heading for Isha prayers with Khawaja Shamsul Islam in Zamzama neighbourhood of Karachi, they were ‚Äúambushed by the complainant in the first case along with 15-20 armed accomplices‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe attackers used firearms, iron rods and sticks, injuring Khawaja Shamsul Islam,‚Äù he alleged, adding that the attackers had gathered outside the mosque.</p>
<p>DIG Raza pointed out that a preliminary investigation of last year‚Äôs attack was conducted by Inspector Maqbool Meher and some suspects were also arrested by the police. However, the case was later transferred to the Special Investigation Unit (SIU)/Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Karachi as an ‚Äúextortion matter‚Äù.</p>
<p>In April this year, a judge and a lawyer were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904465">shot dead</a> in an armed attack on the motorway in Nowshera district.</p>
<p>Nowshera Deputy Commissioner Irfanullah Mehsud told <em>Dawn.com</em> that one of the slain, Mohammad Hayat, was working as a civil judge in Mardan and belonged to the Swat district.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe other person was identified as Khalid Khan, a lawyer, belonging to Rustam area of Mardan, who was accompanying the judge.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mehsud said that they died on the spot and the bodies were moved to Qazi Hussain Ahmed Medical Complex.</p></p>
