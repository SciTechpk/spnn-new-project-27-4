            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913238/govt-allocates-2000mw-for-bitcoin-mining-and-ai-data-centres' target='_blank'><strong>Govt allocates 2,000MW for Bitcoin mining and AI data centres</strong></a>
            <p><p>In a groundbreaking move to transform Pakistan into a global leader in digital innovation, the government has announced the allocation of 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the first phase of a national initiative to power Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.</p>
<p>The government recently decided to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899163">legalise</a> cryptocurrency to lure international investment in Pakistan. The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) was launched in March to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912539/govt-sets-up-digital-assets-authority-as-per-fatf-requirement">digital assets</a>” into the country’s financial landscape.</p>
<p>The federal government appointed entrepreneur <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895975">Bilal Bin Saqib</a> as the chief adviser to the finance minister on the council.</p>
<p>A statement by the Finance Division says this ambitious initiative is spearheaded by the PCC — a government-backed body under the Ministry of Finance — as part of a broader strategy to “monetise surplus electricity, create high-tech jobs, attract billions of dollars in foreign direct investment, and generate billions of dollars for the government”.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb stated that this strategic allocation marks a pivotal moment in Pakistan’s digital transformation journey, unlocking economic potential by turning excess energy into innovation, investment, and international revenue.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is uniquely positioned — both geographically and economically — to become a global hub for data centres. As a digital bridge between Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, Pakistan offers the most strategic location in the world for data flow and digital infrastructure,” the statement says.</p>
<p>It said that since the inception of the PCC, there has been tremendous interest from global Bitcoin miners and data infrastructure companies. Several international firms have already visited the country for exploratory discussions, and following this landmark announcement, more global players are expected to visit in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>“Pakistan’s underutilised power generation capacity is now being repurposed into a high-value digital asset. AI data centres and Bitcoin mining operations, known for their consistent and heavy energy usage, provide an ideal use case for this surplus.</p>
<p>“Redirecting idle energy, especially from plants operating below capacity, allows Pakistan to convert a long-standing financial liability into a sustainable, revenue-generating opportunity,” the statement added.</p>
<p>PCC CEO Bilal Bin Saqib emphasised the transformative nature of this initiative and explained that with proper regulation, transparency, and international collaboration, Pakistan can become a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1609742">global crypto</a> and AI powerhouse.</p>
<p>Saqib said that this energy-backed digital transformation not only unlocks high-value investment but enables the government to generate foreign exchange in US dollars through Bitcoin mining.</p>
<p>Additionally, as regulations evolve, Pakistan can accumulate Bitcoin directly into a national wallet — marking a monumental shift from selling power in Pakistani rupees to leveraging digital assets for economic stability.</p>
<p>By offering stable and affordable energy, the statement said Pakistan presents a highly competitive environment compared to regional counterparts like India and Singapore, where rising power costs and land scarcity limit scalability.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s strategic advantage is further underscored by the global context as while AI data centre demand has soared to over 100 gigawatts (GW), the global supply remains around 15GW. This massive shortfall creates an unprecedented opportunity for countries like Pakistan with surplus power, land and an emerging regulatory framework, it added.</p>
<p>The statement further said the country’s digital connectivity has also been significantly strengthened by the landing of the world’s largest submarine internet cable. The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893743">Africa-2 Cable Project</a>, a 45,000-kilometre global network connecting 33 countries through 46 landing stations, has now landed in Pakistan.</p>
<p>This milestone enhances Pakistan’s internet bandwidth, latency and resilience through redundant fiber routes — key for ensuring high availability and operational continuity for AI data centres.</p>
<p>With more than 40 million crypto users, Pakistan holds immense potential as a regional leader in digital services. Establishing local AI data centres will not only address growing concerns around data sovereignty but will also enhance cybersecurity, improve digital service delivery, and empower national capabilities in AI and cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>These centres are expected to create thousands of direct and indirect jobs, catalysing the development of a skilled workforce in engineering, IT, and data sciences.</p>
<p>The statement adds that this announcement marks only the first phase of a broader, multi-stage digital infrastructure rollout. Future developments are expected to include renewable energy-powered facilities — leveraging Pakistan’s immense <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1861999">wind</a> (50,000MW potential in the Gharo-Keti Bandar corridor), solar, and hydropower resources — as well as strategic international partnerships with leading blockchain and AI companies, and the establishment of fintech and innovation hubs.</p>
<p>These efforts will be complemented by proposed incentives such as tax holidays, customs duty exemptions on equipment, and reduced taxes for AI infrastructure developers, it added.</p>
<p>“Pakistan’s combination of surplus power, geographic advantage, advanced subsea cable connectivity, renewable energy potential, and a large, digitally engaged population creates a compelling case for becoming a regional epicentre of Web3, AI, and digital innovation.</p>
<p>“With the right incentives, strategic investments, and collaborative partnerships, Pakistan is positioning itself not only as a destination for global digital infrastructure but also as a sovereign economy that can accumulate digital assets, export digital services, and lead in the next generation of technological transformation.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif departed for Turkiye from Lahore on Sunday afternoon as he embarked on the first leg of his four-nation tour aimed at strengthening ties with the friendly countries.</p>
<p>The premier will visit Turkiye, Iran, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan from May 25-30, according to the <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/curtain-raiser-prime-ministers-visit-to-turkiye-iran-azerbaijan-and-tajikistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Foreign Office</a>. The tour follows diplomatic support voiced by three of these countries for Pakistan during the recent military confrontation with India.</p>
<p>The prime minister is accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi, state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/25-05-2025/pm-leaves-for-turkiye-on-first-leg-of-four-nation-tour" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> reported.</p>

<p>During the visit, PM Shehbaz will have “wide-ranging discussions with the leaders of these countries on an entire range of issues covering bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance”, according to the FO.</p>
<p>“He will also have the opportunity to express the deepest appreciation and acknowledgement for the support extended to Pakistan by the friendly countries during the recent crisis with India,” it noted.</p>
<p>Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan will hold talks with PM Shehbaz in Istanbul later today, <em>Reuters</em> reported, citing Erdogan’s head of communications.</p>
<p>“During the meeting, bilateral relations, regional and international issues, including the fight against terrorism, will be discussed,” Fahrettin Altun <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/fahrettinaltun/status/1926561438107107658" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on X</a>.</p>
<p>Altun said “various aspects of bilateral relations between Turkiye and Pakistan will be evaluated”, according to a Google translation of his post.</p>
<p>Joint steps taken within the scope of the Pakistan-Turkiye High Level Strategic Cooperation Council as per the two leaders’ <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891812">last meeting</a> in February will be reviewed, the Turkish official said.</p>
<p>While in Tajikistan — likely the last leg of his tour — the premier will also attend the International Conference on Glaciers being held in its capital, Dushanbe, on May 29 and 30.</p>
<p>As tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi escalated, with India launching deadly strikes on Pakistan on May 6, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909193/erdogan-conveys-turkiyes-solidarity-to-pm-shehbaz-amid-india-escalation">conveyed his solidarity</a> to the prime minister and said it supported Pakistan’s “calm and restrained policies”.</p>
<p>Following the tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">airbase attacks</a> and a US-brokered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> between the two neighbours, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev had “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911194/azerbaijan-hails-pakistans-remarkable-success-during-recent-military-strife-with-india-pmo">warmly congratulated</a> PM Shehbaz upon Pakistan’s remarkable success”, according to the PM Office.</p>
<p>Iran had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">offered to mediate</a> during the escalation and paid a visit to both <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">Islamabad</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909355/irans-foreign-minister-repeats-call-for-restraint-in-india-pakistan-standoff">New Delhi</a> in peace efforts, which were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911597">appreciated</a> by PM Shehbaz and the military’s spokesperson.</p>

<p>The diplomatic support voiced by Turkiye and Azerbaijan stoked anger in India as people <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cancelled their holidays</a> in popular resorts in the two countries.</p>
<p>The moves <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911469">intensified</a> as Adani group-operated Mumbai and Ahmedabad airports ended the ground handling concession agreements with Çelebi, an Istanbul-headquartered airport.</p>
<p>Small Indian grocery shops and major online fashion retailers also began a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912015">boycott of Turkish products</a> ranging from chocolates, coffee, jams and cosmetics to clothing.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz’s tour adds to Pakistan’s spree of diplomatic engagement amid tensions with New Delhi.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Dar held a telephonic conversation with Uzbekistan Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov, where views were “exchanged on current regional situation”.</p>
<p>The two leaders discussed existing bilateral relations, particularly the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894417/pakistan-and-uzbekistan-agree-to-expand-bilateral-trade-to-2bn#:~:text=%E2%80%98Detailed%20negotiations%E2%80%99%20held%20on%20joint%20railway%20project">Railway Line Project</a>, the FO <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1926519844997927089" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>
<p>They expressed the hope that the framework agreement for the regional connectivity project would be finalised soon.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913255/bangladesh-court-begins-first-trial-of-hasina-era-officials' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh court begins first trial of Hasina-era officials</strong></a>
            <p><p>Bangladesh on Sunday began the first trial at a special court prosecuting former senior figures connected to the ousted government of Sheikh Hasina, the chief prosecutor said.</p>
<p>The court in the capital Dhaka accepted a formal charge against eight police officials in connection with the killing of six protesters on August 5 last year, the day Hasina <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245/bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-has-resigned-interim-govt-to-run-country-army-chief">fled the country</a> as the protesters stormed her palace.</p>
<p>The eight men are charged with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1852261">crimes against humanity</a>. Four are in custody and four are being tried in absentia.</p>
<p>“The formal trial has begun,” Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor of Bangladesh’s domestic International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), told reporters. “The prosecution believes that this prosecution will be able to prove the crimes done by the accused.”</p>
<p>It is the first formal charge in any case related to the killings during last year’s student-led uprising, which ended Hasina’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850270">iron-fisted rule</a> of 15 years.</p>
<p>Up to 1,400 people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850079/at-least-43-killed-as-clashes-rock-bangladesh-curfew-imposed.">killed</a> between July and August 2024 when Hasina’s government launched a brutal campaign to silence the protesters, according to the United Nations.</p>
<p>The list of those facing trial includes Dhaka’s former police commissioner, Habibur Rahman, who is among those being tried in absentia.</p>
<p>Hasina also fled by helicopter to India, her old ally. She remains in self-imposed exile, defying Dhaka’s extradition request to face charges of crimes against humanity.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#command-responsibility" id="command-responsibility" title="Permalink"></a>‘Command responsibility’</h2>
<p>The launch of the trials of senior figures from Hasina’s government is a key demand of several of the political parties now jostling for power as the South Asian nation awaits <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912727/bangladesh-army-chief-calls-for-elections-by-december">elections</a> that the interim government has vowed will take place before June 2026.</p>
<p>Islam said the eight men were accused of “different responsibilities”, including the most senior for “superior command responsibility, some for direct orders … [and] some for participation”.</p>
<p>He said he was confident of a successful prosecution.</p>
<p>“We have submitted as much evidence as required to prove crimes against humanity, both at a national and an international standard,” he said.</p>
<p>Among that evidence, he said, was video footage of the violence, as well as voice recordings of Hasina in “conversations with different people where she ordered the killing of the protesters using force and lethal weapons”.</p>
<p>The ICT was set up by Hasina in 2009. It sentenced numerous prominent political opponents to death over the following years and became widely seen as a means for Hasina to eliminate rivals.</p></p>
