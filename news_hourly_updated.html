                <h2>SC dismisses PTI petitions, making party ineligible for reserved seats</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Supreme Court‚Äôs Constitutional Bench on Friday dismissed the petitions filed by the PTI in the reserved seats case, declaring that the party will not be eligible for them in the national and provincial assemblies.</p>
<p>The verdict came as an 11-member bench of the SC, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, resumed the hearing of the reserved seats case today. However, Justice Salahuddin Panhwar recused himself. The bench previously had 13 members, but  Ayesha A. Malik and  Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had declared the applications  [inadmissible][11] and were not part of the subsequent proceedings, with the CB head judge noting they had stepped back voluntarily.</p>
<p>Among the remaining 10 members, the review petitions were accepted by a majority of seven judges, including Justices Aminuddin Khan, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhter Afghan, Shahid Bilal Hassan, Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi. The judges who rejected the petitions today included Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi.</p>
<p>As part of the verdict, the SC upheld the Peshawar High Court‚Äôs March 2024 decision and set aside its own July 2024 ruling. As a result, the PTI‚Äôs petitions were dismissed, rendering the party ineligible for the 39 reserved seats.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor detailed reasons to be recorded later, by majority of seven, all civil review petitions are allowed and the impugned majority judgment dated July 12, 2024, is set aside,‚Äù the short order of today‚Äôs verdict, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, noted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs a consequence thereof, Civil Appeals number 333 of 2024 and 334 of 2024 filed by the SIC are dismissed and the judgment rendered by the Peshawar High Court is restored.‚Äù</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail partly allowed the review petitions and maintained his original order with regard to 39 seats, but reviewed the majority judgment to the extent of the remaining 41 seats.</p>
<p>The court instructed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to examine and consider the nomination and declaration appers, as well as any other relevant documents, of all 80 returned candidates ‚Äúby means of de novo exercise with regard to their affiliation and take appropriate decision in accordance with law and applicable rules for allocation of reserve seats‚Äù.</p>
<p>The ECP has 15 days from receiving the copy of the short order to carry out the court‚Äôs instructions.</p>

<p>Reacting to the verdict in a post on X, the PTI termed the decision ‚Äúthe funeral of constitutional, judicial traditions, and justice.‚Äù</p>

<p>PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Khan said he was disappointed by the ‚Äúinjustice and the violation of the Constitution.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm disappointed. This is a huge injustice. For the PTI, it seems that the shadow of Qazi Faez Esa still lurks in the Supreme Court,‚Äù he said while speaking to <em>Geo News.</em></p>
<p>‚ÄúThe right that has been snatched from us is a huge injustice. The framers of the Constitution could not have imagined that a party would get more seats than it won.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said the PTI deserved to receive 78 reserved seats, including 66 for women and 11 for non-Muslims. ‚ÄúThey belong to the PTI, and it is their right,‚Äù he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Gohar went on to say that the PTI contested elections from across the country and joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) as per the affidavit by the ECP for an independent candidate to join a political party.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is no further legal recourse, but we will protest the decision in the assemblies and all forums against this injustice,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>PTI leader Salman Akram Raja also criticised the verdict in a post on X, stating that the party contested the election and received votes ‚Äúonly because we were contesting under Imran Khan‚Äôs banner‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo deny the existence of PTI is to deny the people their voice,‚Äù he wrote.</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#phc-2024-decision" id="phc-2024-decision" title="Permalink"></a>PHC 2024 decision</h2>
<p>In March 2024, the PHC had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1821427">dismissed</a> the SIC‚Äôs petition challenging the election regulator‚Äôs decision to reject the party allocation of reserved women and minority seats.</p>
<p>In a 4-1 verdict, the electoral watchdog ruled that the SIC was not entitled to claim quota for reserved seats ‚Äúdue to having non-curable legal defects and violation of a mandatory provision of submission of party list for reserved seats, which is the requirement of law‚Äù.</p>
<p>The SIC ‚Äî joined by PTI-backed independents who won the elections sans their electoral symbol ‚Äî had filed the petition through its chairman, Sahibzada Muhammad Hamid Raza, seeking directives of the court for the ECP to allocate reserved seats to the council based on their strength in the national and provincial assemblies.</p>
<p>The commission had also decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the PML-N and the PPP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1819514/pml-n-gets-lucky-as-reserved-seats-doled-out">becoming major beneficiaries</a>. The decision was challenged by the PTI in the top court.</p>
<p>On July 13, the apex court, in a unique majority <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">verdict</a>, declared the PTI eligible to receive reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the national and provincial assemblies, giving it a new lease of life in the legislature by declaring it to be a parliamentary party.</p>
<p>However, the ruling was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1868333">not implemented</a> by the National Assembly, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had raised some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859716">objections</a>. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1846084">PML-N</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847508/ppp-takes-cue-from-pml-n-files-review-petition-on-sc-reserved-seats-verdict">PPP</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850678#:~:text=ECP%20files%20review%20plea">ECP</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#todays-hearing" id="todays-hearing" title="Permalink"></a>Today‚Äôs hearing</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, as the Supreme Court resumed hearing the review petitions in the reserved seats case, Justice Panhwar recused himself from the bench after SIC counsel Hamid Khan raised an objection.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHamid Khan objected to judges who joined the Supreme Court after the 26th Amendment being part of the bench,‚Äù Justice Panhwar said, adding that he himself was among those judges.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPublic trust in the judiciary is crucial,‚Äù he remarked. ‚ÄúIt is important that no party questions the composition of the bench. Given these objections, I cannot remain part of this bench.‚Äù</p>
<p>Hamid responded by saying he appreciated the recusal, prompting a stern exchange. Justice Aminuddin remarked, ‚ÄúThere is no need for appreciation. This is the result of your conduct.‚Äù</p>
<p>Justice Mazahir Ali Akbar Naqvi added, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre listening to you out of respect. Otherwise, we were not bound to do so. Don‚Äôt misuse the opportunity you‚Äôve been given.‚Äù</p>
<p>Following Justice Panhwar‚Äôs withdrawal, SIC‚Äôs counsel raised a fresh objection ‚Äî this time to the constitution of the 10-member bench itself.</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail questioned the legal basis for the objection, asserting that the 10-member bench would continue hearing the case.</p>
<p>When asked to clarify, Hamid stated, ‚ÄúI object to a 12-member bench reviewing the decision of a 13-member bench.‚Äù</p>
<p>Justice Aminuddin dismissed the objection and directed him to proceed with his arguments.</p></p>

                <h2>Bilawal says India ‚Äòlost global credibility‚Äô after Pahalgam attack, military escalation with Pakistan</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Friday said that following the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir and the brief but intense <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military escalation with Pakistan</a> last month, India ‚Äúlost its international credibility due to a lack of transparency and widespread disinformation‚Äù.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Pakis¬≠tan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">launched</a> a broad-based engagement campaign to present its perspective on the conflict with India to the world and counter New Delhi‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">unproven</a> allegations. As part of its global outreach, a delegation led by Bilawal visited the United States, London and Brussels.</p>
<p>Addressing reporters at the National Press Club in Islamabad, the PPP chairman stressed that through spreading false information, both in the media and through diplomatic channels, India stripped itself of credibility.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan gained victory on the narrative front, which is beneficial,‚Äù Bilawal said. ‚ÄúThe whole world saw what the Indian [and] Pakistani media were doing.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúPeople all over the world were reading and accepting Pakistani media reports. The entire world knew that [the Indian] government was already lying, and their media had insinuated that they produced credible journalism,‚Äù the PPP chairman added.</p>
<p>Addressing reporters, he said, ‚ÄúYou showed in these five days that we have an impartial and credible media. Every country has their problems, but the Pakistani media community played the biggest role in the narrative victory during those five days, due to the media community‚Äôs credibility.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thanking the journalist community for their accuracy and reporting, Bilawal added that he was proud of how Gen Z ‚Äî the first generation born into the digital age ‚Äî handled social media during the four-day war.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor politicians, our word is our weapon; every political party handled the narrative the way they could, not just on local forums but internationally as well,‚Äù he stated. ‚ÄúBut even more than that, Pakistani media‚Äôs role was historic, and their credibility was established on an international level during those five days.‚Äù</p>
<p>Speaking further, Bilawal emphasised that India, for the first time, spread disinformation through diplomatic channels, not just through the mass media.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is the first time our neighbour was communicating lies on even diplomatic hotlines to different countries,‚Äù he lamented. ‚ÄúIndia didn‚Äôt show transparency, which is why its credibility suffered.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that it took India a month to accept their missile ‚Äúmight have been neutralised‚Äù, while Pakistan openly confirmed shooting down a number of their aircraft in self-defence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs war was based on lies; that‚Äôs when Pakistan stood with the truth,‚Äù Bilawal stated. ‚ÄúWhen they blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgham attack, we didn‚Äôt deny history. If our PM hadn‚Äôt asked for an impartial investigation on an international level, then India would have been successful in convincing the world that we were behind the Pahalgham attack.‚Äù</p>
<p>Bilawal said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ‚Äútook the right decision at the right time, which is why we could establish credibility‚Äù. The PPP chairman also said that Pakistan‚Äôs own ‚Äúcredibility problem‚Äù was largely resolved through making the media more transparent.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe speak not just for the Pakistani people but for the Indian people, too. We don‚Äôt want hatred to pass down through generations. The new generation will not accept India‚Äôs message of hate.‚Äù</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#military-parity-and-peace" id="military-parity-and-peace" title="Permalink"></a>Military parity and peace</h2>
<p>The PPP chairman noted that during the conflict, Pakistan not only established its credibility on the international stage, but it also highlighted that it is a military power on par with its much larger neighbour.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor Pakistan, it is a big victory that we shot down their missile,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have established military parity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLook at how big a defeat it is for India: as soon as we (the delegation) were leaving America, one of their military officers, under oath to their House, said that Pakistan is a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524">phenomenal partner</a> in the fight against terrorism,‚Äù he added, referring to US Central Command chief Army General Michael Kurilla. ‚ÄúThis is their strategic partner saying this.‚Äù</p>
<p>The PPP chief also highlighted that following the operation, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918898">invited</a> to the White House for lunch, hailing it as a ‚Äúmajor achievement‚Äù.</p>
<p>Stating that Pakistan wants to resolve issues through dialogue and under the framework of international law, Bilawal accused India of pursuing a more warlike agenda, through steps such as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988">Operation Sindoor</a> and the suspension of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">Indus Waters Treaty</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs case is that Pakistan is ‚ÄòTerroristan‚Äô, that they will stop our water and kill us through thirst,‚Äù the PPP chairman said. ‚ÄúThey conspired to label Pakistan as a terrorist state. We foiled that conspiracy. We got Pakistan off the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1716183">FATF</a> (Financial Action Task Force) grey list and onto the white list. India failed on every front.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA ceasefire between Pakistan and India means dialogue should follow,‚Äù he maintained. ‚ÄúIn principle, India should engage in dialogue. The Indian prime minister told Pakistan‚Äôs youth, ‚Äòeat bread or face bullets‚Äô.‚Äù</p>
<p>Bilawal maintained that Pakistan was a nation that wants peace and operates with a ‚Äúpeace through strength‚Äù policy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe want peace between both countries,‚Äù Bilawal said. ‚ÄúPrincipally, that is what India should do, but India now calls this ceasefire a ‚Äòpause‚Äô. He (Indian PM Narendra Modi) is not a peacemaker but a warmonger.</p>
<p>‚ÄúModi was once the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1726575/fm-bilawal-responds-forcefully-to-indian-terror-allegations">Butcher of Gujarat</a>, then the butcher of Kashmir, and now he wants to become the butcher of the Indus Valley Civilisation,‚Äù Bilawal warned, although he expressed hope that the US was ‚Äútrying to fulfil the promise they made to us and to maintain peace‚Äù.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#nuclear-thresholds" id="nuclear-thresholds" title="Permalink"></a>Nuclear thresholds</h2>
<p>Speaking about the Kashmir issue, Bilawal highlighted that the dispute had become internationalised, contrary to New Delhi‚Äôs goals.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia constantly tried to keep the Kashmir issue an internal one, but after the war, it has become an international issue,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAn issue which can lead to a war between two nuclear countries cannot be an internal issue. Even India, instead of calling it an internal issue, is calling it a bilateral issue now.‚Äù</p>
<p>In response to a question about the US-mediated ceasefire, Bilawal challenged Indian claims that New Delhi did not request one by saying: ‚ÄúIf Modi says India didn‚Äôt wish for a ceasefire, he should simply say once that Trump is lying.‚Äù</p>
<p>The PPP leader also highlighted that there are no mechanisms between the two to resolve nuclear disputes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are the only two nuclear-armed countries that have no nuclear dispute resolution mechanism. We brought the threshold down so much that if there is any terrorist attack in any country, that means there will be a war,‚Äù Bilawal noted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn such conditions, Pakistan‚Äôs stance is a position of a responsible state, a responsible nuclear power. India‚Äôs position is of a revisionist power that doesn‚Äôt abide by international law and the international rules-based order, and if it insists on keeping the entire world on tenterhooks, then it is not responsible enough to have a nuclear power,‚Äù the PPP chief stated.</p></p>
