                <h2>PM Shehbaz invites opposition leader to consult on new chief election commissioner</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has invited the opposition leader for consultations on appointing the next chief election commissioner (CEC), months after the incumbent‚Äôs term expired in January, it emerged on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The constitutional deadline for the appointment of a new chief election commis¬≠sioner and two members of the Election Com¬≠mission of Pakistan (ECP)  <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897583">exp¬≠ired</a> on March 12, with no action from the government.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866480">26th Amendment</a> allowed the CEC and the members to continue till their successors come in. As per Article 215(4) of the Constitution, the appointment of the CEC and members must be completed within 45 days.</p>
<p>In a letter dated May 16 and addressed to Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub ‚Äî seen by <em>Dawn.com</em> ‚Äî the prime minister noted that the term of the incumbent CEC, Sikandar Sultan Raja, expired on January 27 this year, adding that he was holding office in accordance with the second proviso to clause 1 of Article 215 of the Constitution (term of office of the Commissioner [and members]).</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn term of clause (2A) of Article 213 and sub-clause (b) of clause (2) of Article 218 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, three names each for the appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and two Members (i.e. for Sindh and Balochistan) are to be forwarded to the Parliamentary Committee for hearing and confirmation of any one person against each position,‚Äù the letter read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn view of the aforesaid, you are invited for a meeting for consultation, in terms of clause (2A) of Article 213 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, in order to finalize three names each for appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and Members from Sindh and Balochistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>No exact date for a meeting was given, nor were any names released about prospective CECs.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#disqualification-reference" id="disqualification-reference" title="Permalink"></a>Disqualification reference</h2>
<p>Separately, a hearing on the disqualification reference against Ayub was adjourned until July 1 as he was obligated to attend the upcoming federal budget session in parliament.</p>
<p>Last week, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Sadiq <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914430">forwarded</a> a reference seeking Ayub‚Äôs disqualification to the ECP.</p>
<p>The reference is based on an application filed by former MNA Babar Nawaz, who lost to Ayub in the 2024 general election in NA-18 (Haripur) by a margin of 82,000 votes.</p>
<p>A five-member committee chaired by the CEC presided over the hearing, with Ayub stating that he had yet to appoint counsel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe budget session will start soon and I am a member of the Finance Committee. The budget meeting will be held for two weeks,‚Äù he said, requesting time to attend the budget session and appoint a leader.</p>
<p>Sindh Election Commission member Nisar Durrani said that there is a 90-day time limit to act on the speaker‚Äôs reference. The commission granted Ayub‚Äôs request and adjourned the hearing until July 1.</p>
<p>In a separate case in which the opposition leader was accused of rigging by Babar Nawaz, the opposition leader‚Äôs lawyer sought time to submit a reply and arguments. The commission adjourned the hearing until June 24.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters following the hearing, Ayub assailed the National Assembly for sending the reference ‚Äúwithout using their brains‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe speaker did not consult me about this reference,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn the 2018 elections, I beat my opponent by 40,000 votes. He previously approached the Abbottabad High Court, but the case was dismissed.‚Äù</p></p>

                <h2>Bilawal-led delegation reaches Washington after wrapping up NY visit</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The high-powered delegation, led by former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, has reached Washington after concluding its two-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow">visit</a> to the United Nations Headquarters in New York on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pakis¬≠tan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">launched</a> a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi‚Äôs growing lobbying presence here.</p>
<p>The delegation comprises Senator Rehman, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt and Jalil Abbas Jilani.</p>
<p>In New York, the delegation ‚Äúdrew attention to India‚Äôs illegal use of force and violations of international law, including the UN Charter and International Humanitarian Law, particularly targeting of civilian areas and killing of innocent civilians, including women and children‚Äù, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>It added that the delegation rejected India‚Äôs allegations regarding the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909746">attack</a> in India-occupied Kashmir ‚Äúwithout a shred of evidence, and warned against India‚Äôs weaponisation of water through its unilateral hold on the IWT [Indus Waters Treaty] in violation of international law and treaty obligations‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to the statement, the delegation met with the UN secretary-general, the president of the General Assembly, the president of the Security Council, the representatives of the Security Council‚Äôs permanent and non-permanent members, ambassadors of the OIC Group, representatives of the media, civil society, and think tanks, and the Pakistani community.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the delegation highlighted the country‚Äôs role and commitment to combating terrorism in all forms, while also ‚Äúdrawing attention of the international community towards Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan, and its transnational assassination campaign‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCooperation, not politicisation, was required to effectively combat the menace of terrorism, it was underlined,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>The delegation also emphasised the country‚Äôs responsible and lawful response to Indian aggression and provocations, adding that Pakistan ‚Äúseeks peace but will always defend its sovereignty with resolve‚Äù.</p>
<p>It warned that Indian attempts to create a ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù that implied arbitrary and unilateral strikes could lead to disastrous consequences in South Asia‚Äôs nuclear environment, reiterating that peace in the region hinged on a just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in line with the UN Security Council resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe international community was urged to uphold international law and the sanctity of treaties, push for the revival and normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty, and support the initiation of a comprehensive dialogue to resolve all outstanding issues between India and Pakistan, including the core dispute of Jammu and Kashmir,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>Speaking at a press conference at UN Headquarters, Bilawal said coope¬≠ration between Pakistan and India‚Äôs intelligence agencies could significantly reduce terrorism in South Asia.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am completely confident that if ISI and RAW were ready to sit down and work together to fight these forces, we would see a significant decrease in terrorism in both India and Pakistan,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>He also urged the global community to remain engaged in South Asia, warning that the risk of conflict between nuclear-armed neighbours had grown, not diminished, after the recent ceasefire.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith the intervention of the international community ‚Äî and I would like to mention particularly the role played by the US President Donald Trump and his team led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio ‚Äî we did manage to achieve a ceasefire between India and Pakistan,‚Äù said Bilawal. ‚ÄúThis is a welcome first step, but it‚Äôs only a first step.‚Äù</p>

<p>Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, detailing PM Shehbaz‚Äôs recent multi-state <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow">visit</a>, said the international community was lauding Pakistan‚Äôs diplomatic efforts.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are being praised for our kinetic actions‚Äù, he said, adding that Pakistan‚Äôs narrative was clear to the international community from the beginning and remained so until the resolution of the conflict.</p>
<p>While addressing a press conference, FM Dar said the delegation led by PM Shehbaz expressed gratitude for the support of countries to Pakistan throughout the period of tension, particularly Turkiye and Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPeople in Turkiye and Azerbaijan took to the streets to celebrate the resolution,‚Äù he said, noting that Pakistan‚Äôs victory was a victory for the entire Muslim community.</p>

<p>Appreciating Turkiye‚Äôs role in de-escalation efforts, he recalled that on the night of May 6, when India attacked, his Turkish counterpart was ‚Äúthe first one to call and ask if there is anything they can do for Pakistan‚Äù.</p>
<p>He further said that in the wake of the recent events, India‚Äôs ‚Äúhegemony has been destroyed‚Äù and its supremacy ‚Äúblown in the air‚Äù, adding that Indians were now blaming each other while Pakistan‚Äôs diplomatic efforts were being globally acknowledged.</p>

<p>Separately, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) Syed Tariq Fatemi called on Yury Ushakov, senior aide to the Russian president on foreign policy issues, and briefed him on the recent escalation in South Asia, outlining Pakistan‚Äôs position vis-√†-vis India‚Äôs aggressive actions, especially unilaterally holding the IWT in abeyance.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBesides these meetings, the SAPM gave two interviews to the leading Russian TV networks, expressing his candid views on the increasingly positive trends in Pakistan-Russia relations and recent escalation between Pakistan and India. He also had an extensive exchange of views with a group of academics and journalists from prominent print and electronic media. Furthermore, the SAPM was hosted by Valdai Discussion Club, a prestigious think-tank in Moscow, for a talk on June 4, on the recent developments in South Asia and Pakistan-Russia relations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOverall, the visit of the SAPM was highly successful, with several important official engagements and candid exchanges with parliamentarians, a think tank, several academics and journalists. It paved the way to explicitly share Pakistan‚Äôs perspective on the recent situation and other important issues, such as IWT to the Russian side.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere was widespread appreciation for the manner in which Pakistan was enhancing its relations with Russia, in important areas of trade, investment, energy and connectivity routes,‚Äù the FO said.</p>
