            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930217/foreign-office-slams-indias-mea-for-twisting-coas-asim-munirs-remarks' target='_blank'><strong>Foreign Office slams India’s MEA for ‘twisting’ COAS Asim Munir’s remarks</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Monday castigated India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) for “distorting” and “twisting” remarks made by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir during his recent visit to the United States.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir on Sunday completed his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930030/coas-says-india-wont-be-allowed-to-choke-indus-river">second high-profile trip</a> to the US in less than two months. Like his previous visit, he engaged with both political and military leadership in the host country. In Tampa, Florida, the army chief attended the US Central Command’s (Centcom) change of command ceremony.</p>
<p>His most closely watched appearance came later at a black-tie dinner hosted by Adnan Asad, Pakistan’s honorary consul in Tampa. The event was attended by about 150 guests, including Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Ambassador Rizwan Shaikh, embassy officials, and prominent members of the diaspora.</p>
<p>Comments Field Marshal Munir made at the event were later picked up and, according to the FO, distorted by Indian media outlets. Responding to Indian media reports, the MEA had said earlier today: “Our attention has been drawn to remarks reportedly made by the Pakistani COAS while on a visit to the US. Nuclear sabre-rattling is Pakistan’s stock-in-trade.</p>
<p>“The international community can draw its own conclusions on the irresponsibility inherent in such remarks, which also reinforce the well-held doubts about the integrity of nuclear command and control in a state where the military is hand-in-glove with terrorist groups.”</p>
<p>The MEA had also said that it was “regrettable” that the alleged remarks were “made from the soil of a friendly third country”.</p>

</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In a terse response to the Indian MEA’s statement, the FO said: “Pakistan strongly rejects the immature remarks made by the Indian MEA earlier today, which is yet another demonstration of their chronic tendency to distorting facts and twisting statements out of context.</p>
<p>“The Indian narrative of an alleged ‘nuclear blackmail’ is a misleading and self-serving construct. Pakistan remains firmly opposed to the use or threat of use of force. India’s sabre-rattling and warmongering whenever confronted, invite unfounded allegations bereft of rationality.”</p>
<p>The FO said Pakistan was a responsible nuclear-weapon state with an “elaborate command and control structure under full civilian control” that had always exercised “discipline and restraint” while dealing with issues of such importance.</p>

<p>“Pakistan’s sustained and credible counterterrorism efforts are internationally acknowledged. Our security forces remain the bulwark against terrorism. The Indian MEA’s spurious insinuations are irresponsible and without a shred of evidence.</p>
<p>“We also note with concern a pointless reference to the third countries, in a bid to exert pressure on Pakistan. This not only reflects India’s lack of diplomatic confidence but also constitutes a futile attempt to unnecessarily involve other countries.”</p>
<p>The FO said that “contrary to India’s belligerent and jingoistic approach”, Pakistan would continue to act as a responsible member of the global community.</p>
<p>“However, any act of Indian aggression or violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity will be met with an immediate and matching response. The onus of any ensuing escalation will rest squarely with the Indian leadership,” it warned.</p></p>

            <p><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Monday acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi in two more cases related to the May 9 riots, while sentencing Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudry, Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mehmoodur Rashid to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, following which thousands were arrested.</p>

<p>The ATC had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929899/verdict-in-two-may-9-riots-cases-reserved">reserved its verdict</a> in the two cases on Saturday related to the May 9 riots — the Shadman police station attack and burning of police vehicles near Jinnah House — after completing proceedings at Kot Lakhpat jail. The judge concluded the hearings inside the jail in two sessions during the whole day.</p>
<p>ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced the judgments today and convicted Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema and Rashid in both cases.</p>
<p>PTI leaders Aliya Hamza and Sanam Javed were also sentenced to five years in prison in the Shadman case.</p>
<p>Advocate Rana Mudassar confirmed today’s sentencing to <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>In the Shadman police station case, the court indicted 25 accused out of 41 nominated in the challan and recorded statements of 45 prosecution witnesses. At least 15 accused have been declared proclaimed offenders in this case.</p>
<p>In the police vehicles torching case, the court indicted 17 accused, declared seven proclaimed offenders and recorded statements of 65 prosecution witnesses.</p>
<p>Last month, the Lahore ATC had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925887/lahore-atc-acquits-qureshi-sentences-yasmin-rashid-ejaz-chaudhry-and-others-to-10-years-in-may-9-riots-case">acquitted</a> Qureshi while sentencing Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema, Rashid and others to 10 years in prison over a May 9 riots case related to violence on Sherpao Bridge.</p>
<p>Sarwar Road police had registered a case against PTI leaders and workers on charges of ransacking and burning public property at Sherpao Bridge in the Cantonment area during the violent protests.</p>
<p>Chaudhry had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929752/ptis-zartaj-gul-ejaz-chaudhry-appeal-to-lhc-against-atc-convictions-in-may-9-riots-cases">filed two petitions</a> in the Lahore High Court on Saturday, pleading with the court to suspend his sentence and conviction, along with ordering his release on bail. He further requested the court in the second petition to set aside his conviction and acquit him in the case in the “interest of justice”.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#ptis-gohar-blasts-convictions" id="ptis-gohar-blasts-convictions" title="Permalink"></a>PTI’s Gohar blasts convictions</h2>
<p>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan assailed the convictions, saying: “We’ve said before that if injustice is allowed to thrive, then the voice of the people will be silenced.”</p>
<p>Lamenting that the PTI’s mandate was stolen, Gohar said that the government did not have the people’s respect or vote and did not have the people’s trust.</p>
<p>“Yet we sat [in parliament] so that we could move forward and protect the nation, save democracy, free the courts and ensure the supremacy of order.</p>
<p>“If this blade of injustice doesn’t stop, the nation will suffer a great loss,” he warned.</p>
<p>“We condemn the judgments and reject them,” Gohar added. “Justice has been killed.”</p>
<p>The PTI chairman further said that the party condemned the riots on May 9, stating that they should not have happened and should not happen again. However, he added that the party submitted a petition requesting a hearing on the allegations.</p>
<p>“That hearing has not happened, our petition was ignored and no decision was made,” he stated.</p>
<p>“Because the courts didn’t grant us justice, political tensions and instability rose. We don’t get justice and it keeps getting killed,” Gohar emphasised.</p>
<p>He said that Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai was saying the right thing: “People need to rise up, their voice cannot be silenced.</p>
<p>“We will carry on our movement until the true leader of the world’s 6th biggest party is released.”</p>
<p>Referring to those convicted in today’s hearing, Gohar said that the party members were voices who were representatives of the state who did not condone violence against it.</p>
<p>“If their voices are silenced, if the knife of injustice plunges deeper, then there will be a lot of division. This needs to end,” Gohar emphasised.</p>
<p>According to Gohar, the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) summoned the party leadership, who requested a meeting with Imran. “He (the CJP) said he is pursuing judicial reforms and would allow us to meet Imran in Adiala,” Gohar recalled.</p>
<p>“It’s been six months and there has been no meeting. We submitted a privileged motion to meet Imran, but there has been no action on it.</p>
<p>“We even submitted requests and raised the issue in parliament, but nothing happened,” he added.</p></p>

            <p><p>New Delhi police briefly detained Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and other opposition members on Monday as they protested a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923264/electoral-roll-revision-in-indias-bihar-sparks-fear-and-fury">controversial</a> revised electoral roll in Bihar and alleged “vote theft” by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p>
<p>The credibility of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1827980">elections</a> has rarely been questioned in recent decades in the world’s most populous democracy. Some analysts say the opposition accusations could damage Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he navigates one of the toughest periods of his 11 years in office.</p>
<p>The opposition members were taken into custody midway while marching from the parliament to the Election Commission of India (ECI) headquarters in New Delhi as they protested the roll revision, the <em>Press Trust of India</em> (<em>PTI</em>) <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ptinews.com/stories-detail/national/protesting-opposition-mps-stopped-from-marching-to-ec-office-against-sir/2811244/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Nearly two hours later, Congress lawmaker Kishori Lal Sharma said Gandhi and other opposition leaders had been released.</p>
<p>“The police detained us but now we have been released,” he told the media, adding that the police had not allowed them to go to the ECI as promised, and instead took them to the police station.</p>
<p>“We are now heading to the parliament,” he added.</p>

<p>As the police attempted to thwart the protest by around 300 opposition members, some MPs climbed up to the barricade — set up by the police ahead of the march — and chanted slogans against the ECI and Modi’s government. The protestors carried placards alleging “vote theft”, <em>PTI</em> said.</p>
<p>A statement posted on Gandhi’s X account shortly after he was detained said: “The truth of vote theft is now before the country.</p>
<p>“This fight is not political — it is a fight to protect democracy, the constitution, and the right to ‘one person, one vote’,” he added.</p>
<p>“The united opposition and every voter in the country demands a clean and transparent voter list,” the Congress leader added.</p>

<p>Gandhi and Congress have alleged that voters’ lists in states where the party lost are corrupted, with voters’ names deleted or included more than once to rig elections in favour of Modi’s BJP.</p>
<p>Opposition parties have also criticised the ECI’s decision to revise the voters’ list in the key northern state of Bihar just before state elections due later this year, saying it aims to disenfranchise large numbers of poor voters.</p>
<p>The BJP and the ECI have rejected the accusations.</p>
<p>In June, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923264/electoral-roll-revision-in-indias-bihar-sparks-fear-and-fury">Special Intensive Revision</a> (SIR) of the voter rolls was announced ahead of the upcoming polls in the eastern state of Bihar. The move, which required that all potential voters provide proof of citizenship by July 25, sparked nationwide fears of disenfranchisement among India’s minorities, including Muslims and Dalit communities.</p>

<p>According to <em>PTI</em>, other protesting lawmakers detained included Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi, Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav, T. R. Baalu of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Sanjay Raut of the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and Derek O’Brien of the Trinamool Congress.</p>
<p>Parliamentarians from other opposition parties, such as the Rashtriya Janata Dal, were also taken into custody, the report added.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#state-of-anarchy" id="state-of-anarchy" title="Permalink"></a>‘State of anarchy’</h2>
<p>The ECI has said that changes in voters’ lists are shared with political parties and all complaints are investigated thoroughly.</p>
<p>It has also said that voters’ lists need to be revised to remove dead voters or those who have relocated to other parts of the country, among others. Many voters in Bihar have <a class="link--external" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3wnx7689l5o" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the <em>BBC</em></a> that the draft rolls have wrong photos and include dead people.</p>
<p>“The new draft rolls have 72.4 million names — 6.5 million fewer than before,” the <em>BBC</em> report published today said.</p>
<p>Congress and its allies have fared poorly in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1890744">two</a> state <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1874358">polls</a> that they had expected to win after an impressive show in last year’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1837902">general elections</a>, which saw BJP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1837945">losing</a> its outright majority and remaining in power only with the help of regional parties.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Congress has also complained about electronic voting machines and said the counting process is not fair, charges rejected by the election panel.</p>
<p>The BJP said opposition parties were trying to create a “state of anarchy” by sowing seeds of doubt about the electoral process.</p>
<p>“They are in a state of bankruptcy because of their continuous losses,” Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan of the BJP told reporters on Monday.</p>

<p>As per the <em>PTI</em> report, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had written to the ECI earlier and asked them to hold discussions over the electoral rolls’ SIR, among other issues.</p>
<p>“Thereafter, the MPs wish to collectively meet with the commission on a host of issues, including but not limited to Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls being undertaken in Bihar and proposed to be undertaken in other states as well,” the <em>PTI</em> quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>“We look forward to meeting with the commission, which will be in keeping with the highest tradition of our parliamentary democracy,” he said, according to <em>PTI</em>.</p></p>
