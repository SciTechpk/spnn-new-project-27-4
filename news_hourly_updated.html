                <h2>China appreciates Pakistan‚Äôs role for regional peace in meeting with COAS Munir: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>China acknowledged Pakistan‚Äôs role in regional peace during a meeting with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, the military‚Äôs media affairs wing said on Friday.</p>
<p>Pakistan and China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/china-says-it-backs-pakistan-in-defending-sovereignty">share</a> a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation, and regional connectivity.</p>
<p>Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors, including trade, energy, infrastructure, and defence collaboration, with initiatives like the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879166">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.</p>
<p>During his official visit to the People‚Äôs Republic of China, the army chief held meetings with senior Chinese political and military leadership in Beijing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúChinese military leadership reiterated full confidence in the strength of the bilateral defence partnership and acknowledged Pakistan‚Äôs pivotal role in promoting regional peace,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>COAS Munir called on Chinese Vice President Han Zheng and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the statement read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDiscussions focused on the evolving regional and global political landscape, connectivity initiatives under the CPEC, and the need for coordinated responses to shared geopolitical challenges,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBoth sides expressed satisfaction over the depth of bilateral engagement and reiterated their shared commitment to sovereign equality, multilateral cooperation, and long-term regional stability.‚Äù</p>
<p>The statement continued that the ‚ÄúChinese leadership lauded the Pakistan Armed Forces as a cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor to peace in South Asia‚Äù.</p>

<p>The military engagement between both sides included ‚Äúcomprehensive exchanges on defence and security cooperation, including counterterrorism collaboration, joint training, defence modernisation, and enhanced institutional linkages‚Äù, ISPR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEmphasis was placed on improving operational interoperability and strategic coordination to confront hybrid and transnational threats,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir held meetings with various Chinese military leaders, the statement read, adding, ‚ÄúUpon arrival at the  People‚Äôs Liberation Army Headquarters, the COAS was presented with a guard of honour, symbolising the longstanding camaraderie between the two armed forces.‚Äù</p>
<p>The COAS appreciated China‚Äôs ‚Äúconsistent support‚Äù and reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to ‚Äúfurther expanding military-to-military cooperation across all domains‚Äù, the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>The statement said that the visit ‚Äúreflects the growing depth of politico-military ties between the two brotherly nations and underscores their shared resolve to advance regional security through sustained high-level dialogue and engagements‚Äù.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926296/pakistan-signs-maritime-mou-with-chinese-shipping-giant-to-boost-collaboration">signed</a> a memorandum of understanding with Chinese shipping giant, Shandong Xinxu Group, in a move that is set to bring about a ‚Äúmajor transformation‚Äù in the shipping sector.</p>
<p>Last week, Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar met with Chinese foreign minister, where both sides <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924658">reaffirmed</a> their commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation and promoting regional peace, stability and development.</p></p>

            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday lauded S&amp;P Global <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926320/sampp-global-lifts-pakistans-credit-rating-b-from-ccc-outlook-stable">upgrade</a> to the country‚Äôs sovereign credit rating to ‚ÄòB-‚Äô from ‚ÄòCCC+‚Äô and vowed to achieve sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p>A day earlier, ratings agency S&amp;P Global had raised Pakistan‚Äôs sovereign credit rating to ‚ÄòB-‚Äô from ‚ÄòCCC+‚Äô and placed it on a ‚Äòstable‚Äô outlook, saying the country‚Äôs finances and reserves had been stabilised by International Monetary Fund (IMF) support.</p>
<p>‚ÄúS&amp;P‚Äôs upgrade of Pakistan‚Äôs credit rating from CCC+ to B-, with a stable outlook, is a welcome development,‚Äù PM Shehbaz said in a post on X.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt reflects growing confidence in our economic reforms and the macroeconomic stability we have been able to achieve,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>He continued that his administration remained committed to sustaining the momentum of reform, fostering transparency, and deepening investor confidence, ‚Äúso that the early signs of recovery translate into lasting prosperity for our people and translate into sustainable economic growth.‚Äù</p>
<p>In its statement, S&amp;P had said: ‚ÄúThe stable outlook reflects our expectations that continued economic recovery and government efforts to enhance revenue will stabilise fiscal and debt metrics.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe also expect that sustained official financing will support Pakistan in meeting its external obligations, and that the country will continue to roll over its commercial credit lines over the next 12 months.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pakistan‚Äôs longer-dated international bonds rallied after the upgrade, with the 2051 maturity gaining 1.6 cents to be bid at 84.85 cents on the dollar, according to Tradeweb data.</p>
<p>Last week, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924444">urged</a> the leading US rating agency ‚Äî Moody‚Äôs ‚Äî to improve Pakistan‚Äôs credit rating and help its return to international capital markets at favourable conditions.</p>

<p>Global ratings agency Fitch had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904417">upgraded</a> Pakistan‚Äôs foreign currency credit rating to ‚ÄòB-‚Äô from ‚ÄòCCC+‚Äô in April, citing increased confidence in the country‚Äôs progress on narrowing its budget deficits.</p></p>
