                <h2>Pindi administration bans assemblies, gatherings for week ahead of today‚Äôs PTI protest</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Rawalpindi administration on Monday banned all assemblies and gatherings for a week, citing an ‚Äúimminent threat‚Äù, ahead of the PTI‚Äôs planned nationwide <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922952/imran-shuns-dialogue-plans-nationwide-protest">August 5 protest</a>.</p>
<p>Imran, imprisoned since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">August 2023</a>, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a ¬£190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. He has issued a nationwide <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922952">protest</a> call, which will reach its ‚Äúpeak‚Äù on Aug 5 to mark the second year of his incarceration in multiple cases.</p>
<p>Imran has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926327/imran-decries-lack-of-meaningful-momentum-for-aug-5-protest-orders-pti-to-shun-all-differences">decried</a> the lack of any ‚Äúmeaningful momentum‚Äù for the protest and ordered PTI members to immediately shun all their differences. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja previously said the party has no plans to gather workers at a specific place for the Aug 5 agitation, and instead it will protest at <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927328">different locations</a> across the country.</p>
<p>An order issued yesterday by Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner (DC) Hassan Waqar Cheema said it was brought to his attention by the District Intelligence Committee (DIC) that there was an ‚Äúimminent threat‚Äù within the limits of Rawalpindi district ‚Äî particularly surrounding sensitive installations, prominent roads and other critical infrastructures ‚Äî that may pose a serious risk to human life, public property, and the overall peace and order of the district.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe DIC has reported specific intelligence suggesting that certain groups and elements are actively mobilising with intentions to disturb the law and order situation through large gatherings, protests, and disruptive assemblies,‚Äù the order read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe forum further indicates that these elements may target soft locations and mobilise individuals with the potential to engage in violent actions near key installations and other sensitive sites, thereby endangering the public peace and tranquillity,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>It continued that it was essential to ensure the security of the people and installations and buildings against any potential threat or untoward activity, in the larger interest of public safety, security, peace and tranquillity to avoid any untoward incident.</p>
<p>DC Cheema said that he was prohibiting the following activities within the district from Aug 4-10 under Section 144 (power to issue order absolute at once in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger) of the Code of Criminal Procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assemblies, gatherings, sits-in, rallies, processions, demonstrations, protests and such other activities with a gathering of five or more people</li>
<li>Carrying weapons, spikes, laden batons, gaulails, ball bearings, petrol bombs, improvised explosives or any other instrument that could potentially be used for violence</li>
<li>Displaying arms and objectionable and hateful speeches</li>
<li>Attempting to remove any restriction imposed by a police officer to regulate the assembly of people or the movement of traffic</li>
<li>Pillion riding.</li>
<li>Using loudspeakers</li>
</ul>
<p>Separately, the Adiala Jail superintendent requested the Rawalpindi city police officer to beef up security.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is awfully brought into your notice that PTI political worker, family members, especially sister of PTI leader are used to protest against the Jail administration and other state institutions, particularly outside the Jail. It has come to our attention through electronic/social media that PTI leadership is planning to stage a protest outside this jail tomorrow on Tuesday, which could potentially lead to an untoward incident,‚Äù the request read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGiven the sensitivity of the situation, it is imperative to strengthen the outer security of the jail to maintain law and order. Proactive measures must be taken to identify and apprehend any miscreants involved in organising this protest,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFurthermore, strict action should be enforced to prevent such gatherings near the jail premises to avoid any disruption or security risks. Additional police guard deployment, barricades, and surveillance may be necessary to deter unlawful assemblies and ensure the safety of the facility. Your prompt attention to this matter is highly appreciated. Therefore, it has become a dire need of the hour to beef up the security (from all sides) of the jail to evade an unpleasant situation in future.‚Äù</p>
<p>It urged that, in light of the above, additional personnel be deployed at the jail and its surrounding areas urgently to strengthen the facility‚Äôs outer security under the supervision of police officers so that any unpleasant incident could be avoided.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said in an interview on <em>Geo News</em> show ‚ÄòAaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath‚Äô said the federal government had received a request two days ago, but no one had followed up on it despite attempts by the Islamabad administration to contact the sender.</p>
<p>He said there were opposing narratives and viewpoints coming from within the PTI about the nature of the protest, adding that the party should not blame the government for its own ‚Äúinternal division and weakness‚Äù. Chaudhry said the government was ‚Äúclear‚Äù that any protest was the PTI‚Äôs right.</p>
<p>The state minister questioned why the administration was not directly contacted and the party did not give legal cover to its protest.</p>
<p>The PTI had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927887/pti-moves-lhc-for-aug-5-rally">approached</a> the Lahore High Court last week, seeking permission to hold a public rally at Minar-i-Pakistan on Aug 5.</p>
<p>It has also submitted a request to the Islamabad administration for holding a workers‚Äô convention at F-9 Park tomorrow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the capital police have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927855/police-gear-up-for-protest-as-pti-seeks-permission-for-meeting-at-f-9-park">begun preparations</a>. Officers had told <em>Dawn.com</em> that in the first phase, the Anti-Riot Unit of the police started exercises, physical training and refresher anti-riot courses at the Police Lines Headquarters.</p>
<p>Over a thousand personnel of the unit are undergoing refresher courses. The courses include physical training and exercises to make them fit and respond to the protesters with full energy.</p>
<p>Besides, they are also doing refresher courses on the usage and handling of anti-riot kits. They are getting training regarding the usage of shields to protect themselves and the force from stones and other objects that may be pelted at them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they are also being trained on how to intercept mobs at certain points, cordon them off and disperse them. They are also learning how to deal with troublemakers and protesters taking law and order into their hands.</p>
<p>On the other hand, police have also started collecting details of local PTI leaders and activists besides keeping an eye on their activities. The intelligence units of the police have mounted surveillance over the leaders and hardcore members of the PTI.</p>
<p>Surveillance at all hotels, motels, inns and guest houses along with cthe apital‚Äôs suburbs and outskirts has also been increased to monitor the PTI workers‚Äô activities and get information about their stay and gatherings. The police intelligence units were also asked to prepare fresh lists of local PTI leaders.</p></p>

                <h2>Trump warns he will ‚Äòsubstantially‚Äô raise tariffs on India over Russian oil purchases</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Monday he will substantially raise tariffs on India over its purchases of Russian oil.</p>
<p>Trump last week said he would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927587">impose</a> a 25 per cent tariff on goods imported from India and added that the world‚Äôs fifth-largest economy would also face an unspecified penalty, but gave no details. Later, Trump mou¬≠nted a sharp attack and said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.‚Äù</p>
<p>Over the weekend, two Indian government sources told <em>Reuters</em> that India will keep purchasing oil from Russia despite Trump‚Äôs threats. In turn, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928504/top-trump-aide-accuses-india-of-financing-russias-war-in-ukraine">accused</a> India of effectively financing Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine by purchasing oil from Moscow.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114971053091282290" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on Truth Social today, Trump assailed New Delhi for buying Russian oil and then selling it.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia is not only buying massive amounts of Russian oil, they are then, for much of the oil purchased, selling it on the open market for big profits,‚Äù Trump wrote. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBecause of this, I will be substantially raising the tariff paid by India to the USA,‚Äù the US president wrote.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch    media--uneven  media--stretch">

    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to the threat, India‚Äôs Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) issued a statement claiming that the US and the European Union ‚Äútargeted‚Äù New Delhi for purchasing Russian oil after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict,‚Äù the statement read. ‚ÄúThe US at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy market stability.‚Äù</p>
<p>The MEA highlighted in its statement that the very nations criticising India were engaging in trade with Russia themselves, adding that the goods exchanged include energy, fertilisers, mining products, chemicals, iron and steel and machinery and transport equipment.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhere the United States is concerned, it continues to import from Russia uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for its electric vehicle industry, fertilisers, as well as chemicals,‚Äù the MEA statement added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn this background, the targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable. Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security.‚Äù</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927843">India</a>, the world‚Äôs third-largest oil importer, is the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854116">biggest buyer</a> of seaborne Russian crude, a vital revenue earner for Russia as it wages war in Ukraine for a fourth year.</p>
<p>The US levy on India exceeds those agreed by some other nations in deals with the Trump administration. For example, the tariff on Vietnam is set at 20pc and on Indonesia at 19pc, with levies of 15pc on Japanese and European Union exports.</p>
<p>Last week, Trump said Washington had reached a trade deal with India‚Äôs arch-rival Pakistan that Islamabad said would lead to lower tariffs on its exports.</p>
<p>Since India‚Äôs short but deadly conflict with Pakistan in May, New Delhi has been unhappy about Trump‚Äôs closeness with Islamabad and has protested, casting a shadow over trade talks.</p>
<p>Despite former public displays of bonhomie between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has taken a slightly harder stance against the US in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the India-Pakistan ceasefire he announced on social media on May 10, but India disputes his claim that it resulted from his intervention and trade threats.</p>
<p>By declaring the Indian economy dead in the water, Trump has put Modi and his party in a bind. Until recently, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was canvassing support for the US president‚Äôs election. Its supporters were holding special prayers and muttering mystical chants for Trump‚Äôs victory. There was at least one temple created where a sculptured image of Trump was worshipped.</p>
<p>But Trump has ignored the lavish praise and called out India‚Äôs energy imports from Russia and its tariff regime as non-negotiable.</p>
<p>The Indian government said it was trying to figure out a response by consulting all the ‚Äústakeholders‚Äù, a euphemism for angry businesses whose hopes were riding on Modi‚Äôs daring ability to play both sides of the street.</p>
<p>That appears to have hit a dead-end.</p></p>
