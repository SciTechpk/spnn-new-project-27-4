            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir on Thursday warned that any “misadventure” by India, amid fraught tensions with Pakistan that has seen continued shelling across the Line of Control after a militant attack in occupied Kashmir last week, would be met with a quick and decisive response.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">rejected</a> the accusation and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> and India’s premier granting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">“operational freedom”</a> to his military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an incursion from India within the next 24-36 hours, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension">diplomatic channels</a> from other countries have been engaged to prevent a possible military confrontation.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7270" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said COAS Munir visited the  Tilla Field Firing Ranges in Jhelum to witness “Exercise Hammer Strike”, a high-intensity, field training exercise conducted by the military’s Mangla Strike Corps.</p>
<p>Addressing the troops amid the exercise, the ISPR said the army chief reaffirmed the military’s “unyielding resolve” to defend the nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs.</p>
<p>“Let there be no ambiguity: any military misadventure by India will be met with a swift, resolute, and notch-up response. While Pakistan remains committed to regional peace, our preparedness and resolve to safeguard national interests is absolute,” he was quoted as saying by the ISPR.</p>
<p>It said the COAS lauded the “high morale, combat proficiency, and warfighting spirit” of the officers and troops, terming them the “embodiment of Pakistan Army’s operational excellence”. Senior military leadership, formation commanders and dignitaries from various services also witnessed the exercise.</p>
<p>“Exercise Hammer Strike stands as a testament to Pakistan Army’s pursuit of continuous transformation through rigorous training, doctrinal innovation, and technological modernisation,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p>It added that the exercise was meticulously designed to validate combat readiness, battlefield synergy and the operational integration of cutting-edge weapon systems under near-battlefield conditions. A diverse array of advanced capabilities, including multirole fighter aircraft, combat aviation assets, long-range precision artillery, and next-generation field engineering techniques, were employed to simulate conventional battlefield scenarios.</p>
<p>The ISPR said troops from all arms and services demonstrated “exceptional tactical cohesion, agility, and lethality during synchronised offensive manoeuvres — reflecting an extraordinary level of training and professionalism.</p>
<p>“Notably, the exercise showcased Pakistan Army’s increasing absorption of niche and emerging technologies to augment its kinetic and non-kinetic operational capabilities.”</p>

<p>A day ago, Pakistani officials had said the country would exercise restraint in the face of heightened tensions with India but warned it would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907662/pakistan-wont-sit-idle-in-the-face-of-indian-aggression">respond “strongly” and “decisively”</a> if attacked, invoking its right to self-defence under international law.</p>
<p>“Pakistan will not be the first one to resort to any escalatory move; however, in case of any escalatory move by the Indian side, we will respond very strongly,” Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had said during a joint media briefing with military and Foreign Office spokespersons.</p>
<p>Dar said a similar message had been communicated to the international partners. “Any misadventure will be responded to in a befitting and decisive manner at the time and place of our choosing.”</p>
<p>“Our response would be befitting, decisive and assured,” ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had said. “We are ready for all eventualities. If they choose military confrontation, that would be their choice, but we would then determine its (conflict’s) future direction.”</p>
<p>Gen Chaudhry emphasised that Pakistan’s armed forces were fully capable and prepared to defend the country across all domains. “We are vigilant and our response and counter-measures would be appropriate and decisive,” he said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#president-pm-discuss-security-situation" id="president-pm-discuss-security-situation" title="Permalink"></a>President, PM discuss security situation</h2>
<p>Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday called on President Asif Ali Zardari to discuss the current security situation.</p>
<p>A statement from the President House said the two leaders expressed deep concern over India’s “belligerent attitude and provocative statements, which posed a threat to regional peace and stability”. They reaffirmed that Pakistan would never compromise on the country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, and would respond to any act of aggression in a “befitting manner”.</p>

<p>They stated that the Pakistani nation was united and stood behind its military which was capable of responding to any threat or aggression. They also reviewed Pakistan’s response to India’s “belligerent posture and any possible acts of aggression”.</p>
<p>The two also expressed regret over the Indian leadership’s accusations regarding the Pahalgam attack, noting that they were made without any investigation. It was highlighted in their talks that Pakistan had been a victim of terrorism, suffering immense human and economic losses for over two decades.</p>
<p>They said that the international community should take note of India’s involvement in funding, training and sending militants into Pakistan to carry out terrorist activities.</p>
<p>The statement said President Zardari commended the government’s response to Indian baseless accusations and handling of the situation in a responsible manner. He reaffirmed that Pakistan would take all necessary steps to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and vital national interests at all costs.</p>
<p>The two also highlighted the urgency of implementing United Nations Security Council resolutions to grant the Kashmiri people their right to self-determination, noting it would help bring lasting peace and stability to the region.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also enquired after the president’s health after his recovery from <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901612">Covid-19</a>.</p>
<p>FM Dar and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar were also present during the meeting.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> shared a <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/01-05-2025/pakistan-army-continuing-war-exercises-with-full-vigour" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a>, dated April 30 and dubbed with a patriotic song, showing the Pakistan Army conducting several exercises.</p>
<p>“Pakistan Army is continuing war exercises with full vigour,” the report said. It quoted security sources as saying the exercises included a “practical demonstration of modern weaponry in view of war strategy”.</p>

<p>According to security sources, the exercises included “practical demonstrations of modern weaponry in view of war strategy”. The sources said the primary objective of the war exercises was to deliver a strong and decisive response to any aggression from the enemy.</p>
<p>They emphasised that the Pakistan Army remained fully prepared at all times to give a crushing reply to any hostile action.</p>
<p>“Officers and soldiers are actively showcasing their professional capabilities during the drills,” <em>Radio Pakistan</em> stated.</p>
<p>Similarly, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> also <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/01-05-2025/paf-fully-prepared-to-deliver-crushing-response-to-any-aggression" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared a video</a> showcasing the Pakistan Air Force’s (PAF) military prowess and capabilities, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1861418">JF-17 Block III</a> that other countries have also bought from Pakistan.</p>
<p>“PAF remains steadfast to defend [the] aerial frontiers of Pakistan,” the video captions said.</p>
<p><em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported that the PAF “fully prepared and determined to deliver a crushing response to any aggression”.</p>
<p>Noting that the PAF was equipped with the latest fighter jets, the report said the air force had “always fulfilled its professional responsibilities with utmost efficiency and dedication for the integrity of Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“The PAF is renowned worldwide for its technical expertise and courageous reputation,” it added.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Navy has also released a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwJ9mV5Fpn0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a>, titled ‘Ready at all times’, featuring Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf.</p>
<p>“You must be battle-ready. The time has come to utilise our capabilities effectively,” Admiral Ashraf tells his troops in the video, which shows clips of various naval exercises.</p>
<p>“You get few opportunities to prove yourself. Our nation has a lot of expectations of us. We have to deliver, and deliver to the best possible efficiency before the enemy,” the naval chief says.</p>

<p>India’s navy today issued warnings for several firing drills in the Arabian Sea off the coasts of Maharashtra and Gujarat states. Gujarat shares a border with Pakistan.</p>
<p>The navy did not respond to a <em>Reuters</em> request for comment on the warnings.</p>
<p>As tensions remain high, both countries’ troops reportedly exchanged small arms fire along the Line of Control (LoC) in AJK for the seventh night <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers#:~:text=troops%20exchanged%20fire%20overnight%20across%20the%20Line%20of%20Control%20(LoC)%20in%20Kashmir">since April 25</a>, <em>Reuters</em> said.</p>
<p>While there was no comment from Pakistan today, state media yesterday reported that the Pakistan Army <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension#:~:text=Pakistan%20responds%20to%20unprovoked%20Indian%20firing%20on%20LoC">responded</a> to overnight unprovoked Indian firing on the LoC. No casualties have been reported so far.</p>

<p>Addressing a rally in Mirphurkhas on Thursday, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari accused the Indian PM of targeting the Indus, warning him that the people of Sindh would respond to any moves to strangle the river.</p>
<p>“Someone is robbing the [water of the] Indus once again — his name is Modi, the butcher of Gujarat,” Bilawal said, calling on PPP supporters to raise their voices to protect the Indus River on the international stage.</p>
<p>“We will raise our voices and protect our river from Modi,” he added.</p>

<p>Recounting his time as foreign minister, the Bhutto scion said that he raised the issue of India trying to reject the Indus Water Treaty on the international stage in the past.</p>
<p>“I protected the Indus as foreign minister,” he said. “After the attack in [occupied] Kashmir, they announced that they reject the Indus Waters Treaty. We reject their decision.</p>

<p>“We told them in Sukkur that they should understand that Pakistan is a peaceful country and Islam is a peaceful religion, we don’t want war,” he added.</p>
<p>However, Bilawal warned that if anyone attacks “our Indus River”, then it would be treated as an act of war.</p>
<p>“The Indus is more than just a river; it is our history and our culture,” he stated, adding that the river birthed the Indus Valley Civilisation 3,000 years ago.</p>
<p>“India’s culture is also linked with the river; they love the Indus for this reason,” he added. “We will not give their PM the opportunity to choke the Indus and we do not want war, but we are ready to fight until the end.</p>
<p>“If he targets our water, he will see whether the Indus flows with water or blood,” Bilawal warned.</p>

            <p><p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901722">significant</a> improvement was seen in Pakistan’s internal security landscape in April 2025, “as both militant attacks and resultant casualties dropped sharply compared to March”, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) on Thursday.</p>
<p>Militant violence and security operations intensified in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the PICSS.</p>
<p>Pakistan also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">ranked</a> second in March in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>
<p>According to a press release issued by PICSS today, the number of militant attacks fell by 22 per cent — from 105 in March to 82 in April — while fatalities and injuries declined by 63pc and 49pc, respectively.</p>
<p>It said that security forces intensified <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907126/security-forces-kill-17-more-terrorists-operating-at-behest-of-indian-masters-ispr">counterterrorism</a> actions, killing at least 203 militants in various operations, making the majority (73pc) of the total fatalities in April.</p>
<p>“Only two civilians and two security <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906741/2-soldiers-martyred-15-terrorists-killed-in-kp-operations-ispr">personnel</a> were killed in these operations,” the press release said.</p>
<p>“A total of 287 people were killed in April due to militant violence and security operations, down from 335 in March,” it said, adding that injuries dropped from 271 to 139.</p>
<p>Notably, the share of militant deaths rose, accounting for 203 out of 287 total fatalities — over 70pc, it said, adding that civilian and security force casualties remained minimal, with 30 and 32 fatalities, respectively.</p>
<p>It said that April marked the lowest monthly death toll among security forces since June 2024, while civilian deaths also dropped significantly, underscoring improved operational precision and threat containment.</p>
<p>According to the press release, PICSS attributed these improvements to proactive intelligence-led operations and enhanced border vigilance.</p>
<p>It said that the most consequential development of the month was a two-phase military operation near the Pak-Afghan border that targeted a large group of infiltrating militants of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>At least 71 militants were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906939/54-terrorists-killed-as-infiltration-attempt-thwarted-in-kp-ispr">killed</a>, making it the biggest loss suffered by the group in a single operation to date, it said.</p>
<p>Intelligence assessments suggest that the TTP attempted mass infiltration, miscalculating that Pakistani forces might be distracted by heightened tensions along the eastern border with India, it added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>It said that a disturbing trend identified by PICSS in April was the targeted killing of 13 members of local peace committees (<em>razakars</em>) — a community-based defence initiative that has historically resisted militant infiltration.</p>
<p>The resurgence of attacks on these volunteers, particularly in the tribal districts, suggests that groups like the TTP are attempting to reassert dominance by silencing local resistance structures, the press release said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#breakdown-by-region" id="breakdown-by-region" title="Permalink"></a>Breakdown by region</h2>
<p>Mainland KP recorded 37 militant attacks in April — marginally down from 42 in March, it said.</p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday thanked China’s envoy for endorsing his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">offer</a> to conduct a neutral probe into the Pahalgam attack, following India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">actions</a> against Pakistan that have heightened the risks of a military confrontation between the two countries.</p>

India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">civilian</a> and military leadership have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">rejected</a> the accusation and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> and India’s premier granting “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>” to his military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an incursion from India within the next 24-36 hours, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension">diplomatic channels</a> from other countries have been engaged to prevent a possible military confrontation.</p>
<p>Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong called on Shehbaz at the PM House in Islamabad today, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> (<em>APP</em>) <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/chinese-amb-calls-on-pm-assures-chinas-support-to-achieve-common-desire-of-peace-regional-stability/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The premier thanked China for “endorsing his sincere offer to conduct a credible, neutral and transparent international investigation into the Pahalgam incident”.</p>

<p>He also conveyed that India’s “belligerent actions could distract Pakistan from its ongoing counterterrorism efforts” against the militant Islamic State Khorasan Province (IS-K), Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), who were “operating from inside Afghanistan”.</p>
<p>The past few years have witnessed a rise in the frequency of attacks targeting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900434">Chinese nationals</a> working in Pakistan, with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1877910">20 Chinese citizens</a> killed and 34 injured in terrorist attacks across the country since 2021.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the military accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan. The military spokesperson specifically cited the recent killing of 54 TTP militants during an infiltration attempt, saying it was “sponsored, facilita­ted, and abetted by India”.</p>

<p>In his meeting with the Chinese envoy, PM Shehbaz asserted that Pakistan had always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. He highlighted that as a “frontline state” in the war against terrorism, Pakistan had sacrificed over 90,000 lives and suffered over $152 billion in economic losses.</p>
<p>Ambassador Zaidong thanked the prime minister for sharing Pakistan’s perspective on the “emerging situation due to Indian baseless propaganda and unilateral action”, <em>APP</em> quoted a press release from the PMO as saying.</p>
<p>He also affirmed that China would always support Pakistan to achieve the common desire of both countries to secure peace and stability in South Asia.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz conveyed his warm wishes to President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang, expressing sincere thanks to China for its strong and steadfast support to Pakistan amid the prevailing situation in the region.</p>
<p>Recalling a telephonic conversation between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and FM Ishaq Dar on April 27, the premier thanked China for understanding Pakistan’s principled position vis-à-vis India’s actions since April 22.</p>

<p>Separately, Pakistan’s envoy to the United States has asked President Donald Trump to step in and help ease soaring tensions with India, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.newsweek.com/exclusive-pakistan-calls-trump-help-prevent-nuclear-war-india-2066116" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> by <em>Newsweek</em>.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh told <em>Newsweek</em> yesterday that for a president “standing for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration” — referring to Trump — there was no “higher or flashier flashpoint” than the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“If we have a president who is standing for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration, to establish a legacy as a peacemaker — or as someone who finished wars, defied wars and played a role in de-confliction, resolving the disputes — I don’t think there is any higher or flashier flash point, particularly in nuclear terms, as Kashmir,” Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855847">Rizwan Saeed Sheikh</a> told <em>Newsweek</em>.</p>
<p>“We are not talking about one or two countries in that neighbourhood who <em>[sic]</em> are nuclear-capable. So, that is how grave it is,” he said in an interview with the US magazine.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=Overseas%20wars%20and%20plans%20for%20peace">inaugural speech</a> as the US president, Trump had said: “My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.” A ceasefire, which has now been violated, was secured between <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886289">Israel and Hamas</a> following Trump’s election, and he has also been engaging with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906950">Ukraine and Russia</a> to halt their war.</p>
<p>According to <em>Newsweek</em>, Sheikh contended that the Trump administration would need to pursue a more comprehensive and sustained initiative than in past US attempts to defuse crises that have erupted between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>“I think with this threat that we are facing, there is a latent opportunity to address the situation by not just [focusing] on an immediate de-escalatory measure, or a de-escalatory approach,” the envoy said.</p>
<p>He called for a more durable and lasting solution to the Kashmir dispute, “rather than allowing the situation to stay precarious and pop up again and again at the next drop of a hat on this side or that side”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>During his interview, Sheikh emphasised that the Kashmir issue was the root cause of all troubles between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>“Until and unless that final settlement is made and the resolutions dictate the prescribed solution is allowed to play out, we will all keep having these problems,” Sheikh said. “That’s why we insist on the United States and others playing a role in this situation and getting the de-confliction part activated,” he added.</p>
<p>If the long-standing dispute was resolved, the ambassador said, the population of South Asia could live in peace. “All the other issues between Pakistan and India are not major issues,” he noted.</p>
<p>“We do not want to fight, particularly with a bigger country,” Sheikh said. “We want peace. It suits our economic agenda; it suits our nationhood. It suits every objective that we have currently. But we want peace with dignity.</p>
<p>“We would not want to do it, but if it is imposed, then we would rather die with dignity than survive with indignity,” Sheikh asserted.</p>
<p>The call for Trump to play a role in reducing the tensions came the same day as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was expected to speak to top Pakistani and Indian leaders.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In his phone call with Rubio yesterday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif urged the US to press India to “dial down the rhetoric and act responsibly”.</p>
<p>In a readout of the call with PM Shehbaz, issued by the US State Department, Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said: “Both leaders reaffirmed their continued commitment to holding terrorists accountable for their heinous acts of violence.”</p>
<p>“The secretary (Rubio) urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in investigating this unconscionable attack. He also encouraged Pakistan to work with India to de-escalate tensions, re-establish direct communications, and maintain peace and security in South Asia,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile conversation with India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Rubio “encouraged India to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia”.</p>

<p>Sheikh, reiterating Pakistan’s stance, rejected any involvement of his country in the Pahalgam attack, arguing that the fallout of such an operation could only serve to harm rather than benefit Pakistan’s interests.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is focusing on a matter of a deliberate, considered, pronounced shift of our foreign policy, a pivot from geopolitics to geoeconomics,” the envoy told <em>Newsweek</em>.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“We are focused on the geoeconomics side of our geography and our foreign policy. We are currently economically ascendant,” the official said, stressing that Pakistan only needed a “peaceful neighbourhood” in terms of the broader region.</p>
<p>Terming it “so outlandish, so far-fetched, to blame Pakistan” for the Pahalgam attack, Sheikh said Islamabad was awaiting evidence from New Delhi to prove a link between the incident and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Moreover, the envoy said the attack could be a “false flag operation” conducted to intentionally lay the blame on Pakistan. He acknowledged he could not yet back up the claim, but there was “enough circumstantial evidence, history, […] immediate backdrop and setting […] to entertain that possibility.</p>
<p>Speaking about India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">unilateral suspension</a> last week of the IWT, Sheikh warned that if there was “even an attempt or a semblance of an attempt” to stop or hold water, then it would be a declaration of war.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>While contending that it was “physically impossible” to hold water, the envoy said “all bets are off if it’s about food security of 250 million people”.</p>
<p>“If you threaten me with this kind of a situation, which is existential, what is your expectation of response?” he asked.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Indian Embassy in Washington <a class="link--external" href="https://www.newsweek.com/indian-embassy-terrorists-behind-attack-will-brought-justice-2066403" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Newsweek</em></a> in a statement: “The terrorists behind the attack will be brought to justice.” It termed Sheikh’s remarks a “crude attempt to rewrite history and gloss over facts”.</p>

<p>The spokesperson stated that the Wagah border “will remain open for Pakistani citizens in the future as well”, according to the statement.</p>
<p>“The Indian decision to revoke visas of Pakistani citizens is creating serious humanitarian challenges,” Khan added. “Many patients, with fragile health, had to return to Pakistan without completing their treatment.</p>

<p>“We have announced a 10-day break for all madressahs in Kashmir,” said Hafiz Nazeer Ahmed, the head of Kashmir’s Department of Religious Affairs.</p>
<p>Ahmad told <em>Reuters</em> that security officials feared Indian forces may target seminaries and label them as militant training centres. The notification seen by <em>Reuters</em>, dated April 30, only cited a heatwave as the reason for the closure.</p>
