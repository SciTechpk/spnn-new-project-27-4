            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday said Pakistan and Turkiye were pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) for Turkish entrepreneurs in Karachi.</p>
<p>The announcement came after Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan arrived in Islamabad earlier today on an official visit. Turkiye’s Minister of National Defence Yasar Guler is also visiting Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Turkiye enjoy strong bilateral ties built on shared cultural, religious and historical bonds, as well as mutual respect. In February, the two countries pledged to boost bilateral trade to $5 billion as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891671">visited</a> Islamabad.</p>
<p>“We are pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone dedicated to Turkish entrepreneurs at Karachi,” Dar said, addressing a press conference alongside Fidan at the Foreign Office (FO).</p>

<p>Dar also mentioned other engagements, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753314">revival</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1665062/freight-train-launched-to-link-istanbul-with-tehran-islamabad">Istanbul-Tehran-Islamabad</a> train, saying, “Our delegations are meeting in the coming weeks to finalise the roadmap for revival.”</p>
<p>The deputy PM further said that Pakistan has allocated land for the construction of a Maarif School in Muzaffarabad, referring to the Turkish Maarif Foundation, which Fidan said has more than 80 schools in Pakistan.</p>
<p>“A Maarif Foundation delegation is visiting Muzaffarabad today and visiting the site for evaluation,” he said.</p>
<p>Dar further stated that Turkish companies were being considered for undertaking the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1883728">Jinnah Medical Complex</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910839">Daanish University</a> megaprojects in Islamabad.</p>
<p>The Turkish companies will also be participating in offshore drilling projects and the privatisation of electricity distribution companies (Discos) in the power sector, he highlighted.</p>
<p>“We are actively engaged in different activities, including capacity building and counterterrorism,” Dar asserted.</p>
<p>He appreciated Turkiye’s indigenisation of the defence industry from 20 per cent to 80pc in the last few years, adding: “We would like to benefit from Turkiye’s experience and expertise.”</p>
<p>In his remarks, the Turkish foreign minister said defence cooperation will be further strengthened in the coming days, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/09-07-2025/pakistan-turkiye-vow-to-strengthen-economic-defence-ties" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Fidan called it a “strategic step”, emphasising that it was very important for the security of Pakistan and Turkiye. He asserted that both countries will continue to support each other in countering terrorism. Over a month ago, the two nations conducted a joint operation and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914759/is-operative-captured-at-pak-afghan-border-in-joint-pak-turkiye-intelligence-operation">arrested</a> a high-ranking terrorist.</p>
<p>Referring to the recent Pakistan-India conflict, Fidan was “appreciative of Pakistan’s wisdom-oriented attitude”, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> stated.</p>
<p>He noted that Turkiye and Pakistan were intensifying their cooperation in the field of energy, including mining, precious stones, natural gas and oil. The minister also highlighted that the two nations have expanded their relations in other fields, such as the economy, education and culture.</p>
<p>Fidan reiterated the countries’ aim to increase their commercial relations to $5bn and expressed the firm resolve to take Pakistan-Turkiye relations to a higher level, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> added.</p>
<p>Following their meetings, Dar wrote on X: “Held productive discussions on the entire gamut of bilateral relations and exchanged views on key regional and global developments.</p>
<p>’“Pakistan and Türkiye share deep-rooted bonds of brotherhood, mutual trust, and strategic cooperation,” the deputy PM stressed.</p>

<p>Separately, a high-level delegation led by Guler called on Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) chief, at the Air Headquarters in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Both officials agreed on the establishment of “dedicated joint working groups to streamline and accelerate progress across various sectors of mutual interest”, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7347" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).</p>
<p>The meeting encompassed discussions on evolving regional security dynamics, progress of ongoing defence cooperation and prospects for future collaboration in emerging domains of warfare, ISPR said.</p>

<p>The Turkish defence minister expressed sincere gratitude to the air chief for the warm reception and gracious hospitality extended by the PAF.</p>
<p>He lauded PAF’s “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">exceptional performance</a> under the insightful leadership of the air chief in the recent conflict with India, commending its operational preparedness and resolute defence of national sovereignty”, the ISPR said.</p>
<p>“Highlighting the longstanding fraternal ties between Turkiye and Pakistan, Yasar Guler conveyed Turkiye’s earnest desire to bolster bilateral defence relations through deeper industry-to-industry collaboration,” the ISPR highlighted.</p>
<p>Guler “particularly emphasised the need to explore joint ventures in cutting-edge domains, including niche disruptive technologies, advanced avionics and unmanned aerial systems”, the statement said.</p>
<p>The Turkish defence minister expressed his appreciation for PAF’s continued support in the pilot exchange programme, which he termed as a “vital initiative for fostering professional growth and operational understanding” between the two air forces.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the Air Chief Marshal Sidhu highlighted the enduring brotherly ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, emphasising the common aspirations and strategic convergence that bind the two nations.</p>

<p>He reaffirmed PAF’s “steadfast resolve to further strengthen bilateral cooperation in the domains of advanced training and aerospace technologies”, the military’s media wing said.</p>
<p>“Both dignitaries concurred on finalising the modalities for enhanced training collaboration and reaffirmed their strong commitment to expanding the scale and scope of joint bilateral and multilateral air exercises,” according to the ISPR.</p>
<p>The military’s media wing noted that the visit reflected the shared commitment of both nations to enhance strategic cooperation, solidify defence ties and promote “lasting institutional linkages” between the armed forces of Pakistan and Turkiye.</p>

            <p><p>The Rawalpindi Police on Wednesday said they arrested a man for allegedly killing his daughter for ‘honour’ over not deleting her account on social media platform TikTok.</p>
<p>The first information report (FIR) of the case was registered at Rawat Police Station a day ago on the complaint of Head Constable Shahbaz Anjum Kayani under Section 302 (Punishment of qatl-i-amd), and Section 311 (Waiver or compounding of qisas) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p>
<p>Under Section 311, the state becomes the complainant, as this provision is non-compoundable, and the case must proceed to a logical conclusion. The punishment for ‘honour’ killings, under Sections 311 and 302, includes the death sentence or life imprisonment. The option for a 25-year sentence under Section 302C is not applicable when Section 311 is invoked.</p>
<p>The FIR said the incident occurred at 11:30am a day ago in Dhok Chaudhrian, within the limits of the Rawat Police Station when Kayani received a tipoff from a source about the suspect asking his daughter to delete her TikTok account, but she refused. He added that the suspect was angered and shot his daughter in the name of ‘honour’, fleeing after the crime.</p>
<p>A statement from the police said they had arrested the victim’s father and recovered the murder weapon, a pistol, from his possession, adding that three teams were formed under the supervision of Saddar Superintendent of Police  Nabeel Khokhar for the task.</p>
<p>Rawalpindi City Police Officer (CPO) Syed Khalid Mehmood Hamdani told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the “police registered the case as a complaint because the family of the deceased was portraying the incident as suicide. Later, police investigation revealed it was a murder. The police filed the case to avoid any compromise in future.</p>
<p>“Similar cases were registered earlier too, but when a family member becomes the complainant, they reach a compromise after six months or a year. Police registered the case as the complaintant to charge the suspect with solid evidence.”</p>
<p>The police further said that the postmortem analysis had been conducted, evidence was collected from the crime scene and investigations were ongoing from all angles.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917419">TikTok</a> is wildly popular in Pakistan, in part because of its accessibility to a population with low literacy levels. On it, women have found both audience and income, rare in a country where fewer than a quarter of the women participate in the formal economy.</p>
<p>Last month, popular social media influencer, Sana Yousuf, was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915267">shot dead</a> at her house in Islamabad by a man whose advances she had repeatedly rejected, police said.</p>
<p>Yousaf had racked up more than a million followers on social media. The incident sparked public outrage and widespread media coverage. The case remains under investigation.</p>
<p>Cases of honour killings are prevalent in Pakistan. From January to November last year, a total of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881836/honour-crimes-continued-to-persist-in-2024-threatening-pakistani-womens-lives">346 people</a> fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p>
<p>The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to so-called ‘honour’. In 2023, the country saw a total of 490 ‘honour’ killing incidents taking place, while in 2022, as many as 590 people lost their lives to ‘honour’ killings.</p>
<p>In January, a man who had recently brought his family back to Pakistan from the United States confessed to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1888565">shooting dead</a> his teenage daughter, motivated by his disappr­oval of her TikTok content.</p>
<p>In December, Amina Bibi, a mother of three, was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879419/two-arrested-for-acid-attack-on-woman-neighbour#:~:text=In%20another%20incident%2C%20a%20middle%2Daged%20married%20woman%20was%20shot%20dead%20by%20her%20brother%20in%20the%20Qasimpur%20area%20of%20tehsil%20Pakpattan.">shot dead</a> by her brother, Zafar Hussain, in the Qasimpur area of Pakpattan. Hussain told the police he thought his sister had a “questionable character”.</p>
<p>In November, a mother of five was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875190">brutally killed</a> in Faisalabad by her husband and younger brother, allegedly to protect the family’s ‘honour’. Accused of having an affair, the victim was attacked at home with bricks, leading to fatal injuries. Her body was later dumped in a nullah through a donkey cart.</p>
<p>A man <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866339">murdered</a> four women in his family in October, including his mother, in a fit of rage over their TikTok videos. He told the police the videos spread “immodesty and shamelessness, tarnishing the family’s reputation”.</p></p>

            <p><p>One person was killed while three children were injured after militants carried out two quadcopter attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Wednesday, according to police.</p>
<p>The incident comes after reports of multiple quadcopter and drone attacks in KP and Balochistan over the past year. In March, at least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901160/11-killed-in-mardan-security-action">11 people</a> were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, while in May, a suspected quadcopter munitions drop <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912007/locals-stage-sit-in-as-kp-minister-denounces-killing-of-3-children-in-alleged-north-waziristan-drone-strike">claimed</a> the lives of four children and injured five others in North Waziristan District’s Mir Ali tehsil. The military <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912393/security-forces-falsely-implicated-in-north-waziristan-incident-ispr">clarified</a> that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “Two quadcopter incidents occurred in the district today. In the first quadcopter attack by militants, one woman was killed while three children were injured, including two of the woman’s children.”</p>
<p>The woman’s body and the injured people were taken to the hospital for medical assistance, he added.</p>
<p>DPO Kulachi said that another quadcopter attack occurred where terrorists attacked the Maryan police station, damaging the station’s solar panels on the rooftop.</p>
<p>He said, “The police personnel remained safe in the attack,” adding that it was the third such militant attack on the same police station.</p>
<p>“A search operation was underway in the area to track down the terrorists,” he added.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities recently, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Bannu has seen several militant attacks over the past several months.</p>
<p>On Saturday, one person was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922294/jirga-member-killed-3-injured-by-armed-suspects-firing-in-bannu-police">killed</a> and three others were injured after armed assailants attacked a jirga in the district.</p>
<p>In March, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895956">16 terrorists</a> were killed while five soldiers were martyred as security forces responded to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895785">terrorist attack</a> on the Bannu Cantonment.</p>
<p>The incident resulted in the deaths of 13 civilians and injured 32 others after “severe destruction” of a mosque and a residential building due to the suicide blasts, causing the perimeter wall to partially collapse.</p></p>
