                <h2>Teenager dead, 2 terrorists killed as govt offices attacked in Mastung</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Security forces eliminated two ‚ÄúIndia-backed‚Äù terrorists after an attack on government offices in Balochistan‚Äôs Mastung district that killed a teenager and injured seven others on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Terrorists in Balochistan, previously engaged in a low-level insurgency, have recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896269">intensified</a> their attacks. The banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) emerged as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1882568">key perpetrator</a> of terrorist violence in Pakistan in 2024.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTwo terrorists were killed while another three were injured in an intense fire exchange between the security forces and the terrorists,‚Äù Balochistan spokesperson Shahid Rind said in a statement.</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Fitna al Hindustan</em> attacked the tehsil office, government offices and a bank. A 16-year-old boy died while seven individuals were injured by the terrorists‚Äô firing,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>The term ‚Äú<em><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357#:~:text=state%2Dsponsored%20proxies%20of%20India%20(Fitna%20al%20Hindustan)">Fitna al Hindu¬≠stan</a></em>‚Äù is a new phrase coined by Pakistan‚Äôs military, aimed at framing India‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">alleged role</a> in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Frontier Constabulary, Counter-Terrorism Department and Levies immediately cordoned off the area, crushing the terrorists,‚Äù Rind asserted. An intense fire exchange occurred after the security forces ‚Äúencircled‚Äù the terrorists, he added.</p>
<p>Mastung Deputy Commissioner Athar Abbas Raja also confirmed the attack to <em>Dawn.com</em>, adding, ‚ÄúHeavy firing and blasts [were] heard in the small town at around 11am.‚Äù</p>

<p>Action against the perpetrators was ongoing while an ‚Äúorganised‚Äù clearance operation was also underway at the site of the incident, according to the government statement.</p>
<p>It added that search efforts to trace the facilitators of the attackers had also been initiated. The operation to ‚Äúprotect citizens and arrest terrorists‚Äù was based on intelligence input, Rind said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe immediate response by the security forces was effective in preventing further loss of lives,‚Äù the government official highlighted.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#uptick-in-terrorism" id="uptick-in-terrorism" title="Permalink"></a>Uptick in terrorism</h2>
<p>Militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in the country last month, according to data <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914847/militant-attacks-increased-to-85-in-may-pakistan-institute-for-conflict-and-security-studies">released</a> by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, which recorded 85 attacks in May compared to 81 in April.</p>
<p>In one of the recent major attacks, a school bus in Balochistan‚Äôs Khuzdar was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357">targeted</a> on May 21, leaving eight children among <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913363">10 dead</a>.</p>
<p>In April, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904388">three policemen</a> were martyred and at least 16 others were injured as a blast targeted a vehicle of the Balochistan Constabulary on Mastung‚Äôs Dasht Road.</p>
<p>Last month, security forces killed two ‚ÄúIndian sponsored terrorists‚Äù in Balochistan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921014/2-terrorists-killed-2-arrested-in-balochistans-duki-district-ispr">Duki district</a> and another two in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915835">Kachhi</a>.</p>

<p>On June 18, a man and a woman were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918035">shot dead</a> when unknown gunmen opened fire at them in the Surgaz area, a locality on the outskirts of Mastung town. Another woman and a child sitting in the car were injured in the firing.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>The country ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>

                <h2>Sahiwal police arrest 3 for allegedly sharing sectarian content on social media</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Sahiwal police said on Tuesday they arrested three men in separate cases over the last 24 hours for allegedly sharing hate speech, blasphemous content and sectarian material on social media.</p>
<p>The Punjab government had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919931">ordered</a> a crackdown on hateful content on social media alongside stringent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918677/section-144-announced-across-punjab-from-muharram-1-10">security measures</a>, such as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920725/army-to-be-deployed-across-country-for-security-during-muharram">army deployment</a>, as the country gears up to observe <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920308">Ashura</a> (Muharram 10) on July 6.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll suspects were arrested following the registration of three FIRs (first information reports),‚Äù Sahiwal District Police Officer (DPO) Rana Tahir said, referring to the three men booked in the past two days.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe police are maintaining zero tolerance to such incidents,‚Äù DPO Tahir asserted.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOur message to the youth is clear: they must exercise caution while using social media, especially in ways that could hurt sectarian beliefs or sacred symbols.‚Äù</p>
<p>The police officer stressed the urgent need to educate young people about the responsible use of social media platforms.</p>
<p>The arrests were made under sections <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/1860/actXLVof1860.html#:~:text=Deliberate%20and%20malicious%20acts%20intended%20to%20outrage%20religious%20feelings%20of%20any%20class%20by%20insulting%20Its%20religion%20or%20religious%20beliefs%3A" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">295-A</a> (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/1860/actXLVof1860.html#:~:text=Use%20of%20derogatory%20remarks%2C%20etc.%2C%20in%20respect%20of%20holy%20personages%3A" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">298-A</a> (use of derogatory remarks, etc, in respect of holy personages) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), as well as section 11 (hate speech) of the <a class="link--external" href="https://pakistancode.gov.pk/english/UY2FqaJw1-apaUY2Fqa-apaUY2Jvbp8%253D-sg-jjjjjjjjjjjjj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act</a> (Peca) 2016.</p>
<p>The three complaints, two of which were filed on June 29 and one on June 30, detailed the content of social media posts in which remarks ‚Äúinciting sectarian hatred‚Äù against the Shia community were made.</p>
<p>A FIR  filed at the City Sahiwal police station by Sub-Inspector (SI) Mohammad Azhar mentioned two Facebook posts shared by an account.</p>

<p>The third FIR registered at the Ghala Mandi Station by SI Aakash Rohail was based on a WhatsApp status, a screenshot of which was printed and kept in police custody.</p>
<p>Days ago, Sahiwal‚Äôs Okanwala Bangla police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920920">booked two individuals</a> in separate cases for allegedly spreading sectarian hatred and sharing blasphemous content on social media under sections 295-A and <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/1860/actXLVof1860.html#:~:text=Person%20of%20Quadiani%20group%2C%20etc.%2C%20calling%20himself%20a%20Muslim%20or%20preaching%20or%20propagating%20his%20faith" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">298-C</a> (person of Ahmadi community calling himself a Muslim or propagating his faith) of the PPC and section 11 of Peca.</p></p>
