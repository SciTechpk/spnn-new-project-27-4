            <p><p>Shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) climbed by 5,878 points a few hours after it opened on Tuesday, in the wake of  US President Donald Trump announcing a complete ceasefire between Israel and Iran to end a 12-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">war</a>.</p>
<p>Global shares rallied and the dollar extended declines as a ceasefire to end a 12-day war between Iran and Israel came into effect, while oil prices dived to nearly two-week lows on easing concerns about supply disruptions, <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>
<p>The KSE-100 index climbed 5,878.15 points, or 5.06 per cent, to stand at an intraday high of 122,045.62 from the last close of 116,167.47 yesterday. At 11:26am, a PSX notice informed that due to a 5pc increase in the KSE-30 index from the previous trading day close of the index, a market halt had been triggered as per PSX regulations and all equity and equity-based markets have been suspended accordingly.</p>
<p>The market reopened after a gap of an hour at 12:31pm.</p>
<p>The PSX had endured a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919518/psx-plunges-3855-points-on-geopolitical-jitters">sharp sell-off</a> on Monday, as escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East — sparked by reported US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and Tehran’s threat to close the Strait of Hormuz — sent shockwaves through global markets, triggering panic selling and wiping out more than 3,800 points from the benchmark KSE-100 index.</p>
<p>The Israeli government said it had achieved all its objectives in the war with Iran, and that it had agreed to the US-proposed ceasefire after removing the “dual existential threat” of Tehran’s nuclear programme and ballistic missiles.
Israel nonetheless warned it would “respond forcefully” to any Iranian violation of the truce.</p>
<p>Oil prices fell 5pc after Israel agreed to the proposal.</p>
<p>The ceasefire agreement, as outlined by Trump on social media in a surprise late-night post, would see the arch enemies stop firing in staggered phases.</p>
<p>According to Trump, Iran would unilaterally halt all operations beginning 4am GMT (9am PKT) on Tuesday, with Israel following suit 12 hours later.</p>
<p>After Trump’s announcement, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi posted on social media that “as of now, there is no ‘agreement’ on ceasefire or cessation of military operations”.</p>
<p>However, he added that if Israel stopped “its illegal aggression”, Tehran would have “no intention to continue our response afterwards”.</p>

            <p><p>Israel’s military said Iran launched waves of missiles on Tuesday, with emergency services reporting four people killed, hours after US President Donald Trump announced a complete ceasefire between Israel and Iran to end a 12-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">war</a>.</p>
<p>Witnesses said they heard explosions near Tel Aviv and Beersheba in southern Israel.</p>
<p>Israel’s military said six waves of missiles were launched by Iran and Israel’s national ambulance service said four people were killed in Beersheba, the first reported deaths in Israel since Trump announced the ceasefire late on Monday.</p>
<p>Trump said on Tuesday a ceasefire between Israel and Iran was now in place and asked both countries not to violate it, only hours after Iran launched waves of missiles, which Israel’s ambulance service said killed four people.</p>
<p>“The ceasefire is now in effect. Please do not violate it!” he said in a Truth Social post.</p>
<p>Earlier, a senior White House official said Trump had brokered a ceasefire deal in a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel had agreed so long as Iran did not launch further attacks.</p>
<p>“On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, ‘THE 12 DAY WAR’,” Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114734934153569653" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on his Truth Social site.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>An Iranian official earlier confirmed that Tehran had agreed to a ceasefire, but the country’s foreign minister said there would be no cessation of hostilities unless Israel stopped its attacks.</p>
<p>Abbas Araqchi <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/araghchi/status/1937311435882922420" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> early on Tuesday that if Israel stopped its “illegal aggression” against the Iranian people no later than 4am Tehran time (5:30am PKT) on Tuesday, Iran had no intention of continuing its response afterwards.</p>
<p>“The final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later,” Araqchi added in a post on X.</p>

<p>Trump appeared to suggest that Israel and Iran would have some time to complete any missions that are underway, at which point the ceasefire would begin in a staged process.</p>
<p>Iran’s semi-official <em>SNN</em> news agency reported on Tuesday that Tehran fired its last round of missiles before the ceasefire came into effect.</p>
<p>Israel, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">joined</a> by the United States on the weekend, has carried out <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">attacks</a> on Iran’s nuclear facilities, after alleging Tehran was getting close to obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>Iran <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denies</a> ever having a nuclear weapons program but Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has said that if it wanted to, world leaders “wouldn’t be able to stop us”.</p>
<p>Israel, which is not a party to the international Non-Proliferation Treaty, is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.</p>
<p>Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani secured Tehran’s agreement during a call with Iranian officials, an official briefed on the negotiations told <em>Reuters</em> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>US Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US special envoy Steve Witkoff were in direct and indirect contact with the Iranians, a White House official said.</p>
<p>Neither Irans UN mission nor the Israeli embassy in Washington responded to separate requests for comment from <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>Hours earlier, three Israeli officials had signaled Israel was looking to wrap up its campaign in Iran soon and had passed the message on to the United States.</p>
<p>Netanyahu had told government ministers whose discussions ended early on Tuesday not to speak publicly, Israel’s <em>Channel 12</em> television reported.</p>
<p>Markets reacted favourably to the news. S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.4 per cent late on Monday, suggesting traders expect the US stock market to open with gains on Tuesday.</p>
<p>US crude futures fell in early Asian trading hours on Tuesday to their lowest level in more than a week after Trump said a ceasefire had been agreed, relieving worries of supply disruption in the region.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#end-to-the-fighting" id="end-to-the-fighting" title="Permalink"></a>End to the fighting?</h2>
<p>There did not appear to be calm yet in the region.</p>
<p>The Israeli military issued two evacuation warnings in less than two hours to residents of areas in the Iranian capital Tehran, one late on Monday and one early on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Israeli Army radio reported early on Tuesday that alarms were activated in the southern Golan Heights area due to fears of hostile aircraft intrusion.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, Trump said he would encourage Israel to proceed towards peace after dismissing Iran’s attack on an American air base that caused no injuries and thanking Tehran for the early notice of the strikes.</p>
<p>He said Iran fired 14 missiles at the US air base, calling it “a very weak response, which we expected, and have very effectively countered”.</p>
<p>Iran’s handling of the attack recalled earlier clashes with the United States and Israel, with Tehran seeking a balance between saving face with a military response but without provoking a cycle of escalation it can’t afford.</p>
<p>Iran’s attack came after US bombers dropped 30,000-pound <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842#:~:text=The%20US%20strikes%20included%2014%20bunker%2Dbuster%20bombs%2C%20more%20than%20two%20dozen%20submarine%2Dlaunched%20Tomahawk%20missiles%20and%20over%20125%20military%20aircraft%2C%20the%20top%20general%20added.">bunker-buster bombs</a> on Iranian underground nuclear facilities at the weekend, joining Israel’s air war.</p>
<p>Much of Tehran’s population of 10 million has fled after days of bombing.</p>
<p>The Trump administration maintains that its aim was solely to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, not to open a wider war.</p>
<p>“Iran was very close to having a nuclear weapon,” Vice President JD Vance said in an interview on <em>Fox News</em>’ “Special Report with Bret Baier.”</p>
<p>“Now Iran is incapable of building a nuclear weapon with the equipment they have because we destroyed it,” Vance said.</p>
<p>Trump has cited intelligence reports that Iran was close to building a nuclear weapon, without elaborating.</p>
<p>However, US intelligence agencies said earlier this year they assessed that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and a source with access to US intelligence reports told <em>Reuters</em> last week that that assessment hadn’t changed.</p>
<p>In a social media post on Sunday, Trump spoke of toppling the hardline clerical rulers who have been Washington’s principal foes in the Middle East since Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution.</p>
<p>Israel, however, had made clear that its strikes on Evin prison — a jail for housing political prisoners — and other targets in Tehran were intended to hit the Iranian ruling apparatus broadly, and its ability to sustain power.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919657/supreme-court-lifts-limits-on-trump-deporting-migrants-to-countries-not-their-own' target='_blank'><strong>Supreme Court lifts limits on Trump deporting migrants to countries not their own</strong></a>
            <p><p>The US Supreme Court cleared the way on Monday for President Donald Trump’s administration to resume <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910913">deporting</a> migrants to countries other than their own without offering them a chance to show the harm they could face, handing him another victory in his aggressive pursuit of mass deportations.</p>
<p>In an action that prompted a sharp dissent from its three liberal justices, the court granted the administration’s request to lift a judicial order requiring that migrants set for deportation to so-called “third countries” get a “meaningful opportunity” to tell US officials they are at risk of torture at their new destination, while a legal challenge plays out.</p>
<p>Boston-based US District Judge Brian Murphy had issued the order on April 18.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s brief order was unsigned and offered no reasoning, as is common when it decides emergency requests. The court has a 6-3 conservative majority.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by the two other liberal justices, called the decision a “gross abuse” of the court’s power.</p>
<p>“Apparently, the court finds the idea that thousands will suffer violence in far-flung locales more palatable than the remote possibility that a district court exceeded its remedial powers when it ordered the government to provide notice and process to which the plaintiffs are constitutionally and statutorily entitled,” Sotomayor wrote.</p>
<p>Sotomayor called the court’s action “as incomprehensible as it is inexcusable.”</p>
<p>Murphy had found that the administration’s policy of “executing third-country removals without providing notice and a meaningful opportunity to present fear-based claims” likely violates the US Constitution’s due process protections. Due process generally requires the government to provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing before taking certain adverse actions.</p>
<p>After the Department of Homeland Security moved in February to step up rapid deportations to third countries, immigrant rights groups filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of a group of migrants seeking to prevent their removal to such places without notice and to gain chance to assert the harms they could face.</p>
<p>Murphy on May 21 found the Trump administration violated his order requiring additional steps before attempting to send a group of migrants to politically unstable South Sudan, which the US State Department has urged Americans to avoid “due to crime, kidnapping and armed conflict.” The judge’s intervention prompted the US government to keep the migrants at a military base in Djibouti.</p>
<p>After the US Supreme Court ruling, Murphy in a court order made clear that his decision preventing the rapid deportation of eight men to South Sudan “remains in full force and effect.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Trina Realmuto, executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, which helps represent the plaintiffs, called the ramifications of the court’s action “horrifying,” stripping away “critical due process protections that have been protecting our class members from torture and death.”</p>
<p>The administration told the Supreme Court that its third-country policy already complied with due process and is critical for removing migrants who commit crimes because their countries of origin are often unwilling to take them back. It said that all the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902475">South Sudan-destined</a> migrants had committed “heinous crimes” in the United States, including murder, arson and armed robbery.</p>
<p>“The Supreme Court’s stay of a left-wing district judge’s injunction reaffirms the president’s authority to remove criminal illegal aliens from our country and Make America Safe Again,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said after Monday’s decision.</p>
<p>“Fire up the deportation planes,” said Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#a-flood-of-cases" id="a-flood-of-cases" title="Permalink"></a>A flood of cases</h2>
<p>The dispute is one of many legal challenges to Trump policies to have reached the nation’s highest judicial body since he returned to office in January.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court in May let Trump end <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891343">humanitarian programs</a> for hundreds of thousands of migrants to live and work in the United States temporarily. The justices, however, faulted the administration’s treatment of some migrants whom Trump targeted for removal under the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898591/trump-admin-defies-court-deports-200-venezuelans#:~:text=President%20Donald%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20use%20of%20the%20Alien%20Enemies%20Act%E2%80%99s%20wartime%20powers%20to%20rapidly%20deport%20more%20than%20200%20alleged%20members%20of%20Tren%20de%20Aragua">Alien Enemies Act</a> — a 1798 law that historically has been employed only in wartime — as inadequate under constitutional due process protections.</p>
<p>Sotomayor said that in sending migrants to South Sudan, and in another instance four others to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and on to El Salvador, the administration “openly flouted two court orders” issued by Murphy. Sotomayor also pointed to the separate Alien Enemies Act litigation in which questions were raised about the administration’s compliance with an order issued by a judge in that case.</p>
<p>“This is not the first time the court closes its eyes to noncompliance, nor, I fear, will it be the last,” Sotomayor wrote.</p>
<p>“Yet <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914616">each time</a> this court rewards noncompliance with discretionary relief, it further erodes respect for courts and for the rule of law.”</p>
<p>The administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene after the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals on May 16 declined to put Murphy’s decision on hold.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> has also reported that US officials had been considering sending migrants to Libya, another politically unstable country, despite previous US condemnation of Libya’s harsh treatment of detainees.</p></p>

Many Zambians have raised the issue of this looting for years, but have met coordinated resistance. Consequently, Zambia’s treasury loses billions of dollars in revenue. These losses are driven by well-known multinationals working in concert with certain insiders close&nbsp;to the Zambian state.</p><p>Your editorial also says: “The US decision to cut $50m a year in aid to Zambia … is dreadful, and the reason given, corruption, rings hollow.” Alas, I disagree and wish to place this in context.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/ordinary-zambians-lose-out-twice-to-global-looting-and-local-corruption">Continue reading...</a></p>
