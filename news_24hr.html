            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927618/imran-in-really-poor-conditions-and-getting-worse-his-son-kasim-says' target='_blank'><strong>Imran in ‘really poor conditions and getting worse’, his son Kasim says</strong></a>
            <p><p>Incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s son Kasim Khan has highlighted that his father was jailed in “really poor conditions” that were “getting worse by the moment”.</p>
<p>Imran’s sons — Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim, 26 — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910789">called attention</a> to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Earlier this month, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">said</a> Sulaiman and Kasim will go to the United States before coming to Pakistan as part of a movement calling for the ex-premier’s release. The siblings visited the US and engaged US lawmakers on the issue of their father’s incarceration.</p>
<p>Imran, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a> since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.</p>
<p>In an interview on US media outlet <em>Real America’s Voice</em> shared today, Kasim said, “Right now he’s in really, really poor conditions and it looks like they’re getting worse and worse by the moment. So we’re looking for any way out possible.”</p>
<p>While emphasising that Imran was “incarcerated in a solitary confinement cell”, he said, “The state of the cell he’s in is awful, quite frankly.”</p>
<p>He continued, “He’s showering in muddy water.  I don’t mean unfiltered water. It’s muddy, dirty water,” alleging that 10 people who were incarcerated had died from filthy conditions.</p>
<p>Kasim expressed worry over not being able to see his father and said, “There were moments … he went 10 days without any light in his cell,” calling it a “torture tactic”.</p>
<p>“He gets only two hours a day in daylight. We’re not able to speak to him at all,” he added.</p>

<p>Kasim said that he and his brother were “looking to America at the moment” for support, stating, “A lot of the people here have expressed concern. It seems like it might be the only route out at the moment.”</p>
<p>Speaking about meeting US President Donald Trump’s key aide Richard Grenell, he said, “Grennell was very kind to spend some time with us.”</p>
<p>He continued, “We spoke at length and I don’t want to get into details but I’m very, very hopeful from that.”</p>
<p>He said that Imran from a prison cell won the Feb 2024 elections, which went through “vicious rigging”.</p>
<p>“[Despite] the amount of underhand tactics they used before the election to rig it against his favour, [he] still he managed to win.”</p>
<p>Separately, Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan said today that the sons would “definitely” come to Pakistan as they had a National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (Nicop) and they were “citizens of Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“If anything were to happen to Imran’s sons, it would become an international matter,” she told reporters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif remarked, “Why would the government stop Imran’s sons from coming to Pakistan?”</p>
<p>He told reporters in Islamabad that the government did not want PTI to “resort to any violence”. “The PTI will not be allowed to pull off another May 9 or Nov 26.”</p>
<p>A day earlier, PTI swiftly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927421">rubbished</a> media reports claiming that the incarcerated leader told reporters at Adiala Jail that his sons would not be coming to Pakistan and taking part in or leading any protest.</p>
<p>PTI Central Information Secretary Waqas Akram had stated: “The news circulating in the media regarding Imran Khan Sahib’s children is completely false. Imran Khan sahib has absolutely not stopped his children from coming to Pakistan.</p>
<p>“I would request those media friends who report from Adiala to only broadcast exactly what Khan sahib says. It is inappropriate to take things out of context, selectively, or to present conversations according to their own wishes.”</p></p>

            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Wednesday assailed and rejected the Indian parliament’s debate on “Operation Sindoor”, claiming that the remarks made in the Lok Sabha “distort facts, justify aggression, and glorify conflict for domestic consumption”.</p>
<p>The two countries entered a brief but intense <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military escalation</a> after India, without evidence, blamed Pakistan for the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On May 6–7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long missile exchange. A US-brokered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> ended the war.</p>
<p>During Tuesday’s debate, Indian Home Minister Amit Shah <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927416">claimed</a> that security forces killed three “Pakistanis” involved in the Pahalgam attack in Operation Mahadev, <em>Reuters</em> reported. “I want to tell … the entire nation that these were the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927163#:~:text=Indian%20army%20says%20three%20suspected%20fighters%20killed%20in%20held-Kashmir">three terrorists</a> who killed our citizens … and now all three have been killed,” Shah told parliament during the discussion.</p>
<p>In a statement issued today on the Indian parliament debate, FO spokesperson Ambassador Shafqat Ali Khan said: “Pakistan categorically rejects the baseless assertions and provocative claims made by the Indian leaders during the Lok Sabha debate on the so-called ‘Operation Sindoor’. These statements reflect a dangerous tendency to distort facts, justify aggression and glorify conflict for domestic consumption.</p>
<p>“The world knows that India attacked Pakistan without any verifiable evidence or a credible investigation into the Pahalgam Attack. During the intervening night of May 6 and 7, 2025, India’s targeting of the alleged terrorist infrastructure resulted actually in the martyrdom of innocent men, women, and children. India failed to achieve any of its strategic objectives. On the other hand, Pakistan’s resounding success in neutralising the Indian fighter jets and military targets is an indisputable fact.”</p>
<p>He said that “instead of misleading their compatriots, the Indian leaders would be well-advised to acknowledge the losses incurred by their armed forces and accept the active role played by the third parties in realising the ceasefire”.</p>
<p>The FO spokesperson said that India had not used the immediate offer made by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for a transparent and independent probe into the Pahalgam Attack but had instead chosen the “path of belligerence and aggression”.</p>
<p>He further added that India had “acted as a judge, jury and executioner at the same time” and thus in the backdrop of all this, “any claims regarding the so-called ‘Operation Mahadev’ do not hold any significance for us”.</p>
<p>“The account given by the Indian home minister is replete with fabrications, leading to serious questions about its credibility. Is it a mere coincidence that the alleged perpetrators of the Pahalgam Attack were killed at the start of the Lok Sabha debate?”</p>

<p>The FO statement also criticised the Indian government for its statements about establishing a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911476">new normal</a>” in bilateral relations through the strikes and rubbished New Delhi’s narrative of “nuclear blackmail” on the part of Pakistan, calling such claims “a misleading and self-serving construct” that were “an attempt to veil its own escalatory impulses while shifting blame onto Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“For us, the only ‘normal’ in bilateral relations is respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and adherence to the principles and purposes of the UN Charter,” the statement read.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The FO said it was “well known that Pakistan deterred India through its conventional capabilities, affirming that discipline and restraint remain its guiding principles”.</p>
<p>The FO spokesperson also once again expressed disapproval of the “misplaced assertions” by the Indian leadership regarding the Indus Waters Treaty. “India’s decision to hold the treaty in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">abeyance</a> shows its blatant disregard for the sanctity of international treaties, and strikes at a fundamental pillar of regional cooperation,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>He added that India should adhere to the terms of the agreement rather than “taking pride in a unilateral and illegal move”.</p>
<p>“India’s continued reliance on disinformation, jingoism, and chest-thumping risks destabilising South Asia,” the FO stated, reiterating that Pakistan was a “responsible” nation and reaffirming its commitment to “peace, regional stability and a meaningful dialogue for resolution of all outstanding issues”.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927615/multan-police-arrest-suspect-for-molesting-minor-girl-in-viral-video' target='_blank'><strong>Multan police arrest suspect for molesting minor girl in viral video</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Punjab Police on Wednesday said they arrested a man suspected of molesting a minor girl in Multan district after a video of the incident went viral online.</p>
<p>The video of the incident did the rounds on social media earlier in the week and generated intense criticism with calls for the suspect to be arrested, particularly as it came after the police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927180">arrested</a> a man after footage showing him allegedly molesting a minor girl in Kasur district also went viral online.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the Multan Crime Control Department (CCD) today said: “The man who attempted to sexually assault a girl was arrested in an ‘injured’ condition.”</p>
<p>The incident occurred on July 15 in Mustafa Colony, Rashidabad area, with the limits of Bahauddin Zakaria Police Station when “an unknown person tried to sexually assault a girl in the street and fled from the scene”, according to the statement.</p>
<p>A case was registered under Section 377B (unnatural offences with a minor) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) at the BZ Police Station and the investigation of the case was handed over to the CCD.</p>
<p>The statement said the police received a tip-off about the suspect’s whereabouts and conducted a raid at an undisclosed location to arrest him.</p>
<p>“The suspect attempting to evade arrest opened fire on the police team and in a hurry, accidentally fired and injured himself,” the statement said, adding that he was taken to Nishtar Hospital for medical treatment.</p>
<p>“Police identified him through the Criminal Record Office that he was the suspect who molested the minor girl,” the statement added.</p>
<p>It added that the suspect’s criminal record revealed that he was nominated in a case for killing his brother in 2023. The case was registered under Section 302 (punishment for murder) at the BZ Police Station.</p>
<p>As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908682">reported</a> from across the country last year, according to a civil society report. The report <a class="link--external" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BiZQB4r46gbIYR88plzov08iuLzJ606_/view" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cruel Numbers 2024</a> by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.</p>
<p>“The objective of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages,” the report stated.</p>
<p>In January 2018, police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1382022/justice-for-zainab-riots-erupt-in-kasur-after-7-year-olds-rape-murder">recovered</a> the body of six-year-old Zainab Amin from a heap of trash in Kasur, five days after she went missing. A postmortem examination <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1382243">suggested</a> that she may have been raped before she was strangled to death.</p>
<p>The case <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1382022">sparked</a> outrage across the nation and forced the government into action in finding the serial rapist and killer. The culprit, identified as Imran Ali, was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1439400/zainabs-rapist-murderer-imran-ali-hanged-at-kot-lakhpat-jail">convicted</a> of the rape and murder case and sentenced to death. He was hanged to death in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat Central Jail on Oct 17, 2018.</p>
<p>More than two years after the Zainab case, the National Assembly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1540514">passed</a> the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Bill, 2019 that seeks to expedite investigation and punishment for perpetrators of child abuse.</p></p>
