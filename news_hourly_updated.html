‚Ä¢ FO slams Modi‚Äôs allegations<br />
‚Ä¢ UNSC condemns school bus attack</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistani authorities on Friday said they would continue with intelligence-based operations (IBOs) to combat terrorism in Balochistan, instead of launching a large-scale kinetic military campaign at this stage.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe intelligence-based operations would continue,‚Äù said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, director general of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), during a joint press briefing with Federal Interior Secretary Khurram Agha near the military headquarters in neighbouring garrison city of Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>The joint appearance of military and civilian officials underscored the government‚Äôs unified approach to counterterrorism, especially in the wake of escalating regional tensions with India and aggravating security situation in Balochistan.</p>
<p>Their remarks come days after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912542/pm-vows-strong-action-against-perpetrators-after-school-bus-blast-in-khuzdar">suicide attack</a> in Khuzdar targeted a school bus carrying children of military personnel, in which eight people, including six children, were martyred and dozens others were injured. Two more students Haider, 13, and Malika, 12, succumbed to their injuries, bringing the death toll to eight.</p>

</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Pakistan‚Äôs military had accused India of ‚Äúplanning and orchestrating‚Äù the att¬≠ack using its terrorism proxies in the restive province.</p>
<p>Condemning the attack, Interior Secretary Agha said, ‚ÄúThe attack on school bus in Khuzdar was an attack on our values, our education system and the very fabric of our society.‚Äù He added that initial investigations indicated the assault was orchestrated by India-backed terrorist operating as ‚Äú<em>Fitna al Hindustan</em>‚Äù (Indian mischief).</p>
<p>The term ‚Äò<em>Fitna al Hindu¬≠stan</em>‚Äô is a new phrase coined by Pakistan‚Äôs military, aimed at framing India‚Äôs alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>
<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry emphasised that terrorism in Balochistan was being tackled ‚Äúrationally‚Äù, noting that Pakistan had developed advanced counterterrorism techniques through decades of experience.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúIntelligence-based operations are very effective way of dealing with terrorists. We are hunting them down and eliminating them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe number of terrorists killed in these intelligence-based operations are much higher as compared to the large-scale operations.‚Äù</p>
<p>This emphasis on intelligence-based operations highlights the government‚Äôs preference for targeted strikes to minimise collateral damage, possibly in response to past criticisms of heavy-handed military campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Soft targets</strong></p>
<p>The military spokesman said the military is currently conducting nearly 150 IBOs on a daily basis without disrupting civilian life. ‚ÄúThe terrorist groups after suffering heavily at the hands of law-enforcement agencies are now attacking soft targets. This shows the effectiveness of our operations,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Interior Secretary Agha echoed the approach, noting that a broader military campaign akin to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1225922">Operation Zarb-i-Azb</a> could be launched if necessary, but only after all preparatory steps are completed. ‚ÄúIf need be, there can be a major operation like Zarb-i-Azb but that would be at a later stage. Currently, all operations are continuing,‚Äù Agha said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The reference to Zarb-i-Azb, a 2014-17 operation that significantly reduced militancy in the country, signals the government‚Äôs readiness to escalate if IBOs do not bring the problem of terrorism under control, but also its caution to avoid destabilising Balochistan further.</p>
<p>He added that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879059">National Action Plan</a> (NAP) was being ‚Äúreinvigorated‚Äù to support future counterterrorism efforts. ‚ÄúAll facets of the national action plan are being reinvigorated so that all domains including social, economic, legal, counterterrorism, information and political are fully functional,‚Äù he stated. ‚ÄúSo that when we go into a big operation‚Ä¶ all facets are in place.‚Äù</p>
<p>The NAP, introduced in 2014 after the Peshawar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/army-public-school-10-years/">Army Public School attack</a>, is a comprehensive counterterrorism framework. Its reinvigoration suggests a holistic approach to address not just security but also socio-economic drivers of unrest in Balochistan.</p>
<p><strong>Proxies activated</strong></p>
<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry highlighted how synchronised attacks during the night of May 9 and 10 ‚Äî involving 33 terrorist incidents in Balochistan ‚Äî demonstrated collaboration between India and proxy groups in Balochistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt a time when India was firing projectiles and missiles into Pakistan, it had also activated these proxies,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis synchronisation of attacks proved the collaboration between <em>Fitna al Hindustan</em> and India.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He attributed India‚Äôs alleged targeting of Balochistan to Pakistan‚Äôs recent economic advancements in the province. ‚ÄúBalochistan has reached its take-off phase with improvements in the socio-economic sector‚Ä¶ the inauguration of the airport in Gwadar and expansion of road network,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBalochistan‚Äôs terrorism issue is being addressed rationally where military approach is one aspect. The problem is being addressed synergetically by all elements of national power.‚Äù</p>
<p>This holistic approach reflects the recognition that military solutions alone cannot resolve Balochistan‚Äôs complex issues</p>
<p>Agha reiterated the government‚Äôs readiness and resolve: ‚ÄúThe state has the wherewithal and will to dismantle these networks and bring their handlers and perpetrators of these acts of terrorism to justice. Such actions will have consequences‚Ä¶ Our resolve is firm and response will be decisive.‚Äù</p>
<p>Touching on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">recent tensions</a> with India, the DG ISPR warned of dire consequences if provocations continue. ‚ÄúIndia is using terrorism as a tool against Pakistan through <em>Fitna al Hindustan</em> and <em>Fitna al Khawarij</em>,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPakistan is on the other hand maintaining peace as a rational actor through the resolve of the people and the capabilities of the armed forces.‚Äù</p>
<p>He further condemned India‚Äôs ‚Äúarrogant political mindset,‚Äù citing its refusal to address the Kashmir dispute and alleged suppression of minorities as the reasons behind India becoming a source of instability in the region.</p>
<p><strong>FO rejects allegations</strong></p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1912791">categorically rejected</a> the ‚Äúbaseless, provocative, and irresponsible‚Äù allegations made by the Indian prime minister during a recent public address in Rajasthan, asserting that such statements clearly aimed at stoking regional tensions for narrow political gains, <em>APP</em> adds.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe remarks, replete with distortions, misrepresentations, and inflammatory rhetoric, are clearly aimed at stoking regional tensions for narrow political gains. Such statements not only reflect a deliberate attempt to mislead the public but also violate the norms of responsible statecraft,‚Äù Foreign Office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He said that resorting to threats and boasting about military action against a sovereign nation was a grave breach of the UN Charter and established principles of international law and that this dangerous approach also undermined regional peace and stability.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said that Pakistan remained a consistent and proactive partner in the global fight against terrorism and any insinuation seeking to associate Pakistan with acts of terrorism was factually incorrect and patently misleading. He said it was a tactic often employed to divert attention from India‚Äôs own internal challenges, as well as its repressive policies in India-held Kashmir.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs attempts to mask its serious human rights violations are well-documented and well-recognised by the international community. The plight of the Kashmiri people and their just struggle for self-determination cannot be obscured by aggressive rhetoric and political deflection,‚Äù he remarked.</p>
<p>He urged the Indian leadership to exercise responsibility and restraint as escalatory statements and belligerent posturing serve no purpose other than exacerbating tensions.</p>
<p><strong>UNSC condemns Khuzdar attack</strong></p>
<p>The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has strongly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912792">condemned</a> the terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar, Balochistan, calling it a heinous and cowardly act that claimed the lives of at least six people, including four children, and left more than 50 others injured.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/3  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In an official <a class="link--external" href="https://press.un.org/en/2025/sc16069.doc.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press statement</a>, the Council members expressed profound sorrow over the attack, which occurred on May 21, and extended heartfelt condolences to the victims‚Äô families and to the government.</p>
<p>The UNSC members expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the government and the people of Pakistan, and they wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured, the statement read.</p>

                <h2>Pakistan, India extend airspace bans by another month</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>RAWALPINDI:  Pakis¬≠tan and India on Friday extended <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284">airspace restrictions</a> for each other‚Äôs aircraft in tit-for-tat moves.</p>
<p>A Notam (notice to airmen) issued by the Pakistan Airports Autho¬≠rity (PAA) said the ban on Indian aircraft using its airspace will remain in place till June 24.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe ban on Indian aircraft flying through Pakis¬≠tani airspace has been extended until 4:59am on June 24, 2025,‚Äù the PAA said.</p>
<p>The airspace will not be available for Indian-regis¬≠tered, operated or owned aircraft or those leased by Indian airlines, including military flights with no exceptions, the Notam stated. The restriction will apply to airspace starting from the ground to unlimited airspace height, it added.</p>
<p>Under the directive, no flight operated by Indian airlines or operators will be allowed to enter or transit through Pakistani airspace. However, other inte¬≠r¬≠national airlines would not be affected by the ban.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>India‚Äôs Civil Aviation Ministry issued a corresponding Notam, saying Pakistani-registered, operated, owned, or leased aircraft, including military flights, would be barred from Indian airspace through June 23.</p>
<p>India and Pakistan first imposed the airspace restrictions last month after the shooting in India-occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>On April 24, Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284">announced</a> a series of measures, including the closure of its airspace to all India-owned or operated airlines with immediate effect, as it retaliated against New Delhi‚Äôs slew of aggressive measures against the country.</p>
