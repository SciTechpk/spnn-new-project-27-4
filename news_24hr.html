            <p><p>No loss of life was reported after a bomb blast on a railway track in Balochistan’s Mastung district derailed six bogies of the Jaffar Express, an official said.</p>
<p>With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province’s transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train. Fortunately, there was no loss of life.”</p>
<p>The incident occurred near the Spezand station in Mastung’s Dasht tehsil, when the train was heading from Quetta to Peshawar City station.</p>
<p>“Security forces and rescue teams rushed to the site as soon as they were alerted about the incident, and began a search operation after cordoning off the area,” Kashif said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>A relief train of the Pakistan Railways will bring back passengers of the affected train to Quetta by evening, and all tickets will be refunded, according to Kashif.</p>
<p>“Four bogies of the Jaffar Express had been placed back on the track, while efforts were underway to restore the other two,” the official noted.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, Kashif said that Jaffar Express trains between Quetta and Peshawar — both upwards and downward journeys — were cancelled today and tomorrow, as well as on August 13 and 14.</p>
<p>The Bolan Mail will depart from Karachi on August 16 (Saturday) “in its proper turn” and will arrive in Quetta the next day, he added.</p>
<p>Today’s incident comes just three days after Quetta-bound Jaffar Express <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929447">narrowly escaped</a> a disaster in Balochistan’s Sibi, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train passed.</p>

<p>In another near-miss incident on July 24, a powerful explosion ripped through the Quetta-Sibi rail section, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926300">damaging a bogie</a> of the Bolan Mail.</p>
<p>A July 28 derailment of the Jaffar Express train in Sindh’s Sukkur was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927185">initially attributed</a> to an explosion — even by government-run media — but the Ministry of Railways later said a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927307">technical fault</a> was the cause.</p>
<p>In June, a powerful explosion of a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks caused four bogies of the Jaffer Express to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917945">derail in Jacobabad</a>. No one was hurt in the incident.</p>
<p>In April, the 3UP train heading from Karachi to Quetta was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904018">stopped</a> at Jacobabad railway station due to security reasons.</p>
<p>Train services betw­een Quetta and the rest of the country were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900566">restored</a> on March 27, after they were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897306/all-trains-to-and-from-balochistan-suspended">suspended</a> due to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419">unprecedented hijacking</a> of the Pesha­war-bound Jaffar Express earlier that month.</p>
<p>The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897595/balochistan-standoff-ends-after-all-jaffar-express-hostages-rescued#:~:text=In%20all%2C%2021%20passengers%20lost%20their%20lives%2C%20while%20four%20FC%20personnel%20were%20martyred%2C%20the%20ISPR%20DG%20said.">21 passengers</a> and four security personnel. “All 33 terrorists” were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929988/pti-will-approach-lawyers-over-rumoured-27th-amendment-asad-qaiser' target='_blank'><strong>PTI will approach lawyers over ‘rumoured’ 27th Amendment: Asad Qaiser</strong></a>
            <p><p>PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser on Sunday addressed rumours of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, stating that the party would approach the legal fraternity regarding the potential legislation.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866452/26th-constitutional-amendment-awaits-presidential-assent-after-sailing-through-na-in-late-night-session">passing</a> the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866480">26th Constitutional Amendment</a> last year, the government had been planning to table another amendment, colloquially known as the 27th Amendment, aimed at reforming local governments and “addressing issues skipped in previous legislation”.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, the PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker stated that there is “new drama” surrounding the legislation.</p>
<p>“In this case, we will approach the lawyers’ community regarding this legislation,” Qaiser said. “We will begin by meeting with the Islamabad Bar this month.”</p>
<p>Referring to a “schedule of activities” for this month, Qaiser said that the PTI will also arrange an engagement with foreign diplomats and embassies, as well as a seminar.</p>
<p>The PTI leader also assailed the manner in which the country is being governed, branding it “illegal, unconstitutional and undemocratic”.</p>
<p>“The country is practically under martial law and decisions are being made based on personal preferences,” Qaiser stated. “The country cannot be run under this hybrid system we have right now.</p>
<p>“We have decided that we will use all available forums — parliament, the courts, the public — to take our struggle against injustice and oppression forward.”</p>
<p>Qaiser claimed that courts made decisions not based on merit, but due to institutional pressure.</p>
<p>“We believe that the cases of political prisoners, including [PTI founder] Imran Khan, should be judged on merit, not due to pressure from the authorities,” he emphasised. “If the trials are decided on merit and there is live coverage in the media, the nation will see what a drama this is.”</p>
<p>Qaiser continued: “Then there’s also a show in the assembly. The way it’s being controlled and the way its system is being run, as well as the way parliamentarians are being humiliated in front of Adiala Jail, is concerning. I have conducted some research into this matter and will bring it up before the National Assembly.</p>
<p>“According to our own rules, it is written that any MNA can inspect prisons. Is it just written down or can it actually be enforced?” he asked.</p>
<p>Details about the proposed constitutional amendment were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1869328">divulged</a> by sources to <em>Dawn.com</em> following a meeting bet­ween Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PPP Chairperson Bila­wal Bhutto-Zardari in Lahore, atten­ded by key leaders from both parties on October 27 last year.</p>
<p>In contradicting statements, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had declared that the government was not considering any such legislation. At the same time, then-Adviser to the Prime Minister on Law and Justice Barr­ister Aqeel Malik had hinted that the government could not only table “an amendment” in parliament, but would also be able to pass it.</p>
<p>In June this year, amid speculation in legal circles about the government planning to bring in the 27th Amendment, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915322">endorsed</a> the amendment while calling for broad-based judicial reforms, including the nationwide rotation of judges.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ImranKhanPTI/status/1940527676537679951" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X in July, PTI founder Imran wrote that rather than bringing in the amendment “through a sham parliament, it would be better to openly declare a monarchy, because what exists today is outright dictatorship, forcibly imposed on the country”.</p></p>

            <p><p>Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) on Sunday dismissed “incorrect and misleading” media reports about an eight-day closure of Islamabad International Airport, clarifying the exact date and time of the planned shutdown.</p>
<p>A statement by PAA Spokesperson Saifullah Khan said, “According to the Notams issued, due to air activities ahead of Independence Day on August 14, arrival and departure flights will be suspended for only two hours on specific days and times.”</p>
<p>From August 6-9 and August 11-14, the airport will be shut from 11am-1pm PST.</p>
<p>On August 9 and 11, the airport will also be shut from 8-10pm.</p>
<p>“Apart from these brief interruptions, all flights at the airport will continue as usual,” the statement said, advising passengers to contact their airline for the latest information on their schedule.</p>
<p>The government has said that this year’s Independence Day would be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922864/govt-announces-independence-day-to-be-celebrated-under-theme-of-marka-i-haq">celebrated</a> under the banner of “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a>” (Battle of Truth) — the period of conflict with India in May — to demonstrate the nation’s resilience, progress and pride.</p>

<p>While discussing the activities of the scheduled celebrations, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal stressed that every sector and official in charge should ensure that all universities and schools observe the day in the same format. The same was advised for provincial celebrations and celebrations abroad in collaboration with the Overseas Ministry.</p>
<p>During the four-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">conflict</a> between Pakistan and India, flight disruptions left hundreds of passengers <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909570">stranded</a> at the country’s major airports, including Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Sialkot airports.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defence informed the National Assembly on Friday that the PAA <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929682">lost</a> Rs4.1 billion from April 24 to June 30 due to the closure.</p>
<p>PAA also issued a schedule for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920506/lahore-airport-closure-scheduled-to-avoid-bird-strikes">temporary</a> runway closure at Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International airport owing to bird activity. The closure will be in effect daily from 5am to 8am, starting July 1 until September 15.</p></p>
