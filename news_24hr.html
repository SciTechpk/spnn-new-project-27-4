            <p><p>Rescue teams pulled more bodies from the rubble of a five-storey <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050">building collapse</a> in Karachi overnight, taking the toll on Saturday to 19 as the recovery continued for a second day with eighty per cent of the operation completed.</p>
<p>South Deputy Commissioner (DC) Javed Nabi Khoso told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “Eighty per cent [of the] rescue operation has been completed and it is still ongoing.”</p>
<p>He added that there were “19 confirmed deaths and 13 injured” so far in the incident.</p>
<p>However, South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police Syed Asad Raza earlier told a higher toll of 21 to <em>Dawn.com</em>. The same figure was reported in an update by the Edhi Foundation and according to the data from the Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Institute Of Trauma (SMBBIT) at Civil Hospital Karachi, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, which showed that 20 bodies were brought to the facility while one person died during treatment.</p>
<p>The data showed that 11 injured people were brought for treatment with 10 later discharged.</p>
<p>The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, which was further weakened by recent rains, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922231#:~:text=DIG%20South%20Syed%20Asad%20Raza%20told%20Dawn">said</a> DIG Raza.</p>
<p>“Rescue operation is still underway in Baghdadi, Lyari where the building had collapsed on Friday,” DIG Raza told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>“On one side, debris has been removed up to the ground floor, while on the other side, the rescue team has removed debris up to the third floor,” the police officer added.</p>

<p>Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.</p>
<p>Karachi, home to more than 20 million, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.</p>
<p>“My daughter is under the rubble,” 54-year-old Dev Raj told <em>AFP</em> at the scene.</p>
<p>“She was my beloved daughter. She was so sensitive but is under the burden of debris. She got married just six months ago.”</p>
<p>Rescue teams worked throughout the night, and families said that at least eight people were still believed to be trapped as temperatures climbed to 33 degrees Celsius in the morning.</p>
<p>Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, leading the Rescue 1122 efforts at the scene, told <em>AFP</em> that the operation continued through the night “without interruption”. “It may take eight to 12 hours more to complete,” he said earlier today.</p>
<p>Up to 100 people had been living in the building, senior police officer Arif Aziz told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>The incident came days after a portion of a building <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921188/no-casualties-reported-as-22-rescued-from-partially-collapsed-building-in-karachis-kharadar">collapsed</a> in the city’s Kharadar area. However, no casualties or injuries were reported.</p>
<p>The Public Account Committee of the Sindh Assembly had directed the provincial government in December to take urgent steps to evacuate over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879565">570 buildings</a> declared “dangerous” by authorities across Karachi.</p>

<p>The Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=SBCA%20says%20issued%20multiple%20prior%20notices%20to%20vacate%20building">said</a> it had declared the plot as dangerous through its Technical Committee for Dangerous Buildings after a thorough inspection conducted in October 2022.</p>
<p>The authority said it had issued three ejectment notices to the residents since then, as well as asked K-Electric, Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) to disconnect utility services.</p>
<p>But Imran Khaskheli, an owner and resident watching the rescue operation on Saturday, denied receiving notices.</p>
<p>“Do you think we are out of our senses to stay in an unsafe building with our families?” he said, speaking to <em>AFP</em>. He said he had seen cracks in the pillars of the building early on Friday morning.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“I knocked on all the doors and asked families to leave immediately,” Khaskheli said, adding that around 40 families lived in the building but that many did not heed his warning.</p>
<p>More than 50 buildings in the district have been declared unsafe, with six evacuated since yesterday, DC Khoso told <em>AFP</em>.</p>

<p>Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922231#:~:text=Rescue%201122%20spokesperson%20Hassaanul%20Haseeb%20Khan%20told%20Dawn">said</a> the incident had reportedly occurred between 9am and 9:30am. However, they said they received the information late due to the suspension of communication networks, he added.</p>
<p>Mobile services are usually <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920725/army-to-be-deployed-across-country-for-security-during-muharram#:~:text=It%20was%20also%20agreed%20that%20any%20decision%20to%20suspend%20internet%20or%20mobile%20phone%20services%20will%20be%20made%20in%20consultation%20with%20provinces">suspended</a> in certain areas due to security concerns during Muharram.</p>
<p>Sindh Rescue 1122 Director General (DG) Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, in a statement, said yesterday there were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=Rescue%20DG%20lists%20%E2%80%98hinderances%E2%80%99%20in%20operations">hindrances</a> during the rescue operation due to the “unruly crowd, various road blockades and mobile network [issues]”.</p>
<p>Heavy machinery faced difficulty in reaching the site amid the narrow alleys of Lyari, a low-income neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Police even had to baton-charge a crowd that had gathered around the site to make way for machinery, officials added.</p>
<p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah sought a report on the collapse and details of dilapidated buildings from the SBCA.</p>
<p>Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani said a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=Saeed%20Ghani%20stresses%20timely%20evacuation%20of%20unsafe%20buildings">high-level committee</a> has been formed that will submit a report on the incident by Monday. He lamented that residents did not evacuate the building despite being served notices previously.</p>
<p>The minister also ordered the suspension of the related officials at the SBCA.</p>

<p>Sindh Assembly opposition leader and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan MPA Ali Khurshidi blamed the Sindh government for Karachi’s administrative collapse and the Lyari building tragedy.</p>
<p>“Call the tanker mafia and you’ll get water in 30 minutes,” he said during a press conference, pointing out rampant corruption and institutional failure across civic bodies.</p>
<p>Khurshidi said if the provincial administration was to blame and held responsible if it had not passed laws in 17 years to make this a criminal offence.</p>
<p>“Instead of saying ‘this should be done,’ you should be admitting, ‘we should’ve done this, but we failed to.’”</p>
<p>Addressing President Asif Ali Zardari and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, he said: “This is a question of your and your party’s credibility.”</p>
<p>He said the suspensions of officials would not work, insisting that termination and legal consequences were necessary. He condemned the “harassment” of Karachiites through traffic police extortion, pleading for urgent administrative reform, saying the public was fed up.</p>
<p>“This isn’t about point-scoring politics,” Khurshidi said. “We’re doing politics so we can solve genuine issues faced by people.” He concluded by calling on President Zardari and Bilawal to stop issuing mere condemnations and to instead fix the broken system under their party’s governance.</p>

            <p><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Saturday reported that new extreme maximum temperature records were set in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Chilas and Bunji areas, according to a press release.</p>
<p>The country is currently experiencing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916931">high summer temperatures</a>, with the PMD reporting in June that ‘Feels Like’ temperatures crossed 50 degrees Celsius in four cities.</p>
<p>According to today’s press release, both cities recorded extreme temperatures that shattered previous records.</p>
<p>The PMD recorded a maximum temperature of 48.5°C in Chilas today, breaking the previous historical extreme maximum record of 47.7°C on July 17, 1997.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the temperature recorded in Bunji was 46.1°C. The previous historical extreme maximum record was 45.6°C on July 12, 1971.</p>
<p>“These persistent high temperatures over northern areas may accelerate snow and glacier melt, triggering Glof (glacial lake outburst flood) and flash floods incidents, in vulnerable valleys and surrounding regions during upcoming week,” the PMD warned, citing a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922068">warning</a> issued on Friday.</p>
<p>Glof refers to the sudden release of water and debris from a glacial lake, leading to the loss of lives, property and livelihoods in mountain communities. Over 7.1 million people in Gilgit Baltistan and KP are vulnerable, <a class="link--external" href="https://mocc.gov.pk/Detail/ZmI3OWZlMzYtMTdkYy00ZGU5LTgyZjAtMzIxODdkMTBmMTEy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to the Ministry of Climate Change.</p>
<p>A day ago, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922136">warned</a> the administrations of five districts about the high risk of Glofs due to a significant rise in temperatures and upcoming weather system.</p>
<p>In an advisory issued to the deputy commissioners of Upper and Lower Chitral, Upper Dir, Swat and Upper Kohistan, the PDMA said that the PMD had formally informed it that as there was a significant rise in temperatures and upcoming weather system in northern parts of the country, the risk of Glofs was very likely to increase in glaciated areas of the province.</p>
<p>The PDMA said that in view of the above weather conditions, officials were requested to take all necessary precautionary measures to avoid any loss of human and animal life and damage to infrastructure and crops.</p>
<p>It urged authorities to undertake proactive monitoring and surveillance of vulnerable Glof sites to ensure timely early warning and response, conduct evacuation drills in at-risk communities to ensure full preparedness and ensure that safe evacuation sites are fully stocked and ready for utilisation in case of any eventuality.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Punjab Wildlife and Parks Department on Saturday arrested five individuals and seized 13 lions after launching a crackdown against people illegally keeping the big cats without a licence.</p>
<p>A day earlier, a pet lion <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922087">escaped</a> from a home and chased a woman and two children down a busy street in Lahore. Police arrested three suspects who had fled from the spot, while the lion was confiscated and sent to a wildlife park.</p>
<p>A press release issued today from the provincial government said that the wildlife department launched a “major province-wide crackdown” on the special directives of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz against those keeping lions without a licence.</p>
<p>“This operation is being carried out under a zero-tolerance policy and has already led to significant progress,” the press release said, adding that authorities conducted inspections of 22 locations across the province.</p>
<p>“So far, the wildlife department has taken 13 lions into custody. Five individuals have been arrested, five first information reports (FIR) have been registered and two further actions are pending.”</p>
<p>A video shared by the chief minister’s social media team also showed a leopard being seized.</p>

</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The press release said four lions were recovered in Lahore, with four individuals arrested, one premise sealed and three FIRs registered.</p>
<p>In Gujranwala, four lions were confiscated, with one FIR currently under process, it added.</p>
<p>Two lions were confiscated in Faisalabad, one premise was sealed and one FIR was in progress, while three lions were recovered, one person was arrested and two FIRs were lodged in Multan.</p>
<p>“The illegal trade of wildlife is intolerable and there will be no compromise on public safety,” Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb was quoted as saying in the press release.</p>
<p>She said that keeping lions illegally was not only a violation of the law but also posed a serious social threat.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb stressed that strict enforcement of wildlife laws would be ensured and indiscriminate action would continue against individuals involved in unlawful activities.</p>
<p>“The wildlife department has reiterated that the law is equal for everyone and no exceptions will be made,” the press release said, urging citizens to report any illegal possession of lions.</p>
<p>Keeping exotic animals, especially big cats, as pets has long been seen as a sign of privilege and power in Punjab.</p>
<p>In December 2024, an adult lion <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880249">escaped</a> from its enclosure in another neighbourhood of Lahore, terrorising residents before being shot dead by a security guard.</p>
<p>The incident prompted the provincial government to pass new laws regulating the sale, purchase, breeding and ownership of big cats. The law now <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885596">requires</a> owners to obtain licences for the animals which are barred from being kept in residential areas.</p>
<p>Breeders have to pay a hefty fee for registration, while farms have to be a minimum of 10 acres in size.</p></p>
