                <h2>PTI shows willingness to talk but demands ‚Äòaccountability‚Äô from institutions</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Saturday called on state institutions to engage in dialogue with the PTI, but demanded that they hold themselves accountable.</p>
<p>Gandapur and the PTI‚Äôs top leadership are on a visit to Lahore to formally launch a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923856/pti-brass-gathers-in-lahore-to-kick-start-aug-5-movement">movement</a> to seek the release of party founder Imran Khan and devise a strategy for its nationwide protest, which will reach its crescendo on August 5 ‚Äî marking two years since the ex-premier was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a>.</p>
<p>Since Imran‚Äôs incarceration in several cases, which he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1890696#:~:text=He%20claimed%20that%20four%20convictions%20against%20him%20were%20politically%20motivated">claims</a> are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1843176">politically motivated</a>, his party‚Äôs relationship with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880551">government</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832432">establishment</a> has turned exceedingly sour. The PTI has held several protests over the last year, most of which escalated into <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1857709">violence</a> after facing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875003/day-of-clashes-in-islamabad-ends-in-pti-protesters-retreat">state repression</a>.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference flanked by PTI‚Äôs Punjab leadership, CM Gandapur said: ‚ÄúWe have to correct our institutions ourselves. Come, sit together, own your mistakes and move forward.‚Äù</p>
<p>He recalled that Imran, despite his wife also being imprisoned in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831">graft case</a>, had repeatedly said he was ready to talk for the sake of the country.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>Imran was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">jailed</a> on Aug 5, 2023 in a case related to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878307/imran-khan-bushra-bibi-indicted-in-new-toshakhana-case">state gifts</a>, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831">¬£190 million graft case</a> and faces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845818">pending trials</a> related to the May 9, 2023 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">riots</a>.</p>
<p>In the wake of the nationwide May 9 protests, which saw important <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">military installations</a> come under attack, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753589">thousands</a> of PTI workers and almost the entire <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1774736">top-tier leadership</a> were rounded up, with many still facing court proceedings under serious <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891122/five-pti-leaders-16-activists-indicted-in-another-may-9-case">charges</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCome and talk, acknowledge and correct your mistakes,‚Äù Gandapur reiterated today, noting that it was everyone‚Äôs collective responsibility to think about Pakistan‚Äôs future.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe state institutions have ignored their duties which are stated in the Constitution and are instead doing other work, due to which terrorism has [risen] in the country,‚Äù he said, adding that the security situation in KP and Balochistan had worsened because ‚Äúthose responsible for guarding the borders were chasing the PTI instead‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe state institutions, whose duty is not to engage in politics, are playing every role in forming, running and overthrowing governments,‚Äù the PTI leader alleged.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd when you ask, they reply with delight that ‚Äòwe are non-political‚Äô‚Äù.</p>
<p>Gandapur, stressing that he was a soldier‚Äôs son and brother, said: ‚ÄúMy military is being defamed due to a few wrong people and their decisions.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhere are those who imposed martial laws? They are not in Pakistan today. Who is suffering? My Pakistanis,‚Äù the KP CM said.</p>
<p>Gandapur also called on the political parties in the ruling coalition to go into the public, which he said had ‚Äúrejected‚Äù them. He cautioned that those parties will then face the consequences later on of the ‚Äúculture‚Äù they had developed. Addressing their supporters, he said, ‚ÄúThey (leaders of other political parties) will flee abroad. You have to stay here.‚Äù</p>
<p>He asked if it was ‚Äúright as a human and a Muslim‚Äù if a PTI leader‚Äôs home was raided and their privacy was violated. ‚ÄúIf you are silent on this, then if this happens with you tomorrow, then no one will raise a voice for you either.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thanking PTI workers, leaders, its lawmakers and overseas supporters, Gandapur vowed to organise a grassroots movement upwards from the streets, towns, and cities.</p>
<p>A caravan of KP lawmakers led by CM Gandapur, as well as Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923856/pti-brass-gathers-in-lahore-to-kick-start-aug-5-movement">reached Lahore</a> via G.T. Road yesterday evening. During a layover in Jhelum, the KP CM said that the protest had been launched, and the parliamentary meeting in Lahore would mull the final protest strategy to step up the campaign seeking Imran‚Äôs release.</p>

                <h2>Farm worker dies after US immigration raid on cannabis farm in California</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A farm worker has died after being <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923700/worker-in-critical-condition-after-us-immigration-raid-on-california-farm">injured</a> during a raid by US immigration agents on a legal cannabis farm in California, his family said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Raids on agricultural sites on Thursday resulted in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886071">arrests</a> of 200 undocumented migrants, as part of US President Donald Trump‚Äôs wide-ranging anti-immigration <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918869">crackdown</a>, and clashes between law enforcement officials and protesters.</p>
<p>The farm worker‚Äôs family had started a page on the fundraising platform GoFundMe to help support his relatives in Mexico.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the page posted an update to say he had ‚Äúpassed away.‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump campaigned for the presidency on a harsh anti-immigration platform, likening undocumented migrants to ‚Äúanimals‚Äù and ‚Äúmonsters,‚Äù and since taking office he has delivered on promises to conduct a massive deportation drive.</p>
<p>On Friday, he called demonstrators involved in attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents ‚Äúslimeballs‚Äù and said they should be arrested.</p>
<p>The chaotic raid on the cannabis plantation in Ventura County, about 90 kilometres from Los Angeles, saw the worker who later died being chased by ICE agents, his family said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy uncle Jaime was just a hard-working, innocent farmer,‚Äù said a post on the GoFundMe page. ‚ÄúHe was chased by ICE agents, and we were told he fell 30ft (9 meters).‚Äù</p>
<p>The page described his injuries as ‚Äúcatastrophic.‚Äù</p>
<p>Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman, said he was never in custody.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlthough he was not being pursued by law enforcement, this individual climbed up to the roof of a green house and fell 30 feet,‚Äù McLaughlin said.</p>
<p>‚Äú(Customs and Border Patrol) immediately called a medevac to the scene to get him care as quickly as possible.‚Äù</p>
<p>DHS said 200 undocumented migrants were arrested during raids on marijuana growing sites in Carpinteria and Camarillo on Thursday and 10 children were rescued ‚Äúfrom potential exploitation, forced labor, and human trafficking.‚Äù</p>
<p>Glass House Brands, which owns the farms, said in a statement that it has ‚Äúnever knowingly violated applicable hiring practices and does not and has never employed minors.‚Äù</p>
<p>DHS said more than 500 ‚Äúrioters‚Äù had attempted to disrupt the operation and four US citizens are facing charges for assaulting or resisting officers.</p>
<p>Tear gas was used against the protesters, some of whom were seen in television footage throwing projectiles at law enforcement vehicles.</p>
<p>The department said immigration agency vehicles were damaged and a $50,000 reward was being offered for the arrest of an individual who allegedly fired a gun at law enforcement officers.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#american-dream-no-longer" id="american-dream-no-longer" title="Permalink"></a>American dream ‚Äòno longer‚Äô</h2>
<p>In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he had watched footage of ‚Äúthugs‚Äù throwing rocks and bricks at ICE vehicles, causing ‚Äútremendous damage.‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump said he was authorizing law enforcement officers who are ‚Äúon the receiving end of thrown rocks, bricks, or any other form of assault, to stop their car, and arrest these SLIMEBALLS, using whatever means is necessary to do so.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am giving Total Authorization for ICE to protect itself, just like they protect the Public,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Trump has been involved in a showdown over immigration enforcement with Democratic-ruled California for weeks.</p>
<p>The Republican president sent thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles last month to quell protests against round-ups of undocumented migrants by federal agents.</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has said the troops were not necessary to address the mostly peaceful protests, but his legal efforts to have them removed have failed so far.</p>
<p>The cannabis farm in Camarillo was calm during a visit by an <em>AFP</em> reporter on Friday, as workers waited in line to collect their belongings and paychecks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been here since six this morning asking questions but they‚Äôre not giving us any information,‚Äù said Saul Munoz, a 43-year-old Colombian whose son was detained on Thursday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI just want to know how he‚Äôs doing,‚Äù Munoz said. ‚ÄúBring him back to me and if it‚Äôs time for us to leave, we‚Äôll leave.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe truth is the American dream is no longer really the American dream.‚Äù</p></p>
