            <p><p>Iran‚Äôs President Masoud Pezeshkian landed in Islamabad on Saturday for a two-day visit, eyeing to reaffirm his commitment to elevate annual bilateral trade with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan has recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924349/dar-slams-israel-us-attacks-against-fellow-sco-member-iran-as-unacceptable">expressed solidarity</a> and a desire for cooperation with Iran, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927716/closer-pak-iran-cooperation-vital-to-securing-shared-interests-say-experts">experts say</a> is vital to securing shared interests in a shifting geopolitical environment.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian is paying a two-day official visit to Pakistan over the weekend, making it his first trip to Islamabad in his current role, the Foreign Office <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928047/iranian-president-to-visit-pakistan-on-saturday-fo">said</a>. Ahead of his trip, Pakistan yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919380/the-history-of-us-iran-tensions">pledged</a> to help defuse <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919380/the-history-of-us-iran-tensions">tensions</a> between Iran and the United States.</p>
<p>Dr Pezeshkian arrived at Nur Khan Air Base, where Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar received him.</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz had met with Pezeshkian during his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913442/ready-to-talk-with-india-pm-shehbaz-says-during-meeting-with-iranian-president-in-tehran">visit to Iran</a> in late May, which was part of his regional tour to friendly countries aimed at expre¬≠ssing gratitude for their support during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">conflict with India</a>.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian is the second Iranian president to visit Pakistan in as many years. Late Ebrahim Raisi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1828957">visited</a> the country in April last year, just a month before he died in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1834463">helicopter crash</a>.</p>
<p>According to Iran‚Äôs state media <em><a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85903178/Pezeshkian-Iran-aims-to-expand-trade-with-Pakistan-to-10-billion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IRNA</a></em>, before departing for Pakistan, Pezeshkian emphasised the plan to elevate their annual trade exchanges to $10 billion. The two countries had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1829136">agreed</a> in April last year to boost trade over the next five years.</p>
<p>The president termed the trade relations between Tehran and Islamabad as ‚Äúgood‚Äù and identified boosting trade with Pakistan via land, air and sea as priorities for this trip, the report added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThrough Pakistan, Iran can connect to the Silk Road linking China and Pakistan, and the route can then extend through Iran to Europe,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Emphasising that security and border issues were of great importance to both Iran and Pakistan, he stressed that regional security must be achieved through cooperation, according to <em>IRNA</em>.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>Pezeshkian noted that the two neighbours have ‚Äúenjoyed good, friendly, and deep-rooted relations‚Äù since Pakistan‚Äôs independence. ‚ÄúThe two countries cooperate in economic, scientific, cultural, and border areas, and a deep bond exists between the people of both sides,‚Äù he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian highlighted that during the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919798/ceasefire-brokered-with-iran-after-washington-request-for-liaison-qatars-pm-says">Israel-Iran war</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">United States‚Äô strikes</a> against its nuclear facilities, ‚ÄúPakistan was among the countries that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924349/dar-slams-israel-us-attacks-against-fellow-sco-member-iran-as-unacceptable">strongly condemned</a> this aggression and declared its readiness to provide any necessary support for Iran‚Äôs territorial integrity, as well as for the government and people of Iran‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to <em>IRNA</em>, the president also noted that ‚Äúthe enemy plans to create division among Muslims, but Iran will thwart the enemies‚Äô plots‚Äù, adding that Tehran aims to maintain unity and solidarity between Iran and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian had left for Pakistan earlier today, accompanied by a high-level delegation.</p>

            <p><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Saturday hosted the first of several jirgas on restoring law and order in the province.</p>
<p>KP has been gripped by a deteriorating security situation amid terrorist attacks that have left residents demanding peace while opposing military operations due to collateral damage. CM Gandapur <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927600">announced</a> earlier this week that a series of jirgas would be convened to decide on future steps on a wide array of concerns among the province‚Äôs residents.</p>
<p>In a post on X, a statement from the CM Office said that the regional jirgas began today and were attended by tribal elders and elected public representatives from the Khyber and Orakzai districts, as well as representatives from the tribal subdivisions of Darra Adam Khel and Hassan Khel.</p>
<p>It added that 150 tribal elders from the aforementioned areas, six MPAs, three MNAs and one senator participated in the jirga.</p>

<p>The statement added that the CM‚Äôs adviser on information, the KP chief secretary, inspector general of police and commissioners and deputy commissioners were also present in the jirga.</p>
<p>The statement listed down the recommendations made by the jirga, such as ensuring unity against terrorism to restore peace, as well as declaring that displacement amid the ongoing military operation was ‚Äúunacceptable under any circumstances‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDevelopment is linked to peace and it will accelerate when peace is restored,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúNo one has asked for any resources of the province, including minerals, nor has it been given to anyone, nor will it be given to anyone.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTribal elders have recommended to the federal government that arrangements should be made to send a jirga of the provincial government and tribal elders for negotiations with Afghanistan,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>The statement said that the jirga should receive resources and cooperation to achieve this, adding that the next regional jirga would be held in the Mohmand and Bajaur districts. A third jirga would be held in North and South Waziristan, while the fourth would be convened in Kurram district.</p>
<p>No dates were given for the jirgas in this statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúImmediately after the regional jirgas, a grand jirga will be held under the chairmanship of the Chief Minister,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan group <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, security forces, backed by gunship helicopters and artillery, launched ‚ÄòOperation Sarbakaf‚Äô against terrorists in Lowi Mamund tehsil and imposed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927438/curfew-imposed-as-3-day-operation-against-militants-begins-in-bajaur-official">three-day curfew</a> in the region.</p>
<p>According to a notification, the administration imposed restrictions on all kinds of movement in 16 areas of Lowi Mamund on the recommendation of the district intelligence coordination committee.</p>
<p>The provincial government has opposed the newly launched <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927454/curfew-imposed-as-forces-launch-operation-sarbakaf-in-bajaur">military operation</a> in Bajaur unless it is taken into confidence by the Centre and has vowed to lift the curfew.</p>
<p>Although not confirmed officially by security forces, sources said that at least four terrorists were killed, around 12 were wounded, and about 10 were captured alive in different areas of the Lowi Mamund tehsil. Locals also claimed that a child was among two civilians who died, and eight others, including two minors and a woman, were wounded in clashes between security forces and terrorists.</p></p>
