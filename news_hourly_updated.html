                <h2>PSX climbs nearly 6,000 points amid announcement of Iran-Israel ‚Äòceasefire‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) climbed by 5759.16 points after an earlier halt in trading on Tuesday, in the wake of  US President Donald Trump announcing a complete ceasefire between Israel and Iran to end a 12-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">war</a>.</p>
<p>The KSE-100 index climbed by 6079.16 points, or 5.23 per cent, to close at 122,246.63 points.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, shares at the PSX had climbed by 5,878 points a few hours after it opened. It reached an earlier intraday high of 122,045.62 from the last close of 116,167.47 yesterday, before a market halt was initiated.</p>
<p>Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, attributed the rise to the overnight announcement of a ceasefire, with broad-based gains across sectors.</p>
<p>Farooq said, ‚ÄúThe Pakistan market rallied earlier today following the overnight announcement of a ceasefire.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, reports during the day of Israeli claims that Iran has violated the ceasefire dampened sentiment, pulling the market down from an intraday high of 122,045.62 to 121,926.63 currently. Despite the pullback, local fundamentals remain intact, and the rally could resume if the ceasefire holds. Geopolitical developments will continue to drive market direction in the near term.</p>
<p>Global shares rallied and the dollar extended declines as a ceasefire to end a 12-day war between Iran and Israel came into effect, while oil prices dived to nearly two-week lows on easing concerns about supply disruptions, <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>
<p>At 11:26am, a PSX notice informed that due to a 5pc increase in the KSE-30 index from the previous trading day close of the index, a market halt had been triggered as per PSX regulations and all equity and equity-based markets have been suspended accordingly.</p>
<p>The market reopened after a gap of an hour at 12:31pm.</p>
<p>Farooq explained, ‚ÄúIf the KSE-30 Index moves ¬±5pc from the previous day‚Äôs close and remains at that level for five consecutive minutes, trading is stopped for 60 minutes.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that this mechanism kicks into action whether the index rises by 5pc or falls by that margin to help cool the market down.</p>
<p>The PSX had endured a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919518/psx-plunges-3855-points-on-geopolitical-jitters">sharp sell-off</a> on Monday, as escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East ‚Äî sparked by reported US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and Tehran‚Äôs threat to close the Strait of Hormuz ‚Äî sent shockwaves through global markets, triggering panic selling and wiping out more than 3,800 points from the benchmark KSE-100 index.</p>
<p>The Israeli government said it had achieved all its objectives in the war with Iran, and that it had agreed to the US-proposed ceasefire after removing the ‚Äúdual existential threat‚Äù of Tehran‚Äôs nuclear programme and ballistic missiles.
Israel nonetheless warned it would ‚Äúrespond forcefully‚Äù to any Iranian violation of the truce.</p>
<p>Oil prices fell 5pc after Israel agreed to the proposal.</p>
<p>The ceasefire agreement, as outlined by Trump on social media in a surprise late-night post, would see the arch enemies stop firing in staggered phases.</p>
<p>According to Trump, Iran would unilaterally halt all operations beginning 4am GMT (9am PKT) on Tuesday, with Israel following suit 12 hours later.</p>
<p>After Trump‚Äôs announcement, Iran‚Äôs Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi posted on social media that ‚Äúas of now, there is no ‚Äòagreement‚Äô on ceasefire or cessation of military operations‚Äù.</p>
<p>However, he added that if Israel stopped ‚Äúits illegal aggression‚Äù, Tehran would have ‚Äúno intention to continue our response afterwards‚Äù.</p>

                <h2>Amnesty calls out authorities for failing to protect KP civilians from ‚Äòrepeated quadcopter attacks‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Rights organisation Amnesty International on Tuesday criticised Pakistani authorities for ‚Äúfailing to protect the lives and property of civilians‚Äù in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa amid a surge in suspected quadcopter and drone attacks.</p>
<p>The statement came in response to reports of multiple such attacks in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860946">Khyber Pakhtunkhwa</a> and Balochistan over the past year. In <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901160/11-killed-in-mardan-security-action">March</a>, at least 11 people were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, while in May,  a suspected quadcopter munitions drop claimed the lives of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912007/locals-stage-sit-in-as-kp-minister-denounces-killing-of-3-children-in-alleged-north-waziristan-drone-strike">four children and injured five</a> others in North Waziristan District‚Äôs Mir Ali tehsil. The military clarified that security forces were ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912393/security-forces-falsely-implicated-in-north-waziristan-incident-ispr">falsely implicated</a>‚Äù in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918509/child-killed-5-injured-after-suspected-drone-hits-kps-south-waziristan-police">Last Friday</a>, a child was killed and five others were injured after a suspected drone hit South Waziristan District, prompting condemnations from KP politicians.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistani authorities have failed to take action to protect the lives and property of civilians in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa who continue to pay the price of an escalating number of drone strikes in the province,‚Äù today‚Äôs statement by Amnesty said, quoting the group‚Äôs South Asia Deputy Regional Director Isabelle Lass√©e.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUse of drones and quadcopters to conduct attacks resulting in the unlawful killing of civilians violates international law. Reports that the strikes have hit homes and volleyball games indicate a reckless disregard for civilian life.‚Äù</p>
<p>The statement added that Friday‚Äôs drone strike was part of an ‚Äúalarming series of attacks‚Äù which have escalated since March of this year.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhile Pakistani authorities have often denied responsibility for these attacks, they are obligated to conduct prompt, independent, transparent and effective investigations into these attacks and bring all those responsible to justice through fair trials.‚Äù</p>
<p>Last month, 22 civilians, including children and youth, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913755">injured</a> when a suspected quadcopter dropped munitions in the Birmal tehsil of Lower South Waziristan district, officials confirmed.</p>
<p>The incident occurred near Karmazi Stop on the Wana-Azam Warsak Road.</p>
<p>In October of last year, as many as 13 civilians, mostly children, who received <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866955">injuries</a> when a quadcopter allegedly dropped explosives on a marketplace in Tirah valley here on Monday, were brought to hospitals in Peshawar for treatment, local sources had told <em>Dawn</em>.</p></p>
