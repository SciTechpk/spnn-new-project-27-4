            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911576/uk-urges-all-sides-to-meet-treaty-obligations-amid-indias-suspension-of-iwt' target='_blank'><strong>UK urges ‘all sides’ to meet treaty obligations amid India’s suspension of IWT</strong></a>
            <p><p>UK’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs David Lammy on Saturday urged “all sides” to abide by their treaty obligations, referring to India’s move last month to hold the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a> (IWT) with Pakistan in abeyance unilaterally.</p>
<p>Delhi’s suspension of its participation in the 1960 IWT was part of its series of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">measures</a> against Pakistan, which it blamed, without any evidence, for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">strongly denied</a> any involvement and offered a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a> into it.</p>
<p>“We would urge all sides to meet their treaty obligations,” Lammy told <em>Reuters</em> in Islamabad at the end of his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911413/india-should-adhere-to-ceasefire-pakistan-will-respond-if-hostilities-resume-fo#:~:text=FM%20Dar%20appreciates%20UK%20role%20in%20de%2Descalation">two-day visit</a>, when asked about India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">April 23 suspension</a> of the (IWT), potentially <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911383">squeezing</a> Pakistan’s water supply.</p>
<p>The 1960 pact governs the use of the Indus River system. Pakistan has said it would consider “any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan” to be an “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">act of war</a>”.</p>
<p>Islamabad plans to launch <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907454">international legal action</a> against India over its move. The Pakistan Commission on Indus Waters earlier this month <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908458">shared</a> a detailed report with the federal government about massive violations of the IWT by New Delhi.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>During his interview with <em>Reuters</em>, Lammy also said Britain was working with the US to ensure a ceasefire between India and Pakistan endures.</p>
<p>“We will continue to work with the United States to ensure that we get an enduring ceasefire, to ensure that dialogue is happening and to work through with Pakistan and India how we can get to confidence and confidence-building measures between the two sides,” Lammy said.</p>
<p>“These are two neighbours with a long history but they are two neighbours that have barely been able to speak to one other over this past period, and we want to ensure that we do not see further escalation and that the ceasefire endures,” he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Pakistan has said Britain and other countries, in addition to the United States, played a major role in de-escalating the fighting. Diplomats and analysts say the ceasefire <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911472">remains fragile</a>.</p>
<p>Lammy also said Britain would continue to work with Pakistan on countering “terrorism”, saying that it is “a terrible blight on this country and its people, and of course on the region”.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said Washington had averted what could have been a nuclear war between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as tensions over the Pahalgam attack allegations continued to build up. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting drones</a> sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns. On May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, Trump announced that a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> had been reached between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>“The situation had escalated to the point where nuclear war could have broken out,” Trump said in an interview with US outlet <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-says-comey-knew-assassination-meaning-behind-deleted-social-media-post#:~:text=pointed%20to%20a%20recent%20ceasefire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News</a></em> on Friday.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to a question about getting both countries to step back from the brink of war, Trump called it a “bigger success than I will ever be given credit for”.</p>
<p>“Those are major nuclear powers […] and they were angry. […] It was tit-for-tat, it was getting deeper and more missiles,” he said. He added the next step would have been “the N-word”, responding in the affirmative to the host confirming he meant “nuclear”.</p>
<p>“That’s the worst thing that can happen,” Trump noted. Referring to discussions he said he had with both Pakistan and India on trade, the US president said: “I’m using trade to settle scores and make peace.”</p>
<p>Trump said that he had great conversations with Pakistan. “You know we can’t forget them because it takes two to tango.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“So proud of what we’re able to do with India and with Pakistan,” the US president said.</p>
<p>He continued that Pakistan would love to trade with the US. “They are brilliant people. They make amazing products. We don’t do much trading with them.”</p>
<p>As the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810/trumps-tariffs-stoke-global-trade-war-as-china-eu-hit-back">imposed heavy levies</a> on dozens of allies and rivals alike on April 2, Pakistan was hit by a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901838/economists-see-hurdles-and-opportunities-for-pakistan-as-us-imposes-29pc-tariff-on-country">29 per cent tariff</a> on goods it exports to the US. The government has said it is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906864">seeking ways</a> to address the existing trade imbalance between the two countries.</p>
<p>On trade with New Delhi, Trump said that India was one of the highly tariffed nations, making it almost “impossible to do business”.</p>
<p>However, India is ready to cut 100pc of its tariffs for the US, he added. “That deal will come soon,” the president said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, he had stated that India had offered a trade deal that proposed “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911203">no tariffs</a>” for American goods.</p>
<p>This interview was the third time in a week that the US president expressed his intention of deepening trade ties with Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>“We’re going to do a lot of trade with Pakistan … and India,” Trump said earlier this week, recalling that he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910565/trump-says-warned-pakistan-india-of-no-trade-if-fighting-not-halted">warned</a> both countries of “not doing any trade” if they did not stop fighting. A day after the ceasefire, he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910382#:~:text=adding%20that%20he%20also%20intended%20to%20%E2%80%9Cincrease%20trade%20substantially%20with%20both%20of%20these%20great%20nations%E2%80%9D">said</a> he was going “to increase trade substantially with both of these great nations”.</p>
<p>The US-brokered ceasefire had brought a halt to a week of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909156/nuclear-war-can-break-out-at-any-time-in-case-of-pak-india-standoff-khawaja-asif">record escalation</a> between Pakistan and India as the latter took a series of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988">unprovoked military actions</a> despite Islamabad’s call for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a> into India’s allegations over the Pahalgam attack.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Trump said after the ceasefire was struck that talks should take place in a third-country venue but no dates or location for the talks have been announced.</p>
<p>The military has confirmed that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910992">13 security personnel</a>, including members of the Pakistan Army and the Pakistan Air Force, were martyred while over 75 were injured during the confrontation with India.</p>
<p>It has also stated that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910848/40-civilians-11-personnel-martyred-in-indian-strikes">40 civilians</a> — including seven women and 15 children — lost their lives during the Indian aggression, while 121 others sustained injuries.</p></p>

            <p><p>Lt General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, director general of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), has lauded Iran’s peace efforts in the recent Pakistan-India conflict and warned of “forces” seeking to create a rift among brotherly countries.</p>
<p>Just two days after India, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">without</a> any evidence, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack">blamed</a> Pakistan over last month’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, Iran had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">offered to mediate</a> between the two as tensions escalated.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is fully grateful to the international community, and we are especially grateful to brotherly countries, including the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Gen Chaudhry told <em>IRNA</em> in an <a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85835207/Exclusive-Pakistani-military-spokesperson-Islamabad-appreciates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> published today — the first by any Pakistani armed forces’ spokesperson to an Iranian outlet.</p>
<p>“We should be aware that there are forces in the region that, with the help of external factors, are seeking to create misunderstanding and confusion among brotherly countries in the region and want to create a rift between friends and brothers,” the DG ISPR added.</p>

<p>According to <em>IRNA</em>, Lt Gen Chaudhry spoke about the latest developments in South Asia as well as the “importance of regional and international diplomacy to help de-escalate tensions”. He also “focused” on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">recent visit</a> of Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to Islamabad, the report added.</p>
<p>During his visit to Islamabad, Araghchi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">met with</a> Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir. He later also made a trip <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909355/irans-foreign-minister-repeats-call-for-restraint-in-india-pakistan-standoff">to New Delhi</a>, reiterating his call for restraint.</p>

<p>The DG ISPR appreciated Tehran’s efforts and support to help de-escalate tensions in the region.</p>
<p>“We are pleased with all the efforts of the international community and brotherly countries, especially Iran, which played a role in reducing tensions,” he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as tensions over the Pahalgam attack continued to build up.

<p>The Pakistani army spokesman emphasised that Iran and Pakistan “have very historical and brotherly relations and have always stood by each other in all challenges and trials”.</p>

<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry highlighted that the two nations were “neighbouring and friendly countries that are in contact with each other on many issues and fields”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is eager and pursues that the borders of the two countries are the borders of peace and friendship, and we look forward to it,” the DG ISPR told <em>IRNA</em>.</p>

            <p><p>Former foreign minister and PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi has been moved from Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat Jail to the Punjab Institute of Cardiology (PIC) on Saturday after he suffered heart pain, his lawyer said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Qureshi has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897723/amended-charges-framed-against-qureshi-others">indicted</a> in multiple cases pertaining to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279/special-report-may-9-mayhem-and-military-trials-a-year-on">May 9, 2023 riots</a> and has remained behind bars since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1771020">August 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em> today, Advocate Rana Mudassar, Qureshi’s lawyer, said his client suffered heart pain early in the morning after Fajr prayers. He underwent a medical assessment by prison doctors.</p>
<p>“He was shifted to the PIC by Rescue 1122 after his health failed to improve,” Mudassar said, adding that Qureshi was currently undergoing various tests at the hospital.</p>
<p>The PTI leader’s family had been informed about his condition, the lawyer added.</p>
<p>In a post on X today, Qureshi’s son urged the nation to pray for his speedy recovery.</p>
