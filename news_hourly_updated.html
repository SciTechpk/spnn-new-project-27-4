            </a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump has said said the escalation between India and Pakistan was a ‚Äúshame‚Äù.</p>
<p>He was the first world leader to react to the tense situation after India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">carried out strikes</a> inside Pakistan which also retaliated and reportedly shot down Indian jets.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame. We just heard about it as we were walking in the doors of the Oval [Office],‚Äù he said inside the White House after overseeing the swearing-in ceremony for his special envoy, Steve Witkoff.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past. They‚Äôve been fighting for a long time,‚Äù the US president added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI hope it ends very quickly.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a statement, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called for restraint from both countries, Associated Press  reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Secretary-General is very concerned about the Indian military  operations across the Line of Control and international border. He calls  for maximum military restraint from both countries. The world cannot  afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan,‚Äù said  the statement.</p>
<p>The US State Department also said it is ‚Äúclosely monitoring developments,‚Äù <em>CNN</em> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are aware of the reports, however we have no assessment to offer at this time,‚Äù the spokesperson said. ‚ÄúThis remains an evolving situation,and we are closely monitoring developments.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>Pakistan downs 5 Indian jets as retaliation for late-night strikes at 6 sites: officials</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Pakistani military has brought down five Indian jets in retaliation for late-night strikes launched by its neighbouring country at six sites, including in Punjab‚Äôs Sialkot and Bahawalpur, as well as Azad Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between Pakistan and India began a little after 1am on Wednesday with the Indian air strikes when the neighbouring country launched what it termed ‚ÄúOperation Sindoor‚Äù. Soon after reports emerged, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) confirmed the strikes, saying that India had carried out the attacks from within its airspace. The military spokesperson provided an updated damage assessment of the scenario at around 4am, reporting the death of eight civilians.</p>
<p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed the downing of two Indian jets around 2:45am after Pakistan launched its swift response, while the confirmation for the third plane, a Rafale aircraft, came an hour later. Confirmation of the fourth and fifth Indian jets being taken down came after 5am by Tarar and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif.</p>
<p>Providing further updates on the casualties, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said the number of lives had risen to 26 civilians across six localities that India hit, with 46 injured.</p>

<p>Talking to the media around 7am at the information ministry, Tarar asserted that India had waved a white flag at the Line of Control and ‚Äúaccepted defeat‚Äù. The minister said this as footage of a white flag played in the background.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey have been forced to wave a white flag,‚Äù Tarar said. <em>PTV News</em> also shared <a class="link--external" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJVelCktXce" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">footage</a> of a white flag hoisted seemingly on top of a structure.</p>

<p>Tarar further said that ‚Äúseveral‚Äù posts of the Indian army across the border had been destroyed by the armed forces.</p>
<p>He recalled that Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">called for a probe</a> into the Pahalgam attack but India ‚Äúconducted this attack and then fled from it‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt is a cause of shame for them that they targeted innocent labourers and citizens,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>According to the minister, Pakistan did not target any civilians in India in its retaliatory actions.</p>

<p>Similarly, appearing on <em>Geo News</em> at 5:09am, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also said that Pakistan had downed five Indian jets.</p>
<p>‚Äú[We shot jets down] in Akhnoor, Ambala, Barnala and in Jammu. We also shot down quadcopters and a big drone,‚Äù he stated. ‚ÄúIt is an ongoing situation, we need to see what India does.‚Äù</p>
<p>The military, <em>Reuters</em> reported, said the five Indian fighter jets included three Rafale planes and one each of Russian planes, a Su-30 and MiG-29.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch    media--uneven  media--stretch">

    </figure></p>
<p>A spokesman for the military told <em>Reuters</em> Indian planes were only targeted after they attacked Pakistan.</p>
<p>There was no word from India on the downing of the jets, which would be the most serious loss for the Indian military in decades and risked further escalation.</p>
<p>The Rafale fighter is a new addition to India‚Äôs military, part of a plan to modernise its military, reduce dependence on Russian-origin equipment, and boost domestic weapons production to supply forces deployed along two contentious borders with Pakistan and China.</p>
<p>Before the clash, the Indian Air Force operated 36 Rafale fighters, while the navy‚Äôs aircraft fleet mainly comprises Russian MiG-29 jets.</p>
<p>India signed a deal with France‚Äôs Dassault Aviation on Monday to buy another 26 Rafale fighter aircraft worth 630 billion rupees ($7.4bn) for its navy in late April.</p>
<p>Tarar earlier said that Pakistan‚Äôs military response was ongoing but did not share operational details. ‚ÄúWe shot down two Indian planes and we are responding to Indian aggression right now as we speak,‚Äù he told British broadcaster <em>Sky News</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndian media, in a state of frenzy, is continuously running fabricated stories about losses of Pakistani Air Force and false claims of damaged aircraft,‚Äù <em>PTV</em> had said, stating, ‚ÄúNo Pakistan Air Force aircraft has sustained any damage.‚Äù</p>

<p>Appearing on British broadcaster <em>Sky News</em> around 2:45am, Tarar said Pakistan‚Äôs response is ongoing, but did not share operational details.</p>
<p>When asked about the potential for escalation, Tarar said it ‚Äúis an evolving situation‚Äù.</p>
<p>He reiterated that Pakistan was expecting an attack by India and said that ‚Äúthey would be the aggressor‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe offered an investigation into the whole Pahalgam episode, we wanted a fair and transparent investigation. But ‚Ä¶ India, without evidence, has targeted civilians, women and children. India had no right to do that,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs the minister for information, I have occupied a seat of responsibility,‚Äù Tarar said. ‚ÄúI have taken an oath and I will give you verified information.‚Äù</p>
<p>When asked why India blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack, Tarar replied: ‚ÄúThis area (Pahalgam) is a good 200km from the LoC. The FIR was filed in 10 minutes, but police arrived after one and a half hours.‚Äù</p>
<p>Tarar accused India of ‚Äúrunning away‚Äù from an investigation into the Pahalgam attack and accused India‚Äôs governing party of ‚Äúwanting a reason to attack Pakistan‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have a high morale and we will respond to Indian aggression,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia has no evidence whatsoever to link Pakistan to this incident,‚Äù he stressed. ‚ÄúIndia has attacked civilians ‚Ä¶ without any justifiable cause and because we have the right to self-defence, we will defend our country, we will respond.‚Äù</p>
<p>Questioned about terrorists found hiding in Pakistan in the past, including Al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden, Tarar rejected the allegations and reiterated that Pakistan was facing terrorist attacks ‚Äúevery second week‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre talking about the history ‚Äî the Soviet invasion, the cold war ‚Äî then that‚Äôs a different story,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Tarar also maintained that the US had thanked Pakistan for its efforts in the war against terrorism and ‚Äúfor the good fight we are fighting‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia will now face Pakistan‚Äôs very fierce response, because we are never the aggressors,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Referring to Pahalgam, Tarar said India ‚Äúis questioning its own government‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey have no evidence, they have no facts and they ran away from the investigation which Pakistan had offered,‚Äù the minister added. They attacked our civilians, they attacked our mosque today, they attacked five localities. Pakistan will now respond and will respond very, very effectively.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur desire for peace should not be mistaken for weakness,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>When asked about India‚Äôs strikes, Tarar said that no terrorist infrastructure was hit.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen I took foreign and local journalists to a village near the LoC ‚Ä¶ tomorrow morning, I was planning to take them to Bahawalpur and Muridke to show them where the strikes have occurred, to show that the local population is living there.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe totally deny India‚Äôs allegations regarding terrorists,‚Äù Tarar maintained. ‚ÄúWe have complete evidence that women and children have been targeted, there are civilian casualties in this and we will bring the evidence to foreign and local media. There are no terrorist camps.‚Äù</p>
<p>Questioned about the possibility of de-escalation, Tarar said that the situation is ongoing, adding, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see how it turns out‚Äù.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>ARY News</em> at 1:06am about the initial details of the attack, DG Chaudhry said: ‚ÄúAll of our air force jets are airborne. This cowardly and shameful attack was carried out from within India‚Äôs airspace. They were never allowed to come and intrude into the space of Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>He noted: ‚ÄúLet me say it unequivocally: Pakistan will respond to this at a time and place of its own choosing. This heinous provocation will not go unanswered.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis temporary happiness that India has achieved with this cowardly attack will be replaced with enduring grief.‚Äù</p>

<p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told <em>ARY News</em> that civilian areas were attacked.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe attacks were carried out on civilian areas,‚Äù Asif said, adding that the ‚Äúcowards‚Äù attacked from their own airspace. ‚ÄúThey never left their house. Let them come out, we will respond fittingly.‚Äù</p>
<p>When asked about Pakistan‚Äôs decisions, Asif replied that Pakistan will retaliate.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will give a far greater response than their own strike,‚Äù the minister said. ‚ÄúNot only did they attack civilians but they did it from their own airspace.‚Äù</p>
<p>On <em>Geo News</em>, Asif clarified that the strikes were launched from within India‚Äôs airspace.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWomen and children have been martyred in civilian areas. India is claiming it was targeting terrorist camps,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere is no such thing, international media can visit the targets so that India‚Äôs lies are exposed. We are offering international media to come wherever attacks have happened.‚Äù</p>
<p>The defence minister further said: ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have the courage to attack us in our airspace, and they are firing on women and children. Mosques have been destroyed.‚Äù</p>
<p>He vowed that ‚Äúwe will give a befitting response,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey will immediately receive their due.‚Äù</p>
<p>Multiple loud explosions were heard in Azad Jammu and Kashmir close to the mountains around the city of Muzaffarabad after midnight, multiple <em>Reuters</em> witnesses said.</p>
<p>After the explosions, the city‚Äôs power was blacked out, the witnesses said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs act of aggression has resulted in martyrdom of civilians, including women and children. This act of aggression has also caused grave threat to commercial air traffic.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe strongly condemn India‚Äôs cowardly action, which is a flagrant violation of the UN Charter, international law, and established norms of inter-state relations.</p>
<p>In the wake of Pahalgam attack, the Indian leadership has once again used the bogey of terrorism to advance its sham narrative of victimhood, jeopardising regional peace and security. India‚Äôs reckless action has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict.‚Äú</p>
<p>The FO said the situation continues to evolve and Pakistan reserves the right to respond appropriately at a time and place of its choosing, in accordance with the Article-51 of the UN Charter, and as enshrined in international law.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe government, armed forces and people of Pakistan stand united in the face of Indian aggression. They will always act with iron resolve to protect and preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe the people of Pakistan stand together as a nation against this ugly, senseless, foolish Indian aggression. We are shoulder to shoulder with our fighting forces and will defend our homeland against this cowardly Indian attack,‚Äù said former president Arif Alvi.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat is still imminent today and can happen anytime,‚Äù he said, adding that a confrontation could be ‚Äúone of the choice‚Äù India could want to adopt but ‚Äúwe have developed a countermeasure for every choice, whether that is a surgical strike or ground attack or air attack or naval engagement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the United States on Tuesday again called for calm between India and Pakistan, after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned of stopping water from flowing across borders.</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz and the accompanying dignitaries ‚Äúunderscored the imperative of heightened national vigilance, seamless inter-agency coordination, and reinforced operational readiness to deter and decisively respond to any violation of Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity‚Äù, the PMO said.</p>
<p>Commending the ISI‚Äôs ‚Äúprofessionalism and strategic acumen‚Äù, the prime minister lauded its ‚Äúcritical role in safeguarding national interests and enabling informed national security decision-making under complex and dynamic conditions‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan Army is one of the most professional and disciplined force in the world,‚Äù the premier was quoted as saying. He reaffirmed that the entire nation was standing with ‚Äúour brave armed forces‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe leadership reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs unambiguous resolve to defend the homeland against all threats ‚Äî conventional or otherwise,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>The leaders reiterated that with the nation‚Äôs full support, the armed forces, supported by all other elements of national power and state institutions, remained ‚Äúfully prepared to uphold Pakistan‚Äôs security, prestige, and honour under all circumstances‚Äù.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also visited the newly established National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre (Niftac) and formally inaugurated its state-of-the-art headquarters, ‚Äúwhich will serve as the central node for coordinating Pakistan‚Äôs national counterterrorism strategy‚Äù, the PMO said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNiftac, a federal institution, integrates over 50 relevant federal and provincial departments and agencies into a unified intelligence and threat management architecture supported by a centralised national database.‚Äù</p>
<p>The statement added that at the subnational level, Niftac is linked to six Provincial Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centres (Piftacs), including those in AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan, ensuring seamless coordination from the federation to the provinces.</p>
<p>Commending the efforts of all stakeholders involved in operationalising this vital capability, the prime minister described Niftac as a quintessential national platform for collaborative threat assessment and response. He underscored that ‚Äúdismantling the nexus between terrorism, illicit networks, and external sponsorship requires robust and efficient institutional mechanisms.‚Äù</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Modi said that water from India that once flowed across borders would be stopped.</p>
<p>Modi did not mention Pakistan specifically, but his speech comes after New Delhi suspended its part of the 65-year-old Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which governs water critical for consumption and agriculture.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs water used to go outside, now it will flow for India‚Äù, Modi said in a speech in New Delhi. ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs water will be stopped for India‚Äôs interests, and it will be utilised for India.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pakistan has warned that tampering with its rivers would be considered ‚Äúan act of war‚Äù.</p>
<p>However, experts also pointed out that India‚Äôs existing dams do not have the capacity to block or divert water and can only regulate the timing of when they release flows.</p>
<p>Islamabad accused India of altering the flow of the Chenab River, one of three rivers placed under Pakistan‚Äôs control according to the IWT.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have witnessed changes in the river (Chenab) which are not natural at all,‚Äù Punjab Irrigation Minister Kazim Pirzada told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe majority impact will be felt in areas which have fewer alternate water routes,‚Äù Pirzada warned.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOne day the river had normal inflow and the next day it was greatly reduced,‚Äù Pirzada added.</p>
<p>In AJK, large quantities of water from India were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906856">reportedly released</a> on April 26, according to the Jinnah Institute.</p>
