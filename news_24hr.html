            <p><p>Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on mutual visa exemption during the 12th session of the Pakistan-UAE Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC), the Foreign Office (FO) said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The session was held following a hiatus of <a class="link--external" href="https://www.moib.gov.pk/News/64780" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">13 years</a> after it was scheduled in October 2024. The <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/11th-session-of-pakistan-uae-joint-ministerial-commission" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">last session</a> was held in Islamabad from November 6-7, 2013.</p>
<p>The FO said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1937752634267414594" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> that the session, held in Abu Dhabi a day ago, was co-chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his UAE counterpart Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan.</p>
<p>“Prior to the formal proceedings, a working group meeting of the JMC was held under the leadership of Special Assistant to the PM Tariq Bajwa and Minister of State of the UAE Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh, the statement said.</p>
<p>“The JMC reviewed the full scope of bilateral relations and agreed on concrete measures to strengthen cooperation in trade, banking, culture, investment, aviation, railways, energy, food security, climate change, defence, healthcare, manpower, higher education and information technology.”</p>

<p>It also said that both sides emphasised promoting institutional mechanisms and inter-ministerial coordination, and discussed regional and global developments.</p>
<p>“A protocol, outlining procedural frameworks for follow-up actions, coordination through sectoral working groups and facilitation for reciprocal visits, was also signed,” the statement added.</p>
<p>According to FO, “In addition to the protocol of the session, MoU on ‘Mutual Exemption of Entry Visa Requirements’ and ‘Establishment of a Joint Task Force to Promote Investments’ as well as an Agreement on ‘Artificial Intelligence and Digital Economy’ were signed.”</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MIshaqDar50/status/1937708404660744263" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Dar said that he signed an agreement with Al-Nahyan on “mutual visa exemption for the holders of diplomatic and official passports of our two countries”.</p>
<p>“This important step reflects our shared resolve to further strengthen our fraternal ties and deepen institutional collaboration across all levels,” he added.</p>

<p>The FO said that both sides expressed satisfaction with the outcomes and agreed to hold the 13th Session of the JMC in Pakistan on mutually agreed-upon dates.</p>
<p>“The successful convening of the JMC session underscores the deep-rooted and multifaceted relationship between Pakistan and the UAE and their shared vision for a dynamic and progressive partnership,” it added.</p>
<p>The UAE is Pakistan’s third-largest trading partner after China and the United States, is home to more than a million Pakistani expatriates and is the second-largest source of remittances after Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UAE, Faisal Tirmizi, had said that the bilateral trade between Pakistan and the UAE <a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvworld/newsdetail/4542" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exceeded</a> US$10.9 billion in the fiscal year 2023–24, including goods and services.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, PM Shehbaz Sharif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916754/pm-shehbaz-discusses-regional-peace-bilateral-ties-with-uae-leadership">met</a> UAE President and Ruler of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan during his official one-day visit to the Gulf state, where he discussed matters of bilateral and regional interest.</p>
<p>The high-level engagement aimed at reaffirming Pakistan’s gratitude to friendly nations that supported Islamabad’s position during its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">recent standoff</a> with New Delhi.</p></p>

            <p><p>The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Wednesday slashed the base power tariff by Rs1.49 per unit for the next fiscal year.</p>
<p>Nepra Spokesperson Safeer Hussain confirmed the development to <em>Dawn.com</em> and said the proposal had been sent to the federal government.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Last month, against high hopes, the government sought revision in the base electricity tariff for the next fiscal year, proposing only 30 paise to a maximum of Rs2.25 per unit reduction in consumer rates under seven different scenarios.</p>
<p>Only in one unlikely case of normal circumstances and a stable exchange rate at Rs280, the average base tariff would reduce by Rs2.25 per unit in fiscal year 2025-26 to Rs24.75 from the prevailing rate of about Rs27 per unit.</p>
<p>In case of local currency depreciation to Rs300, the base tariff reduction would be around 30 paise per unit. The reduction mainly stems from lower capacity payments.</p>
<p>The average Power Purchase Price (PPP) would be on top of about Rs8.16 to Rs9.52 per unit fuel cost, taking the total electricity price to range between Rs34 and Rs35 per unit, excluding taxes, fees, duties and surcharges.</p>
<p>Electricity demand is projected to grow between three and five per cent in all cases, but only if the exchange rate remains stable at Rs280. The exchange rate has been assumed to be Rs300 in all six other cases. In addition, US inflation has been taken at 2pc, Pakistan inflation at 8.65pc, besides 11.9pc Karachi Interbank Offe­red Rate, 4.07pc international interest rate, and transmission losses at 2.80pc.</p>
<p>The Nepra determination would be taken to the federal cabinet for approval and subsidy allocation, and the power division would file a follow-up tariff table to Nepra for subsidy punching for various consumer categories and slabs be­­fore formal notification with effect from July 1 as already committed to the International Monetary Fund.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920078/james-webb-telescope-discovers-its-first-exoplanet' target='_blank'><strong>James Webb telescope discovers its first exoplanet</strong></a>
            <p><p>The James Webb Space Telescope has discovered its first exoplanet, astronomers said on Wednesday, capturing rare direct images of the relatively small world in the Earth’s galactic backyard.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1665553">telescope</a>, which can see farther into the universe than anything before it, has turbocharged the search for planets beyond the Solar System since coming online in 2022.</p>
<p>Until now, however, its deep gaze has mostly been used to probe already known exoplanets, to find out key information such as the atmospheric composition, rather than tracking down new worlds.</p>
<p>The discovery of exoplanet TWA 7b, revealed in a study in the journal <em>Nature</em>, “represents a first for the telescope”, France’s CNRS research centre said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.cnrs.fr/en/press/james-webb-space-telescope-discovers-its-first-exoplanet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>The large majority of the nearly 6,000 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906052/planet-with-comet-like-tail-observed-disintegrating-near-its-star">exoplanets</a> found so far have been identified from the light they blot out when they pass in front of their star, rather than from direct images of the planet.</p>
<p>Webb “has spent an enormous amount of time observing planets that have never been directly imaged”, lead study author Anne-Marie Lagrange of the Paris Observatory told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#blinded-by-the-light" id="blinded-by-the-light" title="Permalink"></a>‘Blinded by the light’</h2>
<p>Capturing direct images of faraway planets is difficult because they are “very faint” due to a lack of heat, Lagrange said. Even worse, she added, “We’re blinded by the light of the star they orbit.”</p>
<p>But Webb has a way to get around the problem.</p>
<p>An attachment to Webb’s MIRI instrument called a coronagraph masks the star, creating an effect similar to a solar eclipse. The telescope’s infrared vision can then peer through and spot the planet.</p>
<p>Astronomers pointed Webb at the star TWA 7, which is around a hundred light years from Earth, relatively nearby in the universe.</p>
<p>The star, which was first spotted by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, was thought to be a promising target for two reasons.</p>
<p>It is just 6.4 million years old — a baby compared to the Sun’s 4.5 billion years — and still surrounded by a massive disc of gas and dust where planets are thought to form.</p>
<p>And from the direction of Earth, the disc is seen from above, giving a good view of its rings.</p>
<p>The three rings around the star, which stretch more than 100 times the distance separating the Sun and Earth, had previously been spotted by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/532660/chile-desert-to-host-worldaes-biggest-telescope">Very Large Telescope</a> in Chile.</p>
<p>But inside an otherwise empty section of the second ring, the Webb telescope detected something particularly bright. Astronomers ruled out that the light was coming from an object at the edge of the Solar System, or from a distant galaxy behind the star.</p>
<p>That could mean only that the light source was a relatively small and cold planet, with a mass at least 10 times lighter than any other exoplanet directly imaged so far, according to the study.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#the-hunt-for-smaller-worlds" id="the-hunt-for-smaller-worlds" title="Permalink"></a>The hunt for smaller worlds</h2>
<p>The researchers estimated that the planet’s mass was similar to that of Saturn, a gas giant that weighs only a third of Jupiter, the biggest planet in the Solar System.</p>
<p>Webb has increased the ability to detect exoplanets via direct images by a factor of 10, Lagrange said.</p>
<p>That is important because smaller, rocky planets similar to Earth or Mars are the ultimate target in the search for habitable worlds outside of the Solar System.</p>
<p>Lagrange said she would be delighted to discover “Earth-like planets” one day.</p>
<p>But she said astronomers needed to study all kinds of planets — and to understand how planetary systems form — to know whether the life-hosting Solar System is unique.</p>
<p>In the future, astronomers expect the Webb telescope will be able to spot planets even smaller than TWA 7b.</p>
<p>But directly capturing images of faraway worlds similar to Earth will require even more telescopic power, such as from the Extremely Large Telescope that is scheduled to come online in Chile in 2028.</p></p>
