            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev renewed their pledge to diversify the strategic partnership through investment in mutually beneficial avenues, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/27-05-2025/pakistan-azerbaijan-vow-to-diversify-strategic-partnership-through-investment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The development came as the premier met with President Aliyev after landing in Azerbaijan’s Lachin District earlier today as he continued his four-nation tour to appreciate their support for Pakistan during the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military confrontation</a> with India.</p>
<p>Starting his expedition on May 25, the premier has already paid a visit to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913346/pm-shehbaz-in-turkiye-to-elevate-strategic-partnership">Turkiye</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913442/ready-to-talk-with-india-pm-shehbaz-says-during-meeting-with-iranian-president-in-tehran">Iran</a>, with Tajikistan his final stop of the trip ending on May 30.</p>
<p>In their meeting today, PM Shehbaz and Aliyev reviewed the “full spectrum of bilateral relations and expressed satisfaction over the upward trajectory of political, economic, defence, and cultural cooperation” between their countries, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> stated.</p>
<p>The prime minister thanked Aliyev’s country for its steadfast support during the recent Pakistan-India confrontation and “acknowledged the public expressions of solidarity from both the leadership and the people of brotherly Azerbaijan”. Earlier this month, Aliyev had congratulated Shehbaz upon Pakistan’s “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911194/azerbaijan-hails-pakistans-remarkable-success-during-recent-military-strife-with-india-pmo">remarkable success</a>”, according to the PM Office.</p>
<p>He noted that the people of Azerbaijan “celebrated the success of Pakistan in Marka-i-Haq against India”, referring to the Pakistan armed forces’ response to Indian aggression.</p>

<p>The Azerbaijan side agreed to the exchange of delegations regarding progress in its investment in Pakistan, with delegation-level talks to be organised “very soon”, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>The prime minister reiterated that both countries had stood by each other on every occasion and would continue to do so. He also conveyed his warm felicitations to Aliyev and his nation ahead of the Azerbaijan Republic Day tomorrow.</p>
<p>The two leaders underscored the importance of coordinated efforts to promote regional stability, mutual prosperity and principled positions on key international issues, the report added.</p>
<p>The meeting concluded with both leaders reaffirming their commitment to the deepening of the Pakistan-Azerbaijan partnership and working closely to further advance shared objectives at the bilateral and regional levels.</p>
<p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi were also present during the meeting, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/GovtofPakistan/status/1927402648749113524" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on the government’s official X account.

<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913346/pm-shehbaz-in-turkiye-to-elevate-strategic-partnership">In Istanbul</a>, Shehbaz and Erdogan had “reaffirmed their principled support for each other’s core concerns, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute”. In Tehran, the premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913442/ready-to-talk-with-india-pm-shehbaz-says-during-meeting-with-iranian-president-in-tehran">expressed his willingness</a> to talk with India to resolve ongoing issues, including Kashmir and water security.</p>
<p>During his visit, PM Shehbaz will have “wide-ranging discussions with the leaders of these countries on an entire range of issues covering bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance”, the Foreign Office had said earlier.</p>
<p>“He will also have the opportunity to express the deepest appreciation and acknowledgement for the support extended to Pakistan by the friendly countries during the recent crisis with India,” it noted.</p>
<p>While in Tajikistan — likely the last leg of his tour — the premier will also attend the International Conference on Glaciers being held in its capital, Dushanbe, on May 29 and 30.</p>

<p>“Key areas of mutual interest included enhancing military-to-military cooperation, improving security mechanisms along the shared border, and exploring avenues for transforming the border regions into zones of trade and economic connectivity, thereby contributing to regional stability and prosperity.”</p>
<p>COAS Munir was “accorded a warm welcome upon his arrival, including a ceremonial guard of honour presented by a well-turned-out contingent of the Iranian Armed Forces”, the statement added.</p>
<p>The ISPR stated that COAS Munir was on an official visit to Türkiye, Iran and Azerbaijan — three of the countries on Shehbaz’s itinerary.</p>

<p>As tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi escalated, with India launching deadly strikes on Pakistan on May 6, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909193/erdogan-conveys-turkiyes-solidarity-to-pm-shehbaz-amid-india-escalation">conveyed his solidarity</a> to the prime minister and said it supported Pakistan’s “calm and restrained policies”.</p>

            <p><p>Seven minors were among 22 people injured in an alleged quadcopter strike in the Wana tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s South Waziristan district, according to a hospital list.</p>
<p>An incident report issued by the district headquarters hospital (DHQ) in Wana mentioned a “drone attack” at 8pm, which injured 22 people aged between 13 and 60 years.</p>
<p>The condition of a 13-year-old and a man was listed as “serious”, and they were referred to “tertiary care”. Seven, including three aged 15, 18 and 19 years, had “major” injuries. The rest of the 13 had “minor” injuries, of which two were discharged.</p>
<p>PTI-affiliated <a class="link--external" href="https://www.na.gov.pk/en/profile.php?uid=1657" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MNA Zubair Khan Wazir</a> echoed the hospital’s tally and told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “The young men were playing volleyball when the quadcopter fired shells on them.”</p>
<p>He added that people in the area were “scared and restricted to their homes after the attack”.</p>
<p>Wazir, in a post on Facebook, strongly condemned the “drone attack in which innocent citizens were targeted”. He demanded that the federal government and the relevant institutions “immediately investigate the incident, provide justice to the affected families, and take immediate and effective steps to prevent such attacks in the future”.</p>
<p>“Targeting common people under the guise of an attack on a Taliban post is extremely regrettable, shameful and unacceptable,” Wazir claimed, terming the incident a “part of a heinous conspiracy to sabotage regional peace”.</p>
<p>The incident comes within a fortnight after a suspected quadcopter munitions drop claimed the lives of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912113">four children</a> and injured five others in North Waziristan District’s Mir Ali tehsil. The military clarified that security forces were “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912393/security-forces-falsely-implicated-in-north-waziristan-incident-ispr">falsely implicated</a>” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>Locals there staged a sit-in for over a week with the victims’ bodies, demanding justice, before finally announcing today that they had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913645/mir-ali-sit-in-over-alleged-drone-strike-comes-to-an-end-as-agreement-reached">ended their protest</a> after reaching an agreement with the local administration.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee (RHC) on Tuesday announced that it has not sighted the Zilhaj moon, meaning Pakistan would observe Eidul Azha on June 7.</p>
<p>The committee’s meeting took place on a roof in Islamabad’s Kohsar Block, where the religious affairs ministry has its <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/QExNBEGH6bpF75948" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">office</a>.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference, RHC Chairman Maulana Abdul Khabeer Azad said, “No testimony of sighting the moon of the month of Zilhaj was received from any part of Pakistan […]. Therefore, it was decided with consensus that Zilhaj 1, 1446AH would be on May 29, Thursday and Eidul Azha would be observed on June 7, Saturday.”</p>
<p>He noted that the weather remained cloudy in most parts of the country and clear in some.</p>
<p>Maulana Azad presided over the meeting of the RHC earlier in the evening, with officials and experts from other departments also gathered to sight the moon.</p>
<p>Simultaneous zonal meetings of the RHC also took place at their respective headquarters in the provincial capitals to send testimonies.</p>
<p>Dr Mohammad Hasan Ali, director of the Institute of Meteorology and Geophysics at the Pakistan Meteorological Department; Shaukatullah Khan of the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco); and Zainul Abedin from the science and tech ministry were among those present during the meeting, Azad said.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Suparco <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912584">predicted</a> that the festive occasion of Eidul Azha would likely be celebrated across Pakistan on June 7.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>According to Suparco, while the birth of a new moon for Zilhaj 1446 AH would occur on May 27, the possibility of the moon being sighted across the country today would be extremely low even under optimal weather conditions.</p>
<p>Cloudy weather <a class="link--external" href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/pk/islamabad/258278/hourly-weather-forecast/258278" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> in the federal capital further reduced the sighting probability.</p>
<p>Celebrated on the 10th of Zilhaj, Eidul Azha marks the culmination of Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam.</p></p>
