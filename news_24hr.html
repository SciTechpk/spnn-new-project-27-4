            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923729/jui-f-chief-fazl-advises-change-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-administration' target='_blank'><strong>JUI-F chief Fazl advises ‘change’ in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa administration</strong></a>
            <p><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Saturday suggested that there should be a “change” in the PTI-led Khyber Pakht­un­khwa government, adding that it would be better if the change came from within the ruling party amid reports of possible efforts afoot to bring a “regime change” in the province.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921763">met</a> two key leaders from the province, ostensibly to get a handle on the political situation. The PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre believes that the PTI government in KP has failed to deliver for over a decade, and recent events have further cemented their conviction that the provincial government is failing to safeguard the lives of the people. Meanwhile, the PTI has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921760/pti-warns-against-attempt-to-topple-provincial-set-up">warned</a> against any attempt to topple the provincial government through constitutional means.</p>
<p>Addressing the matter at a press conference in Peshawar today, the JUI-F chief said, “My advice would be that there should be a change in the province but if the PTI is in the majority, then the change should be from within the majority of the PTI. If the same people come together to bring a change in the provincial government, then it will be better.”</p>
<p>Fazl said he preferred this option rather than the opposition coming together and bringing a change in the government.</p>
<p>He added that it was his belief and that of his party that the majority of the province was “fake” and a product of rigging but it could not tolerate any political struggle or uncertainty, thus it would be better if there was a change from within the ruling PTI.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Speaking on the prevailing security situation in the province, Fazl said, “The common citizen’s life is insecure today.</p>
<p>“If the opposition parties contact us then will we talk to them and also try to hold an all party conference to discuss this issue and come up with a strategy to deal with it.”</p>
<p>Speaking about the merger of Fata with KP, he said, “We strongly opposed the merger when it was being done.”</p>
<p>Fazl said that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922671/pti-muqam-spar-over-ex-fata-jirga-committee">committee</a> formed to bring reforms in ex-Fata did not have representation from KP.</p>
<p>“From all the parties, only we have been asked for representatives for the committee, but we haven’t given our representatives,” he added. The JUI-F chief said that the party would take its decision in consultation with tomorrow’s grand tribal jirga.</p>
<p>“Is this decision an admission of the failure of the previous decision (Fata merger) or another ploy to gain access to the minerals of the area?” he asked.</p>
<p>The JUI-F chief said that if he was content with the federal government’s decisions, then he would have joined them. “Both the federal and the provincial governments were a result of electoral rigging,” Fazl said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi said that the ex-Fata committee was not “about reversing the merger of Fata and the province”.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Peshawar, he said, “The committee was formed when the prime minister and Field Marshal [Asim] Munir visited and a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915208">jirga</a> was held.</p>
<p>“The provincial government said that the jirga system that had ended in the merged districts should be revived, and this is what the committee was formed for.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) founder Altaf Hussain’s health has been on the mend after he was admitted to the hospital, according to a video by a party official posted on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hussain was recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923515">hospitalised</a> in London due to “severe illness”, where he underwent multiple tests. London-based senior party leader Mustafa Azizabadi told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the MQM founder’s treatment was ongoing and “hopefully it’s not something serious”.</p>
<p>In a video message posted early on X today, Azizabadi stated that the MQM founder’s health had improved since yesterday.</p>
<p>“Altaf Hussain <em>bhai</em> (brother) has undergone some tests and blood transfusion has been given. The tests show that Altaf <em>bhai’s</em> health … has greatly improved,” Azizabadi said. “Doctors are treating him according to the test results.”</p>
<p>He highlighted that misinformation had spread about Hussain’s condition, calling it “upsetting”.</p>

<p>An update from MQM Coordination Committee Deputy Convener Qasim Ali said doctors conducted a detailed medical examination and agreed to continue treatment in light of the test reports from a day ago.</p>
<p>“Doctors have advised continuing blood transfusions for Altaf Hussain today as well due to a decrease in blood count.”</p>

<p>Previously known as the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, Hussain founded his party in 1984 to represent the Urdu-speaking community, which had migrated to Pakistan amid Partition.</p>

<p>Under Hussain’s leadership, MQM swept the 1988 election in Sindh’s urban areas, emerging as the third-largest party in the country.</p>
<p>The MQM under Hussain was accused of using violent tactics to attain and retain political power. On the contrary, Hussain maintained that the state and other political parties have targeted MQM and its workers ever since its formation.</p>
<p>Hussain currently lives in London, where he has been in self-imposed exile since 1992. He was later granted British citizenship. From London, Hussain played an active role in politics, regularly broadcasting political speeches to his followers in Karachi.</p></p>

            <p><p>Pakistan’s Olympic javelin champion Arshad Nadeem and India’s Neeraj Chopra are set to lock horns next month at the Diamond League event in Silesia, Poland, in their <a class="link--external" href="https://www.olympics.com/en/news/neeraj-chopra-vs-arshad-nadeem-record-head-to-head-rivalry-india-pakistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first</a> head-to-head contest since the Paris Olympics, it emerged on Saturday.</p>
<p>The match-up comes amid heightened political tensions between Pakistan and India, which have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923614">spilt over</a> into the world of sports.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://silesia.diamondleague.com/stars-galore-in-silesia-bukowiecka-and-lisek-announce-new-names/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> from the Diamond League, issued on July 9, announced the athletes taking part in the upcoming competition in Poland, including Kenyan middle-distance runner Faith Kipyegon.</p>
<p>The contest between Nadeem and Chopra was described as “the first opportunity for revenge after the Paris Olympics”.</p>
<p>“The Pakistani’s form remains something of a mystery, as he rarely appears on the European circuit,” the press release read. “The exception he will make on August 16 results from his desire to face Chopra.”</p>
<p>The press release noted that Chopra threw 90 metres this spring, adding that he is “yearning for more”. Last week, Chopra <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922485/indias-javelin-hero-chopra-leverages-star-power-as-crowds-flock-to-self-titled-event">headlined</a> the ‘Neeraj Chopra Classic’ — billed as India’s inaugural world-class field competition — and walked away with another gold medal.</p>
<p>In May, Nadeem threw a massive 86.4m to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914503">win gold</a> in the men’s javelin final at the Asian Athletics Championship in Gumi, South Korea.</p>
<p>A day before an April 22 terrorist attack in occupied Kashmir, Chopra had announced that the world’s top throwers, including Nadeem, had been invited to the first Neeraj Chopra Classic. However, the attack in Kashmir prompted heavy criticism of Chopra’s decision to invite Nadeem.</p>
<p>Nadeem ultimately did not attend the event.</p></p>
