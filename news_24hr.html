            <p><p>A session of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has convened to discuss the prevailing tensions in South Asia amid a standoff between Pakistan and India in the wake of a militant attack in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack%20were%20brought%20out">cross-border linkages</a>” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">firmly</a> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315/pahalgam-attack-fm-dar-throws-down-gauntlet-to-india-asks-for-evidence-of-allegations-against-pakistan">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> as it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an incursion and India’s premier granting “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war">military</a> warning of a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907785/any-military-misadventure-by-india-will-be-met-with-swift-resolute-notch-up-response-coas">swift</a>” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907930/us-hopes-that-indias-response-to-pahalgam-attack-doesnt-lead-to-broader-regional-conflict-vance">diplomatic channels</a> have remained engaged to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>Acting on a global level, Islamabad had decided to seek the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908460">immediate session</a> of the UNSC to apprise world powers about the recent tensions with India.</p>
<p>The session was scheduled for 3pm at the UN headquarters in New York. State-run broadcaster <em>Radio Pakistan</em> said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/RadioPakistan/status/1919469953792815426" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X that the session was under way.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Earlier today, the Foreign Office (FO) said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had instructed Pakistan’s permanent representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar, to take immediate steps for the UNSC session.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>“Pakistan will particularly brief the UNSC on how India’s aggressive actions, repeated provocations and inflammatory rhetoric pose a serious threat to regional and global peace and stability,” an FO <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/pakistan-decides-to-formally-apprise-the-unsc-of-the-latest-developments-in-south-asia" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> issued today said.</p>
<p>It said that Pakistan would call upon the UNSC to “exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security by taking appropriate measures to address these concerning developments”.</p>
<p>“It will also highlight India’s unlawful and unilateral attempt to put the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance — a clear violation of its international obligations,” the FO said.</p>
<p>The instructions came two days after Ambassador Iftikhar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908062">said</a> Pakistan was closely following the situation stemming from India’s aggressive moves in the wake of the Pahalgam attack and would seek a UNSC meeting at an appropriate time.</p>
<p>Earlier, before the session, UN chief Antonio Guterres <a class="link--external" href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/press-encounter/2025-05-05/secretary-generals-press-encounter-india-and-pakistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urged</a> that Pakistan and India must exert “maximum restraint” and step back from the brink of war.</p>
<p>Relations have reached “a boiling point”, Guterres told reporters in New York, adding that they were at their “highest in years”.</p>
<p>He again condemned the April 22 attack in Pahalgam, calling for those responsible to be brought to justice through “credible and lawful means”.</p>
<p>“It is also essential — especially at this critical hour — to avoid a military confrontation that could easily spin out of control,” the secretary-general warned.</p>

<p>“Now is the time for maximum restraint and stepping back from the brink.”</p>
<p>The UN chief also called Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to discuss the prevailing security situation in South Asia, according to a press release from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).</p>
<p>It added that this was the second telephone conversation between the two leaders within a week.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz appreciated the UN chief’s continued engagement and outreach efforts and welcomed his call for de-escalation as well as the need to avoid any confrontation.</p>
<p>“While reiterating his offer of an independent, transparent, neutral and credible investigation, the prime minister expressed his concern that India was yet to provide any evidence, nevertheless, it continued to resort to provocative rhetoric and warmongering,” the statement said.</p>
<p>The premier reiterated Pakistan’s determination to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also expressed his serious concern at Indian attempts to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907975">politicise</a> international financial institutions in an attempt to harm Pakistan’s economic interests.</p>
<p>The UN chief briefed the prime minister on his outreach efforts for peace and stability in the region, and expressed his commitment to remain engaged with all interlocutors on the issue.</p>
<p>Pakistan and India have fought multiple wars and remain bitter foes.</p>
<p>International pressure has been piled on both New Delhi and Islamabad to de-escalate.</p>
<p>No group has claimed responsibility for the attack in Kashmir.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given his military “full operational freedom” to respond, and Islamabad has warned it will hit back against any aggression.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the National Assembly (NA) unanimously passed a resolution condemning India’s unlawful and unilateral declaration to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance in blatant violation of the treaty.</p>
<p>Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry presented the resolution.</p>
<p>The resolution said that the killing of innocent civilians was contrary to the values upheld by Pakistan, and the NA rejected all “frivolous and baseless attempts” to link Pakistan with the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>The lawmakers condemned the “orchestrated and mala fide campaign” by the Indian government to malign Pakistan, which “follows a familiar pattern of exploiting the issue of terrorism for a narrow political goal”.</p>
<p>The resolution warned that Pakistan remained fully capable and prepared to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity against any aggression, including water terrorism or military provocation and any misadventure by India would be met with a firm, swift and decisive response.</p>
<p>The lawmakers emphasised that the people of Pakistan remained committed to peace but would never allow anyone to transgress the country’s sovereignty, security, and interests.</p>
<p>The resolution demanded that India should be held accountable for its involvement in different acts of terrorism and targeted assassinations on the soil of other countries, including Pakistan, and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering moral, political and diplomatic support for and commitment to the Kashmiri people’s just struggle for the realisation of their inalienable right to self-determination.</p>

<p>FM Dar said that the attack was an attempt to “divert attention” from India’s internal challenges and its cross-border terrorism.</p>
<p>Addressing the Regional Dialogue 2025 in Islamabad today, organised by the Institute of Regional Studies, Dar said Pakistan believed the Pahalgam attack was part of an effort to “divert attention” from India’s internal challenges, adding that it could be “self-choreographed”.</p>
<p>“We believe that what has happened is to divert attention — I am talking of Pahalgam — from India’s internal challenges, state-sponsored terrorism, the ongoing human rights violations in the Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir, and to gain narrow domestic political objectives,” Dar said.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget that there are some by-elections coming in the next few months in India,” he added, referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907658">upcoming polls in Bihar</a> in October.</p>
<p>“This brinkmanship carries consequences that extend far beyond India’s borders,” the deputy PM warned, calling India’s actions “unilateral, politically-motivated and highly provocative”.</p>
<p>He noted: “There appears to be a calculated and premeditated attempt to escalate regional tensions, following a familiar pattern — level allegations against Pakistan without evidence, use inflammatory rhetoric, incite war hysteria and use this as a pretext for aggression and unilateral actions.”</p>
<p>In a reference to the Indian government, Dar stressed that regional and international peace and security could not be “sacrificed at the altar of narrow electoral gains”.</p>
<p>“This is a dangerous political game and gamble, putting at stake the lives of millions in the region,” the foreign minister highlighted. However, he also reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace: “We will support all efforts towards de-escalation.”</p>
<p>“Analysts say this could be another ploy. It might have been self-choreographed,” echoing Pakistani leaders’ previous statements of the Pahalgam attack being a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906207">false flag operation</a>”.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>“How can an FIR (first information report) be registered in 10 minutes at a police station where you need at least 45 minutes to reach? […] Come on. Nobody’s a fool,” Dar quipped.</p>
<p>“International dignitaries are talking [to] both sides. Few of them — great friends — suggested to me, ‘Can you try and help the perpetrators be caught?’ I said ‘come on, do you know the distance where it happened and where’s the Line of Control? 230 kilometres.”</p>
<p>The deputy PM asserted: “Pakistan has exposed India’s mala fide and they are now on the backfoot. But it takes two to tango. I am telling all these dignitaries that we will show patience and will not be the first ones to attack.</p>
<p>“But if anybody makes any mistake and ventures into adventurism, then God knows what situation that will lead to. I hope sense prevails and they should [reflect].”</p>
<p>He detailed that he has directed Pakistan’s permanent representative to the United Nations to request a meeting of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>“Let’s share with them the facts and figures and the details and the evidence we showed the other day,” said Dar, referring to his press briefing with the military’s spokesperson, where they <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">accused India</a> of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan.</p>
<p>“I cannot find the word abeyance in any international treaties’ dictionary. The word suspension is there,” Dar said, referring to India’s unilateral <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">suspension</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>.</p>

<p>Separately, UK High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriott assured PM Shehbaz today that her country would “work closely with Pakistan and India for maintaining regional peace and security”, the PMO said.</p>
<p>In his meeting with Marriott in Islamabad, PM Shehbaz urged her country to play its part in de-escalating the ongoing tensions with India.</p>

<p>The premier shared Pakistan’s perspective on the prevailing situation in South Asia in the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident and rejected India’s attempts to link Pakistan to the incident without providing any evidence.</p>
<p>He also reiterated his offer for a transparent, credible and neutral international investigation into the incident and invited the UK to join it, the PMO statement added.</p>
<p>Noting that the UK enjoyed “good relations” with both India and Pakistan, PM Shehbaz assured Marriott that Islamabad “would never take any action that could imperil regional peace and security”.</p>
<p>The prime minister stressed that with the support of friendly countries, including the UK, his government’s “foremost priority remained advancing economic growth and development of the country”.</p>

<p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also met PM Shehbaz and Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir today, state broadcaster <em>PTV News</em> said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1919347210086387893" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a>.</p>
<p>FM Araghchi, who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907094/china-urges-india-pakistan-to-exercise-restraint-after-pahalgam-attack">arrived in Islamabad</a> late last night, also met with Deputy PM Dar.</p>

<p>“Key discussions held with PM Shehbaz Sharif, FM Ishaq Dar and Army Chief Gen Asim Munir,” <em>PTV News</em> stated, highlighting that the visit came amid “rising India-Pakistan tensions after the Pahalgam attack”.</p>
<p>In his meeting with the Iranian FM, PM Shehbaz stressed that India’s weaponisation of the Indus Waters Treaty was unacceptable and a red-line for Pakistan.</p>
<p>According to the PMO, the premier shared serious concerns over the prevailing tensions in South Asia as a result of India’s provocative behaviour sincethe  Pahalgam incident.</p>
<p>He categorically rejected any attempts to link Pakistan to the incident, without sharing any evidence and said Pakistan had offered that an international, transparent, neutral and credible investigation be conducted to ascertain the facts behind the Pahalgam incident.</p>
<p>While stating that Pakistan had acted with maturity and responsibility, the prime minister said, “India had, on the other hand, created a media frenzy to divert the world’s attention away from Jammu and Kashmir dispute, which remained the root cause of instability in South Asia.”</p>
<p>Iran’s FM Araghchi conveyed warm greetings from the Iranian leadership to the prime minister and reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to strengthening its relations with Pakistan and also playing its part in bringing peace and stability in South Asia.</p>
<p>The meeting between the army chief and the Iranian FM at General Headquarters (GHQ) today featured constructive discussions on the geo-strategic environment, with particular focus on challenges confronted by both countries in the domain of security, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release.</p>
<p>Both sides agreed to stay engaged for enhanced bilateral cooperation while jointly working to assist in bringing positive developments in issues concerning the region, ISPR said.</p>
<p>The Iranian FM acknowledged and appreciated Pakistan’s efforts for peace and stability in the region, it added.</p>
<p>In their meeting, Dar and Araghchi exchanged views on the evolving situation in South Asia and the US-Iran nuclear talks, the <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1919346265885921696" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Foreign Office said</a>.</p>
<p>Both leaders also agreed that complex issues could be “resolved through diplomacy and negotiations”.</p>
<p>“They appreciated each other’s constructive diplomatic efforts, which demonstrate their shared commitment to peace and stability in the region,” the FO said. As Pak-India tensions persist, FM Araghchi is also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908387/info-minister-dg-ispr-to-brief-all-political-parties-on-pakistan-india-situation-state-media#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20arrives%20in%20Pakistan%2C%20will%20visit%20India%20next%20week">expected to visit India</a> later in the week.</p>

<p>During today’s <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MediaCellPPP/status/1919273163143455229" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">meeting</a> at Aiwan-i-Sadr, Zardari expressed concern over the recent “irresponsible and aggressive rhetoric by the Indian government”, saying that such actions threaten regional peace and stability.</p>
<p>The two discussed matters of bilateral importance, with a particular focus on the ongoing situation between Pakistan and India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>The Chinese ambassador reaffirmed the “enduring and time-tested friendship between China and Pakistan”, describing the relationship as one of “ironclad brothers” who have always supported each other in challenging times.</p>
<p>He thanked Zardari for sharing Pakistan’s perspective, and emphasised that China would always support its ally to achieve the common desire of both countries to secure peace and stability in South Asia.</p>

<p>Zardari conveyed his deep appreciation and gratitude to the Chinese government for its “consistent support, always standing by Pakistan in difficult times”.</p>
<p>On Thursday, PM <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907760">thanked China’s envoy</a> for endorsing his offer to conduct a neutral probe into the Pahalgam attack. Last week, China had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907094/china-urges-india-pakistan-to-exercise-restraint-after-pahalgam-attack">urged</a> both India and Pakistan to “exercise restraint” as the two countries reportedly exchanged fire at the Line of Control (LoC).</p>
<p>As Pakistan continues diplomatic engagement with various countries to brief them on the ongoing situation, PM Shehbaz yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908460#:~:text=Prime%20Minister%20Shehbaz%20Sharif%20talked%20to%20his%20Malaysian%20counterpart%2C%20while%20Foreign%20Minister%20Ishaq%20Dar%20spoke%20to%20the%20Malaysian%20as%20well%20as%20Russian%20foreign%20ministers">spoke</a> to his Malaysian counterpart, while Dar spoke to the foreign ministers of Malaysia and Russia.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, appearing on <em>Samaa TV</em> programme ‘Nadeem Malik Live’, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif reiterated that any Indian attack would be met with a “befitting response”, adding that it would be “a level above what they do”.</p>
<p>“If they attack, which I can’t define right now, our response will be a step up and will not come down,” he said.</p>
<p>When asked about the possibility of an Indian attack on the LoC, Asif responded that there was anticipation that any Indian attack would be contained to the LoC or Sialkot sector.</p>
<p>“Once war starts, you cannot calibrate or control it,” he said. “Starting a war itself is something which is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>“Modi is fighting a war for his own gains and for votes,” Asif added. “Political compulsions dictate their strategic policy, which is very unfortunate. Votes are more valuable than human lives or international peace.”</p>

<p>Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar visited the LoC in Azad Jammu and Kashmir with local and foreign media and dismissed India’s allegations of “terrorist hideouts” there, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/05-05-2025/info-minister-visits-loc-along-with-local-foreign-media" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The visit facilitated by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting was aimed at exposing the “false and baseless Indian propaganda”, the report said, pointing out that media representatives were taken to specific locations that India had allegedly “labelled as terrorist hideouts”.</p>
<p>“By witnessing the ground situation, hearing from the local population, and observing the environment firsthand, the media got the opportunity to assess the truth behind India’s claims,” <em>Radio Pakistan</em> noted.</p>
<p>Among the group of international journalists was <em>CNN</em>’s International Diplomatic Editor <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/NicRobertsonCNN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nic Robertson</a>.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>According to <em>Radio Pakistan</em>, Robertson visited a village where Muhammad Farooq and Muhammad Deen were killed in a “fake encounter by the Indian army”.</p>
<p>The <em>CNN</em> editor interviewed both men’s bereaved families, who appealed for justice through international media, the report said. No statement by Robertson was found on his social media accounts immediately after the visit.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Tarar said: “India is now claiming the presence of training camps in Bela Noor Shah, which is near Pir Chinasi, and that they were used in the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>“This area is 26 kilometres away from the LoC and the purpose of coming here is to show that Indian propaganda is false, fake, and concocted,” he added.</p>

<p>“India’s narrative has failed miserably, and the international media has not picked it up. There are contradictions in India’s response and they are not able to provide evidence,” the minister said.</p>
<p>He asserted: “There are no terrorist camps here. There are beautiful mountains and people [only].”</p>
<p>“Don’t resort to any misadventure,” Tarar warned, adding that Pakistan would give a befitting response to any Indian aggression and would go to any extent to defend its sovereignty.</p>
<p>Echoing Deputy PM Dar’s statements, Tarar said India uses propaganda to “hide its internal failures”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Pakistan Army again responded to unprovoked firing by the Indian army along the LoC overnight, state broadcaster <em><a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvworld/newsdetail/5439" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PTV News</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>According to security sources, Indian troops resorted to unprovoked firing on multiple Pakistani military posts in Nakyal, Khuiratta, Sharda, Kel, Neelum and Haji Pir sectors along the LoC.</p>
<p>The action was responded to in a befitting manner by the Pakistan Army, <em>PTV News</em> added. It quoted security sources as saying that the armed forces were “fully alert”.</p>
<p>Pakistani troops had previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension#:~:text=Pakistan%20responds%20to%20unprovoked%20Indian%20firing%20on%20LoC">responded</a> to “unprovoked” Indian firing on April 30.

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908633/asean-takes-unified-stance-against-sweeping-trump-tarrifs' target='_blank'><strong>Asean takes unified stance against sweeping Trump tarrifs</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) has presented a unified stance against “escalating trade protectionism” and an uncertain economic landscape amid global economic upheaval caused by sweeping tariffs of the new Trump administration.</p>
<p>The United States at the start of April <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810">imposed</a> sweeping tariffs on most goods imported to the US, as well as much higher levies on dozens of rivals and allies alike. A week later, US President Donald Trump announced that he would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903146">pause</a> many of his new tariffs for 90 days, even as he raised them further on imports from China.</p>
<p>By mid-April, the White House announced that China faced tariffs of up to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904617">245 per cent</a> due to its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903545">retaliatory tariffs</a> on American goods. Asean had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903538/asean-opts-for-constructive-engagement-over-us-tariffs">decided not to retaliate</a> against the announcement of reciprocal tariffs, choosing instead to engage in constructive and forward-looking discussions to tackle emerging challenges.</p>
<p>Asean issued a <a class="link--external" href="https://asean.org/joint-statement-of-the-28th-asean3-finance-ministers-and-central-bank-governors-meeting/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joint statement</a> on Sunday statement following the 28th ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers’ and Central Bank Governors’ Meeting in Milan where it warned that tariffs would have a major impact on trade and economic stability in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>“Escalating trade protectionism weighs on global trade, leading to economic fragmentation, affecting trade, investment and capital flows across the region,” Asean said.</p>
<p>“Near-term prospects may also be affected by other external risks, including tighter global financial conditions, growth slowdown in major trading partners, and reduced investment flows,” it added.</p>
<p>The bloc called for “enhanced regional unity and cooperation” amid growing economic uncertainty and said it would prioritise maintaining resilience while remaining flexible enough to respond to near-term challenges.</p>
<p>“On the fiscal front, this means rebuilding policy buffers while continuing to provide well-targeted support to sustain growth while implementing structural reforms,” the statement read. “We will also carefully recalibrate monetary policy based on domestic conditions.”</p>
<p>The bloc reaffirmed its commitment to multilateralism and a “rules-based, non-discriminatory, free, fair, open, inclusive, equitable, and transparent multilateral trading system”.</p>
<p>“We urge international organisations to uphold multilateralism and promote free trade, analyse and monitor the potential impact of trade tensions on the global economy, and support their members in providing policy advice to manage the negative shocks that may arise.”</p>
<p>Trump’s tariffs are increasingly clogging up the wheels of a world economy which for decades was greased by predictable and relatively free trade.</p>
<p>Big-name multinationals, right down to niche e-commerce players, last week cut sales targets, warned of job cuts and reviewed their business plans, while major economies revised down growth prospects amid bleak data read-outs.</p>
<p>“US tariff policy is a serious negative shock for the world in the near term,” said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, group chief economist at French bank BNP Paribas.</p>
<p>“The US tariffs end-game may be further away and at a higher level than previously thought,” she said of blanket US tariffs, currently set at a baseline of 10pc.</p></p>

            <p><p>A soldier was martyred while eight terrorists were killed in multiple engagements across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Monday.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ceasefire</a> with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted by the forces in general area of Mir Ali in North Waziristan District.</p>
<p>“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the <em>khwarij</em> location, and resultantly, three <em>khwarij</em> were sent to hell,” it said, referring to the term the state uses for terrorists.</p>
<p>“In another IBO, conducted in South Waziristan District, two <em>khwarij</em> were successfully neutralized by the security forces. However, during an intense fire exchange, one brave son of the soil, Naik Mujahid Khan (age: 40 years, resident of District Kohat) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced shahadat,” the statement said.</p>
<p>It added that two more engagements took place between the troops and the terrorists in the Khyber and Bannu districts, resulting in the killing of three terrorists.</p>
<p>Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area against the security forces as well as target killing of innocent civilians, the ISPR said.</p>
<p>Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area, ISPR said.</p>
<p>The press release added that the security forces of Pakistan were determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthened our resolve.</p>
<p>Late last month, security forces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906939/54-terrorists-killed-as-infiltration-attempt-thwarted-in-kp-ispr">killed</a> 54 terrorists attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district, the military’s media wing said.</p>
<p>Militant violence and security operations intensified in the country in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901722/militant-attacks-in-march-surged-to-highest-level-since-2014">report</a> by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">ranked</a> second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p></p>
