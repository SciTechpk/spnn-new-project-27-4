                <h2>PM Shehbaz lauds World Bank support for Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äòlegitimate position‚Äô on Indus Waters Treaty</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday appreciated the World Bank‚Äôs (WB) support for Pakistan‚Äôs position in light of India‚Äôs suspension of the <a class="link--external" href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTs/Volume%20419/volume-419-I-6032-English.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Indus Waters Treaty</a> (IWT).</p>
<p>In April, India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">held</a> the IWT in abeyance following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam that killed 26 ‚Äî an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">‚Äúact of war‚Äù</a>, noting that the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension.</p>
<p>In a meeting with the WB‚Äôs regional vice president for the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan (MENAAP), Ousmane Dione, in Islamabad, the premier acknowledged the institution‚Äôs principled support for Pakistan‚Äôs legitimate position on India‚Äôs ‚Äúunilateral and unlawful actions‚Äù, which undermined ‚Äúimportant international agreements‚Äù such as the IWT.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to upholding international law, achieving prosperity, maintaining regional peace and reiterated the country‚Äôs resolve to resolve all issues through dialogue.</p>

<p>The prime minister further thanked the WB for its timely and generous assistance during the devastating floods of 2022, which helped Pakistan initiate immediate relief efforts and begin reconstruction and rehabilitation activities.</p>
<p>He especially thanked World Bank President Ajay Banga and former country director for Pakistan Najy Benhassine for their pivotal role in advancing the new country partnership framework (CPF) for Pakistan.</p>
<p>In January, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885518">became</a> the first country to launch a longer-term CPF with the WB, after the bank‚Äôs board of directors approved the 10-year programme and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885337">pledged</a> to provide $20 billion to Pakistan.</p>

<p>According to a World Bank <a class="link--external" href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2025/01/14/world-bank-group-announces-new-10-year-country-partnership-framework-for-pakistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, the new framework for the country aimed to ‚Äúsupport inclusive and sustainable development through a strong focus on building human capital‚Äù, in addition to fostering durable private sector growth.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz appreciated the strategic role of the CPF in supporting Pakistan‚Äôs development priorities, particularly in the areas of energy, human capital, climate change, and governance reforms.</p>
<p>Dione expressed gratitude to the premier for the warm hospitality extended during his visit to Pakistan.</p>

<p>He reaffirmed the WB‚Äôs commitment to deepening and expanding its longstanding partnership with Pakistan and enhancing collaboration in key sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>Dione appreciated Pakistan‚Äôs ongoing macroeconomic recovery and praised the prime minister‚Äôs government for steering the country toward financial stability and sustainable growth.</p>
<p>He particularly commended the current administration‚Äôs reform agenda, noting the premier‚Äôs strong leadership in advancing institutional reforms, restoring investor confidence, and promoting inclusive economic development.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz and Dione expressed a shared commitment to further strengthening cooperation in the coming years, to achieve long-term development goals and build a prosperous future for the people of Pakistan.</p></p>

                <h2>S&P Global lifts Pakistan‚Äôs credit rating ‚ÄòB-‚Äô from ‚ÄòCCC+‚Äô, outlook stable</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Ratings agency S&amp;P Global raised Pakistan‚Äôs sovereign credit rating to ‚ÄòB-‚Äô from ‚ÄòCCC+‚Äô and placed it on a ‚Äòstable‚Äô outlook on Thursday, saying the country‚Äôs finances and reserves had been stabilised by International Monetary Fund (IMF) support.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe stable outlook reflects our expectations that continued economic recovery and government efforts to enhance revenue will stabilise fiscal and debt metrics,‚Äù S&amp;P said in a statement on the move.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe also expect that sustained official financing will support Pakistan in meeting its external obligations, and that the country will continue to roll over its commercial credit lines over the next 12 months.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pakistan‚Äôs longer-dated international bonds rallied after the upgrade, with the 2051 maturity gaining 1.6 cents to be bid at 84.85 cents on the dollar, according to Tradeweb data.</p>
<p>The 2031 and 2036 maturities also gained around 1 cent, while shorter-dated maturities posted smaller gains.</p>
<p>Last week, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924444">urged</a> the leading US rating agency ‚Äî Moody‚Äôs ‚Äî to improve Pakistan‚Äôs credit rating and help its return to international capital markets at favourable conditions.</p>
<p>Moody‚Äôs had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855270">upgraded</a> Paki¬≠stan‚Äôs credit rating by one notch in August 2024 to Caa2 from Caa3 (<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1739609">downgraded</a> in February 2023 due to suspension of the IMF programme) and changed its outlook to positive from stable for improving macroeconomic conditions, including liquidity and external position from very weak levels.</p>
<p>Global ratings agency Fitch had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904417">upgraded</a> Pakistan‚Äôs foreign currency credit rating to ‚ÄòB-‚Äô from ‚ÄòCCC+‚Äô in April, citing increased confidence in the country‚Äôs progress on narrowing its budget deficits.</p></p>
