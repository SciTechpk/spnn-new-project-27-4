<p>13 people have died in Lahore, eight in Faisalabad, four in Pakpattan, three in Sheikhupura and Okara and one person each in Nankana Sahib and Sahiwal,‚Äú said the Rescue Punjab spokesperson.</p>

<p>PDMA Spokesperson Irfan Ali Kathia district said, ‚ÄúChawkwal recorded 400mm of rain in 10 hours, which left many areas flooded.‚Äù</p>

<p>The district administration has been alerted, while the relevant rescue departments, including Water and Sanitation Agencies (WASA), Rescue 1122, and other civil personnel, have been summoned to the field to oversee rescue efforts, according to District Commissioner Chakwal, Quratul Ain Malik.</p>
<p>In light of the situation, relief arrangements have been made in hospitals and public buildings, Malik said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the PDMA spokesperson Kathia added that the district administration was in contact with the military as well in case of additional support.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe PDMA assured the district administration of support in rescue and relief efforts and is personally overseeing the rescue operation until all citizens are safely evacuated,‚Äù Kathia said. ‚ÄúThe district administration is continuing to monitor the situation, particularly in low-lying areas.‚Äù</p>
<p>District Emergency Operation Centre, including the PDMA Control Room, are on high alert, he said, adding that ‚Äúhelicopters and other rescue resources are also on standby.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúPAF‚Äôs participation in RIAT, one of the world‚Äôs largest military airshows, underscores Pakistan Air Force‚Äôs commitment to showcasing its professional excellence, operational capability and the indigenous strength of its aviation industry,‚Äù the ISPR highlighted.</p>
<p>Adding to the operational significance of this international deployment, Pakistan Air Force‚Äôs JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighters executed successful Air-to-Air Refuelling operations en route to the UK with the support of a PAF IL-78 aerial refuelling tanker.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe intricate refuelling operation demonstrated PAF‚Äôs long-range operational capabilities and the proficiency of its air and ground crew in conducting extended operations beyond national borders.</p>
<p>‚ÄúJF-17 Block-III is an EASA Radar and Long Range BVR equipped 4.5 generation multi-role fighter aircraft which is capable of undertaking a wide variety of combat missions, bolstering airpower application in the face of contemporary challenges, thereby strengthening national security,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>In May, when Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">downed</a> 5 Indian jets as retaliation for late-night strikes during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/pakistan-india-tensions">Pakistan-India conflict</a>, the PAF formally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">acknowledged</a> a month later that it was the Kamra-based 15 Squadron that led the charge in shooting down the jets.</p>
<p>The event is now considered one of the largest air-to-air engagements in South Asia in more than half a century.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is a palpable sense of enthusiasm across the United Kingdom following the recent Pakistan-India conflict, as aviation enthusiasts and defence observers were eagerly looking forward to the arrival of the Pakistan Air Force‚Äôs JF-17 Thunder Block-III,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe aircraft‚Äôs combat-proven capabilities and operational excellence have garnered significant global attention, making its appearance at RIAT a highly anticipated highlight in the aerospace and defence community.‚Äù</p></p>
