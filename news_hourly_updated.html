                <h2>PSX crosses 128,000 barrier on first day of FY26</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Bullish momentum continued at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday as the market crossed the 128,000 barrier on the first day of the new fiscal year 2025-26.</p>
<p>The KSE-100 index rose by 2404.51 points, or 1.9 per cent, to stand at 128,031.82 points at 12:15pm, from the last close of 125,627.31 points.</p>
<p>Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, attributed the rise to easing geopolitical tensions and the market ‚Äúpricing in a gradual decline in interest rates alongside improving economic stability‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInvestors are also anticipating a strong corporate results season and are rerating the market‚Äôs price-to-earnings ratio toward more normalised levels, the analyst said.</p>
<p>He added that in his opinion, the market had entered phase two of the bull run ‚Äî characterised by increasing public participation and a broad-based rally across a wide range of stocks.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said investors are increasing exposure in equities from fixed income due to the higher taxation rate imposed on fixed income in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920303">recent budget</a>, choosing high-dividend-yield stocks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúContinuation of monetary easing due to falling inflation driven by fiscal discipline, strong external account and focus on structural reforms would keep equities in limelight,‚Äù Ashraf said.</p>
<p>He anticipated that sectors benefiting from monetary easing and structural reforms, particularly related to the energy chain, would remain prominent.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the PSX <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921314/psx-ends-fy25-at-record-high-on-china-loan-boost">ended</a> the final session of the outgoing fiscal year on a bullish note, with the benchmark KSE-100 index soaring to a record high above 125,000. The rally was driven by aggressive buying at attractive valuations and strong year-end fund flows.</p>
<p>Also on Monday, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921312/government-sees-exports-rising-inflation-at-5-7pc-in-fy26">projected</a> a positive export outlook and a moderate rise in inflation to a range of 5-7 per cent for 2025-26, citing improved global economic conditions and domestic recovery trends.</p>
<p>In its Monthly Economic Update and Outlook for June, the Ministry of Finance said Composite Leading Indicators (CLIs) of Pakistan‚Äôs major trading partners ‚Äî including the UK, US, Eurozone and China ‚Äî were all operating above their long-term average of 100, suggesting a likely increase in demand for Pakistani exports.</p>
<p>For June, inflation is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921197/countrys-june-inflation-likely-to-remain-between-3-4pc-finance-ministry">expected</a> to remain between 3‚Äì4pc. The ministry also forecast a positive outlook for Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) in the coming months, driven by robust trends in cement despatches and automobile sales. ‚ÄúThe uptick in private sector credit reflects growing production activity and improved investor confidence,‚Äù the report said.</p></p>

                <h2>Two traffic policemen gunned down in Lakki Marwat</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Two traffic policemen were martyred as unidentified gunmen opened fire on them in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Lakki Marwat district on Tuesday, according to police.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe traffic cops were on their way to Tajazai Adda for duty on motorcycles when they were fired at on Longkhel Road near Gulbaz Dehqan village,‚Äù read a statement by Lakki Marwat police spokesperson Shahid Hameed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe martyrs include Israel and Sanaullah, both of whom hailed from the Longkhel [area],‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The police cordoned off the area and initiated an investigation.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Lakki Marwat District Police Officer (DPO) Mohammad Jawad Ishaq specified that the four attackers were riding on two motorcycles and stole the policemen‚Äôs submachine guns.</p>
<p>DPO Ishaq further said, ‚ÄúThe traffic personnel were dressed in civilian clothes when they were targeted.‚Äù</p>
<p>Lakki Marwat has seen a rise in attacks in recent months that reflect an increasing militant presence in the area, although unrest dates back to the early 2000s. Militant activity has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914847">resurged</a> in recent years, straining local peace efforts and heightening fears of renewed instability.</p>
<p>Last week, the leader of the Shahab Khel peace committee and two of his companions were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921018">shot dead</a> by terrorists in Lakki Marwat.</p>
<p>In June, police said they <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918265">destroyed several hideouts</a> of terrorists in the forest located along the Kurram and Gambila Rivers in the district during a search and strike operation.</p>
<p>Earlier that month, three terrorists were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916076/3-terrorists-killed-one-cop-martyred-in-gun-battle-with-lakki-marwat-police-local-peace-committee">killed</a> while a cop was martyred in the district‚Äôs Kot Kashmir area during a gun battle with the police and local peace committee.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, two suspected terrorists were shot dead after an exchange of fire with police and Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) personnel in KP‚Äôs Bannu district, a police officer said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Police and CTD conducted a joint operation against the criminals in Bannu‚Äôs Domel tehsil, leading to an exchange of fire from both sides for over 20 minutes, a statement by Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúResultantly, two terrorists were shot dead, while their accomplices managed to escape after taking advantage of darkness and nearby bushes,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>The suspects were identified as Hussain Ahmed and Inaam alias Tooru, a resident of North Waziristan‚Äôs Haider Khel village.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe slain terrorists were involved in several major attacks and IED (improvised explosive device) blasts,‚Äù RPO Sajjad added.</p>
<p>The police recovered two AK-47 rifles, four hand grenades, six magazines, 150 bullets, and two mobile phones from the suspected terrorists.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The alleged terrorist Inaam was wanted by the police and CTD in five different cases for attacking and killing police officers, while Ahmed was wanted in three different terrorist incidents.</p>
<p>RPO Sajjad noted that the Bannu police and the CTD had averted a possible major terrorist attack due to timely action. He said an operation to arrest the escaped suspects has been intensified.</p>
<p>He asserted that the CTD and police were determined to establish law and order in the area and completely eradicate terrorism.</p>
<p>Last month, several suspects were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917310">arrested</a> and a cache of heavy weapons was seized during a joint operation carried out by the police, CTD, and the army in Bannu.</p></p>
