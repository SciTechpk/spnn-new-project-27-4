                <h2>SC‚Äôs Justice Salahuddin Panhwar comes down hard on ‚Äòdishonest judges‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>UMERKOT: <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891816/in-a-first-new-sc-judges-to-take-oath-outdoors">Justice Salahuddin Panhwar</a> of Supreme Court has expressed his deep regrets over shortcomings of the country‚Äôs judicial system and institutions, and also criticised dishonest judges, lawyers and police officers responsible for the delay and denial of justice to the public.</p>
<p>He was speaking at the oath-taking ceremony of the Umerkot Bar Association here on Friday.</p>
<p>Describing the saying: ‚ÄúJustice delayed is justice denied‚Äù as absolutely correct, he declared that a court failing to deliver justice serves no purpose. Mentioning the cases where justice was delayed for decades, he gave a couple of examples: ‚ÄúOne woman waited for 71 years for a decision on her inheritance case and another person‚Äôs case relating to an accident was decided after 24 years‚Äù.</p>
<p>He condemned use of influence by feudals and bureaucrats and observed that some judges were compromising their integrity to appease the powerful.</p>
<p>Justice Panhwar said judges must act with courage, and not fear, and warned them that betraying the oath undermines public trust.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Says ‚Äòthey compromise their integrity to appease the powerful‚Äô; regrets how three bars, some judges and police backed accused in journalist Nasrullah Gadani‚Äôs murder case</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Highlighting systemic corruption, he referred to the case of journalist Nasrullah Gadani‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1842412/family-points-finger-at-ppp-mna-two-sons-in-journalist-nasrullah-gadanis-murder-in-ghotki">murder</a>, and noted that lawyers from three bars, police and even some judges defended the accused.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>He criticised misuse of the Dispossession Act, meant to protect the poor, and pointed out that it was now being used to harass them.</p>
<p>He also pointed to the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) where, he recalled, judicial decisions had led to loss of life. He wondered: ‚ÄúWhose judges we are ‚Ä¶ people‚Äôs or the elite‚Äôs?‚Äù</p>
<p>Justice Panhwar also lamented societal hypocrisy, observing that in Pakistan, people pretended to be virtuous while acting otherwise. He urged judges to engage with communities directly, saying: ‚ÄúWe must stop isolating ourselves and see how people live.‚Äù Sharing his feelings with the audience, he remarked: ‚ÄúSometimes I wonder whether we are judges or bandits‚Äù.</p>
<p>Touching upon social issues, he debunked claims of ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921711/probe-ordered-into-abduction-forced-conversion-of-hindu-girl-in-badin">forced conversions</a>‚Äù and pointed out that 90pc of girls running away from their homes happened to be from Muslim families, and not minorities. This, however, signals a broader societal failure to protect women, he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He also noted a lack of shelters for the girls and women vulnerable to injustice, and said this segment is denied education and inheritance rights, particularly in marginalised communities like the scheduled castes.</p>
<p>While criticising judicial system‚Äôs inefficiency, he cited the example of Mirpurkhas courts which ‚Äòdisposed of‚Äô 319 out of 320 cases within a week, and remarked that it was a ‚Äòformality‚Äô rather than ‚Äòjustice‚Äô. How could police deliver, he wondered.</p>
<p>Justice Panhwar expressed the view that upper Sindh‚Äôs ‚Äòdacoit culture‚Äô and lower Sindh‚Äôs ‚Äòdrug epidemic‚Äô, particularly in Umerkot district, had paralysed the system.</p>
<p>He revealed that one Sukkur SSP had admitted his helplessness in controlling crime, and said he responded [to his statement] by saying that ‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt act, we should resign and go home.‚Äù</p>
<p>Justice Panhwar accused the Umerkot police of focusing on extortion, instead of curbing crime. ‚ÄúCrime surged under a former sessions judge,‚Äù he deplored.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He said that the Cooperative Housing Society Act was meant for protecting rights of farmers and labourers, not for developing housing schemes. It was designed to empower the working class through loans and by encouraging collective forums, he added.</p>
<p>Justice Panhwar concluded with a warning: ‚ÄúOur rulers tell lies, our institutions tell lies, and people also have stopped speaking the truth. If we don‚Äôt change ourselves, then the system will collapse.‚Äù</p>
<p>Justice Jan Ali Junejo of Sindh High Court, Tharparkar Sessions Judge Abdul Waheed Sheikh, Umerkot Sessions Judge Abdul Qudoos  Memon, Advocate Yousif Laghari, Mir Pervez Talpur, President of the SHC Bar Association (Mirpurkhas) and Sindh Bar Council members Nand Kumar Goklani and Sher Mohammad  Wassan were among the prominent figures who attended the ceremony.</p>

                <h2>Talks between Bajaur Amn Jirga, TTP continue</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>BAJAUR: Amid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927600">talks</a> between the Bajaur Amn Jirga and terrorists for the latter‚Äôs peaceful return to Afghanistan, security officials have ruled out any compromise with anti-state elements here.</p>
<p>The seventh session of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928424">negotiation</a> between Jirga members and TTP leaders was held on Friday. Sources claimed that the terrorists, living among civilian population in Bajaur tribal district, were involved in sabotage and other crimes.</p>
<p>They said that the chief minister and security officials asked tribal elders to expel foreign terrorists, mostly Afghans, or vacate the area for one or two days for an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927454">operation</a> against terrorists.</p>
<p>While promising the continuation of operation against terrorists ‚Äúat all costs,‚Äù the chief minister and security officials called for efforts to minimise collateral damage.</p>
<p>Security sources said the government‚Äôs direct talks with terrorists or their facilitators was out of the question until the latter surrendered. They said the ongoing tribal jirga was a logical step to ensure the maximum public safety ahead of any action.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The sources, however, said both the state and residents were opposed to any compromise with terrorists. They said that the authority to conduct armed operations against terrorists rested with the state.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the seventh round of talks between Bajaur Amn Jirga members and terrorist leaders concluded in Lowi Mamund tehsil here on Friday evening.</p>
<p>Jirga head Sahibzada Haroon Rashid didn‚Äôt update the media about the outcome of the negotiations. However, there is a high likelihood of the Jirga sharing ‚Äúnew developments‚Äù with the media shortly.</p>
