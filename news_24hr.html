            <p><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Thursday rebutted rumours of President Asif Ali Zardari being asked to resign, terming it a “malicious campaign”.</p>
<p>“We are fully aware of who is behind the malicious campaign targeting President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and the chief of army staff,” Naqvi <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MohsinnaqviC42/status/1943211206371602592" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X.</p>
<p>“I have categorically stated that there has been no discussion, nor does any such idea exist about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency,” he asserted.</p>

<p>“The president of Pakistan enjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces,” the minister said.</p>
<p>He quoted President Zardari as having “clearly” stated: “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”</p>
<p>Naqvi stressed that the “sole focus” of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was Pakistan’s strength and stability, and “nothing else”.</p>
<p>“To those involved in this narrative, do whatever you wish in collaboration with hostile foreign agencies. As for us, we will do whatever is necessary to make Pakistan strong again, InshAllah,” Naqvi added.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, social media campaigns against the army have escalated, reflecting broader tensions within the country’s political and social fabric.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856908">government</a>, as well as the military, have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1876905">repeatedly</a> warned about “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=fake%20news%20and%20propaganda%20have%20become%20so%20common%20and%20there%20is%20no%20accountability%20for%20it.%E2%80%9D">fake news and propaganda</a>” proliferating on social media, with military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=theories%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20added.-,%E2%80%98Digital%20terrorism%E2%80%99,-Questioned%20about%20criticism">digital terrorism</a>” under the laws.</p>
<p>In May, President Zardari and PM Shehbaz formally decorated Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Syed Asim Munir with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912748/president-pm-decorate-coas-munir-with-rank-of-field-marshal">rank of field marshal</a> for his “sagacious leadership and exceptional strategy” during the recent conflict with India.</p>
<p>In a subsequent dinner hosted by the army chief, Field Marshal Munir lauded the political leadership for their “strategic foresight” during <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> against India.</p>

<p>The next month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who belongs to PM Shehbaz’s PML-N, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918558/whats-behind-khawaja-asifs-praise-for-hybrid-system">hailed</a> the “existing hybrid model of governance” in the country. In a separate interview, he also termed it as a “practical necessity” for Pakistan, saying the system was “doing wonders”.</p>
<p>In May 2024, the army chief and President Zardari had expressed their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1825461">concern</a> over “baseless and unsubstantiated allegations levelled by a specific political party and its few individuals” against the army for their political interests.</p></p>

            <p><p>Pakistan and China on Thursday agreed to further enhance ties and joint broadcasting projects between their state broadcasters to tackle fake news and disinformation, <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/10-07-2025/pakistan-china-agree-to-enhance-ties" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Radio Pakistan</em></a> reported.</p>
<p>Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation, and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors, including trade, energy, infrastructure, and media collaboration, with initiatives like the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879166">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)</a> symbolising a shared vision for development.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1831125">government</a>, as well as the military, have previously warned about “fake news and propaganda” proliferating on social media, with Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850240">saying</a> that not enough was being done against “digital terrorism” under the law.</p>
<p>The decision was made during a meeting in Beijing between Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar and Cao Shumin, Deputy Head of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Minister and Party Secretary of the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA).</p>

<p>“Both leaders also agreed on a joint narrative against fake news and emphasised technical training and institutional collaboration,” the report said. “They described the ongoing partnership in the media as a reflection of mutual trust and longstanding friendship.”</p>
<p>The report added that the two sides also held talks related to a proposed agreement between <em>China Central Television (CCTV)</em> and <em>PTV</em> to promote the exchange of information and cooperation.</p>
<p>Tarar said Pakistan was ready to translate bilateral media cooperation into practical steps and that state-run media entities — <em>PTV</em>, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> and <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> — were playing a crucial role in communicating stories of China’s development, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856317">Belt and Road Initiative</a>, CPEC, cultural ties, and bilateral cooperation to the people of both countries.</p>
<p>Per the report, Tarar said <em>PTV</em> was building intellectual and cultural bridges between the two nations by broadcasting Chinese programmes, documentaries and news reports in Urdu.</p>
<p>He said <em>APP’s</em> “China News Service” had crossed a significant milestone in effectively conveying Pakistan’s narrative to Chinese readers.</p>
<p>Referring to the recent Pakistan-India tensions, the information minister noted that the youth of China and Pakistan expressed strong solidarity with each other, which went viral on social media.</p>
<p>The meeting also discussed exchange visits of digital influencers from both Pakistan and China. Tarar said in the digital age, exchanges between influencers and social media representatives of both countries can inject new energy into bilateral relations.</p>
<p>Shumin said China considered Pakistan a trustworthy partner. “Media organisations of Pakistan and China can come closer through the exchange of experiences,” she was quoted as saying in the report.</p>
<p>Both sides agreed that media, culture, and people-to-people relations can introduce new dimensions to the Pakistan-China friendship, and these efforts will be further strengthened under a joint strategy.</p>
<p>In February, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan, Jiang Zaidong <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pak-china-cooperation-in-education-media-to-be-expanded-chinese-ambassador/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>: “We are ready to expand cooperation with Pakistan in education, media, think tanks, youth exchanges, and the film and television industries, to foster mutual learning between civilisations and strengthen cultural and people-to-people ties.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Four people from two different groups were killed while two others were injured in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mardan district over a personal dispute, police said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Mardan police spokesperson Muhammad Faheem Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “There was a clash between two groups over a personal dispute, resulting in the killing of four people — three from one group and one from the other group—while two people sustained injuries.”</p>
<p>“The motive behind the clash was a personal dispute between them,” he added.</p>
<p>One of the injured filed a first information report (FIR) at the Garhi Kapura police station on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>According to the FIR, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, the complainant said that the incident occurred around 10pm when he was returning home with his brothers and cousins, saying that they were attacked by armed assailants who were already present there.</p>
<p>The FIR was registered under Sections  148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 302 (intentional murder) and 324  (attempted mu­r­der) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).</p>
<p>“Five armed men opened fire on us, resulting in the instant death of three people, while my cousin and I got injured,” the complainant wrote in the FIR.</p>
<p>A relative of the deceased from the second group also filed a police case at the Garhi Kapura police station under Sections 302 (intentional murder), 324  (attempted mu­r­der) and 34 (common intention).</p>
<p>Police spokesperson Faheem added that the dead bodies and the injured were taken to the Bala Garhi Hospital for autopsy and medical assistance.
“An FIR had been lodged and raids are being conducted to arrest the suspects,” he added.</p>
<p>In May, six people, including three women, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912641">lost their lives</a> in an exchange of fire over a family feud in the Khatko Pul area of Peshawar.</p>
