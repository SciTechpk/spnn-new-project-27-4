                <h2>Pakistan rubbishes Indian PM Modi‚Äôs bid to link Islamabad with terrorism</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office on Friday categorically rejected the ‚Äúbaseless, provocative, and irresponsible allegations‚Äù made by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who in a heated speech accused Pakistan of carrying out terrorist attacks in his country.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between New Delhi and Islamabad came as tensions over last month‚Äôs Pahalgam attack continued to build up, as India ‚Äîwithout evidence ‚Äî blamed Pakistan for the attack. On the night of May 6-7, India launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting</a> drones sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat</a> strikes on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns and declare a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">ceasefire</a>. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">offered talks</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Indian premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912761/no-water-for-pakistan-from-indian-rivers-modi">said</a> that Pakistan would not get water from rivers over which India has rights.</p>
<p>According to a statement <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1925764355250950294/photo/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued</a> by the FO on X today, ‚ÄúPakistan categorically rejects the baseless, provocative, and irresponsible allegations made by the Indian prime minister during a recent public address in Rajasthan.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe remarks, replete with distortions, misrepresentations, and inflammatory rhetoric, are clearly aimed at stoking regional tensions for narrow political gains,‚Äù the FO said, adding that such statements not only reflect a deliberate attempt to mislead the public but also violate the norms responsible statecraft.</p>
<p>‚ÄúResorting to threats and boasting about military action against a sovereign nation is a grave breach of the United Nations Charter and established principles of international law,‚Äù the FO said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis dangerous approach undermines regional peace and stability,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The foreign ministry said that Pakistan remained a ‚Äúconsistent and proactive partner in the global fight against terrorism‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAny insinuation seeking to associate Pakistan with acts of terrorism is factually incorrect and patently misleading,‚Äù it continued.</p>
<p>It noted that the Indian premier‚Äôs tactic was ‚Äúoften employed to divert attention from India‚Äôs own internal challenges‚Äù, adding that the Indian attempts to mask its ‚Äúserious human rights violations‚Äù in occupied Kashmir by scapegoating Pakistan were well-documented and increasingly recognised by the international community.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe plight of the Kashmiri people and their just struggle for self-determination cannot be obscured by aggressive rhetoric and political deflection.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pakistan urged the Indian leadership to ‚Äúexercise responsibility and restraint‚Äù, the FO said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEscalatory statements and belligerent posturing serve no purpose other than exacerbating tensions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRather than resorting to fictitious narratives and warmongering for electoral mileage, India should demonstrate maturity by resolving outstanding disputes through peaceful dialogue and diplomacy,‚Äù the FO noted.</p>
<p>It added that Pakistan remained firmly committed to ‚Äúpeaceful coexistence, regional stability, and constructive engagement‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, our desire for peace should not be misconstrued as weakness,‚Äù it said, adding that the people and the armed forced were ‚Äúfully prepared and capable of defending the country‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAny misadventure or aggression will be met with a resolute and proportionate response,‚Äù the FO added.</p>
<p>It said that Pakistan has demonstrated its resolve in the past and will do so again, if required.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe international community must take serious note of India‚Äôs aggressive posture and hate-driven narratives that threaten regional peace,‚Äù it said, adding that it was ‚Äúimperative to discourage such rhetoric and actions to preserve stability in South Asia‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGlorification of conflict benefits no one, and the path to lasting peace lies in dialogue, mutual respect, and adherence to international law,‚Äù it concluded.</p></p>

                <h2>UNSC condemns ‚Äòheinous, cowardly‚Äô terrorist attack on school bus in Khuzdar</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The United Nations Security Council on Friday condemned ‚Äúin the strongest terms the heinous and cowardly‚Äù terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar earlier this week.</p>
<p>At least six people, including three students, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912542/pm-vows-strong-action-against-perpetrators-after-school-bus-blast-in-khuzdar">slain</a> while over 40 others ‚Äî mostly students ‚Äî sustained injuries after a bomb targeted the bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.</p>
<p>The condition of at least a dozen is said to be serious due to critical injuries, officials said, adding that at least 15 girl students were among the injured. Security forces vowed to ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357/4-students-killed-several-injured-as-school-bus-comes-under-attack-in-khuzdar-dc">relentlessly pursue</a>‚Äù the culprits of the attack as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir visited the injured in Quetta yesterday.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912572/bla-and-ttp-are-indian-proxies-govt-will-prove-indias-involvement-in-khuzdar-bus-attack-asif">said</a> that two major terrorist groups operating in Pakistan were ‚ÄúIndian proxies‚Äù, adding that Islamabad would present ‚Äúcomplete evidence‚Äù to prove New Delhi‚Äôs involvement in the attack on the school bus.</p>
<p>According to state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em>, the UNSC condemned the ‚Äúheinous and cowardly terrorist attack‚Äù on a school bus in Khuzdar in the strongest terms.</p>
<p>In a press release, the UNSC said that the ‚Äúreprehensible act of terrorism resulted in the grievous loss‚Äù, with its members expressing deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the government.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey [UNSC members] wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The council reaffirmed that ‚Äúterrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security‚Äù, underlining the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>It urged all states to cooperate actively with the government of Pakistan, reiterating that any acts of terrorism were criminal and unjustifiable.</p>
<p>The council reaffirmed the need for all states to combat by all means, according to the UN Charter and other international obligations.</p></p>
