            <p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he has nominated Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, presenting the US president with a letter he sent to the prize committee.</p>
<p>The move comes as Israel continues its onslaught on Gaza, which has so far killed 57,523 Palestinians. Last year, the UN-backed International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1874034">issued</a> arrest warrants for Netanyahu, citing allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court said he, along with ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, “intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival”, including food, water, medicine, fuel, and electricity.</p>
<p>“He’s forging peace as we speak, in one country, in one region after the other,” Netanyahu said at a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922520">dinner</a> with Trump at the White House.</p>

<p>Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514">nominations</a> from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years and has made no secret of his irritation at missing out on the prestigious award.</p>
<p>The Republican has complained that he had been overlooked by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">mediating role</a> in conflicts between India and Pakistan, as well as Serbia and Kosovo.</p>
<p>In 2024, he <a class="link--external" href="https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/trump-grumbles-about-obama-s-nobel-peace-prize-and-claims-he-deserved-it-more/ar-AA1sVZiM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">insisted</a> that he was more deserving of a Nobel than ex-president Barack Obama, and complained how it was unfair that “anybody else” but him would have been honoured with one.</p>
<p>In June, Pakistan had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514/govt-to-recommend-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize-for-decisive-diplomatic-intervention-in-india-pakistan-crisis">decided</a> to formally recommend Trump for the coveted prize, given his role in de-escalating the India-Pakistan conflict when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">US mediation</a>.</p>
<p>However, as the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">joined</a> Israel’s war with Iran and launched attacks on three Iranian nuclear facilities, Pakistani lawmakers, activists, authors and ex-diplomats criticised the move. A resolution was also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919467#:~:text=In%20the%20resolution,in%20the%20region.%E2%80%9D">submitted</a> in the Senate by the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl to rescind the decision but led to no tangible outcome as Pakistan had not officially submitted the nomination.</p>
<p>Trump has also demanded credit for “keeping peace” between Egypt and Ethiopia and brokering the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements aiming to normalise relations between Israel and several Arab nations.</p>
<p>He campaigned for office as a “peacemaker” who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging more than five months into his presidency.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922775/texas-flood-toll-passes-100-as-more-bodies-recovered' target='_blank'><strong>Texas flood toll passes 100 as more bodies recovered</strong></a>
            <p><p>The death toll from catastrophic flooding in Texas rose to more than 100 on Monday, as rescuers continued their grim search for people swept away by torrents of water.</p>
<p>Among the dead were at least 27 girls and counsellors who were staying at a youth summer camp on a river when disaster struck over the Fourth of July holiday weekend.</p>
<p>Forecasters have warned of more flooding as rain falls on saturated ground, complicating recovery efforts involving helicopters, boats, dogs and some 1,750 personnel.</p>
<p>“There is still a threat of heavy rain with the potential to cause flooding,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott said in a statement Monday, with the number of victims expected to rise still.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump confirmed he planned to visit Texas on Friday, as the White House slammed critics claiming his cuts to weather agencies had weakened warning systems.</p>
<p>“Blaming President Trump for these floods is a depraved lie, and it serves no purpose during this time of national mourning,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday.</p>
<p>She said the National Weather Service, which <em>The New York Times</em> reported had several key roles in Texas unfilled before the floods, issued “timely and precise forecasts and warnings.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Trump has described the floods that struck in the early hours of Friday as a “100-year catastrophe” that “nobody expected.” The president, who previously said disaster relief should be handled at the state level, has signed a major disaster declaration, activating fresh federal funds and freeing up resources.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#tragedy" id="tragedy" title="Permalink"></a>‘Tragedy’</h2>
<p>At least 104 flood-related deaths were reported across central Texas.
Kerr County, through which the Guadalupe River runs, was the hardest hit, with at least 84 people killed including 28 children, according to the local sheriff’s office.</p>
<p>The toll includes 27 who had been staying at Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian camp that was housing about 750 people when the floodwaters struck.
Camps are a beloved tradition in the long US summer holidays, with children often staying in woods, parks and other rural areas.</p>
<p>Texas Senator Ted Cruz described them as a chance to make “lifetime friends — and then suddenly it turns to tragedy.”</p>
<p>But some residents were questioning the absence of more robust flood-warning systems in this region of south and central Texas — where such deluges are so frequent that it is known colloquially as “Flash Flood Alley.”</p>
<p>Experts stress the NWS sent out timely forecasts, and climate scientist Daniel Swain pinned the problem on a failure of “warning dissemination.” San Antonio mother Nicole Wilson—  who almost sent her daughters to Camp Mystic — launched a petition on Change.org urging Governor Greg Abbott to approve a modern warning network.</p>
<p>“Five minutes of that siren going off could have saved every single one of those children,” she told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>At a candlelight vigil in San Antonio on Monday night, Texans gathered to pray for the victims of the floods and voice lingering fears.</p>
<p>“I was pretty shocked on the gravity of the situation and how big it was, and I wouldn’t necessarily expect that our rivers would rise so quickly,” said Rebeca Gutierrez, 29.</p>
<p>“Hopefully there’s preventative efforts happening in similar areas to make sure nothing to this degree happens.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#two-story-building" id="two-story-building" title="Permalink"></a>Two-story building</h2>
<p>In a terrifying display of nature’s power, the rain-swollen waters of the Guadalupe River reached treetops and the roofs of cabins as girls at the camp slept.</p>
<p>Blankets, teddy bears and other belongings were caked in mud. Windows in the cabins were shattered, apparently by the force of the water.</p>
<p>Volunteers were helping search through debris from the river, with some motivated by personal connections to the victims.</p>
<p>“We’re helping the parents of two of the missing children,” Louis Deppe, 62, told <em>AFP</em>. “The last message they got was ‘We’re being washed away,’ and the phone went dead.”</p>
<p>Months’ worth of rain fell in a matter of hours on Thursday night into Friday, and rain has continued in bouts since then.</p>
<p>The Guadalupe surged around 26 feet (eight meters) — more than a two-story building – in just 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Flash floods occur when the ground is unable to absorb torrential rainfall.
Human-driven climate change has made extreme weather events such as floods, droughts and heat waves more frequent and more intense in recent years.</p></p>

            <p><p><strong>• Says business community’s issues to be resolved on priority basis<br />
• In meeting with Sharjeel, minister praises Sindh govt for effective Muharram security</strong></p>
<p>KARACHI: Acknowledging the growing number of visa rejections faced by Pakistani citizens, particularly the business community, by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has said that he will raise the issue with his UAE counterpart this week and is hopeful that the matter will be resolved.</p>
<p>He expressed these views while talking to representatives of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) here on Monday.</p>
<p>Upon his arrival at the KCCI, the minister was warmly welcomed by the office-bearers and leading members of the city’s business community, who briefed him on several issues, including law and order, street crime, water shortages, smuggling, narcotics and encroachments.</p>
<p>The minister assured them that the government was working hard to address all these issues on a priority basis.</p>
<p>About the visa problems, he said that he will be meeting with the interior minister of the UAE a day after tomorrow and he will enlighten him about the severity of the issue.</p>
<p>Mr Naqvi highlighted the government’s efforts to improve the global ranking of the Pakistani passport. “We are proud of our green passport, and in the future, it will be a source of even greater pride.”</p>
<p>He also praised the performance of the Sindh police, noting that the law and order situation in the city has significantly improved compared to the past, with a noticeable reduction in crime. “If Karachi is healthy, Pakistan will be healthy,” he remarked.</p>
<p>Regarding smuggling, Mr Naqvi said that the government has made considerable progress in curbing illegal trade. “A few years ago, even the dollar was being smuggled from here, but the situation has improved, and further measures are underway,” he said.</p>
<p>However, he clarified that while smuggling had not been completely eradicated, it has been significantly reduced.</p>
<p>He also stressed the importance of the Safe City Project in curbing crimes, calling it a key initiative endorsed by the prime minister.</p>
<p>He mentioned Faisalabad as a successful model where the project has led to a decline in overall crimes and expressed his hope that similar efforts would be intensified in Karachi.</p>
<p>On the issue of verifying potential employees’ criminal backgrounds, the minister said the government will work with the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) to streamline ID and SIM card verification, enabling businesses to make informed hiring decisions.</p>
<p>Addressing the problem of encroachments, the minister called for strict legislation, including penalties and fines, to effectively deal with the issue.</p>
<p>BMG chairman Zubair Motiwala, vice chairman Anjum Nisar, KCCI President Javed Bilwani and others were present on the occasion.</p>
<p>Earlier, Mr Motiwala termed land grabbing Karachi’s biggest challenge and criticised the revival of questionable police practices.</p>
<p>He appealed for surprise inspections of police stations and stressed police reforms, emphasising merit-based promotions and better salaries.</p>
<p><strong>Commissioning ceremony of new boats</strong></p>
<p>Also on Monday, the interior minister attended the commissioning ceremony of two new RHIB (Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats) inducted into the Pakistan Coast Guards (PCG) fleet at Karachi Port.</p>
<p>Upon his arrival, he was warmly received by PCG Director General Major General Jawad Riaz.</p>
<p>The ceremony was attended by senior military and civil officials, members of the international community and notable personalities from various walks of life.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, the interior minister lauded the professionalism and performance of the coast guards, stating that it is the only force in the country that operates simultaneously on both land and sea to prevent smuggling, illegal immigration, and anti-trawling fishing activities.</p>
<p>He noted that the induction of the two new boats will significantly enhance the operational capabilities of the force and contribute to curbing illicit activities.</p>
<p><strong>Visits Sharjeel’s residence</strong></p>
<p>Mr Naqvi visited the residence of Sindh’s Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon.</p>
<p>The meeting between the two leaders included a detailed discussion on the country’s important political issues.</p>
<p>The meeting included a detailed discussion on the relations between the federation and the provinces, and joint efforts to ensure national peace and stability.</p>
<p>Both agreed that all political forces must work together to address the challenges facing the country, in the interest of national unity and public welfare.</p>
<p>The interior minister appreciated the security arrangements made by the provincial government and police during Muharram.</p>
