            <p><p>A search operation for tourists who went missing after rain-induced floods in Gilgit-Baltistan’s (GB) Babusar area concluded on Monday after 14 days, while their funeral prayers were held in absentia.</p>
<p>Pakistan has been grappling with severe flooding caused by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">glacial lake outburst floods</a> (Glofs) and intense monsoon rains since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919360">June</a>. These extreme weather events have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930">resulted</a> in several deaths and injuries across the country, with the GB region among the hardest hit.</p>
<p>After deadly floods <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> across GB’s Babusar area on July 21, the deaths of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=Seven%20deaths%20were%20reported%20from%20Babusar">seven people</a> had been confirmed but 12 remained missing. Besides the missing, the region’s death toll <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20so%20far%2C%2010%20fatalities%20and%20four%20injuries%20have%20been%20reported">stands at 10</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Firaq said, “The funeral prayers of the missing persons were offered in absentia in Babusar.”</p>
<p>He said that the search operation on Babusar Highway, which had continued for 14 days, has now ended. “All vehicles have been removed from the debris, but no trace of the missing persons could be found,” he said.</p>
<p>“[The] hopes of the missing persons being rescued in the flood-hit area have been dashed,” he added.</p>
<p>Last week, the GB government had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927377/gb-govt-promises-to-compensate-flood-affected-people-says-rehabilitation-work-underway">intensified</a> the search operations on Babusar Highway.</p>
<p>Diamer police, GB Scouts, Pakistan Army personnel, Rescue 1122 and local volunteers took part in the search efforts. Drone camps, modern equipment, sniffer dogs, technical mechanisms, heavy machinery and human resources were used for the operation.</p>

<p>Separately, five members of a family trapped because of a flood four days ago in GB’s Ghizer district have been rescued and taken to a safe place, Ghizer’s Rescue 1122 said today.</p>

<p>According to Ghizer Rescue 1122’s media coordinator, Shakraiz, a lightning strike washed away the road connecting the flood-hit area on the evening of July 31, causing five members of a family to be stranded on the other side of a river in Gopus Khatam village.</p>
<p>“Today, the team rescued all the members and moved them to a safe place by boat,” Shakraiz told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>“Food was also delivered to other affected families during the operation. Sixty-two houses, water supply and electricity systems, along with health and education centres, were severely affected by the flood in the Ishkoman and Gopus valleys of Ghizer.”</p>
<p>According to local political leader Zafar Muhammad Shadamkhel, lightning struck at eleven places simultaneously, causing severe damage to houses, buildings, schools, roads and power plants. He added that 600 people have been deprived of drinking water.</p>
<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927955">cloudburst-induced floods</a> in Ghizer and Hunza districts caused significant damage to the irrigation channel in Ghalapan village in upper Hunza’s Gojal, which provides water for over 50,000 forest trees, according to residents.</p>
<p>The next day, a glacier burst in GB’s Bagrot Valley had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928021">resulted</a> in the death of one person, while his father was injured, according to the regional government’s spokesperson.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928691/pakistan-issues-another-tender-to-buy-01m-tonnes-of-sugar-traders-say' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan issues another tender to buy 0.1m tonnes of sugar, traders say</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) has issued a new international tender to purchase 100,000 tonnes of white refined sugar, European traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>The quantity is double the earlier procurement target of 50,000 tonnes. The deadline for submission of price offers is August 11.</p>
<p>The announcement is believed to indicate that Pakistan will make no purchase in its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926639/tcp-doubles-tender-size-amid-sugar-price-surge">previous tender</a> for 100,000 tonnes of sugar on July 31, traders said.</p>
<p>On July 8, Pakistan’s government had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923204/trading-corporation-of-pakistan-to-import-035m-tonnes-of-sugar">approved plans</a> to import 500,000 tonnes of sugar to help maintain price stability. Market analysts said that retail sugar prices in the country have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923873">risen sharply</a> since January.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/3  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Traders said three companies had participated in the July 31 tender, with the lowest price offer assessed at $539.00 a tonne cost and freight included (c&amp;f).</p>
<p>Pakistan reportedly received <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925968">no offers</a> in a previous tender to buy 50,000 tonnes of sugar on July 22, with traders saying the requirement to load shipments from August 1-15 was too short notice for realistic offers.</p>
<p>The new tender seeks small/fine and medium grade sugar from worldwide origins, excluding India and Israel, packed in bags transported either in ocean shipping containers or breakbulk.</p>
<p>Shipment of breakbulk supplies is sought from September 1-15 for 50,000 tonnes and September 10-25 for 50,000 tonnes. For 50,000 tonnes of sugar in ocean shipping containers, shipment can also be made between September 1 and 20.</p>
<p>Shipments should be organised to achieve the arrival of all the sugar in Pakistan by October 20.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, traders remain puzzled by the government’s sugar trade policy.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/3  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>During FY25, Pakistan exported 765,734 tonnes of sugar, generating $411 million in foreign exchange, with an average per tonne price of $537. By contrast, only 33,101 tonnes were exported in FY24, earning just $21m.</p>
<p>Despite the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1864661">export</a> surge earlier this year, domestic consumers are now grappling with rising prices.</p>
<p>Last week, the government decided to enforce <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927244">strict monitoring</a> of sugar stocks and deploy officials at each sugar mill to oversee inventory levels and ensure uninterrupted supply in line with commitments made by the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA).</p></p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) on Monday and chaired a high-level meeting to review the flood damages from the recent monsoon rains and distribute relief funds to the affected people.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge became more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921009/at-least-8-dead-13-injured-in-rain-related-incidents-across-gb-punjab-and-sindh-officials#:~:text=two%20sisters%20died%20after%20being%20swept%20away">late June</a>. Situation worsened when deadly floods <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20so%20far%2C%2010%20fatalities%20and%20four%20injuries%20have%20been%20reported.%20Seven%20deaths%20were%20reported%20from%20Babusar%2C%20two%20from%20Thore%20Valley%20(Dia%C2%ADmer)%20and%20another%20from%20Astore%20district.">10 people</a>, mostly tourists, have lost their lives, with between 10 and 15 tourists still missing.</p>
<p>Addressing a review meeting on the damages caused by the recent monsoon rains, PM Shehbaz termed the destruction caused by cloodbursts in Diamer and other areas as “unfortunate”. He prayed for those who lost their lives and for the speedy recovery of the injured.</p>
<p>“Pakistan’s contribution to global emissions is negligible, but despite this, it is among the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891272">top 10 countries</a> that are facing destruction and losses due to global warming,” the premier noted.</p>

<p>Recalling the devastating <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1724134">2022 floods</a>, he said, “After that, each year such destruction comes in less or greater intensity.”</p>
<p>In 2022, the country witnessed the most devastating floods in its history, which killed 1,700 people, affected 33 million people, washed away swathes of agricultural lands, and incurred <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1721343">losses</a> worth $30 billion, according to governmental estimates.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz hailed the work of various federal authorities — including the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the ministries of communication, water, GB, climate change, and international coordination — in assisting with the relief work.</p>
<p>He stressed that he had issued “clear” directives to Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik and his team to work on the matter. He highlighted that Malik has attended various conferences on climate change and secured funds for resilient infrastructure in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Highlighting that the ministry had a key role in “mitigating the changes arising from climate change” across the country, the premier noted that the NDMA was originally established for relief, rescue and rehabilitation work once a disaster strikes.</p>
<p>He recalled that the communication secretary had spent six days in GB as he oversaw the restoration of roads damaged by the rains.</p>
<p>The prime minister vowed to visit GB once the monsoon rains end to lay the foundation stone of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1822414">Daanish Schools</a> he had promised. “We will also discuss other development projects with you and decide on them,” he assured the GB government.</p>
<p>He said the solar power project, which he was personally overseeing, had been greenlit by the Central Development Working Party and awaited approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council.</p>
<p>“I will try to ensure this project’s completion as soon as possible under my own monitoring.”</p>

<p>During his day trip, PM Shehbaz held separate meetings with the GB governor and chief minister to discuss the region’s flood damages, among other matters.</p>

<p>During the meeting, prayers were offered for those who lost their lives in the recent rains and floods.</p>
<p>The governor also updated the premier on the region’s overall law and order situation. Recently, GB’s Tangir district witnessed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928201/gb-awami-action-committee-leader-woman-killed-in-name-of-honour">two honour killing incidents</a> within a week, taking the lives of four people.</p>
<p>In his meeting, CM Gulbar informed PM Shehbaz about the rescue and relief activities in the wake of the monsoon rains, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/04-08-2025/pm-gb-cm-discuss-progress-on-development-projects" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Gulbar, an estranged member of the PTI who was backed by the PML-N and PPP during his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1764488">election as chief minister</a>, appreciated the premier’s decision to establish Daanish schools in GB.</p>
<p>They also discussed the law and order situation in GB and progress on development projects.</p>

<p>The visit comes after PM Shehbaz chaired a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928144">high-level meeting</a> last week to review the monsoon damage, where he reaffirmed the federal government’s full support for relief and recovery efforts in GB and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).</p>
<p>Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik, Kashmir Affairs and GB Minister Amir Muqam, Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Inter-Provincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, and PM’s coordinator on GB Shabbir Ahmed Usmani are accompanying the premier.</p>
<p>“The prime minister will meet with the victims of rains and floods in Gilgit and distribute relief funds,” <em>PTV</em> said.</p>
<p>In a statement on the occasion, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said, “The hopes of flood affectees are attached to the prime minister.</p>
<p>“GB has faced losses worth more than Rs20 billion due to the worst destruction caused by the floods,” Faraq highlighted.</p>
<p>As floods and landslides hit GB in late July, CM Gulbar had appe­aled to the federal government for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838">Rs7bn in emergency funds</a> to deal with climate-induced disasters.</p>

<p>“Cooperation from the federal government plays the role of oxygen for GB,” the official said, stressing that “homeless people with wrecked houses and eroding settlements were looking forward to remedies for their wounds”.</p>
<p>Terming PM Shehbaz’s visit a “good omen”, Faraq welcomed the premier to the region.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922323/maximum-temperature-record-shattered-in-gbs-chilas-and-bunji-pmd">heat­­waves</a>, erratic weat­her patterns and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928021">glacial melting</a> have triggered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a> and intense floods across the region.</p>
<p>Five members of a family trapped due to a flood four days ago in GB’s Ghizer District were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928659/5-family-members-stranded-due-to-floods-in-gb-rescued-after-4-days">rescued today</a>, the region’s Rescue 1122 said.</p>

<p>On Friday, a <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">glacier burst</a> in GB’s Bagrot Valley led to the death of a 12-year-old boy, while his father was injured.
