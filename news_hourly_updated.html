                <h2>Justice Mandokhail notes Justice Isa, Afridi acknowledged PTI‚Äôs right to reserved seats</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail on Thursday observed that former Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa and CJP Yahya Afridi in their separate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back#:~:text=Chief%20Justice%20Qazi%20Faez%20Isa%20read%20out%20the%20minority%20judgement%2C%20written%20by%20Justice%20Jamal%20Khan%20Mandokhail">judgements</a> last year had acknowledged the PTI‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621">right to reserved seats</a> as a parliamentary party.</p>
<p>The remarks came as the Supreme Court‚Äôs constitutional bench (CB) heard review pleas against a ruling that had declared the PTI eligible for reserved seats.</p>
<p>In its July 12, 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">short order</a>, eight out of 13 judges ruled that 39 out of a list of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621#:~:text=the%20verdict%20stated.-,List%20of%2080%20MNAs,-The%20verdict%20listed">80 MNAs</a> were and are the returned candidates of the PTI, setting it to emerge as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845532">single largest party</a> in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>However, the ruling had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1868333">not been implemented</a> by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860119">National Assembly</a>, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had raised some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859716">objections</a>. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1846084">PML-N</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847508/ppp-takes-cue-from-pml-n-files-review-petition-on-sc-reserved-seats-verdict">PPP</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850678#:~:text=ECP%20files%20review%20plea">ECP</a>.</p>
<p>An 11-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin Khan resumed the hearing today after Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908809/two-judges-object-as-sc-accepts-review-pleas-on-reserved-seats-for-hearing">dismissed</a> the review petitions on the first day of hearings.</p>
<p>The other 10 members of the bench were Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhter Afghan, Shahid Bilal Hassan, Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Salahuddin Panhwar, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi.</p>
<p>The CB <a class="link--external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1A8p0eILX0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">live-streamed</a> its proceedings on the SC‚Äôs YouTube channel, after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912745/supreme-court-allows-live-streaming-of-reserved-seats-review-case">accepting</a> the SIC‚Äôs application for it last week.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Advocate Faisal Siddiqui appeared before the court today on behalf of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), which the PTI-backed independent candidates had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1816169">joined</a> during the 2024 elections after the PTI‚Äôs election symbol was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1805488">revoked</a>.</p>
<p>Sikandar Bashir Mohmand was present as the ECP counsel while Barrister Haris Azmat appeared as the PML-N lawyer.</p>
<p>During the hearing, Justice Mandokhail noted that he and ex-CJP Isa, in their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back#:~:text=8%2C%202024%20elections.-,Minority%20view,-Later%2C%20Chief%20Justice">minority judgment</a>, had agreed with the eight-judge majority verdict to the extent of 39 candidates. He further said that CJP Yahya Afridi had also acknowledged the PTI‚Äôs right to reserved seats.</p>
<p>Despite the 8-5 split, 11 out of the 13 judges had declared the PTI a parliamentary party. In his standalone order, Justice Afridi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back#:~:text=after%20providing%20an%20opportunity%20to%20the%20parties%20concerned%20and%2C%20if%20required%2C%20to%20revisit%20its%20earlier%20decision%20within%20seven%20days.">ordered the ECP</a> to provide an opportunity to the parties concerned about the reserved seats and, if required, to revisit its earlier decision within seven days.</p>
<p>Justice Mazhar, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621#:~:text=Justice%20Syed%20Mansoor%20Ali%20Shah%20had%20announced%20the%20majority%20verdict%2C%20which%20was%20supported%20by%20seven%20other%20judges%3A%20Justices%20Munib%20Akhtar%2C%20Muhammad%20Ali%20Mazhar">part</a> of the original majority verdict, also noted: ‚ÄúThe minority judges acknowledged the PTI on the same grounds as the majority judges.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The proceedings were then adjourned till 11:30am on June 16, with Siddiqi set to continue his arguments.</p>
<p>During the previous hearings, the CB had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913802/judges-in-a-fix-over-sic-role-in-reserved-seats-case">questioned</a> the SIC‚Äôs standing in the case, noting that the original order had allocated seats to the PTI and not the SIC. Senior lawyer Makhdoom Ali Khan, counsel for women lawmakers affected by the SC ruling, has also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913572/legality-of-ptis-relief-in-reserved-seats-case-contested">contested the legality</a> of that verdict.</p>
<p>Initially, a full-strength 13-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin took up the review pleas on May 6. However, Justices Ayesha and Abbasi declared the applications as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908809/two-judges-object-as-sc-accepts-review-pleas-on-reserved-seats-for-hearing">inadmissible</a> and were not part of the subsequent proceedings, with the CB head judge noting they had stepped back voluntarily.</p>
<p>Justice Ayesha had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909890/justice-ayesha-malik-piqued-by-failure-to-upload-dissenting-order">formally complained</a> to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi about her dissenting order not being uploaded to the SC‚Äôs website.</p>
<p>In her judgement, she had criticised the ECP for not implementing the earlier order, observing that it would ‚Äúnot only undermine the authority of the Supreme Court but also erode the foundational values of democracy itself‚Äù.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#the-hearing" id="the-hearing" title="Permalink"></a>The hearing</h2>
<p>At the outset of the hearing, Justice Mandokhail asked the PML-N lawyer whether he had addressed the point of a party‚Äôs candidates being declared as independent in his written response. Azmat replied that he had tried to answer the question.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>Siddiqi contended that the <a class="link--external" href="https://scp.gov.pk/files/Misc/The_Pakistan_Supreme_Court_Rules.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Supreme Court Rules</a> had not been considered in some petitions and asked that those be dismissed.</p>
<p>He said he would answer the question of why SIC chairman Hamid Raza contested the elections independently, at which Justice Mandokhail noted that the matter of ‚Äúwho contested in what manner‚Äù was not before the court.</p>
<p>However, Justice Hilali, referring to her questions in previous hearings, remarked: ‚ÄúI had some questions, which I did not get a satisfactory answer to.‚Äù</p>
<p>She noted that the SIC had existed as a political party since 2013, wondering how it was ‚Äúmade a parliamentary party‚Äù despite Raza not contesting the polls from his party.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was stated in the reserved seats case that voting is a fundamental right, even though voting is not a fundamental right,‚Äù Justice Hilali said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Here, Justice Mandokhail recalled that he and ex-CJP Justice Qazi Faez Isa, in their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back#:~:text=8%2C%202024%20elections.-,Minority%20view,-Later%2C%20Chief%20Justice">minority judgment</a>, agreed with the eight-judge majority verdict to the extent of 39 candidates.</p>
<p>‚ÄúJustice Yahya Afridi also said that the PTI had a right to reserved seats,‚Äù the judge added. In his standalone order, Justice Afridi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back#:~:text=after%20providing%20an%20opportunity%20to%20the%20parties%20concerned%20and%2C%20if%20required%2C%20to%20revisit%20its%20earlier%20decision%20within%20seven%20days.">ordered the ECP</a> to provide an opportunity to the parties concerned about the reserved seats and, if required, to revisit its earlier decision within seven days.</p>
<p>Justice Mazhar, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621#:~:text=Justice%20Syed%20Mansoor%20Ali%20Shah%20had%20announced%20the%20majority%20verdict%2C%20which%20was%20supported%20by%20seven%20other%20judges%3A%20Justices%20Munib%20Akhtar%2C%20Muhammad%20Ali%20Mazhar">part</a> of the original majority verdict, observed, ‚ÄúThe minority judges acknowledged the PTI on the same grounds as the majority judges.‚Äù</p>
<p>Siddiqi then questioned how the review applications could depend on the minority rulings, pointing out that the same judgments had ‚Äúaccepted the PTI as a party‚Äù.</p>
<p>Justice Panhwar noted, ‚ÄúThe verdict challenged by those who brought the review petitions had not even been read before us.‚Äù</p>
<p>Justice Mazhar questioned whether judges could decide outside the constitutional scope. ‚ÄúEven if for the public aspiration and democracy, can judges rewrite the Constitution?‚Äù</p>
<p>Siddiqi responded that the Constitution had not been rewritten, at which Justice Hilali observed that it had been. ‚ÄúThree days‚Äô period was extended to 15 days,‚Äù she said, referring to the time given to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621#:~:text=The%20rest%2041%20MNAs%20were%20%E2%80%9Ctreated%20as%20independent%20returned%20candidates%20because%20they%20had%20not%20mentioned%20themselves%20as%20belonging%20to%20PTI%20in%20their%20nomination%20papers%E2%80%9D%2C%20the%20order%20read.">41 independent candidates</a> to resubmit their party affiliation.</p>
<p>Upon the lawyer contending that the majority of the judges were in favour of the PTI getting the reserved seats, Justice Aminuddin remarked, ‚ÄúYou are creating issues for yourself.‚Äù</p>
<p>Siddiqi then replied, ‚ÄúWe have no issue whether the PTI gets the reserved seats or the SIC; it is the same.‚Äù</p>
<p>The lawyer argued, ‚ÄúEveryone should get equal rights. PTI candidates were deliberately not given their rights.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail then remarked, ‚ÄúDemocracy has been mentioned. Is it not democracy for the candidates to decide on their own? No one can be forced to join another party. Those independent candidates who want to join another party can do so.‚Äù</p>
<p>Here, Justice Aminuddin addressed Siddiqi, saying: ‚ÄúYou keep going to the past.‚Äù The lawyer responded that the original ruling had not been read aloud before the bench, at which Justice Mandokhail asked why he was complaining when no one had stopped him from reading it.</p>
<p>At one point, Justice Hilali again questioned the SIC‚Äôs role in the conundrum.</p>
<p>Addressing Siddiqi, she asked: ‚ÄúWhy did you (SIC) not tell the PTI that ‚Äòwe are not contesting the elections‚Äô? The SIC chairman should have informed the PTI that he is running in the elections independently.‚Äù</p>
<p>Referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850003">dissenting order</a> by Justice Aminuddin and Justice Afghan that had denied the PTI reserved seats, the lawyer stated, ‚ÄúI do not agree with Justice Aminuddin‚Äôs judgment but it was a very forceful decision.‚Äù</p>
<p>At one point, Justice Mazhar, Justice Hilali and Siddiqi went back and forth over the right to vote being a fundamental constitutional right.</p>
<p>Siddiqi cited <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part2.ch1.html#:~:text=17.,Freedom%20of%20association" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Articles 17 and 19 of</a> the Constitution, which guarantees the right to affiliation and speech, respectively.</p>
<p>When Justice Hilali asserted that voting was not a fundamental right by birth but created by the statute, Siddiqi explained that there were three types of rights ‚Äî ‚Äúnatural such as the right to life, given by the statute and fundamental that can only be taken away after a Constitutional Amendment‚Äù.</p>
<p>As the hearing was adjourned till June 16, Siddiqi said he would want two hearings to complete his arguments.</p></p>

<p>Additionally, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal told reporters that there was no change in the budget date.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe federal budget will be presented on June 10,‚Äù he told the media after exiting a committee meeting at the National Assembly.</p>
<p>According to the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), Eidul Azha is expected to fall on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912584">June 7</a>, which means the third day of Eid will likely fall on June 9 ‚Äî the same day the Economic Survey is due to be released.</p>
<p>Last week, Schehzad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912867">announced</a> on X that the federal budget would be presented on June 10, while the Pakistan Economic Survey would be released a day earlier.</p>
<p>Before that, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909569">announced</a> that the federal government will present the next fiscal year‚Äôs budget on June 2, with a 16 per cent lower development allocation of Rs921 billion, resulting in the likely closure of about 200 ongoing development projects.</p>
<p>Last year, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1839433">presented</a> his first federal budget with a total outlay of Rs18.9 trillion, which analysts said was broadly ‚Äúin line with IMF guidelines‚Äù.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb, during the budget presentation, said that the goal was to widen the tax base to avoid burdening existing taxpayers.</p></p>
