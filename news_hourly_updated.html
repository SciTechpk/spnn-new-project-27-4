            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs willingness for a ‚Äúmeaningful dialogue‚Äù with India on all outstanding issues, state media <a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/23-07-2025/pakistan-ready-for-meaningful-dialogue-with-india-pm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Radio Pakistan</em></a> reported.</p>

<p>Pakistan previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911132">invited</a> India to a comprehensive dialogue to address all contentious issues, including the Kashmir dispute and the water distribution.</p>
<p>During a meeting with British High Commissioner Jane Marriott today, PM Shehbaz appreciated the UK‚Äôs role in de-escalating tensions during the Pakistan-India standoff and reiterated that Pakistan was ready for a meaningful dialogue with India on all outstanding issues.</p>
<p>He welcomed the British government‚Äôs decision to resume <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924570/uk-lifts-ban-on-pakistani-airlines-removes-country-from-air-safety-list">PIA flights</a> to the UK. He said, ‚ÄúThis [decision] would go a long way in alleviating the hardships faced by the British-Pakistani community as well as enhancing people-to-people exchanges,‚Äù while appreciating the role of the high commissioner.</p>
<p>Both sides discussed the ‚Äúpositive trajectory‚Äù of bilateral relations. The prime minister said that the recently held <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924280/pakistan-uk-ink-accord-to-boost-economic-cooperation">trade talks</a> between the two countries would lead to mutually beneficial opportunities for both sides. ‚ÄúPakistan is also cooperating closely with the UK at the UN Security Council, where Pakistan currently holds the monthly Presidency,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Marriott briefed PM Shehbaz about her recent visit to London, where she had extensive consultations on enhancing bilateral ties.</p>
<p>She lauded the Pakistani government‚Äôs recent economic performance which brought about a significant improvement in key macroeconomic indicators. She also discussed the UK‚Äôs perspective on regional developments in South Asia and the Middle East.</p>

<p>Last week, UK‚Äôs government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924354">launched</a> e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù border and immigration system.</p>
<p>The announcement came just a day after the two countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924280/pakistan-uk-ink-accord-to-boost-economic-cooperation">formally signed</a> the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#un-envoy-hits-back-at-india-for-cross-border-terrorism-claims" id="un-envoy-hits-back-at-india-for-cross-border-terrorism-claims" title="Permalink"></a>UN envoy hits back at India for cross-border terrorism claims</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Pakistan‚Äôs envoy to the UNSC, Ambassador Usman Jadoon, rejected Indian allegations of cross-border terrorism and asked India to change its behaviour, instead of resorting to its ‚Äútired narrative of victimhood and blame-shifting‚Äù, during the UNSC debate on ‚ÄúPromoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes‚Äù on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Indian envoy was reacting to Deputy PM Dar‚Äôs speech in New York during the reception hosted for Pakistan‚Äôs presidency of the UNSC, where the latter underscored the need for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is India which actively sponsors, aids and abets terrorism in my country and beyond,‚Äù Ambassador Jadoon, deputy permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, told the 15-member body on Tuesday evening, while responding to allegations made by India‚Äôs UN Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRather than being blinded by hubris and a misplaced sense of impunity, and instead of resorting to its tired narrative of victimhood and blame-shifting, India must introspect seriously, change its behaviour and comply with its international legal obligations on all counts,‚Äù he said, in the debate convened by Pakistan to promote pacific settlement of disputes between nations.</p>
<p>Ambassador Jadoon said that it was especially regrettable that the Indian ambassador targeted Pakistan yesterday, when earlier in the day, the council ‚Äúspoke with a unanimous voice to reaffirm the purposes and principles of the UN charter and the imperative of peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for international law and effective implementation of the resolution of the security council‚Äù.</p>
<p>The Pakistani envoy pointed out that firstly, India was in illegal occupation of the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile claiming to abide by the UN charter, and purportedly the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes, India has been in violation of security council resolutions on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, and has refused to implement those resolutions, thereby denying the Kashmiri people the exercise of their inalienable right to self-determination,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs egregious violations of human rights which extend beyond the occupied territory of Jammu and Kashmir and encompass its appalling treatment of minorities has been widely reported by international human rights organisations,‚Äù Jadoon added.</p>
<p>He also said that India had ‚Äústooped to a new low‚Äù of unilaterally and illegally holding in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">abeyance</a> the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, with the stated aim of depriving the people of Pakistan of water from the Indus river system.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn gross violation of international law, India resorted to blatant aggression against my country between 7-10 May, targeting civilians, including women and children,‚Äù the ambassador said.</p>
<p>He highlighted Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúbefitting but measured response‚Äù in accordance with its right to self-defence, aimed exclusively at military targets, that resulted in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">downing</a> of six Indian aircraft that took part in the aggression, among other significant military losses.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe hostilities came to an end owing to Pakistan‚Äôs position of strength and responsible approach, and facilitation of the US, as also highlighted in the statement of the US this morning, ‚Äú Jadoon told the delegates.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is ironic that India, which itself brought the Jammu and Kashmir dispute to the security council, refuses to implement the resolutions adopted by the council to peacefully resolve this dispute,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>Obviously stung by the success of Pakistan‚Äôs signature event at the council, the Indian envoy had claimed that Pakistan was ‚Äústeeped in fanaticism and terrorism‚Äù, and a ‚Äúserial borrower from the International Monetary Fund‚Äù.</p>
<p>The debate will resume on July 24 to listen to the remaining speakers, after listening to scores of high-level representatives.</p></p>

                <h2>Lower Kurram and Sadda tribes sign year-long peace agreement</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The tribes of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Lower Kurram and Sadda regions signed a peace agreement on Wednesday for a year in a jirga held at the Sadda Frontier Corps Fort that was attended by many local notables.</p>
<p>In March, tribal leaders in Kurram district <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901115">came</a> to terms on an eight-month peace agreement ahead of Eidul Fitr. Violence stemming from decades-old land disputes had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878429/officials-hold-out-hope-for-kurram-accord#:~:text=At%20least%20130%20people%20have%20been%20killed">claimed</a> at least 130 lives in the fragile district, with multiple efforts to establish peace between tribes. A ceasefire agreement was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1882460">reached</a> following months of conflict in January.</p>
<p>Kurram Deputy Commissioner (DC) Ashfaq Khan, who chaired the jirga, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that after a long law and order situation in the district, the efforts of the administration, security forces, police and tribal leaders brought positive results and ‚Äúa peace agreement was signed between the local tribes of Lower Kurram and Sadda for a year.‚Äù</p>
<p>The jirga was held at Sadda FC Fort between prominent tribal chiefs of the Ahle Sunnat and Tori Bangash tribes, including the participation of the additional DC, officers of the Security Forces Police and assistant commissioners.</p>
<p>DC Khan said the tribal elders inked the agreement in the light of the Kohat agreement, and all conditions of that agreement were to be considered.</p>
<p>He said the tribal leaders declared the move a ‚Äúmilestone for regional stability‚Äù and hoped for progress and long-standing peace. They also applauded the security forces, police and administration‚Äôs role and acknowledged their efforts, he added.</p>
<p>The residents of Topki, Sameer, Gosar, Amal Kot, Gharbena, Sangena, Kandezar, Mengak, Tangay, Manda, Marokhel and the suburbs of Lower Kurram and from Sadda, Kochi, Sateen, Shasho, Darani, Per Qayum, Sakhi Ahmad Shah, Mala Kaly, Chakai Kaly, Jan Haji Kaly, Malak Mulajan Kaly, Arawaly, Marokhel, Lower Mandori and adjacent areas signed the agreement unanimously.</p>
<p>On the occasion, DC Khan said the establishment of peace in the Hussain and Jamil valleys of Kurram district was possible only with the cooperation of regional elders, and the immense sacrifices of the security forces for peace in the region were highly commendable. He added that more steps would be taken for peace.</p>
<p>At least 10,000 personnel of the army, police and other agencies <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919962">performed</a> security duty during Muharram in Kohat division, with the restive Kurram district handed over to the army due to a slew of sectarian killings in the past.</p></p>
