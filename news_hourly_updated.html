<p>In a pulsating <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918646/pakistan-edge-france-in-thriller-to-reach-nations-cup-final">semi-final clash</a> at the National Hockey Stad­ium, Pakistan had staged a stunning comeback a day ago and overcame France 3-2 on penalties to book their place in the final.</p>
<p>The victory not only marked Pakistan’s entry into their second consecutive Nations Cup final but also kept alive their hopes of qualifying for the prestigious FIH Men’s Pro League for the first time.</p>
<p>It was a match that saw the Green Shirts display a blend of youthful flair, tactical discipline and mental resilience. Down 2-0 midway through the third quarter, Pakistan clawed their way back into the contest through a sequence of brilliantly orchestrated goals, eventually forcing a shootout after a 3-3 deadlock in regulation time.</p>
<p>“We were ready for this win for a long time,” Player of the Match Rana Waheed had said after the final whistle. “Everything we have — we gave everything. [We are] thankful to Allah Almighty for helping us. We are really proud of the team and looking forward to the finals now.”</p>
<p>The win over France was especially significant, given Pakistan’s dramatic journey to the semi-finals. Despite a 4-3 defeat to New Zealand in their final group game — in which they had led 3-1 — Pakistan advanced ahead of hosts Malaysia on goal difference. Both teams had ended with four points, but Pakistan’s tally of nine goals edged Malaysia’s eight.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s Nations Cup campaign had begun with a thrilling 3-3 draw against Malaysia, followed by a convincing 5-2 victory over Japan. Although they faltered against New Zealand, they did enough across their group matches to qualify for the knockouts.</p>
<p>The team’s resurgence comes amid growing optimism in Pakistan’s hockey circles. With a young core and renewed focus on grassroots development, the Green Shirts are aiming to restore some of the lost glory associated with the sport that once made them global champions.</p>
<p>Friday’s win not only reaffirmed Pakistan’s promise but also put them within one win of rejoining the FIH Pro League — a competition featuring the world’s top national teams.</p></p>

                <h2>Tarar stresses ‘exemplary punishment’ for Sana Yousuf’s killer</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday said that social media influencer Sana Yousuf’s killer should receive an exemplary punishment and that this should be a “test case” so that no such crime occurs in the future.</p>
<p>Islamabad Police arrested Umar Hayat, the main suspect in the 17-year-old’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915163/murder-case-filed-after-17-year-old-social-media-influencer-shot-dead-in-islamabad">murder</a>, on June 3, nearly a day after she was gunned down in her house in the federal capital. Police claimed the man murdered Sana because she repeatedly refused his advances. An Islamabad court on Friday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918402/physical-remand-of-suspect-in-sana-yousuf-murder-case-extended-by-3-days">extended</a> Hayat’s physical remand for another three days.</p>
<p>Tarar visited Yousuf’s home and extended condolences to her family, telling them that the prime minister and the interior minister had taken strict notice of the murder. He noted that the police arrested the suspect within hours of the incident and lauded the investigation.</p>
<p>“The culprit should get the strictest punishment to make an example,” Tarar told reporters outside the house, adding that the family has a “good legal team” and a strong case.</p>
<p>“The important thing now is to ensure there are no gaps in the prosecution or trial process and that everything moves forward smoothly,” the minister added. “Our lawyers and the Lawyers’ Forum will go with their legal team and provide support.</p>
<p>“I was here not just to express my grief, but also to give the family hope,” Tarar said.</p>

<p>Responding to a question, the information minister said that social media platforms should be used responsibly and their negative use should be discouraged, given that they can have “damaging impacts”.</p>
<p>“Girls can get blackmailed and harassed, or even fall victim to violence,” he stated. “It is time for legislation to protect young girls. We have to provide a forum for their protection and awareness.”</p>
<p>In a post on X, he said: “Those making videos on this tragedy must also stand with the family and the state in court during proceedings.”</p>

<p>The incident had sparked widespread outrage across the country, including from citizens, celebrities and President Asif Ali Zardari’s daughter, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916285">MNA Aseefa</a>.</p>
<p>“Sana was just a girl — with ambition, with dreams, with a life ahead of her,” Aseefa said in a statement. “She had every right to live freely and safely. What happened to her wasn’t just an act of violence — it was a punishment for saying no. And that should horrify every one of us.”</p></p>
