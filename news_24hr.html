            <p><p>The Chinese leadership has lauded the role of the Pakistan Army and hailed it as a “cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor” for peace in the region, the military’s media affairs wing said on Friday.</p>
<p>Pakistan and China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/china-says-it-backs-pakistan-in-defending-sovereignty">share</a> a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation, and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors, including trade, energy, infrastructure, and defence collaboration, with initiatives like the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879166">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.</p>
<p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir is currently on an official visit to China. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement today that he held meetings with senior Chinese political and military leadership in Beijing.</p>
<p>“Chinese military leadership reiterated full confidence in the strength of the bilateral defence partnership and acknowledged Pakistan’s pivotal role in promoting regional peace,” it said.</p>
<p>COAS Munir called on Chinese Vice President Han Zheng and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the statement read.</p>
<p>“Discussions focused on the evolving regional and global political landscape, connectivity initiatives under the CPEC, and the need for coordinated responses to shared geopolitical challenges,” it added.</p>
<p>“Both sides expressed satisfaction over the depth of bilateral engagement and reiterated their shared commitment to sovereign equality, multilateral cooperation, and long-term regional stability.”</p>
<p>The statement continued that the “Chinese leadership lauded the Pakistan Armed Forces as a cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor to peace in South Asia”.</p>

<p>The military engagement between both sides included “comprehensive exchanges on defence and security cooperation, including counterterrorism collaboration, joint training, defence modernisation, and enhanced institutional linkages”, THE ISPR said.</p>
<p>“Emphasis was placed on improving operational interoperability and strategic coordination to confront hybrid and transnational threats,” it added.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir held meetings with various Chinese military leaders, the statement read, adding, “Upon arrival at the  People’s Liberation Army Headquarters, the COAS was presented with a guard of honour, symbolising the longstanding camaraderie between the two armed forces.”</p>
<p>The COAS appreciated China’s “consistent support” and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to “further expanding military-to-military cooperation across all domains”, the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>The statement said that the visit “reflects the growing depth of politico-military ties between the two brotherly nations and underscores their shared resolve to advance regional security through sustained high-level dialogue and engagements”.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926296/pakistan-signs-maritime-mou-with-chinese-shipping-giant-to-boost-collaboration">signed</a> a memorandum of understanding with Chinese shipping giant, Shandong Xinxu Group, in a move that is set to bring about a “major transformation” in the shipping sector.</p>
<p>Last week, Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar met with the Chinese foreign minister, where both sides <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924658">reaffirmed</a> their commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation and promoting regional peace, stability and development.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926532/govt-urges-social-media-firms-to-block-accounts-run-by-terrorist-groups' target='_blank'><strong>Govt urges social media firms to block accounts run by terrorist groups</strong></a>
            <p><p>The government on Friday called on global social media organisations to immediately block the accounts of proscribed terrorist groups disseminating propaganda on their platforms.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926051/minister-talal-chaudhry-warns-public-of-ttp-operating-whatsapp-channels-to-spread-hate-harmful-narrative">highlighted</a> how a terrorist group was using WhatsApp channels to “disseminate hateful content and harmful narratives”, urging the platform and the global community to help Pakistan combat terrorism.</p>
<p>Addressing a joint press conference today in Islamabad alongside Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik, Chaudhry said: “I want to request social media operators and platforms to cooperate with us on the blockage and removal of accounts, taking measures to stop mirror accounts and to share information of account holders who are operating these accounts.”</p>
<p>Chaudhry said terrorist groups and individuals, including those banned in the United States, the United Kingdom and sanctioned by the United Nations, were operating accounts on social media platforms such as X, Facebook and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>He said the National Action Plan (NAP) — formed in 2014 to take action against terrorists through a concerted national effort — requires taking action against those spreading propaganda on media and social media.</p>
<p>The agenda items of NAP include a ban on the glorification of terrorists and terrorist organisations through print and electronic media, and measures against the abuse of the internet and social media for terrorism.</p>
<p>He requested social media firms to block these groups; use artificial intelligence (AI) to prevent “mirror accounts”; and share information about their operators. He urged creating auto-detect and auto-block algorithms against such accounts.</p>
<p>Barrister Malik said authorities had unearthed 481 accounts associated with proscribed terrorist groups on various platforms and reported them to social media organisations.</p>
<p>He urged social media firms to share information about account holders to “amplify counterterrorism operations in dealing with this newer threat”.</p>
<p>He also requested them to implement strict measures, which include AI methods to discover more accounts. He invited them to establish their presence in the country and sought enhanced cooperation in the digital world.</p>
<p>Malik said Pakistan was at the forefront and had rendered sacrifices in the war against terrorism, but a new trend had surfaced on social media apps such as X, Facebook, Instagram and Telegram.</p>
<p>“We will welcome social media platforms to set up offices in Pakistan for better coordination,” he said. “We seek coordination between social media platforms and our law enforcement agencies on social issues and the presence of terrorist organisations on social media.”</p>
<p>He said terror groups such as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, Islamic State Khorasan Province, Balochistan Liberation Army and Balochistan Liberation Front had an active presence on social media platforms, noting they have been banned by the US and the UK as well.</p>
<p>“Pakistan remains steadfast and is committed to our resolve to combat terrorism. Apart from operating on the ground, we have seen new trends in the digital realm,” he said.</p>
<p>He said the state minister for interior also highlighted how terrorist groups were “working on social media, recruiting and actively disseminating propaganda” through WhatsApp and other platforms.</p>
<p>“These social accounts significantly enhance their social media presence, whether it through their real names of pseudonyms. It poses a threat to our nation, citizens and the rest of the world.”</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926537/govt-to-continue-assisting-in-dr-aafia-siddiquis-case-pm-shehbaz-assures-her-sister' target='_blank'><strong>Govt to continue assisting in Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s case, PM Shehbaz assures her sister</strong></a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif assured Dr Fouzia Siddiqui on Friday that the government would continue to provide all possible legal and diplomatic support in the matter of her sister, Dr Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist serving a prison sentence in the US, the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-meets-dr-aafia-siddiquis-sister-assures-all-possible-legal-diplomatic-support/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) Registrar Office <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924527">put</a> on hold the processing of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925717/contempt-notice-to-pm-cabinet-after-unsanctioned-hearing">contempt of court notices</a> issued to PM Shehbaz and his cabinet members as the dealing staff decided to ascertain its validity first.</p>
<p>IHC Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan on July 21 issued a contempt of court notice to the entire federal government, including the prime minister and all ministers, for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921306">refusing</a> to file an amicus brief to support Dr Aafia’s case in the US.</p>
<p>“The government is in no way negligent regarding the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui,” the prime minister was quoted as having said by <em>APP</em>.</p>
<p>On the instructions of PM Shehbaz, the government has previously provided diplomatic and legal assistance in the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui, a statement issued by the PM Office said.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, the prime minister not only wrote a letter to then-US President Joe Biden regarding this issue but also formed a committee headed by Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar to ensure further progress in the matter,” the statement added.</p>
<p>“The committee will remain in contact with Dr Fouzia and work to provide the necessary support in this regard.”</p>
<p>Dr Aafia Siddiqui, a neuroscientist and educator, was convicted by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on charges of attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan and has been serving her <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924527">sentence</a> at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Carswell in the US since 2010.</p>
<p>On July 12, the IHC expr­essed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923643">dissatisfaction</a> over the federal government’s failure to submit a report in the case concerning Dr Aafia’s release, health and repatriation, with Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq threatening to “summon the entire cabinet” if the report was not presented.</p>
<p>In February, the IHC was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893509">told</a> that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1496759">proposal</a> to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1384547">exchange</a> Shakil Afridi for Dr Aafia was unfeasible.</p>
<p>The law officer representing the federal government informed the court that Dr Aafia’s American lawyer Clive Smith had suggested the swap, but Pakistan and the US did not have any agreement for such an exchange.</p>
<p>Last year in October, PM Shehbaz had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866050">requested</a> that then US President Joe Biden pardon and release Dr Aafia from jail.</p>
<p>In a letter dated October 13, which has been seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, the prime minister expressed his concerns about Dr Aafia’s “fragile mental and frail physical health” while in prison. “Now 52 years old, she has served 16 years behind bars in the US.</p>
<p>“Numerous Pakistani officials have paid consular visits to Dr Siddiqui … all of them have raised their serious concerns about the treatment she has received,” the letter read. “In fact, they fear she may take her own life.”</p>
<p>Consequently, the US State Department <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867024">declined</a> to comment on the letter written by PM Shehbaz to the Biden administration.</p>
<p>When a journalist inquired about the letter during a press briefing on Tuesday, spokesperson Vedant Patel stated: “Certainly, we would not get into private diplomatic communications,” seemingly confirming receipt of the correspondence.</p></p>
