            <p><p>Former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Saturday called out India for its “excuses” to avoid any dialogue with Pakistan to resolve their outstanding issues after recent tensions between the two countries.</p>
<p>Pakis­tan has launched a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence there. As part of its global outreach, the team will also visit London and Brussels. The delegation comprises former foreign ministers Bilawal, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Washington after wrapping up engagements with US lawmakers and think tanks, the PPP chairman said Pakistan’s civil and military leadership were all on the same page against terrorism and believed that it was in the region’s interest to establish with India. “It is India who’s been running away from calls for an investigation and it’s been India who’s been running away from efforts for dialogue. I believe that is perhaps the lamest excuse for not having a dialogue right now,” he added.</p>
<p>Bilawal offered to arrange a dialogue with the military or political leadership if India wanted.</p>
<p>“I believe the true path forward is for India and Pakistan to engage in a dialogue to establish peace. Whatever excuse you want to make sometimes, it’s this civil military excuse, sometimes it’s this geopolitical excuse, sometimes it’s this ‘Oh all Muslims are terrorist excuse so we’re not going to talk to Pakistan’ — it’s getting [tiresome]. You can’t be two nuclear armed neighbours with a conflict threshold so low and absolutely no dispute resolution mechanism.”</p>
<p>Bilawal said India did not want mediation from the US or the United Nations or any interactional actor and did not even want to engage directly with Pakistan, noting that this made no rational sense.</p>
<p>“It’s in all our interest to convince India to undo the decision that doesn’t serve their purposes and come to the table and talk.”</p>

<p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended heartfelt congratulations to the entire Pakistani nation and the Muslim Ummah around the world on the occasion of Eidul Azha.</p>
<p>They emphasised the importance of promoting values of sacrifice, love, brotherhood, and unity in the nation’s behaviour.</p>
<p>In his message, the president said that the day revives in people the spirit of faith, sacrifice, selflessness, and brotherhood.</p>
<p>“He called for drawing lessons from the spirit of sacrifice and selflessness shown by Prophet Ibrahim (AS) and integrating them into our lives,” <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/07-06-2025/president-pm-exchange-eid-greetings-with-people" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> said.</p>

<p>He said there was a pressing need to support the underprivileged and marginalised segments of our society. “Along with the act of animal sacrifice, Eid calls upon us to make a solemn pledge to always care for those in need.”</p>
<p>Zardari said as a nation, we must support each other, share in each other’s sorrows, and work together to build a prosperous and great Pakistan.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said, “The message of Eidul Azha is not limited to the sacrifice of animals alone, it also teaches us to sacrifice our ego, desires, and personal interests for higher purposes.</p>
<p>“As our beloved homeland, Pakistan, moves forward on the path of development, we must embrace the spirit of unity, sacrifice, and selflessness.”</p>
<p>He said this Eid teaches us not only the importance of sacrificing life and wealth but also that nations achieve greatness when they work for collective welfare and selflessness alongside individual development.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz continued, “Today, we must especially remember our Palestinian brothers and sisters who are enduring ruthless and inhumane oppression and hunger.”</p>
<p>He added: “Likewise, we reaffirm our unwavering solidarity with the brave people of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, who have been engaged in a just and courageous struggle for their right to self-determination for decades.”</p>
<p>The prime minister, along with former chief minister Hamza Shehbaz, offered prayers in Lahore’s Model Town.</p>

<p>“Extending warm Eid greetings to the officers and men, the field marshal commended their unwavering commitment, professional excellence, and steadfast service in the face of persistent challenges.

<p>The army chief also lauded the formation’s “exemplary performance” during the recent military escalation with India and paid tribute to the martyrs during the period.</p>

<p>While interacting with the troops, the army chief also expressed “deep appreciation for their high morale, exceptional operational readiness, and resolute vigilance in responding effectively to Indian ceasefire violations”. He reiterated complete confidence in the battle preparedness of the armed forces to “decisively deter and defeat any act of aggression”.</p>
<p>The ISPR added that underscoring Pakistan’s principled stance, the field marshal affirmed that the “just and valiant” struggle of the Kashmiri people against Indian occupation would never be forgotten. He emphasised the need for the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in line with the aspirations of its people and the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915994/uk-and-india-discuss-counter-terrorism-cooperation-after-south-asia-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>UK and India discuss ‘counter-terrorism’ cooperation after South Asia tensions</strong></a>
            <p><p>The United Kingdom and India on Saturday discussed expanding their “counter-terrorism” collaboration following recent fighting between the latter and Pakistan, Britain’s foreign minister told <em>Reuters</em> after meeting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>British FM David Lammy is the highest-profile Western official to have visited both New Delhi and Islamabad since the two agreed to a ceasefire last month after their worst fighting in nearly three decades.</p>
<p>The latest tensions began in April after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">killing</a> of 26 men in Indian-occupied Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on “terrorists” it alleged were backed by Pakistan, a charge Islamabad denied. India then attacked what it claimed was “terrorist infrastructure” in Pakistan, leading to escalation from both sides until a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910113/world-community-hails-ceasefire-decision-between-pakistan-and-india">May 10 ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>“We want the situation to be maintained, but of course we recognise fragility, particularly in the backdrop of terrorism, terrorism designed to destabilise India,” Lammy said in an interview at the residence of the British high commissioner in New Delhi.</p>
<p>“We are keen to continue to work with our Indian partners on counter-terrorism measures.”</p>
<p>He said he discussed the next steps with both Modi and Indian FM S. Jaishankar, but gave no specifics.</p>
<p>Last year, India and Britain discussed combatting the financing of terrorism, cooperation between law enforcement and judicial bodies and information sharing.</p>
<p>Lammy said he also discussed boosting trade between the world’s fifth and sixth largest economies. The countries concluded talks for a free trade deal early last month.</p>
<p>“I know that Prime Minister Keir Starmer is very much looking forward to coming to India very soon to sign the free trade agreement,” Lammy said. “There is so much that our two nations can continue to do together.”</p></p>
