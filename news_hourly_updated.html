                <h2>US Centcom chief lauds ‘phenomenal partner’ Pakistan in counter-terrorism efforts</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>United States Central Command (Centcom) commander Army General Michael Kurilla on Wednesday praised Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner in the world of counter-terrorism”, citing the nation’s struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K).</p>
<p>Pakistan and the US reaffirmed the continuation of counter-terrorism cooperation during a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1833287">dialogue</a> in Washington on May 10. The dialogue underscored the cooperation between the two countries in addressing the most pressing challenges to regional and global security, including the threats posed by terrorist outfits such as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and IS-K.</p>
<p>The two nations are slated to have another counter-terrorism <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900767">dialogue</a> this month.</p>
<p>During a House Armed Services Committee hearing in Washington on Tuesday, the general was asked about the situation on the Afghan border with Pakistan, where he outlined that Pakistan has apprehended several “high-value” IS-K operatives.</p>
<p>Hailing a “phenomenal partnership” with Islamabad, Gen Kurilla highlighted that Pakistan has “gone after ISIS Khorasan (IS-K) killing dozens of them.”</p>
<p>“Through a relationship we have with them and providing intelligence, they have captured at least five ISIS Khorasan high-value individuals,” Kurilla said.</p>
<p>“They have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895923/trump-hails-pakistans-help-in-arresting-is-terrorist-behind-2021-kabul-airport-bombing">extradited</a> back Jaffar, who was one of the key individuals behind the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1642871">Abbey Gate bombing</a>,” he added, referring to IS-K operative Mohammad Sharifullah, an Afghan national who was arrested by Pakistan earlier this year.</p>
<p>Gen Kurilla added that he received a call from Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir after Sharifullah’s arrest, recounting, “He said ‘I’ve caught him, I’m willing to extradite him back to the United States, please tell the secretary of defence and the president’.</p>

<p>“We’re seeing Pakistan — with limited intelligence that we provided them — go after them using their means to do that and we’re seeing an effect on ISIS Khorasan,” he emphasised.</p>
<p>Gen Kurilla noted that there have been 1,000 terrorist attacks in “the western area” of Pakistan since the start of 2024, noting that they “are in an active counter-terrorism fight right now”.</p>
<p>“They have been a phenomenal partner in the counter-terrorism world,” the Centcom chief added.</p>
<p>Continuing his testimony, Gen Kurilla stated that the US needs to maintain ties with both Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>“We have to have a relationship with Pakistan and with India. I don’t believe it’s a binary switch that we can’t have one with Pakistan if we have one with India,” he argued. “We should look at the merits of the relationship for the positives that it has.”</p>
<p>In April, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the pair’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902727">first phone call</a>, where America’s top diplomat expressed interest in deepening cooperation in a variety of sectors, including counter-terrorism.</p>
<p>“During the call, DPM (Deputy Prime Minister)/FM Dar reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening its partnership with the United States,” the Foreign Office said in a statement.</p>
<p>“According to the statement, Dar highlighted Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts between 2013 and 2018, with Rubio appreciating Pakistan’s fight against terrorism and expressing the US’s “desire to further enhance counterterrorism cooperation”.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895923">address</a> to the US Congress in March, US President Donald Trump spoke about Sharifullah, praising Pakistan for the arrest.</p>
<p>“Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,” the US president told Congress. “I want to thank especially the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster.”</p></p>

            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916519/india-wants-to-sabotage-president-trumps-peace-efforts-bilawal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <h2>India wants to ‘sabotage President Trump’s peace efforts’: Bilawal</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Wednesday lambasted India for attempting to “sabotage President Donald Trump’s peace efforts” in South Asia, stressing that Pakistan was willing to solve all issues through dialogue.</p>
<p>His statement came against the backdrop of Pakistan’s recent conflict with India triggered by a deadly April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> on tourists in Occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. New Delhi, without evidence, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">accused</a> Islamabad of backing the attackers — an allegation that led to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">four-day military escalation</a> between the two nuclear-armed countries before the United States brokered a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> on May 10.</p>
<p>To present Pakistan’s stance on the escalation and dismiss Indian propaganda, the government constituted a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916097/pakistan-agreed-to-ceasefire-despite-having-upper-hand-on-condition-of-more-talks-with-india-bilawal">high-level delegation</a>, chaired by Bilawal, to visit major world powers. After holding meetings in the US, the delegation is now in the United Kingdom, after which it will head to the Belgian capital of Brussels to hold talks with the members of the European Commission.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference at the Pakistan High Commission in London, Bilawal said, “India wants to sabotage President Trump’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914608">peace efforts</a>, but its efforts will be in vain. The US will, if required, drag India to the table as it in the global interest that India and Pakistan make peace for regional stability and move towards development.”</p>
<p>The PPP chairman added that the recent conflict with India had turned the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916481/trump-willing-to-work-on-kashmir-issue-confirms-us-state-dept">Kashmir</a> dispute into a global issue despite New Delhi’s attempts to call it an “internal matter.”</p>
<p>“During this war, there has been progress regarding Kashmir on the diplomatic front. In 2019, India thought it had turned Kashmir into an internal matter. When Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">said</a> there should be mediation on Kashmir, the issue is now a global issue. India has been forced to accept that Kashmir is a bilateral issue.”</p>
<p>A day earlier, the US Department of State <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916481/trump-willing-to-work-on-kashmir-issue-confirms-us-state-dept">reiterated</a> President Trump’s resolve to work on the Kashmir dispute, saying each step that he takes “is made to solve generational differences between countries”.</p>
<p>Responding to a question on the steps US plans to take in the wake of Trump’s offer, State Department’s spokesperson Tammy Bruce during a press briefing noted, “So, while I can’t speak to his plans, the world knows his nature, and I can’t speak to any details of what he might have in that regard.”</p>
<p>He said the delegation held a meeting with members of the All Parties Kashmir Conference at the British House of Commons, who accepted that the issue has been globalised and they can speak about it.</p>
<p>Other members of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow">delegation</a> include — Hina Rabbani Khar, Khurram Dastgir, Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari, Bushra Anjum Butt and senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.</p>
<p>Bilawal reaffirmed that Pakistan desires peace but will defend itself from <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909954">Indian aggression</a> if attacked.</p>
<p>“Pakistan believes that through dialogue, all issues — whether Kashmir, water or terrorism — can be resolved.  War is not the solution,” he asserted, adding the message would be conveyed to the European Commission during the visit to Brussels as well.</p>
<p>“India’s narrative is based on lies. Its war and post-war narrative is also based on lies.  The people of India also want to live in peace.</p>
<p>“We have demonstrated that we can defeat India in conventional war as well as on the diplomatic front. We are talking about peace and India about war.”</p>
<p>Answering a question, Bilawal said India had no right to suspend or terminate the Indus Water Treaty — a deal between Pakistan and India that ensures fair distribution of the Indus River system’s waters. Following the Pehalgam attack, New Delhi held the treaty in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913184">abeyance</a>.</p>
<p>“The treaty is still intact. India’s statement (on holding the treaty in abeyance) is a violation of the Indus Water Treaty. Even threating to suspend the treaty is a violation of the UN charter. If India suspends it, we have called it an act of war.”</p>
<p>The former minister said India would have to “take back the statement on holding the treaty in abeyance.”</p>
<p>“If we are to create an enabling environment for dialogue, it is necessary that treaties are upheld,” he said.</p>
<p>Bilawal also criticised the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916324/india-a-belligerent-power-spinning-out-of-control-says-sherry-rehman-on-jaishankars-remarks">statement</a> of Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Pakistan, who said that when India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913085">Operation Sindoor</a>” was not over, it was a clear message that India “reserved the right to go after terrorists anytime, anywhere if they have done harm to us”.</p>
<p>“Jaishankar is a war monger, not a diplomat. If he thinks threatening nuclear war is diplomacy, then India’s problem isn’t Pakistan, it’s extremism within its own cabinet,” Bilawal said.</p>
<p>“Pakistan rejects these recycled allegations. It is ironic that a country with a sitting prime minister whose reputation speaks for itself… dares to lecture Pakistan, who is a victim of terrorism. Threatening missile strikes and boasting about escalation is not a display of strength, it’s a dangerous sign of regional instability.”</p>
<p>“The world should ask who is the aggressor. Pakistan responded with restraint, India continues to brag about war. Even India’s military has walked back its initial lies. Pakistan air force defended its air space.”</p>
<p>“If Jaishankar is so enamored by Google images, I suggest he Googles Abhinandan,” he quipped, referring to the Indian Air Force fighter pilot <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1659775">Abhinandan Varthaman</a>, who was captured on 27 February, 2019, after his plane was shot down inside Pakistani territory.</p>
<p>Bilawal said India has been unable to provide even a shred of evidence on the baseless allegations in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915829">Pahalgam attack</a> in occupied Kashmir in which 26 people lost their lives.</p>
<p>“Pakistan has asked for evidence. We have nothing to hide. If India has proof linking the April attacks to Pakistani soil, Pakistan group, then share with the international community.</p>
<p>“The truth is India knows Pakistan has nothing to do with the attacks. That is why India refused our prime minister’s call for an investigation. That is why to this day, they are hiding the truth from their citizens. This was an indigenous act of terrorism, an Indian intelligence failure, and the Indian government launched a war based on a lie,” he asserted.</p>
<p>The Bhutto scion said Pakistan will continue to peruse peace from “Kartarpur to the ceasefire”, while India continues to pursue “propaganda, polarisation, and war”.</p>
<p>“We want peace, stability and regional integration. All we see from New Delhi since election time is jingoism as a war policy,” he said.</p>
<p>In response to another question, Bilawal said India has targeted <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898852">Sikh</a> activists in Pakistan and countries around the world, and employing terrorism as a foreign policy that cannot be allowed for any civilised nation.</p>
<p>“I think India’s targeting campaign against Sikhs is a continuing factor why the world wasn’t with them when they raised allegations against Pakistan,” he said.</p>
<p>“The world knows India targeted Sikhs activists, killed them, or paid criminals gangs. India has targeted Sikhs in Pakistan also. Canada has said India paid criminal organisations to target Sikhs. There were also targeted in US and Australia.”</p></p>
