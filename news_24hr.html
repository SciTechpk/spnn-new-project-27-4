            <p><p>The Karakoram Highway (KKH) was reopened on Saturday as aid and rescue operations continued in Gilgit-Baltistan after flash floods battered the region.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719">devastating impacts</a> of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">heat­­waves</a>, erratic weat­her patterns and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660">glacial melting</a> have triggered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a> and intense floods across the region.</p>
<p>On Monday, floods swept through GB’s Babusar area in Diamer district and Naran, causing landslides and leaving many <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926193">stranded</a>. At least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926487">nine people</a> died and more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure were damaged as a result.</p>
<p>In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said: “The Karakoram Highway is open for all types of traffic.”</p>
<p>He recalled that the main artery had been blocked due to landslides and mud flow on Friday, adding that machinery was sent to restore the road.</p>
<p>Faraq further said that rescue and search operations were underway across the region. The recent floods have caused severe destruction in the region, particularly in the Kunduz region and the Ghanche district, he noted.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

<p>“Floods in GB have destroyed many houses, water channels, communication roads, standing crops, shops and electricity poles,” the official said.</p>
<p>He added that the local government has distributed “hundreds of tents, thousands of food packets and medicines to the affected people” across the region.</p>
<p>Speaking about the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">search operation</a> in Babusar, Faraq said, “There may be 10 to 12 missing tourists at the Babusar valley as a search operation was ongoing.”</p>
<p>“The Pakistan Army, GB Scouts, Rescue 1122 and local volunteers are taking part in the operation,” he said, adding that continuous landslides and increasing water flow were hampering the search.</p>
<p>Another rescue operation was underway in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/642478/trekking-to-tranquility">Fairy Meadows</a>, according to the government spokesperson.</p>

<p>“Four stranded tourists at Fairy Meadows near Nanga Parbat basecamp, including one man and three women, were airlifted through Pakistan Army helicopters on early Friday,” he added.</p>
<p>GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan and his cabinet will also hold a press conference today regarding flood disasters and rehabilitation operations, Faraq added.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the National Disaster Management Authority <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/pmd-issues-glof-alert-for-gb-kp-as-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-from-diamer-amid-floods#:~:text=NDMA%20issues%20landslide%20alert">issued</a> a landslide alert for the northern areas of the country. It advised citizens to avoid travelling to mountainous areas and directed authorities to remain alert in case of an emergency.</p>

<p>The GB government has started free and special flights yesterday to evacuate stranded tourists and local people, GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmed Mirza noted.</p>
<p>In a media briefing on Friday, Mirza said 135 people, including 80 tourists, were taken from Skardu to Islamabad through a C-130 flight. “A special C-130 flight will start from Gilgit to Islamabad to shift stranded tourists and local passengers to Islamabad,” he added.</p>
<p>He also said that the GB government made the arrangements with the NDMA and Pakistan Army to “facilitate safe evacuation of tourists, patients, and students who were stranded at multiple locations”.</p>
<p>A helicopter service was also launched to evacuate tourists stranded in the affected areas, he added.</p>
<p>The chief secretary further noted, “The main cause of most of the incidents was melting glaciers and cloudburst.”</p>
<p>He said that the cloudburst-induced <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">destructive flood</a> at Babusar valley washed away around eight kilometres of the road leading to Babusar Top, sweeping away two dozen vehicles and leaving <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/officials-say-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-amid-gb-floods-govt-issues-landslide-alert">hundreds of tourists</a> and locals stranded.</p>

<p>“However, the stranded tourists at Babusar valley and Deosai areas were safely evacuated through timely efforts by locals, Rescue 1122, district administration, the Pakistan Army, Frontier Works Organisation (FWO), and local community volunteers,” he added.</p>
<p>Mirza stated that 12km of roads, 26 bridges, 20 vehicles, water channels, cattle sheds, shops, agricultural lands, crops, private and public properties, irrigation channels, and drinking water supply systems had been damaged in several areas of GB.</p>
<p>“The GB government is effectively dealing with the situation,” he said, asserting the administration was providing aid to the affected places.</p></p>

            <p><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday apologised to mixed martial arts player Shahzaib Rind for the “inordinate delay” in the government’s promised financial reward and support.</p>
<p>In September, Rind <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859830">made history</a> when he won the Karate Combat Championship (KC-49) in Singapore, becoming the first-ever world champion from Pakistan after defeating Brazil’s Bruno Roberto De Assis in the final.</p>
<p>Following the win, <a class="link--external" href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2501761/karate-champion-shahzaib-rind-receives-rs100m-reward-from-president-zardari" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> had presented Rind with a cheque worth Rs 100 million, the <a href="https://www.samaa.tv/2087313582-mma-fighter-shahzaib-rind-rewarded-with-job-cash-after-win-against-india">Balochistan government</a> announced Rs2m as a cash prize, while a <a class="link--external" href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2498392/sardar-yaar-muhammad-rind-announces-reward-for-karate-champion-shahzaib-rind" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">former minister</a> had also promised him 25 acres of land.</p>
<p>Tarar’s apology today comes after Rind, in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/RindhShahzaib/status/1948070734607122889" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X on Wednesday, had slammed the government for its “fake promises” of Rs5m in cash and an additional Rs80m to support his training and upcoming matches.</p>
<p>“Our politicians are corrupt,” Rind alleged, adding that the last time he won, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had announced rewards for him.</p>
<p>“It was all [a] lie; I never got [a] penny from them. They just take pictures, fake promises and forget shame,” he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>Last year, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had issued a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-congratulates-shahzaib-rind-on-winning-karate-combat-championship/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> congratulating Rind and <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/pmln_org/status/1789587982296510500" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">met with him</a>. However, a report on any announcement of a reward could not be found.</p>
<p>Tarar responded to Rind’s criticism today, apologising for the delay in the promised support.</p>
<p>“There seems to be some miscommunication. We sincerely apologise for this unjustified delay,” the minister <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/TararAttaullah/status/1948967159796744580" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on X.</p>
<p>“Sportsmen like you are our real heroes and we value your achievements. You have brought great honour to the country and made us all proud.”</p>
<p>He added: “The prime minister has taken a serious notice of this inordinate delay and rest assured, it will be sorted out immediately inshallah.</p>
<p>“The PM has further instructed that such mistakes must never happen in the future. We regret this unjustified delay and the inconvenience caused,” the minister said.</p>

<p>In response, Rind welcomed the “acknowledgement”, saying: “I truly appreciate the prime minister’s attention to this matter and his commitment to supporting athletes like myself.</p>
<p>“Representing Pakistan on the world stage is an honour, and I will always give my all for our country. Inshallah, with your support, we can continue to uplift and inspire the next generation of champions,” he added, saying he looked forward to the issue’s resolution soon.</p>

<p>In April last year, Rind had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1829004">decried</a> the government’s lack of support, saying it was its “bad luck” that it did not support the country’s heroes after his 2-1 victory over India at Dubai’s Karate Combat 45 event.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926704/pakistan-urges-ceasefire-de-escalation-in-russia-ukraine-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan urges ceasefire, de-escalation in Russia-Ukraine conflict</strong></a>
            <p><p>Pakistan has called for de-escalation and ceasefire in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/trends/russia-ukraine-war">Russia-Ukraine war</a> and stressed that “echoes for peace must be heard” as Ambassador Usman Jadoon addressed a United Nations briefing.</p>
<p>“Peace in Ukraine is long overdue,” Ambassador Jadoon, deputy permanent representative of Pakistan to the United Nations, told the UN Council, which debated the situation in Ukraine on Friday after Russia <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676939">invaded</a> its neighbour in March 2022.</p>
<p>“The calls for ending this conflict should not be allowed to go unheard or masked by the continued drums of war,” he added, highlighting that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676939">the conflict</a> was now four years old.</p>
<p>Pakistan, as a consistent advocate for peace, has called for de-escalation and giving primacy to dialogue over fighting, said Ambassador Jadoon, who at that time was chairing the 15-member meeting.</p>
<p>“Only a sincere and meaningful dialogue which addresses mutual security concerns of all sides, is anchored in the principles of UN Charter and international law, and respects the relevant multilateral agreements can help lead to a peace, which is durable, just and long-lasting,” the Pakistani envoy added.</p>
<p>“Military solution and continued escalation are akin to pursuing a dead end,” he said, adding that continued attacks have only deepened the suffering of people affected by this conflict. “Sustainable peace demands de-escalation, ceasefire, and unwavering commitment to dialogue. “</p>
<p>Despite the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1872798">diplomatic efforts</a> at the start of this year, including Security Council Resolution 2774 and multiple limited ceasefire understandings, Ambassador Jadoon noted that tangible progress has remained elusive.</p>
<p>“While prisoner <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912920">exchanges</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914985">talks</a> in Istanbul offer a glimmer of hope, it is unfortunate that the ongoing violence, death, and destruction from relentless attacks have continued to cast a shadow over the nascent and fledgling peace efforts.”</p>
<p>In this regard, Ambassador Jadoon underscored the need for the protection of civilians, stating that the targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure under any pretext is unjustifiable.</p>
<p>“Sustainable peace demands de-escalation, ceasefire and unwavering commitment to dialogue,” he added.</p>
<p>Asserting that diplomacy was the only path forward, the Pakistani envoy welcomed the talks between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>“These [talks] must translate into tangible de-escalation, and steps such as prisoner swaps should catalyse broader political negotiations, aimed at ending this conflict.”</p>
<p>Pakistan, he added, stands ready to support all regional and international efforts that pave the way for a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict.</p>
<p>At the outset, a senior UN official told the Security Council that the daily <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1677316">barrage</a> of Russian missiles and drones against Ukrainian cities and towns has continued to intensify, with devastating consequences for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844618">civilian population</a>.</p>
<p>Miroslav Jenca, assistant secretary-general for Europe, Central Asia and the Americas in the Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Peace Operations, said that civilian casualties in Ukraine reached a three-year high in June, citing the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).</p>
<p>According to Ukrainian authorities, Russia has launched at least 5,183 long-range munitions against Ukraine in July, including a record number of 728 long-range drones on July 9.</p>
<p>Recalling that delegations from both countries recently met in Istanbul for the third time in 2025, the UN official urged that ongoing diplomatic contacts be sustained.</p>
<p>However, he urged that they be “reinforced by genuine political will to make tangible progress towards ending the current dangerous cycle of escalation as soon as possible”.</p>
<p>On her part, Joyce Msuya, assistant secretary-general for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, said, “There is no safe place left in Ukraine,” emphasising that “the use of explosive weapons in populated areas — including long-range missiles and drones — remains a key driver of civilian harm”.</p>
<p>Civilians in Ukraine continue to bear the heaviest burden, struggling to access food, water, power, and healthcare. “Nearly 13 million people need assistance, but limited funding means we can reach only a fraction of them,” she reported, adding: “For many displaced women and girls, safety remains out of reach.”</p>
<p>She also said that the continued use of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875267">anti-personnel mines</a> puts civilian lives and livelihoods at daily risk. She noted with alarm “the recent decree by the Ukrainian president announcing his country’s withdrawal” from the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, which prohibits the use of these munitions.</p></p>
