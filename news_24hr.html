            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930473/you-cannot-snatch-even-drop-of-pakistan-pm-shehbaz-warns-india-on-restricting-water-flow' target='_blank'><strong>‘You cannot snatch even drop of Pakistan,’ PM Shehbaz warns India on restricting water flow</strong></a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday warned India against any designs on the Indus River, saying that it could not snatch “even one drop” of water belonging to Pakistan amid tensions over the share of hydel resources in the region.</p>
<p>India in April held the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">abeyance</a> following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">termed</a> any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907454">considering</a> court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920611/pakistan-hails-hague-courts-supplemental-award-in-indus-waters-case-says-india-cant-sideline-arbitration-process">supplemental award</a> by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague in June held that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. India, in response, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920611/pakistan-hails-hague-courts-supplemental-award-in-indus-waters-case-says-india-cant-sideline-arbitration-process#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIndia%20has%20never,the%20ministry%20maintained.">did not recognise</a> the court or its decisions. A day ago, the PCA issued an “Award on Issues of General Interpretation of the IWT” in the Indus Waters case, stating that India must <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930219">generally “let flow” the waters</a> of the western rivers for Pakistan’s “unrestricted use”.</p>
<p>Addressing a ceremony in Islamabad today, the prime minister said: “I want to tell the enemy today that if you threaten to hold our water, then keep this in mind that you cannot snatch even one drop of Pakistan.”</p>
<p>The prime minister warned that if India attempted such an act, “you will be again taught such a lesson that you will be left holding your ears.”</p>
<p>“Our air force shot down six of their jets, among which four of them were Rafales,” PM Shehbaz added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The prime minister’s warning comes a day after former foreign minister and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari termed the IWT’s suspension an attack on the Indus Valley civilisation and said the nation would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930241/pakistan-wont-back-down-if-india-forces-war-declares-bilawal">not back down</a> if New Delhi forced it into war.</p>
<p>“If war is waged, then from the land of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai we will send a message to the Modi government that we do not retreat, we do not bow down, and if you dare think about launching an attack on the Indus River, then the people of every province of Pakistan will be ready to confront you,” he had said.</p>
<p>Similarly, while on a weekend visit to the United States, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930030/coas-says-india-wont-be-allowed-to-choke-indus-river">reportedly warned</a> that Pakistan would never allow India to choke the Indus River and would defend its water rights at all costs, even if the forces would have to destroy any controversial dam that India sought to build on it.</p>
<p>“We will wait for India to build a dam, and when they do so, we will destroy it,” he reportedly told members of the Pakistani-American community in Tampa, Florida. “The Indus River is not the Indians’ family property. We have no shortage of resources to undo the Indian designs to stop the river.”</p>

<p>The prime minister also conveyed his wishes for Independence Day to the representatives of the Christian, Hindu, Sikh and Parsi communities present at the event.</p>
<p>“The brothers and sisters of the minority communities also played an integral role in the movement for Pakistan,” he said, adding that not only did they play a role in the founding of the country, but also played a role in its development of the country.</p>
<p>Speaking on the May conflict between Pakistan and India, the prime minister said: “The way we smashed the enemy in this conflict, they will remember it for a lifetime.”</p>
<p>He called upon the youth to play a role in the development of Pakistan and announced that 100,000 laptops would be distributed amongst the high achievers all over the country.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday forecast widespread rain, wind, and thundershowers in most parts of the country in the coming days, with monsoon activity expected to intensify from August 17.</p>
<p>At least 312 people, including 142 children, have died and 740 others have been injured in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan since late June, according to <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndma.gov.pk/sitrepm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">updated daily data</a> from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).</p>
<p>The NDMA said the deluges, which began on June 26, have left a trail of devastation across the country. The dead include 113 men, 57 women and 142 children, while the injured include 243 children, 209 women and 288 men.</p>
<p>In its latest weather advisory issued today, the Met Office said monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea were continuously penetrating the upper parts of Pakistan, while moist currents from the Bay of Bengal were likely to strengthen midweek.</p>
<p>A westerly wave currently affecting the region was also expected to intensify from Aug 17.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, rain-wind/thundershower with scattered heavy falls was expected in Islamabad, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, upper Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Gilgit-Baltistan from Aug 14 -17.</p>
<p>The wet spell was expected to last from Aug 18-21 in many northern areas, including Neelum Valley, Muzaffarabad, Rawalakot, Poonch, and several districts of GB.</p>

<p>From Aug 18-21, KP would witness widespread rains, with heavy to very heavy falls in districts such as Dir, Swat, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Peshawar and Mardan.</p>
<p>Southern districts, including Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Waziristan, Tank, and Dera Ismail Khan, would also receive showers with occasional heavy spells.</p>
<p>Punjab, including Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Murree, Galliyat, Lahore, Gujranwala, Sialkot, and Faisalabad, was likely to experience heavy rains from Aug 18-21, with scattered activity in southern districts.</p>
<p>Parts of Balochistan, including Barkhan, Zhob, Khuzdar, Gwadar, and Panjgur, as well as several Sindh districts, including Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Larkana, and Tharparkar, were also expected to receive showers between Aug 18-22.</p>
<p>The PMD warned that heavy rains may generate flash floods in local streams and nullahs of KP, Murree, Galliyat, northeast Punjab and AJK from Aug 15-21, and hill torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan and eastern Balochistan from Aug 18-21.</p>
<p>Urban flooding was also expected in low-lying areas of Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Peshawar, and Nowshera during the same period.</p>
<p>Landslides and mudslides might disrupt roads in hilly areas of KP, GB, Murree, Galliyat, and AJK, while heavy falls, windstorms, and lightning may damage weak structures such as rooftops, walls of mudhouses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels.</p>
<p>The public, travellers and tourists were advised to avoid unnecessary travel to vulnerable areas and remain updated about the latest weather conditions.</p>
<p>All relevant authorities were urged to stay on high alert to prevent any untoward incidents.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Tuesday issued a stay order for the appointments of new opposition leaders in the National Assembly and the Senate following the disqualification and removal of PTI’s Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz from their respective roles.</p>
<p>On August 5, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928901">disqualified</a> Ayub and Faraz, along with other opposition MNAs and MPAs, following their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">convictions</a> in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927964/pti-opposition-leaders-over-100-others-sentenced-for-may-9-riots#:~:text=judgements%20in%20three%20separate%20cases">three</a> cases related to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9, 2023 riots</a>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, on August 8, both leaders were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929551">removed</a> from their posts through notifications issued by the NA and Senate secretariats.</p>
<p>A division bench comprising Justices Arshad Ali and Dr Khurshid Iqbal took up separate petitions filed earlier today by Ayub and Faraz against the denotification of their parliamentary roles.</p>
<p>PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan appeared as the counsel for both petitioners.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The bench issued notices to the ECP and other respondents, directing them to halt the appointments for the opposition leader in both houses of the parliament, which are currently vacant.</p>
<p>The court adjourned the hearing till August 15 (Friday), seeking replies from the respondents.</p>
<p>During the hearing, Gohar informed the bench of the details of recent developments. “When an MNA becomes the opposition leader, then the ECP’s role does not remain anymore,” he asserted.</p>
<p>“May 9 was an unfortunate incident, which should not have happened,” the PTI leader said. He contended that the ECP recently also disqualified <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927477/haste-raises-eyebrows-as-ecp-disqualifies-another-pti-lawmaker">MNA Abdul Latif</a> from the NA-1 by “citing the wrong reference of the [2012] <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1013436/sc-says-it-cannot-order-musharrafs-trial-for-treason#:~:text=2012%20Azhar%20Siddiq%20case">Azhar Siddique case</a>”.</p>
<p>“We won 180 seats, entered the parliament with 90 seats, and are now left with 23,” the PTI lawyer lamented.</p>
<p>“Now the government wants to bring another party’s opposition leader,” Gohar claimed, requesting the court to issue directives to stop any further action against Ayub and Faraz.</p>
<p>A PHC bench comprising Justice Ali and Justice Farah Jamshed had also barred the ECP from taking any action against Ayub and Faraz on August 6, but to no avail since the order came a day after their disqualification.</p>
<p>The court had also granted the two leaders, as well as Zartaj Gul, protective bail till August 20.</p>

<p>Speaking to the media outside the PHC, Gohar called for the “season of disqualifications” to come to an end.</p>
<p>“These disqualifications are not the solution to any issue,” the PTI leader emphasised. “I will request everyone to come to their senses now.”</p>
<p>Refuting reports of friction within the party leadership, he asserted: “There is no weakness in our team; we are being oppressed.”</p>
<p>Gohar also reaffirmed the PTI’s intention to stage gatherings across the country on August 14 to “celebrate Independence Day and raise voice” for ex-premier Imran Khan’s release, despite the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930003">government’s call</a> to reschedule the protests.</p>

<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTIofficial/status/1953459018187354362" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> issued by the PTI and attributed to Imran has termed August 14 as the “next important day” of the party’s fresh <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928760/pti-to-kick-off-free-imran-movement-today">protest movement</a>.</p>
<p>However, Gohar also acknowledged the need for a dialogue to solve the ongoing political crisis.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media outside the PHC, Ayub highlighted “rising” inflation in the country. “These people (government) are enjoying themselves by burdening the people of Pakistan,” he said.</p>
<p>He alleged: “There has been a scandal of more than Rs500 billion in the petroleum sector. There was another scandal worth Rs2,000bn which has come to light.”</p>

<p>On <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9, 2023</a>, PTI supporters, protesting party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, following which thousands were arrested.</p>
<p>PTI parliamentarians convicted in May 9 cases would face automatic disqualification under Article 63(1)(g) of the Constitution, which bars members convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude or corrupt practices.</p>
<p>A Faisalabad anti-terrorism court on July 31 had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">senten­ced</a> over PTI 100 leaders and workers to jail terms of up to 10 years in connection with the riots. Ayub, Faraz, PTI’s Zartaj Gul and Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza were among the key opposition leaders handed rigorous imprisonment.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>They were convicted under sections 109 (punishment for abetment) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) in a case registered at Ghulam Muhammadabad police station.</p>
<p>In another case registered at the same police station, 60 out of 67 accused were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927964/pti-opposition-leaders-over-100-others-sentenced-for-may-9-riots">convicted</a>, while seven were acquitted.</p>
<p>In the case filed at the Civil Lines police station, 107 out of 108 accused were sentenced to 10 years in prison and one person was handed a three-year jail term, while 77 were acquitted.</p>
<p>Former information minister Fawad Chaudhry, MNA Zain Qureshi (son of PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi), MPA Khayal Ahmad Kastro and Faizullah Kamuka were acquitted in all three cases.</p>
<p>The judge had issued arrest warrants for those convicted who were not present in court and had directed the police to arrest all convicts and bring them before the court for imprisonment.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Separately, on July 23, a Lahore ATC had handed Yasmin Rashid, Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed and other PTI leaders 10-year rigorous imprisonment in a case related to vandalism at <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925804/atc-hears-final-arguments-in-sherpao-bridge-violence-case">Sherpao Bridge</a>. However, Qureshi and five others were acquitted.</p>
<p>The same day, a Sargodha ATC had sentenced dozens of PTI leaders, including then-Punjab Assembly opposition leader Malik Ahmed Khan Bhachar, in another May 9 riots case registered at the Musakhel police station.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880141">December 21</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881338">Dec 26</a> last year, a military court sentenced 85 civilians, including ex-premier Imran Khan’s nephew Hassaan Niazi, to up to 10 years for their involvement in the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>However, days later, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884089">mercy petitions</a> of 19 accused were later accepted on humanitarian grounds, while 48 other pleas had been processed to Courts of Appeal.</p>

<p>Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar said, “Issues of disqualifications, convictions can only be resolved by sitting down for talks, not by waving documents in the air.”</p>
<p>Speaking in the Senate while addressing the opposition, Tarar said, “I will not go into debate on punishments, but on May 9, people saw Jinnah house burning.”</p>
<p>He added that if anyone commits a crime, there is a legal course which must be followed, and within that course, there are legal remedies like interim relief. “This is how the judicial system works,” he said.</p>
<p>He also spoke about PTI MNA Jamshed Dasti was provided <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927764">relief</a> by the Lahore High Court after his disqualification.</p></p>
