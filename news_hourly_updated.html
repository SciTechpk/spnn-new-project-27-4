                <h2>Chinese leadership lauds Pakistan‚Äôs role in regional peace during meeting with COAS Munir</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Chinese leadership has lauded the role of the Pakistan Army and hailed it as a ‚Äúcornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor‚Äù for peace in the region, the military‚Äôs media affairs wing said on Friday.</p>
<p>Pakistan and China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/china-says-it-backs-pakistan-in-defending-sovereignty">share</a> a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation, and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors, including trade, energy, infrastructure, and defence collaboration, with initiatives like the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879166">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.</p>
<p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir is currently on an official visit to China. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement today that he held meetings with senior Chinese political and military leadership in Beijing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúChinese military leadership reiterated full confidence in the strength of the bilateral defence partnership and acknowledged Pakistan‚Äôs pivotal role in promoting regional peace,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>COAS Munir called on Chinese Vice President Han Zheng and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the statement read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDiscussions focused on the evolving regional and global political landscape, connectivity initiatives under the CPEC, and the need for coordinated responses to shared geopolitical challenges,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBoth sides expressed satisfaction over the depth of bilateral engagement and reiterated their shared commitment to sovereign equality, multilateral cooperation, and long-term regional stability.‚Äù</p>
<p>The statement continued that the ‚ÄúChinese leadership lauded the Pakistan Armed Forces as a cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor to peace in South Asia‚Äù.</p>

<p>The military engagement between both sides included ‚Äúcomprehensive exchanges on defence and security cooperation, including counterterrorism collaboration, joint training, defence modernisation, and enhanced institutional linkages‚Äù, THE ISPR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEmphasis was placed on improving operational interoperability and strategic coordination to confront hybrid and transnational threats,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir held meetings with various Chinese military leaders, the statement read, adding, ‚ÄúUpon arrival at the  People‚Äôs Liberation Army Headquarters, the COAS was presented with a guard of honour, symbolising the longstanding camaraderie between the two armed forces.‚Äù</p>
<p>The COAS appreciated China‚Äôs ‚Äúconsistent support‚Äù and reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to ‚Äúfurther expanding military-to-military cooperation across all domains‚Äù, the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>The statement said that the visit ‚Äúreflects the growing depth of politico-military ties between the two brotherly nations and underscores their shared resolve to advance regional security through sustained high-level dialogue and engagements‚Äù.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926296/pakistan-signs-maritime-mou-with-chinese-shipping-giant-to-boost-collaboration">signed</a> a memorandum of understanding with Chinese shipping giant, Shandong Xinxu Group, in a move that is set to bring about a ‚Äúmajor transformation‚Äù in the shipping sector.</p>

                <h2>Govt urges social media firms to block accounts run by terrorist groups</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The government on Friday called on global social media organisations to immediately block the accounts of proscribed terrorist groups disseminating propaganda on their platforms.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926051/minister-talal-chaudhry-warns-public-of-ttp-operating-whatsapp-channels-to-spread-hate-harmful-narrative">highlighted</a> how a terrorist group was using WhatsApp channels to ‚Äúdisseminate hateful content and harmful narratives‚Äù, urging the platform and the global community to help Pakistan combat terrorism.</p>
<p>Addressing a joint press conference today in Islamabad alongside Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik, Chaudhry said: ‚ÄúI want to request social media operators and platforms to cooperate with us on the blockage and removal of accounts, taking measures to stop mirror accounts and to share information of account holders who are operating these accounts.‚Äù</p>
<p>Chaudhry said terrorist groups and individuals, including those banned in the United States, the United Kingdom and sanctioned by the United Nations, were operating accounts on social media platforms such as X, Facebook and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>He said the National Action Plan (NAP) ‚Äî formed in 2014 to take action against terrorists through a concerted national effort ‚Äî requires taking action against those spreading propaganda on media and social media.</p>
<p>The agenda items of NAP include a ban on the glorification of terrorists and terrorist organisations through print and electronic media, and measures against the abuse of the internet and social media for terrorism.</p>
<p>He requested social media firms to block these groups; use artificial intelligence (AI) to prevent ‚Äúmirror accounts‚Äù; and share information about their operators. He urged creating auto-detect and auto-block algorithms against such accounts.</p>
<p>Barrister Malik said authorities had unearthed 481 accounts associated with proscribed terrorist groups on various platforms and reported them to social media organisations.</p>
<p>He urged social media firms to share information about account holders to ‚Äúamplify counterterrorism operations in dealing with this newer threat‚Äù.</p>
<p>He also requested them to implement strict measures, which include AI methods to discover more accounts. He invited them to establish their presence in the country and sought enhanced cooperation in the digital world.</p>
<p>Malik said Pakistan was at the forefront and had rendered sacrifices in the war against terrorism, but a new trend had surfaced on social media apps such as X, Facebook, Instagram and Telegram.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will welcome social media platforms to set up offices in Pakistan for better coordination,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe seek coordination between social media platforms and our law enforcement agencies on social issues and the presence of terrorist organisations on social media.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said terror groups such as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, Islamic State Khorasan Province, Balochistan Liberation Army and Balochistan Liberation Front had an active presence on social media platforms, noting they have been banned by the US and the UK as well.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan remains steadfast and is committed to our resolve to combat terrorism. Apart from operating on the ground, we have seen new trends in the digital realm,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He said the state minister for interior also highlighted how terrorist groups were ‚Äúworking on social media, recruiting and actively disseminating propaganda‚Äù through WhatsApp and other platforms.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese social accounts significantly enhance their social media presence, whether it through their real names of pseudonyms. It poses a threat to our nation, citizens and the rest of the world.‚Äù</p></p>
