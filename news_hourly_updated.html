‚Ä¢ FO slams Modi‚Äôs allegations<br />
‚Ä¢ UNSC condemns school bus attack</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistani authorities on Friday said they would continue with intelligence-based operations (IBOs) to combat terrorism in Balochistan, instead of launching a large-scale kinetic military campaign at this stage.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe intelligence-based operations would continue,‚Äù said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, director general of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), during a joint press briefing with Federal Interior Secretary Khurram Agha near the military headquarters in neighbouring garrison city of Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>The joint appearance of military and civilian officials underscored the government‚Äôs unified approach to counterterrorism, especially in the wake of escalating regional tensions with India and aggravating security situation in Balochistan.</p>
<p>Their remarks come days after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912542/pm-vows-strong-action-against-perpetrators-after-school-bus-blast-in-khuzdar">suicide attack</a> in Khuzdar targeted a school bus carrying children of military personnel, in which eight people, including six children, were martyred and dozens others were injured. Two more students Haider, 13, and Malika, 12, succumbed to their injuries, bringing the death toll to eight.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Pakistan‚Äôs military had accused India of ‚Äúplanning and orchestrating‚Äù the att¬≠ack using its terrorism proxies in the restive province.</p>
<p>Condemning the attack, Interior Secretary Agha said, ‚ÄúThe attack on school bus in Khuzdar was an attack on our values, our education system and the very fabric of our society.‚Äù He added that initial investigations indicated the assault was orchestrated by India-backed terrorist operating as ‚Äú<em>Fitna al Hindustan</em>‚Äù (Indian mischief).</p>
<p>The term ‚Äò<em>Fitna al Hindu¬≠stan</em>‚Äô is a new phrase coined by Pakistan‚Äôs military, aimed at framing India‚Äôs alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>
<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry emphasised that terrorism in Balochistan was being tackled ‚Äúrationally‚Äù, noting that Pakistan had developed advanced counterterrorism techniques through decades of experience.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúIntelligence-based operations are very effective way of dealing with terrorists. We are hunting them down and eliminating them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe number of terrorists killed in these intelligence-based operations are much higher as compared to the large-scale operations.‚Äù</p>
<p>This emphasis on intelligence-based operations highlights the government‚Äôs preference for targeted strikes to minimise collateral damage, possibly in response to past criticisms of heavy-handed military campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Soft targets</strong></p>
<p>The military spokesman said the military is currently conducting nearly 150 IBOs on a daily basis without disrupting civilian life. ‚ÄúThe terrorist groups after suffering heavily at the hands of law-enforcement agencies are now attacking soft targets. This shows the effectiveness of our operations,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Interior Secretary Agha echoed the approach, noting that a broader military campaign akin to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1225922">Operation Zarb-i-Azb</a> could be launched if necessary, but only after all preparatory steps are completed. ‚ÄúIf need be, there can be a major operation like Zarb-i-Azb but that would be at a later stage. Currently, all operations are continuing,‚Äù Agha said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The reference to Zarb-i-Azb, a 2014-17 operation that significantly reduced militancy in the country, signals the government‚Äôs readiness to escalate if IBOs do not bring the problem of terrorism under control, but also its caution to avoid destabilising Balochistan further.</p>
<p>He added that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879059">National Action Plan</a> (NAP) was being ‚Äúreinvigorated‚Äù to support future counterterrorism efforts. ‚ÄúAll facets of the national action plan are being reinvigorated so that all domains including social, economic, legal, counterterrorism, information and political are fully functional,‚Äù he stated. ‚ÄúSo that when we go into a big operation‚Ä¶ all facets are in place.‚Äù</p>
<p>The NAP, introduced in 2014 after the Peshawar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/army-public-school-10-years/">Army Public School attack</a>, is a comprehensive counterterrorism framework. Its reinvigoration suggests a holistic approach to address not just security but also socio-economic drivers of unrest in Balochistan.</p>
<p><strong>Proxies activated</strong></p>
<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry highlighted how synchronised attacks during the night of May 9 and 10 ‚Äî involving 33 terrorist incidents in Balochistan ‚Äî demonstrated collaboration between India and proxy groups in Balochistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt a time when India was firing projectiles and missiles into Pakistan, it had also activated these proxies,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis synchronisation of attacks proved the collaboration between <em>Fitna al Hindustan</em> and India.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He attributed India‚Äôs alleged targeting of Balochistan to Pakistan‚Äôs recent economic advancements in the province. ‚ÄúBalochistan has reached its take-off phase with improvements in the socio-economic sector‚Ä¶ the inauguration of the airport in Gwadar and expansion of road network,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBalochistan‚Äôs terrorism issue is being addressed rationally where military approach is one aspect. The problem is being addressed synergetically by all elements of national power.‚Äù</p>
<p>This holistic approach reflects the recognition that military solutions alone cannot resolve Balochistan‚Äôs complex issues</p>
<p>Agha reiterated the government‚Äôs readiness and resolve: ‚ÄúThe state has the wherewithal and will to dismantle these networks and bring their handlers and perpetrators of these acts of terrorism to justice. Such actions will have consequences‚Ä¶ Our resolve is firm and response will be decisive.‚Äù</p>
<p>Touching on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">recent tensions</a> with India, the DG ISPR warned of dire consequences if provocations continue. ‚ÄúIndia is using terrorism as a tool against Pakistan through <em>Fitna al Hindustan</em> and <em>Fitna al Khawarij</em>,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPakistan is on the other hand maintaining peace as a rational actor through the resolve of the people and the capabilities of the armed forces.‚Äù</p>
<p>He further condemned India‚Äôs ‚Äúarrogant political mindset,‚Äù citing its refusal to address the Kashmir dispute and alleged suppression of minorities as the reasons behind India becoming a source of instability in the region.</p>
<p><strong>FO rejects allegations</strong></p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1912791">categorically rejected</a> the ‚Äúbaseless, provocative, and irresponsible‚Äù allegations made by the Indian prime minister during a recent public address in Rajasthan, asserting that such statements clearly aimed at stoking regional tensions for narrow political gains, <em>APP</em> adds.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe remarks, replete with distortions, misrepresentations, and inflammatory rhetoric, are clearly aimed at stoking regional tensions for narrow political gains. Such statements not only reflect a deliberate attempt to mislead the public but also violate the norms of responsible statecraft,‚Äù Foreign Office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He said that resorting to threats and boasting about military action against a sovereign nation was a grave breach of the UN Charter and established principles of international law and that this dangerous approach also undermined regional peace and stability.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said that Pakistan remained a consistent and proactive partner in the global fight against terrorism and any insinuation seeking to associate Pakistan with acts of terrorism was factually incorrect and patently misleading. He said it was a tactic often employed to divert attention from India‚Äôs own internal challenges, as well as its repressive policies in India-held Kashmir.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs attempts to mask its serious human rights violations are well-documented and well-recognised by the international community. The plight of the Kashmiri people and their just struggle for self-determination cannot be obscured by aggressive rhetoric and political deflection,‚Äù he remarked.</p>
<p>He urged the Indian leadership to exercise responsibility and restraint as escalatory statements and belligerent posturing serve no purpose other than exacerbating tensions.</p>
<p><strong>UNSC condemns Khuzdar attack</strong></p>
<p>The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has strongly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912792">condemned</a> the terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar, Balochistan, calling it a heinous and cowardly act that claimed the lives of at least six people, including four children, and left more than 50 others injured.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/3  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In an official <a class="link--external" href="https://press.un.org/en/2025/sc16069.doc.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press statement</a>, the Council members expressed profound sorrow over the attack, which occurred on May 21, and extended heartfelt condolences to the victims‚Äô families and to the government.</p>
<p>The UNSC members expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the government and the people of Pakistan, and they wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured, the statement read.</p>

‚Ä¢ President meets IMF delegation, praises it for supporting Islamabad‚Äôs economic stability</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: The government on Friday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909569">postponed</a> the announcement of the federal budget 2025-26 by more than a week to June 10 amid inconclusive discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on some of the critical fiscal measures and to avoid the Eid break during the budget session.</p>
<p>Informed sources said the visiting IMF staff mission had multiple rounds of discussion on Friday, including a wrap-up session with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb.</p>
<p>The minister‚Äôs adviser, Khurram Schehzad, confirmed that the federal budget for the next year will be presented on June 10, and the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25 will be released on June 9. Earlier, the budget announcement was set for June 2.</p>

<p>Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal told <em>Dawn</em> that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912609">discussions with the IMF</a> had just concluded, and it was thought that the budget announcement should be made soon after <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eid holidays</a> to ensure continuity of the budget session.</p>
<p>Sources said there was also a view that it would be difficult for the government to recollect a sufficient number of members of parliament from their hometowns for the budget debate if the budget was announced before Eid which is likely to fall on June 7.</p>
<p>Therefore, the budget announcement would be immediately followed by a comprehensive debate in the house and enable standing committees on finance to read through budget proposals and give their input before its passage by the two houses, well before June 30.</p>
<p>Also, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was leaving for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912856">whirlwind visit</a> to Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Iran, and some other friendly countries in Central Asia and the Middle East, and would be unable to personally indulge in budgetary settings. He would be back from abroad on May 29.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the meeting of the Annual Plan Coordination Committee (APCC) for finalisation of federal and provincial development plans set for Monday (May 26) has also been postponed to a fresh date to be set later.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Sources said the recent sudden announcement of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911530">national tariff policy</a> envisaging a drastic cut in customs tariffs from 19 to 9.5 per cent on raw materials and semi-finished items for a few industries, besides the removal of additional customs duties, had also created a lot of concern among the relevant industrial sector.</p>
<p>The five-year tariff policy approved for inclusion in budget inclusion in the budget this year by the prime minister himself compelled the powerful industries to launch a counter campaign.</p>
<p>Coupled with this, the defence allocations for next year had a reasonable budgetary impact, which could not be settled with the IMF staff before the wrap-up meeting with the finance minister, although discussions between FBR‚Äôs top brass and the staff mission continued until evening.</p>
<p>Sources said the engagements with the IMF would now continue virtually over the next week till finalisation of the defence budget, and as a result, the revenue side of the equation and other estimates under the budget, including the federal public sector development programme that was now estimated at Rs1tr. Staff-level discussions on the next budget began on May 14.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>Sources said there is no plan the to increase the rate of petroleum levy in the near future, except for a separate imposition of carbon levy on a number of items, starting with about Rs3 per litre and going up to Rs5 in second year to meet a requirement of Climate Resilience Support Fund (RSF).</p>
<p>The sources said the relief measures for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893953">salaried class</a>, real estate, and expenditure control measures had been discussed with the IMF staff, but this would remain subject to an alternative resource envelope to be presented by the authorities, as fiscal consolidation would remain one of the central themes of the next year‚Äôs budget.</p>
<p><strong>India‚Äôs objections</strong></p>
<p>As the talks with IMF staff concluded, the Fund‚Äôs spokesperson at its headquarters in Washington rubbished <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909885">Indian concerns</a> about recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900322">approval</a> by its executive board of $1.4bn in additional RSF support besides disbursement of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910966">$1bn second tranche</a> of the $7bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF).</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe [IMF executive] board approved the disbursement after finding that Pakistan had met all performance targets and made progress on structural reforms‚Äù, said IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack at a regular <a class="link--external" href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2025/05/22/tr-05222025-com-regular-press-briefing-may-22-2025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news briefing</a>, adding that the loan programme for Islamabad was only for stabilisation of foreign exchange reserves and not related to the budget financing.</p>

<p>An Indian journalist asked the spokesperson about the recent bailout package by the IMF to Pakistan, saying ‚Äúthe Indian government has expressed a lot of displeasure with Pakistan planning to use this package to build ‚Äî rebuild ‚Äî areas that allegedly support cross-border terrorism.‚Äù</p>
<p>Another journalist asked about the implications of the escalation between Pakistan and India on both economies, while another questioned what ‚Äúsafeguards the IMF has that its funds won‚Äôt be used for military or in support of military actions.‚Äù.</p>
<p>In response to the questions, Ms Kozack said the IMF‚Äôs Executive Board approved Pakistan‚Äôs EFF programme in September of 2024.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe first review at that time was planned for the first quarter of 2025. And consistent with that timeline, on March 25, 2025, the IMF Staff and the Pakistani authorities reached a staff-level agreement on the first review for the EFF,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>She added that the agreement was then presented to the IMF‚Äôs executive board, which completed the review on May 9. ‚ÄúAs a result of the completion of that review, Pakistan received the disbursement at that time,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>Ms Kozack explained that the global money lender had a standard procedure in place under its programmes, which allowed its executive board to conduct periodic reviews of lending programs to assess countries‚Äô progress. The board, she said, particularly looked at whether the programme was on track, whether the conditions under the programme were met, and whether any policy changes were needed to bring the programme back on track.</p>
<p>She then said that Pakistan‚Äôs programme was approved after the country successfully met all of the required targets. Regarding the question on safeguards, she clarified that IMF financing was provided to members for the purpose of resolving balance of payments problems, therefore, in the case of Pakistan, all the disbursements received under the EFF were allocated to the reserves of the central bank.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo, those disbursements are at the central bank, and under the programme, those resources are not part of budget financing. They are not transferred to the government to support the budget,‚Äù she said.</p>
