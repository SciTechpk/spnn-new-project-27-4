                <h2>At least 18 reported missing in Swat River flash floods; 8 bodies found</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least 18 people went missing after being swept away in flash floods triggered by heavy rains in the Swat River, officials said, adding that eight of them have been killed while a search operation to locate the remaining people was underway.</p>
<p>The floods in the district have inundated several areas, with reports of dozens stranded at different locations, according to an initial report by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122.</p>
<p>KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah confirmed that out of the 18 missing individuals, the bodies of eight have been found, while three of them have been rescued.</p>
<p>The incident prompted the provincial government to immediately launch a rescue operation, the statement said, adding, ‚ÄúRescue operations are currently being conducted at eight different locations in Swat.‚Äù</p>
<p>The statement further said, ‚ÄúA total of 75 people were trapped at different places along the Swat River on the bypass road,‚Äù adding that 58 of them had been rescued.</p>
<p>The provincial government has formed a committee to inquire about the matter, it added.</p>

<p>According to the initial report by KP Rescue 1122, search and rescue operations were underway for the remaining bodies in several areas.</p>
<p>Three bodies have been recovered from Ingaroderai, while one body was also recovered from Ghalegy, where seven people were stranded and rescue operations are still underway.</p>
<p>At least 120 Rescue 1122 personnel have been deployed in rescue operations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMore than 22 people were trapped in the water in Imam Dhirai, who were rescued safely by the team of Rescue Station 33,‚Äù the report stated, adding that the search operation of Rescue Station 44 was ongoing.</p>
<p>Seven people are also reported to be trapped in Manyar, with Rescue Stations 44 and 55 working jointly in rescue activities.</p>
<p>One person was trapped at Panjigram village, where a rescue operation was underway, while at least 20 to 30 people have been rescued from Bara Bamakhela, the report said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll Rescue 1122 teams are present on site and rescue operations are in full swing,‚Äù the report said.</p>
<p>A flood alert has been issued by the Charsadda Deputy Commissioner Qaiser Khan, directing relevant staff to be on high alert following the floods in Swat.</p>
<p>A notice from the DC‚Äôs office said the ‚Äúdischarge at Khwazakela in River Swat has increased to 77,782 cusecs, categorised as a very high flood.‚Äù</p>
<p>DC Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em> that rescue teams had been deployed to the banks of the River Kabul and River Swat.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnnouncements were made via mosque loudspeakers to inform the public about the dangers of floodwater,‚Äù the DC said, adding that officials were instructing people to move to safer places.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are keeping an eye on the Munda headworks; until 3pm, the flow was normal.‚Äù</p>

<p>Meanwhile, former climate change minister and PPP Senator Sherry Rehman has said that the continued ‚Äúsleepwalk‚Äù on climate stress was triggering such incidents.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe need to understand that this and other disasters are the deadly impact of super heavy monsoons in Swat, all triggered by climate stress, and it is not just one area,‚Äù she added.</p>
<p>Rehman also said that the district and provincial administration had been alerted, but ‚Äúearly warning systems are being ignored by the general public in KP‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan needs to understand that such hazards are triggered by global warming and climate change ‚Ä¶ So please stop calling it a natural disaster or a random flash flood that is disconnected from human actions or responsibility.‚Äù</p>

<p>The KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued a flood alert after water discharge levels at Khwazakhela in the Swat River surged to 77,782 cusecs, categorising it as a very high flood situation due to the ongoing heavy rainfall in the region.</p>
<p>In an official communication addressed to the Deputy Commissioners of Peshawar, Charsadda, and Nowshera, the PDMA advised all concerned authorities to take urgent precautionary measures to prevent any loss of life, damage to infrastructure, crops and livestock.</p>
<p>The PDMA directed local administrations to immediately identify vulnerable points and at-risk communities and put in place effective safety and mitigation measures. It emphasised maintaining a heightened state of alert, with constant monitoring of the evolving flood situation to ensure a timely response.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122, Civil Defence, and all other emergency services have been instructed to stay on high alert, particularly in low-lying and high-risk areas.</p>
<p>Communities living along the banks of Kabul River and its tributaries are being sensitised to the expected rise in water levels.</p>
<p>Local authorities have been advised to ensure the timely evacuation of at-risk populations in flood-prone areas per existing evacuation plans and to ensure the availability of shelter, food, and medical supplies in designated camps.</p>
<p>Farmers and cattle herders have been warned to move their livestock to safer locations away from low-lying riverbanks, while the general public is urged to avoid unnecessary travel or vehicle movement in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>The PDMA also directed concerned departments to remain ready for road clearance operations in case of blockages or waterlogging, and to pre-position emergency equipment at critical locations.</p>
<p>The Provincial Emergency Operations Centre (PEOC) at PDMA remains active 24/7 and can be reached via helpline 1700 for any assistance or guidance.</p>

                <h2>SC dismisses PTI petitions, making party ineligible for reserved seats</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Supreme Court‚Äôs Constitutional Bench on Friday dismissed the petitions filed by the PTI in the reserved seats case, declaring that the party will not be eligible for them in the national and provincial assemblies.</p>
<p>An 11-member bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, resumed the hearing today. However, Justice Salahuddin Panhwar recused himself. The bench previously had 13 members, but  Ayesha A. Malik and  Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had declared the applications  [inadmissible][11] and were not part of the subsequent proceedings, with the CB head judge noting they had stepped back voluntarily.</p>
<p>Among the remaining 10 members, the review petitions were accepted by a majority of seven judges, including Justices Aminuddin Khan, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhter Afghan, Shahid Bilal Hassan, Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi. The decision of the Peshawar High Court (PHC) was upheld, while the apex court‚Äôs July 2024 judgment was set aside. Accordingly, the PTI‚Äôs petitions were dismissed, making the party ineligible for the 39 reserved seats.</p>
<p>The short order of today‚Äôs verdict, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, noted that Justice Salahuddin Panhwar recused himself, so the bench was reconstituted with all the available members of the Constitutional Bench.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInitially, this Constitutional Bench was constituted for the hearing of the aforesaid review petitions by 13 honourable Judges of this Court, but two of them ‚Äî Justice Ayesha A Malik and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi ‚Äî on the first date of hearing dismissed all the review petitions,‚Äù the order read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor detailed reasons to be recorded later, by majority of seven, all civil review petitions are allowed and the impugned majority judgment dated July 12, 2024, is set aside,‚Äù the order read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs a consequence thereof, Civil Appeals number 333 of 2024 and 334 of 2024 filed by the SIC are dismissed and the judgment rendered by the Peshawar High Court is restored.‚Äù</p>
<p>Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail partly allowed the review petitions and maintained his original order with regard to 39 seats, but reviewed the majority judgment to the extent of the remaining 41 seats.</p>
<p>The court instructed the Election Commission of Pakistan to examine and consider the nomination and declaration appers, as well as any other relevant documents, of all 80 returned candidates ‚Äúby means of de novo exercise with regard to their affiliation and take appropriate decision in accordance with law and applicable rules for allocation of reserve seats‚Äù.</p>
<p>The ECP has 15 days from receiving the copy of the short order to carry out the court‚Äôs instructions.</p>

<p>Reacting to the verdict in a post on X, the PTI termed the decision ‚Äúthe funeral of constitutional, judicial traditions, and justice.‚Äù</p>

<p>PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Khan said he was disappointed by the ‚Äúinjustice and the violation of the Constitution.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm disappointed. This is a huge injustice. For the PTI, it seems that the shadow of Qazi Faez Esa still lurks in the Supreme Court,‚Äù he said while speaking to <em>Geo News.</em></p>
<p>‚ÄúThe right that has been snatched from us is a huge injustice. The framers of the Constitution could not have imagined that a party would get more seats than it won.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said the PTI deserved to receive 78 reserved seats, including 66 for women and 11 for non-Muslims. ‚ÄúThey belong to the PTI and it is their right,‚Äù he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Gohar went on to say that the PTI contested elections from across the country and joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) as per the affidavit by the Election Commission of Pakistan (SIC) for an independent candidate to join a political party.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is no further legal recourse, but we will protest the decision in the assemblies and all forums against this injustice,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>PTI leader Salman Akram Raja also criticised the verdict in a post on X, stating that the party contested the election and received votes ‚Äúonly because we were contesting under Imran Khan‚Äôs banner‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo deny the existence of PTI is to deny the people their voice,‚Äù he wrote.</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#phc-2024-decision" id="phc-2024-decision" title="Permalink"></a>PHC 2024 decision</h2>
<p>In March 2024, the PHC had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1821427">dismissed</a> the SIC‚Äôs petition challenging the ECP‚Äôs decision to reject the party allocation of reserved women and minority seats.</p>
<p>In a 4-1 verdict, the electoral watchdog ruled that the SIC was not entitled to claim quota for reserved seats ‚Äúdue to having non-curable legal defects and violation of a mandatory provision of submission of party list for reserved seats, which is the requirement of law‚Äù.</p>
<p>The SIC ‚Äî joined by PTI-backed independents who won the elections sans their electoral symbol ‚Äî had filed the petition through its chairman, Sahibzada Muhammad Hamid Raza, seeking directives of the court for the ECP to allocate reserved seats to the council based on their strength in the national and provincial assemblies.</p>
<p>The commission had also decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the PML-N and the PPP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1819514/pml-n-gets-lucky-as-reserved-seats-doled-out">becoming major beneficiaries</a>. The decision was challenged by the PTI in the top court.</p>
<p>On July 13, the apex court, in a unique majority <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">verdict</a>, declared the PTI eligible to receive reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the national and provincial assemblies, giving it a new lease of life in the legislature by declaring it to be a parliamentary party.</p>
<p>However, the ruling was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1868333">not implemented</a> by the National Assembly, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had raised some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859716">objections</a>. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1846084">PML-N</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847508/ppp-takes-cue-from-pml-n-files-review-petition-on-sc-reserved-seats-verdict">PPP</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850678#:~:text=ECP%20files%20review%20plea">ECP</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#todays-hearing" id="todays-hearing" title="Permalink"></a>Today‚Äôs hearing</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, as the Supreme Court resumed hearing the review petitions in the reserved seats case, Justice Panhwar recused himself from the bench after SIC counsel Hamid Khan raised an objection.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHamid Khan objected to judges who joined the Supreme Court after the 26th Amendment being part of the bench,‚Äù Justice Panhwar said, adding that he himself was among those judges.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPublic trust in the judiciary is crucial,‚Äù he remarked. ‚ÄúIt is important that no party questions the composition of the bench. Given these objections, I cannot remain part of this bench.‚Äù</p>
<p>Hamid responded by saying he appreciated the recusal, prompting a stern exchange. Justice Aminuddin remarked, ‚ÄúThere is no need for appreciation. This is the result of your conduct.‚Äù</p>
<p>Justice Mazahir Ali Akbar Naqvi added, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre listening to you out of respect. Otherwise, we were not bound to do so. Don‚Äôt misuse the opportunity you‚Äôve been given.‚Äù</p>
<p>Following Justice Panhwar‚Äôs withdrawal, SIC‚Äôs counsel raised a fresh objection ‚Äî this time to the constitution of the 10-member bench itself.</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail questioned the legal basis for the objection, asserting that the 10-member bench would continue hearing the case.</p>
<p>When asked to clarify, Hamid stated, ‚ÄúI object to a 12-member bench reviewing the decision of a 13-member bench.‚Äù</p>
