            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: With up to 14 per cent reduction in regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) prices notified for the current month, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1904896">electricity rates</a> for Karachi and petroleum prices across the country are expected to come down in coming days.</p>
<p>With a reduction of Rs3 to Rs7 per litre in major oil products estimated for the next fortnight, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) on Tuesday notified a 14pc reduction in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904310">price of RLNG</a> on Tuesday for sales at the transmission stage by the two Sui gas companies for the current month.</p>
<p>The Karachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL), which serves consumers in Sindh and Balochistan, has seen its system losses at the distribution stage drop from 16.16pc to 10.6pc.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>On the other hand, the Lahore-based SNGPL, which provides gas to consumers in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, saw its system losses at the distribution stage drop to 7.47pc from 8.6pc until February this year.</p>
<p>According to a notification, the RLNG’s sale price for SNGPL at the transmission stage has been cut by 12.42pc to $11.026 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for May against $12.59 per mmBtu in April.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Ogra notifies 14pc cut in RLNG price</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sale price at distribution stage for SNGPL was reduced by 12.51pc to $11.79 per mmBtu for the current month, against $13.48 per mmBtu last month.</p>
<p>On the other side, the RLNG sale price for SSGCL has been decreased at transmission stage by 13.62pc to $9.74 per mmBtu for May, against $11.27 per mmBtu in April. The sale price at the distribution stage for the company was also reduced by 13.64pc to $10.87 per mmBtu instead of $12.59 per mmBtu last month.</p>
<p>The Ogra said the reduction in RLNG price was due to a decline in the delivered price on ship for both companies.</p>
<p>The overall decrease in absolute terms for SSGC’s transmission price amounted to $1.53 per mmBtu, while reduction at distribution stage was $1.72 per unit.</p>
<p>The reduction in RLNG price for SNGPL during transmission was reported at $1.56 per mmBtu and $1.69 per unit for distribution.</p>
<p>Ironically, the RLNG distribution prices for SSGCL $10.87 per mmBtu and $11.79 per mmBtu for SNGPL are almost $2.74 and $3.66 per mmBtu higher than the Pakistan State Oil’s $8.13 per mmBtu average delivered price ex-ship (DES), respectively.</p>
<p>This is mainly because of the fact that both LNG importers — PSO and Pakistan LNG Ltd (PLL) — and port authorities also charge profit margins on account of retainage and margins at the rate of 3.15pc and 3.1pc of DES price, respectively, on top of 7.4pc losses of SNGPL and 10.6pc losses of SSGCL.</p>
<p>The basket RLNG price was based on a total of 10 cargoes for May, all under two LNG contracts between PSO and Qatar Gas at an average of about $8.13 per mmBtu — six cargoes at $7.24 and four cargos at $9.48 per mmBtu. Pakistan LNG Ltd (PLL) did not import any cargo this month as it deferred cargos for the current month owing to demand crash.</p>
<p><strong>Petroleum prices</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904539">prices of petrol and diesel</a> are estimated to fall by about Rs3.5 and Rs7 per litre for the next fortnight ending May 31, owing to a decline in the international market and a slight ease in import premium on petrol. This relief is, however, subject to unchanged tax rates.</p>
<p>Based on existing tax rates, informed sources said, the ex-depot price of petrol was estimated to go down by about Rs3.5, depending on final calculation on May 15, followed by a Rs7 per litre cut in high speed diesel (HSD).</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The estimates for lower petrol price stem from about $1.5 per barrel decline in international price of petrol and about $3 per barrel in HSD over the past two weeks. The ex-depot petrol price currently stands at Rs252.63 per litre. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of middle and lower-middle class.</p>
<p>The ex-depot price of high speed diesel (HSD) stands at Rs256.64 per litre.</p>
<p><strong>KE petition</strong></p>
<p>In a formal petition, K-Electric has, however, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904785">requested</a> the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) not to pass on entire benefit to consumers, and instead, set aside partial benefit to clear its past claims.</p>
<p>The company has already claimed Rs14.6bn past dues on account of partial load, startup costs, plant degradation and open cycle operations for the period between July 2023 and March 2025. Nepra has already set aside Rs9.4bn by disallowing full benefit of fuel cost reduction to consumers between November 2024 and January 2025.</p>
<p>A public hearing is scheduled for May 22.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the electricity rates for consumers of K-Electric have also become entitled to Rs5.02 per unit refund next month on account of fuel cost adjustment for March, with a total financial benefit of Rs6.8bn.</p>

            <p><p>Pakistan has received the second tranche of special drawing rights worth $1.023 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme, the central bank said in a post on X on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The amount will be reflected in its foreign exchange reserves for the week ending May 16, the State Bank of Pakistan said.</p>

<p>Last week the IMF had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">approved</a> the immediate disbursement of about $1bn to Pakistan under the ongoing EFF and allowed an additional arrangement for the $1.4bn Resilience and Sus­tainability Facility (RSF).</p>
<p>In a statement issued last Friday, the IMF had said its Executive Board completed the first review of Pakistan’s economic reform program supported by the EFF Arrangement.</p>
<p>“This decision allows for an immediate disbursement of around $1bn (SDR 760 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to about $2.1bn (SDR 1.52 billion). In addition, the IMF Executive Board approved the authorities’ request for an arrangement under the RSF, with access of about $1.4bn (SDR 1 billion),” it said.</p>
<p>It noted that Pakistan’s policy efforts under the EFF had already delivered “significant progress” in stabilising the economy and rebuilding confidence, amidst a challenging global environment.</p>
<p>“Fiscal performance has been strong, with a primary surplus of two per cent of gross domestic product achieved in the first half of FY25, keeping Pakistan on track to meet the end-FY25 target of 2.1pc of GDP.</p>
<p>“Inflation fell to a historic low of 0.3pc in April, and progress on disinflation and steadier domestic and external conditions, have allowed the State Bank of Pakistan to cut the policy rate by a total of 1100 bps since June 2025. Gross reserves stood at $10.3bn at end-April, up from $9.4bn in August 2024, and are projected to reach $13.9bn by end-June 2025 and continue to be rebuilt over the medium term.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it said the RSF would support the authorities’ efforts to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and build economic and climate resilience.</p>
<p>A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) had said PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction over the approval and “the failure of India’s high-handed tactics” against Pakistan.</p>
<p>“The country’s economic situation has improved and the country is moving towards development. India is plotting a conspiracy to divert attention from our country’s development through unilateral aggression.</p>
<p>“International institutions have responsibly rejected India’s false propaganda. Indian attempts to sabotage the IMF programme have failed,” it quoted the prime minister as saying.</p></p>
