            <p><p>Iran state TV resumed live coverage after Israel’s attack on the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) building on Monday.</p>
<p>“The Zionist regime, the enemy of the Iranian nation, minutes ago conducted a military operation against the Islamic Republic of Iran news network”, part of IRIB, said Hassan Abedini, a senior official at the broadcasting service. “The regime (Israel) was unaware of the fact that the voice of the Islamic revolution and the great Iran will not be silenced with a military operation.”</p>
<p>The blast occurred as the presenter was live on TV, lambasting Israel before she was seen leaving the live broadcast, Iranian media reported, sharing a video of the incident. The attack was <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/Israel_katz/status/1934643151655899471" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">confirmed</a> by the Israeli defence minister as well.</p>

<p>Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country was “on the road to victory” and claimed that his air force was “in control of the skies over Tehran”, <em>Al Jazeera</em> reported.</p>
<p>Netanyahu made the remarks as he visited the Tel Nof airbase in central Israel, accompanied by Defence Minister Israel Katz and Chief of Staff Lieutenant-General Eyal Zamir, according to the Israeli media.</p>
<p>“We are on our way to achieving our two objectives: eliminating the nuclear threat and eliminating the missile threat,” he said. Netanyahu also threatened the citizens of Tehran, telling them to leave Iran’s capital. “We are taking action.”</p>
<p>The latest military exchange between the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916920/a-timeline-of-the-long-standing-conflict-between-israel-and-iran">arch-rivals</a> began when Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/israel-launches-strikes-on-iran">struck</a> Iran’s nuclear and military sites on Friday, killing top <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">commanders and scientists</a>. Tel Aviv has said it wants to stop Tehran from building an atomic weapon, which the latter has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a>, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p>
<p>Dangers of further escalation loomed over a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1917383">meeting</a> of G7 leaders in Canada, with US President Donald Trump expressing hope a day ago that a deal could be done, but no sign of the fighting abating on a fourth day of war.</p>
<p>Today, he said that Iran wanted to talk about de-escalating hostilities with Israel, and should do so immediately “before it’s too late”.</p>
<p>“I’d say Iran is not winning this war, and they should talk, and they should talk immediately before it’s too late,” Trump told reporters at the start of a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.</p>
<p>In turn, Iran called on Trump to force Israel to cease fire as the only way to end the four-day-old aerial war</p>
<p>“If President Trump is genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on X.</p>
<p>“Israel must halt its aggression, and absent a total cessation of military aggression against us, our responses will continue. It takes one phone call from Washington to muzzle someone like Netanyahu. That may pave the way for a return to diplomacy.”</p>

<p>Sources told <em>Reuters</em> that Tehran had asked Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman to press Trump to use his influence on Israel to agree to an immediate ceasefire. In return, Iran would show flexibility in nuclear negotiations, said the two Iranian and three regional sources.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted an evacuation order for citizens in Tehran on his X account.</p>
<p>The post ordered citizens living in a specific area of the Iranian capital to “leave immediately”, warning that Israel would attack Iran’s military infrastructure in the area.</p>
<p>“Dear citizens, for your safety, please leave the mentioned area in the third district of Tehran immediately,” the order read, enclosing a map of the city. “Your presence in this area endangers your life.”</p>

<p>Katz also said that  Iran’s state television and radio were “about to disappear”, after the evacuation warning was issued for the district in Tehran where the broadcaster is based.</p>
<p>“The Iranian propaganda and incitement megaphone is about to disappear,” he said in a statement. “Evacuation of nearby residents has begun.”</p>
<p>The area marked for evacuation is an upmarket part of the Iranian capital home to at least four hospitals and medical centres, a major police building and state broadcaster <em>IRIB</em>. It also houses several embassies, including those of Qatar, Oman and Kuwait, as well as UN offices and the <em>AFP</em> bureau.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Katz threatened that residents of Tehran will “pay the price and soon” after Iranian missiles struck Tel Aviv and the port city of Haifa before dawn, killing at least eight people.</p>
<p>“The residents of Tehran will pay the price, and soon,” Katz <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/Israel_katz/status/1934482487599575160" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>.</p>

<p>The latest fatalities in Israel, reported by Israel’s national emergency services, raised the death toll to 23 since Friday.</p>
<p>Israeli attacks in Iran have killed at least 224 people so far, including 70 women and children, while over 1,200 have been injured, the health ministry was quoted as saying earlier today by <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/at-least-224-killed-over-1-000-wounded-in-israeli-strikes-on-iran-health-ministry/3599882" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anadolu Agency</a></em>.</p>
<p>More than 90 per cent of the wounded were civilians, including women and children, health ministry official Hossein Kermanpour <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/HKermanpour/status/1934331936912326671" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X.</p>
<p>At least 100 more were wounded in Israel in the overnight blitz, part of a wave of attacks by Tehran in retaliation for Israel’s strikes targeting the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of sworn enemy Iran.</p>

<p>The aircraft carrier USS Nimitz was leaving Southeast Asia on Monday after cancelling plans to dock in Vietnam, amid reports it is headed to the Middle East to boost the US presence.</p>
<p>At 1:45pm GMT (6:45pm PKT), the carrier was traveling through the Malacca Strait toward the Indian Ocean, according to Marine Traffic, a ship-tracking site.</p>
<p>A Vietnamese government official confirmed to <em>AFP</em> that a planned reception aboard the USS Nimitz on June 20, as part of the ship’s expected June 19-23 visit to Danang, had been cancelled.</p>
<p>The official shared a letter from the US embassy announcing that the Defence Department was cancelling the event due to “an emergent operational requirement.” The US Embassy in Hanoi declined to comment to <em>AFP</em>, as did a spokesman for the Nimitz.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amir Moqadam on the sidelines of the International Maritime Expo and Conference in Karachi, a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said on Monday.</p>
<p>The statement said, “PM [Shehbaz] reiterated Pakistan’s condemnation of the recent Israeli aggression on Iran and the entire nation’s sympathy with Iran over the deaths of innocent people.”</p>
<p>While discussing the current regional situation, the premier expressed Pakistan’s solidarity with Iran and its people during the tense situation, the statement added.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#russia-and-turkiye-offer-to-mediate-condemn-israeli-attacks" id="russia-and-turkiye-offer-to-mediate-condemn-israeli-attacks" title="Permalink"></a>Russia and Turkiye offer to mediate, condemn Israeli attacks</h2>
<p>As the attacks did not seem to halt, Russia and Turkiye offered to facilitate the end of the ongoing war between Israel and Iran.</p>
<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian in a phone call today that his country “stands ready to undertake a facilitating role to end the conflicts as soon as possible and return to nuclear negotiations”.</p>
<p>Erdoğan “emphasised the importance Turkiye attaches to the preservation of peace and stability in the region”, the Turkish presidency said.</p>
<p>The Kremlin said Russia remains ready to act as a mediator between Israel and Iran, and that Moscow’s previous proposal to store Iranian uranium in Russia remains on the table.</p>
<p>Before Israel launched strikes on the Islamic Republic, Russia said last week that it stood ready to remove highly enriched uranium from Iran and convert it into civilian reactor fuel as a potential way to calm the crisis.</p>
<p>“This proposal remains on the table, it remains relevant. But, of course, with the outbreak of hostilities, the situation has become seriously complicated,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.</p>
<p>“You know that we condemn those actions that have led to such a dangerous escalation of tension in the region,” Peskov stated.</p>
<p>He noted that the root causes of the conflict needed to be addressed and eliminated, and that the military strikes were escalating the entire crisis to beyond serious levels.</p>
<p>“And secondly, we also note a significant consolidation of society in Iran against the background of the bombing that is currently being carried out by the Israeli side,” Peskov added.</p>
<p>Stating that Russia “remains ready to do everything necessary to eliminate the root causes of this crisis”, Peskov said the situation was “escalating more than seriously, and, of course, this is not affecting the situation for the better”.</p>
<p>Asked about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/netanyahu-reveals-iran-marked-trump-enemy-number-one-assassination-plot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News</a></em> on Sunday that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917243">regime change</a> in Iran could be a result of Israel’s military attacks, Peskov said that the Kremlin had seen the remarks.</p>
<p>The statement comes after Trump yesterday cited the possibility that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, could help. Speaking to <a class="link--external" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-us-gets-involved-israel-iran-conflict/story?id=122865561" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>ABC News</em></a>, Trump said he would be open to Putin being a mediator in the conflict. “He is ready. He called me about it. We had a long talk about it,” the US president had said.</p>
<p>The European Union said Russia has “zero credibility” as a potential mediator between Iran and Israel after Trump suggested that Putin could play a role.</p>
<p>“There has been a recent Russia-Iran partnership agreement, which signals deepening cooperation across multiple areas, including foreign policy and defence,” EU spokesman Anouar El Anouni said.</p>
<p>“In light of such, Russia cannot be an objective mediator.”</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan condemned Israel’s “act of force” against Iran and called for an immediate cessation of hostilities when they spoke by phone on Monday, the Kremlin said.</p>
<p>“Both sides expressed the most serious concern about the ongoing escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict, which has already led to a large number of casualties and is fraught with serious long-term consequences for the entire region,” a Kremlin statement said.</p>
<p>“The leaders spoke in favour of an immediate cessation of hostilities and the settlement of contentious issues, including those related to the Iranian nuclear programme, exclusively by political and diplomatic means.”</p>
<p>The two sides agreed to remain in close cooperation, the statement said.</p>
<p>Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed in a phone call on Monday that the conflict between Iran and Israel must end and room must be made for diplomacy as soon as possible, the Turkish presidency said.</p>
<p>In a statement, the presidency also said Erdogan repeated his view that the only solution to the crisis was a return to nuclear talks.</p>

<p>Search and location operations were underway in the coastal city of Haifa, where around 30 people were wounded, emergency authorities said, as dozens of first responders rushed to the strike zones.</p>
<p>Fires were seen burning at a power plant near the port, the media reported. Video footage showed several missiles over Tel Aviv and explosions could be heard there and over Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Israel’s military warned of a new missile salvo incoming from Iran. “A short while ago, the IDF identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the State of Israel,” the army posted on Telegram, using the acronym for its official name.</p>
<p>It said its air defences were working to intercept the threat but advised people to “enter a protected space and remain there until further notice”.</p>
<p>Several residential buildings in a densely populated neighbourhood of Tel Aviv were destroyed in a strike that blew out the windows of hotels and other nearby homes just a few hundred metres from the US Embassy branch in the city.</p>
<p>The US ambassador to Israel said the building sustained minor damage, but there were no injuries to personnel.</p>
<p>British maritime security firm Ambrey said that fires were observed at the power plant in the vicinity of Israel’s Haifa port, <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>

<p>Ambrey said it observed video footage of the Israeli military intercepting the attack, followed by impacts from two hypersonic missiles.</p>
<p>An <em>AFP</em> journalist heard loud explosions in Jerusalem on early Monday, while footage showed Israeli air defences working over the city. Outside Haifa, an <em>AFP</em> journalist saw fires break out following the latest Iranian barrage.</p>
<p>Israel’s public broadcaster <em>Kan</em> reported that at least four areas were hit in the latest Iranian attacks on central Israel.</p>

<p>The predawn missiles also struck near Shuk HaCarmel, a popular market in Tel Aviv that typically draws large crowds of residents and tourists buying fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as popular bars and restaurants.</p>
<p>A residential street in nearby Petah Tikva and a school in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish city of Bnei Brak were also hit.</p>

<p>Iran does not intend to develop nuclear weapons but will pursue its right to nuclear energy and research, President Masoud Pezeshkian said today, reiterating Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1700780">religious edict</a> against weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>Iran had claimed the existence of the <em>fatwa</em> for years before making the text public for the first time in 2010, when it was being accused by the West and Israel of seeking to secretly acquire the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>While asserting that Iran remains opposed to developing weapons of mass destruction, Esmaeil Baghaei, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson, said the Iranian parliament is preparing a bill to leave the nuclear <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1479334">Non-Proliferation Treaty</a> (NPT).</p>
<p>The Iranian president, speaking during a parliamentary session on Monday, also called for unity and solidarity “more than ever” against the Israeli aggression, <em>Press TV</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/06/16/749935/We-must-stand-united-against-the-criminals--aggression--Iran%E2%80%99s-Pezeshkian" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian asserted that Iran had the right to benefit from nuclear energy and research that served the nation’s interests, adding that no one had the right to deny this right.</p>
<p>“We have extended a hand of brotherhood to all Islamic nations — for they are all our brothers. Today, most, if not all, of them stand with us and by our side,” he further said.</p>
<p>The president said the US violated international norms by “allowing” Israel to attack Iran, stressing that Iran never sought war or initiated it.</p>
<p>“The enemy cannot remove us or our nation from the scene through violence, killings, and assassinations,” Pezeshkian said.</p>
<p>“For every hero who falls, hundreds more will rise to carry the flag and stand against the oppression, injustice, crimes, and betrayal committed by these aggressors,” he added.</p>
<p>On the slain nuclear researchers killed in Israel’s attacks, Pezeshkian asked: “What crime did a scientist commit to deserve being murdered, along with his family, by someone from the other side of the world?”</p>

<p>The Israeli military said earlier today that it was striking surface-to-surface missile sites in central Iran, adding it was “operating against this threat in our skies and in Iranian skies”.</p>
<p>Israel has claimed strikes as far away as Iran’s holy city of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1835205">Mashhad</a> in the far east, 2,300 kilometres from Israel.</p>
<p>Iranian state television reported that at least five people were killed on Sunday by an Israeli strike that hit a residential building in downtown Iran.</p>
<p>Colonel Reza Sayyad, a spokesman for Iran’s armed forces, threatened a “devastating response” to Israel’s attacks.</p>
<p>“Leave the occupied territories (Israel) because they will certainly no longer be habitable in the future,” he warned in a televised address, adding shelters will “not guarantee security”.</p>
<p>According to <em>AFP</em>, residential areas in both countries have suffered deadly strikes since the hostilities broke out, with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slamming Iran on Sunday for allegedly targeting civilians.</p>
<p>“Iran will pay a very heavy price for the premeditated murder of civilians, women and children,” he said, during a visit to the site of a missile strike on a residential building in the coastal city of Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>His remarks came hours after Iranian missile fire killed another 10 people yesterday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a likely Iranian drone killed a woman in Syria, a Britain-based war monitor said, in what would be the first death on Syrian soil since the current hostilities between Iran and Israel began, reported <em>AFP.</em></p>
<p>The drone struck the woman’s home in western Tartus province, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p>
<p>Iran has executed a man who was found guilty of spying for Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad, the semi-official <em>Fars</em> news agency reported today, identifying the man as Esmail Fekri.</p>
<p>The execution is the <a class="link--external" href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-hanging-israel-mossad-spy-90089362075772025a0e0da5ee763be0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">third</a> in recent <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/30/iran-hangs-man-accused-of-spying-for-israel-mossad" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">weeks</a> related to the conduct of espionage on behalf of Israel.</p>
<p>Iranian media, including <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1404/03/25/3335833/%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%DB%8C-2-%D8%B9%D8%B6%D9%88-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%AC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tasnim</a></em>, reported on Sunday that police had arrested two suspects over alleged links to Israel’s Mossad spy agency. Israel, in turn, said it had taken two individuals into custody over alleged links to Iranian intelligence.</p>

<p>In Iran, a heavy cloud of smoke hung above Tehran after Israeli aircraft struck two fuel depots. Local media also reported an Israeli strike on the police headquarters in the city centre.</p>
<p>“We haven’t been able to sleep since Friday because of the terrible noise,” said a Tehran resident who gave her name as Farzaneh.</p>
<p>“Today, they hit a house in our alley, and we were very scared. So we decided to leave Tehran and head to the north of the country.”</p>
<p>Some, however, were determined to stay.</p>
<p>“It is natural that war has its own stress, but I will not leave my city,” 31-year-old Shokouh Razzazi told <em>AFP.</em></p>
<p><em>AFP</em> images from Israel’s Haifa, meanwhile, also showed a column of smoke rising on Sunday evening following an Iranian missile barrage.</p>

<p>The military said rescue teams “have been dispatched to several hit sites in Israel”, while the fire services reported rescuers heading to a building on the coast that sustained a “direct hit”.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, in Bat Yam, first responders wearing helmets and headlamps picked through a bombed-out building.</p>
<p>“There was an explosion and I thought the whole house had collapsed,” said Bat Yam resident Shahar Ben Zion.</p>

<p>In Washington, two US officials told <em>Reuters</em> that Trump had vetoed an Israeli plan in recent days to kill Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>
<p>“We found out that the Israelis had plans to hit Iran’s supreme leader. President Trump was against it, and we told the Israelis not to,” a US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>When asked about the <em>Reuters</em> report, Netanyahu <a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/netanyahu-reveals-iran-marked-trump-enemy-number-one-assassination-plot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Fox News</em></a> on Sunday: “There’s so many false reports of conversations that never happened, and I’m not going to get into that.”</p>
<p>“We do what we need to do,” he told <em>Fox</em>’s ‘Special Report With Bret Baier’.</p>
<p>Asked whether <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917243">regime change</a> in Iran was one of the objectives of Israel’s strikes, Netanyahu said that “it certainly could be the result, because the Iran regime is very weak”.</p>
<p>In the same interview, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/netanyahu-trump-iran-fox-news-b2770483.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Independent</a></em> reported, Netanyahu claimed that Iran attempted to assassinate Trump twice “through proxies”.</p>
<p>“Through their intel, yes; they want to kill him,” he added. “He’s enemy number one,” the Israeli premier said, referring to the US president.</p>
<p>Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20shifting%20stance%20around%20the%20Israeli%20strikes%2C%20which%20he%20called%20%E2%80%9Cexcellent%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9Cvery%20successful%E2%80%9D%20in%20a%20series%20of%20media%20interviews%20on%20Friday">lauded Israel’s offensive</a> but said Washington had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917285#:~:text=Trump%20distances%20US%20from%20strikes%20on%20Iran%2C%20warns%20against%20attacks%20on%20it%20in%20%E2%80%98any%20way%E2%80%99">nothing to do</a> with it, while threatening to unleash “the full strength and might” of the US military if Iran attacked American interests.</p>
<p>However, seemingly contradicting his ally, Netanyahu claimed that American pilots were shooting down drones headed towards Israel. In the same interview, he also said that he and Trump were “fully coordinated”.</p>
<p>Trump has urged the two foes to “make a deal”, adding, however, that “sometimes they have to <a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-israel-iran-have-fight-out-believes-deal-possible" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fight it out</a>” first.</p>
<p>Two US officials said on Friday that the US military had helped shoot down Iranian missiles that were headed toward Israel, according to <em>Reuters</em>. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/after-sitting-out-the-iran-attack-u-s-steps-in-to-help-israel-intercept-missiles-16749866" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> the same.</p>
<p>FM Araghchi maintained Tehran had “solid proof” that US forces had supported Israel in its attacks.</p>
<p>He also told a meeting of foreign diplomats that Iran’s actions were a “response to aggression”. “If the aggression stops, naturally our responses will also stop,” he added.</p>
<p>Iran scrapped <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">planned</a> nuclear <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903561">talks</a> with the United States, saying it was “meaningless” to negotiate while under fire.</p></p>

            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday dismissed an alleged video circulating online of an Iranian official saying Pakistan will attack Israel with nuclear weapons, amid the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917457/israel-warns-tehrans-residents-will-pay-the-price-soon-as-toll-rises-after-tel-aviv-haifa-attacks">ongoing conflict</a> between Iran and Israel.</p>
<p>Nearly 80 people, including top army officers, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/iran-says-israel-attack-declaration-of-war-following-strikes-on-nuclear-facilities-missile-factories">killed</a> while civilians were among over 300 wounded in Iran as a result of Israeli strikes on military sites and private residences on June 13. Iran subsequently launched its own retaliation with ballistic missiles fired at Israel and the two countries continued to exchange a volley over the weekend.</p>
<p>Posts from multiple Indian and others users on social media platforms and Indian media outlets since Sunday shared a video of Iranian National Security Council member Mohsen Rezaei, claiming that he said Pakistan told Iran that if Israel drops a nuclear bomb on Tehran, Pakistan would retaliate in kind amid current tensions. However, fact-checking platform iVerify Pakistan <a class="link--external" href="https://iverifypakistan.com/iranian-official-mohsen-rezaei-did-not-say-pakistan-vowed-retribution-against-israel-with-nuclear-weapons/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">concluded</a> that the video was doctored, and the Iranian official had not made any such statement.</p>
<p>Addressing the matter during today’s <a class="link--external" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1wGDbFKUlyI?si=esL1vMAGTm0S6GLr" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Senate session</a>, FM Dar said, “There is a video on social media where an Iranian general was quoted as saying: ‘If Israel nuke attacks Iran, then Pakistan will attack [Israel] with nuclear weapons.’”</p>
<p>“This is irresponsible and false news,” he said, adding that the claims had become viral on the internet, and that even UK news outlet <em>Daily Mail</em> picked it up.</p>
<p>He said, “From our side, there has been no such statement. It was fabricated.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>He also addressed an alleged video of US President Donald Trump allegedly urging Pakistan to stay out of the Israel-Iran conflict. Similarly, he said that a widely circulated interview of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, purported to be recent, was in fact from 2011. Such deceptive content is causing confusion and is being monitored closely by the Foreign Office, he told the Senate.</p>
<p>Dar said, “We have checked that it was an AI-generated clip and it was fake.”</p>
<p>He cautioned that everyone must be careful, saying, “This is not a children’s matter. This is a serious war like ours with India.”</p>

<p>Speaking on the Iran-Israel conflict, the foreign minister said, “We wanted the Iran-US [nuclear] <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912795">talks</a> to be successful. I must appreciate the foreign minister of Oman and Iran, who kept me in the loop throughout the process of the four rounds of talks in Muscat and Rome.”</p>
<p>Dar said that the Senate’s statement on the conflict was widely circulated around the world, stating, “[The] House of Federation took a strong stance. We fulfilled our responsibility with clarity.”</p>
<p>He further said that Pakistan facilitated the UN Security Council meeting within 24 hours of the attacks. He added that the Iranian ambassador at the meeting acknowledged four countries by name, including Pakistan.</p>
<p>Dar also said that he spoke to the Iranian foreign minister on the night of June 13/14, quoting him as saying, “We [Iran] are ready for diplomatic dialogue if Israel does not attack again.”</p>
<p>“We have conveyed the matter through different channels that Iran is ready if the other side can stop,” he added.</p>
<p>He highlighted some of the consequences for Pakistani students and <em>zaireen</em> (pilgrims) in Iran.</p>
<p>“On June 13, the crisis management unit of the foreign ministry was activated.</p>
<p>“We have so far evacuated 251 students. By tonight, they will reach Quetta. There are over 500 <em>zaireen</em> there. Three hundred of them travelled by air to go there while 209 went there by road,” he said, adding that Pakistan was in contact with other countries as well.</p>
<p>“Iran approached us on June 14 to help bring back 20,000 Haj pilgrims in Saudi Arabia. We gave a positive response to this. Pakistan will give them a visa on arrival, and welcome them at Karachi airport … So we are fulfilling our responsibility.”</p>
<p>Dar also spoke on Pakistan’s nuclear programme, saying that Pakistan’s policy had not changed since 1998.</p>
<p>“Even at that time, we said that it is Pakistan’s stated policy. It is for the purpose of self-defence. It is our deterrence. It was important for parity, peace and security in this region,” he said, adding that India’s “spectacle of having hegemony and supremacy over us [Pakistan]” was buried on May 10, following the recent Pakistan-India tensions.</p>
<p>Dar further said, “We are not signatories of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Since 1998, our condition has been that we will sign it only when India does. So neither India nor Pakistan have signed it. Neither has Israel. But it is a serious crime to attack nuclear installations, whether you are a member or not.</p>
<p>“It is a major violation of international law due to the unimaginable consequences of attacking nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>The foreign minister reiterated that Pakistan’s “nuclear power is for our security and stability as well as regional stability.</p>
<p>“Israel dare not look at Pakistan. Pakistan has enough power to respond to any malafide [action]. Our armed forces are fully alert,” he added.</p>
<p>Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned the global community to be “wary and apprehensive” of Israel’s nuclear arsenal, amidst Tel Aviv’s aggression against its neighbours in the region.</p>
<p>Israel possesses around 90 nuclear warheads, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917457/israel-warns-tehrans-residents-will-pay-the-price-soon-as-toll-rises-after-tel-aviv-haifa-attacks">according</a> to the US-based Centre for Nuclear Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. There are multiple United Nations (UN) resolutions concerning Israel’s nuclear arsenal, including UN General Assembly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/iran-says-israel-attack-declaration-of-war-following-strikes-on-nuclear-facilities-missile-factories">Resolution 41/93</a>, which urged Tel Aviv to renounce its weapons and place its facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917469/fact-check-trump-netanyahu-viral-comments-about-pakistan-on-iran-israel-clash-are-fake">months</a> of attacking Gaza — flattening homes, targeting hospitals and aid workers, and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912795">starving</a> a besieged population — Israel has now expanded its assault across borders, launching <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">wide-scale air strikes</a> against Iran last week. Israeli officials have claimed the strikes are part of a broader operation codenamed ‘Rising Lion’ to deter Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.</p>

<p>“(The) world should be wary and apprehensive about Israel’s nuclear prowess, a country not bound by any international nuclear discipline, nor signatory to NPT or any other binding arrangement,” he said in a post on X.</p>
<p>“We do not pursue hegemonic policies against our neighbours, which are being amply demonstrated by Israel these days,” Asif continued, referring to Israel’s aggression in the region,.</p>
<p>The defence minister added that Pakistan was a signatory to all international nuclear disciplines.</p>
<p>“Our nuclear capability is for the benefit of our people and defence of our country against the hostile designs of our enemies,” Asif said.</p>
<p>Asif said that the Western world must worry about conflicts being generated by Israel, adding that it would engulf the whole region and beyond.</p>
<p>“Their patronage of Israel, a rogue state, can have catastrophic consequences,” Asif warned.</p>
<p>Israel was able to <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/west-turns-a-blind-eye-to-israels-nuclear-weapons-academic/3076316#:~:text=conduct%20nuclear%20activities.-,90%20nuclear%20warheads,-According%20to%20unofficial" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">produce</a> nuclear weapons by the end of the 1960s. It is estimated that there are about 90 plutonium-based nuclear warheads in this country and that Israel has produced enough plutonium for 100-200 weapons.</p>
<p>Tel Aviv is not a party to the NPT — a 1970 accord aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, promoting disarmament, and ensuring the peaceful use of nuclear technology.</p>

<p>“Although Israel refrains from informing the international community about whether it possesses nuclear weapons, it is the only country in the Middle East that has not accepted the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement, which allows the IAEA to inspect all kinds of civilian and military nuclear facilities and to carry out verification activities for the work carried out,” Heinz Gartner, a professor from the University of the Vienna <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/west-turns-a-blind-eye-to-israels-nuclear-weapons-academic/3076316" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>Anadolu Agency</em>.</p>

            <p><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) maintained its policy rate on Monday at 11 per cent, after many analysts cited inflation risks from rising global commodity prices amid Iran-Israel tensions.</p>
<p>The central bank’s policy rate, after being slashed by 1,000bps from 22pc since June 2024 in seven intervals, was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908601">cut to 11pc</a> last month.</p>
<p>“The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 11 per cent,” the SBP said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.sbp.org.pk/press/2025/Pr-16-Jun-2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>Several brokerages had initially expected a cut but revised their forecasts after the Israeli strikes sparked fears of a broader conflict.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The MPC observed that global oil prices had “rebounded sharply, reflecting the evolving geopolitical situation in the Middle East and some ease in US-China trade tensions”.</p>
<p>“Taking stock of these developments and potential risks, the committee assessed that the real interest rate remains adequately positive to stabilise inflation within the target range of 5–7pc,” the MPC stressed.</p>
<p>The escalating hostilities after Israel’s attacks on Iran on Friday had triggered a sharp spike in oil prices — a worry for Pakistan given the broader impact on imported inflation from a potentially prolonged conflict and tightening of crude supplies.</p>
<p>Eleven of 14 respondents in a snap poll by <em>Reuters</em> expected the SBP to leave the benchmark rate unchanged at 12pc. Two forecast a 100 basis-point (bps) cut and one predicted a 50bps cut.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#inflation-expected-to-trend-up-and-stablise-in-5-7pc-target-range" id="inflation-expected-to-trend-up-and-stablise-in-5-7pc-target-range" title="Permalink"></a>Inflation expected to ‘trend up and stablise’ in 5-7pc target range</h2>
<p>On inflation, the MPC noted that the recent uptick in May <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914976">to 3.5pc</a> year-on-year was in line with its expectation, whereas core inflation declined “marginally”.</p>
<p>The headline inflation had hit an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908067">all-time low</a> of 0.3pc YoY after declining for several months from <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1757288">around 40pc</a> in May 2023.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The MPC said inflation was expected to “trend up and stabilise” in the target range. The SBP expects average inflation to range between 5.5pc and 7.5pc for the current fiscal year, which ends this month.</p>
<p>“This outlook, however, remains subject to multiple risks emanating from potential supply-chain disruptions from regional geopolitical conflicts, volatility in oil and other commodity prices, and the timing and magnitude of domestic energy price adjustments,” the committee added.</p>
<p>It noted that economic growth was picking up gradually and was projected to gain further traction next year on the back of earlier rate cuts. However, the MPC cautioned about “some potential risks to the external sector amidst the sustained widening in the trade deficit and weak financial inflows”.</p>
<p>It observed that some of the proposed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292">FY26 budgetary measures</a> may further widen the trade deficit by increasing imports, adding that the decision to maintain the interest rate was “appropriate to sustain the macroeconomic and price stability”.</p>
<p>The MPC termed the “timely realisation of planned <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916681">foreign inflows</a>, achievement of the targeted fiscal consolidation and the implementation of structural reforms as essential to maintain macroeconomic stability and achieve sustainable economic growth”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“The decision to hold rates was not surprising given the uncertain geopolitical outlook with oil prices spiking around 15pc,” said Mustafa Pasha, executive director at Karachi-based Lakson Investments.</p>
<p>“Additionally, it gives the SBP time to assess the impact of the budget and upcoming gas/electricity tariff revisions on inflation and the external account.”</p>
<p>Noting the key developments since its last meeting in May, the MPC said the real GDP growth for FY25 was provisionally reported at 2.7pc.</p>
<p>“Despite a substantial widening in the trade deficit, the current account remained broadly balanced in April,” it highlighted, also mentioning the increase in the SBP foreign exchange reserves to $11.7 billion as of June 6, owing to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910966">$1 billion tranche</a> by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>“Third, the revised budget estimates indicate the primary balance surplus at 2.2pc of GDP in FY25, up from 0.9pc last year,” the MPC said, adding that the government was targeting a primary surplus of 2.4pc of the GDP for next year.</p>
<p>The SBP decision also comes on the heels of Pakistan’s contractionary budget, in which it cut total spending by 7pc and set a GDP target of 4.2pc for fiscal year 2025-26.</p>
<p>The government said the $350 billion economy is stabilising under a $7bn International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, though analysts remain wary of external and fiscal pressures.</p></p>
