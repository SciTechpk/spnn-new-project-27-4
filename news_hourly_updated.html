                <h2>Two teams to present Pakistan‚Äôs perspective to world on recent Indian aggression: FO</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Two government delegations are set to hold a series of meetings with major world capitals to present Pakistan‚Äôs perspective to the global community on the recent spike in tensions with India, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Monday.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">high-level delegation</a> ‚Äî consisting of two former foreign ministers, two former foreign sec¬≠¬≠retaries, two former ambassadors to the US, and a serving federal minister ‚Äî arrived in New York yesterday for consultations at the United Nations. It will also visit Washington DC, London and Brussels, the FO said.</p>
<p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari; ex-FMs Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; and Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh¬≠mina Janjua are members of the first delegation.</p>
<p>The group is scheduled to meet UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Gute¬≠rres, the president of the UN General Assembly, and ambassadors of all five permanent members of the Security Council. It will also address a joint session of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation envoys.</p>
<p>The delegation will kick off its engagements on June 3, with planned meetings with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, senior administration officials, lawmakers, think-tank analysts, and leading media organisations.</p>
<p>According to the FO, another delegation, led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi, will visit Moscow today.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe visits of these delegations are aimed at projecting Pakistan‚Äôs perspective on the recent Indian aggression,‚Äù the statement read. ‚ÄúThe delegations will highlight Pakistan‚Äôs responsible and restrained conduct ‚Äî seeking peace with responsibility ‚Äî in the face of India‚Äôs reckless and belligerent actions in violation of international law.‚Äù</p>
<p>The delegations will also highlight that ‚Äúdialogue and diplomacy should take precedence over conflict and confrontation‚Äù.</p>
<p>The statement read that the delegations will underscore the importance of the international community to play its due role in promoting a lasting peace in the region, including the immediate resumption of the normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe delegations will engage in a series of meetings with the leadership of international bodies, public office holders, senior officials, parliamentarians, think tanks, media and diaspora,‚Äù the FO said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#strategic-importance-and-not-mere-photo-opportunities" id="strategic-importance-and-not-mere-photo-opportunities" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòStrategic importance and not mere photo opportunities‚Äô</h2>
<p>Separately, Senator Sherry Rehman said that the delegation led by the PPP chairman has already begun its US visit with a ‚Äúpacked schedule of high-level multilateral meetings in New York‚Äù.</p>
<p>Rehman emphasised that the meetings will have strategic importance, and not be ‚Äúmere photo opportunities‚Äù.</p>
<p>She added that country‚Äôs status as ‚Äúa responsible and stable middle power‚Äù is being highlighted during the engagements, and that the country had a clear interest in ‚Äúregional peace and security‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAdherence to international laws is part of Pakistan‚Äôs foreign policy,‚Äù Rehman said, adding that the ‚Äúfabricated‚Äù Indian narrative against the country ‚Äúwill not be allowed to take the form of truth this time‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia has started using false terrorism allegations as justification for war. This trend cannot be allowed to become the norm,‚Äù she said, adding that the country would not be part of any Indian ‚Äúfilm script‚Äù.</p>
<p>The PPP leader said, ‚ÄúChairman Bilawal Bhutto has successfully presented Pakistan‚Äôs solid position on water, Kashmir and violations of international laws of war and peace.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan, as a responsible nuclear state, believes in a broad and fair dialogue based on peace,‚Äù she added.</p></p>

                <h2>Karachi residents feel more low-intensity tremors</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Another low-intensity earthquake was felt by Karachi residents on Monday, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).</p>
<p>The tremor was the third within 24 hours.</p>
<p>The most recent quake <a class="link--external" href="https://seismic.pmd.gov.pk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">measured 3.2</a> on the Richter scale with the city‚Äôs densely populated Quaidabad area as its epicentre. The area‚Äôs residents had also experienced a similar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914834/karachi-experiences-36-magnitude-quake-with-quaidabad-as-epicentre">3.6-magnitude tremor</a> at 5:33pm yesterday.</p>
<p>Both earthquakes originated at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres beneath the surface.</p>

<p>A separate tremor originating near the city‚Äôs Gadap Town was recorded at 1:05am earlier today. It measured 3.2 on the Richter scale and had a depth of 12km.</p>
<p>Ameer Hyder, the chief meteorologist at the Met Office in Karachi, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the tremors were caused by an active fault line in Landhi.</p>
<p>He noted that the quakes‚Äô intensity was not high and was ‚Äúgradually declining‚Äù. While stating that no formal prediction could be made yet, Hyder expected the tremors to end within a week.</p>

<p>Experts have previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say">pointed out</a> that such minor seismic activities ‚Äúpreempt‚Äù high-intensity earthquakes by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates.</p>
<p>The country had witnessed around <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say">20 low-intensity earthquakes</a> in the first half of February ‚Äî an average of more than one tremor each day.</p>
<p>In April, jolts were felt in parts of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905258">Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab</a> ‚Äî including Peshawar, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore ‚Äî <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903840">twice</a> that month.</p>
<p>Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates ‚Äî the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian ‚Äî <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say#:~:text=Tectonic%20positioning">according to</a> geological engineer Muhammad Rehan, creating five seismic zones within the country.</p>
