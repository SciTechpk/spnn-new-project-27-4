                <h2>Joint search operation underway against terrorists in KP‚Äôs Bannu locality</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Amid a spate of terrorist and quadcopter attacks, police on Friday imposed a curfew in Hoveed area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Bannu as a search and targeted operation is ongoing alongside security forces there.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP ‚Äî including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur ‚Äî have seen a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a>, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773/3-terrorists-killed-during-joint-operation-in-kps-bannu-police">July</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement issued today, Bannu police spokesperson Khanzala Quraishi said: ‚ÄúThis operation has been launched on the basis of intelligence reports, the main objective of which is to cleanse the area from the scourge of terrorism and establish lasting peace.‚Äù</p>
<p>The operation began at 5am on Friday, according to Quraishi, and was launched on the instructions of Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan under the supervision of District Police Officer Saleem Abbasi Kalachi.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring the operation, security forces and police personnel have completely surrounded the area and house-to-house searches are ongoing,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn case of any suspicious activity or resistance, immediate and effective action is being taken so that the terrorists do not get any chance to escape or hide.‚Äù</p>
<p>A curfew has been imposed in the area for the sake of public safety, and citizens have been advised to cooperate with security agencies and stay indoors.</p>
<p>‚ÄúImmediately report any suspicious person or activity to the relevant authorities,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAuthorities have warned that providing any kind of facility or assistance to terrorists is a serious crime, and strict legal action will be taken against such elements.‚Äù</p>
<p>Last week, a police constable was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928472">martyred</a> in a terrorist attack on a checkpoint in Bannu, where an exchange of fire also left three terrorists dead and three policemen injured.</p>
<p>In July, ter¬≠rorists used a quadcopter to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923850">attack</a> a police station in Miryan, Bannu, making it the fifth such attack at the installation in a month.</p></p>

                <h2>Govt suspends mobile data services in Balochistan until Aug 31 for ‚Äòsecurity reasons‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Balochistan government spokesman Shahid Rind on Friday said that mobile data services in the province have been suspended until August 31 over ‚Äúsecurity reasons‚Äù.</p>
<p>In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925001">worsened</a>, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419/jaffar-express-hijacking-state-media-reports-190-rescued-2nd-day-of-operation-underway-in-balochistan">attacks</a>. In February, nearly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896269/62pc-of-deaths-from-terror-attacks-in-balochistan">62 per cent</a> of the total terrorism-related deaths in the country occurred in Balochistan.</p>
<p>The move came after a notification issued by the Balochistan Home Department on Aug 6, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, ordered the immediate suspension of data services until Aug 31, citing the ‚Äúpeculiar law and order situation‚Äù in the province.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is, therefore, requested to please direct the concerned authorities for suspension/closure of 3G and 4G services in the entire province ‚Ä¶ to avoid any untoward incident,‚Äù the notification read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe service has been suspended because they (militants) use it for coordination and sharing information,‚Äù Rind said, according to <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>The suspension follows the government announcement from last month <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927007">banning</a> Pakistani Zaireen (pilgrims) from travelling by road from Quetta to Iran and Iraq due to national security concerns.</p>

<p>On March 11, the Pesha¬≠war-bound Jaffar Express train became the target of an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897237/rescue-operation-for-hostages-underway-after-terrorists-attack-jaffar-express-in-balochistan">unprecedented hijacking</a>, when terrorists fired on the locomotive and took over 400 passengers hostage.</p>
<p>Media reports said that security forces had surrounded the area and launched a clearance operation to rescue all passengers. <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported that security forces had rescued 80 hostages held by the terrorists.</p>
<p>Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on March 12 that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419">clearance operation</a>, launched after the train‚Äôs unprecedented hijacking in Balochistan, ended with all 33 terrorists being killed.</p></p>
