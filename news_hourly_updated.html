                <h2>US makes deal to tap Pakistan‚Äôs oil reserves</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Details remain sketchy despite Trump announcement; no word on tariff rate as Aurangzeb meets key officials<br />
‚Ä¢ India slapped with 25pc tariff, punished for buying Russian arms, oil through ‚Äòsecondary tariffs‚Äô<br />
‚Ä¢ Six Indian companies face State Dept sanctions for being part of Iran oil, petrochemical trade</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that the US has concluded a deal with Pakistan that will allow the two allies to work together on developing Pakistan‚Äôs vast oil reserves.</p>
<p>The announcement, <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114943927434273211" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on his Truth Social account, did not specify whether the two countries have also reached an agreement on tariffs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have just concluded a Deal with the Country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive Oil Reserves,‚Äù Trump wrote.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are in the process of choosing the Oil Company that will lead this Partnership. Who knows, maybe they‚Äôll be selling Oil to India some day!‚Äù</p>
<p>Although Pakistan has long claimed to have large oil deposits along its coast, this marks the first high-level move towards tapping them.</p>
<p>The reference to India was also particularly poignant, as the US president earlier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927587/trump-says-india-to-pay-25pc-tariff-from-aug-1-with-additional-penalty-for-russian-energy-purchases">slapped</a> the country with a 25 per cent tariff on imports, mainly as a punishment for acquiring oil and military equipment from Russia.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLikewise, other Countries are making offers for a Tariff reduction. All of this will help reduce our Trade Deficit in a very major way,‚Äù he wrote, adding: ‚ÄúA full report will be released at the appropriate time.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a separate part of his post, Trump mentioned South Korea to illustrate the ongoing tariff discussions, in a way that could also be seen as inviting further offers from countries like Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSouth Korea is right now at a 25% Tariff, but they have an offer to buy down those Tariffs. I will be interested in hearing what that offer is.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pakistani officials have previously offered to reduce the country‚Äôs $3 billion trade deficit with the United States by increasing imports of US goods, including oil, rather than accepting higher tariffs.</p>
<p><strong>Aurangzeb holds talks</strong></p>
<p>Finance Minister Mohammad Aurangzeb, who is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927252/aurangzeb-to-arrive-in-us-for-final-round-of-tariff-talks">currently</a> in Washington for what officials describe as final-stage <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922229/pakistan-us-reach-accord-on-trade-and-tariffs">negotiations</a> on a tariff deal, also began meetings with senior US officials on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Pakistani delegation is keeping the details of the talks under wraps, but one official said, ‚ÄúWe hope to sign a deal before the (Aug 1) deadline expires.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe hope to conclude a mutually beneficial trade agreement‚Ä¶ hopefully in days, not in weeks,‚Äù said Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar during a recent event at the Atlantic Council in Washington.</p>
<p>Mr Dar, who was recently in New York to address the United Nations, said a committee had been formed to finalise the terms of the proposed deal.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs long as we are better than or equal to our peers, we should be fine,‚Äù Mr Dar said.</p>
<p>While the exact tariff rate being negotiated for Pakistan has not been publicly disclosed, Pakistani officials have said they‚Äôre seeking terms on a par with other recent US trade agreements ‚Äî particularly those with Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, where tariffs are reportedly set between 15pc and 20pc.</p>
<p><strong>Trump ‚Äòpunishes‚Äô India</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the 25pc tariffs, Trump also slapped an unspecified additional penalty on India for acquiring military equipment and oil from Russia, starting Aug 1.</p>
<p>However, he later said the US was currently negotiating a deal with India. ‚ÄúThey have one of the highest tariffs in the world now, they‚Äôre willing to cut it very substantially. But we‚Äôll see what happens,‚Äù Mr Trump told reporters.</p>

<p>In a strongly worded <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114942106248731470" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on the social media platform Truth Social, Mr Trump accused India of imposing excessively high tariffs and maintaining some of the world‚Äôs most ‚Äústrenuous and obnoxious non-monetary trade barriers‚Äù. He also criticised New Delhi‚Äôs continued reliance on Russian arms and energy purchases.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia will therefore be paying a tariff of 25pc, plus a penalty for the above, starting on August 1,‚Äù Mr Trump wrote. ‚ÄúWhile India is our friend, we have done relatively little business with them because of their trade practices.‚Äù</p>
<p>The US president made it clear that no further extensions would be given to countries that failed to reach a deal by the end-of-week deadline.</p>
<p>The imposition of a penalty tariff on India for its purchases of Russian oil, if enacted, would be the first use of what Mr Trump has taken to calling ‚Äúsecondary tariffs‚Äù, a kind of penalty that would be imposed instead of the financial sanctions typically used against countries that do business with embargoed nations, according to <em>The New York Times.</em></p>
<p>In response, the Indian government said in a statement that it was studying the implications of Mr Trump‚Äôs announcements and remained dedicated to securing a fair trade deal with the US.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia and the US have been engaged in negotiations on concluding a fair, balanced and mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement over the last few months. We remain committed to that objective,‚Äù it said, according to <em>Reuters.</em></p>
<p>The news pushed the Indian rupee down 0.4pc to around 87.80 against the US dollar in the non-deliverable forwards market, from its close at 87.42 during market hours. Gift Nifty futures were trading at 24,692 points, down 0.6pc.</p>
<p><strong>Sanctions on six Indian firms</strong></p>
<p>Separately, the State Department announced sanctions against six Indian firms for ‚Äúengaging in Iranian petroleum, petroleum products, or petrochemical trade‚Äù.</p>
<p><strong>The sanctioned entities include:</strong></p>
<p>Kanchan Polymers, which ‚Äúimported and purchased over $1.3M worth of Iranian-origin petrochemical products‚Äù.</p>
<p>Alchemical Solutions, which imported and purchased Iranian-origin petrochemical products valued at over $84m.</p>
<p>Ramniklal, a petrochemical company that imported and purchased Iranian-origin products valued at over $22m.</p>
<p>Jupiter Dye Chem, which imported and purchased Iranian-origin petrochemical products valued at over $49m.</p>
<p>Global Industrial, which imported and purchased products, including methanol, valued at over $51m.</p>
<p>Persistent Petrochem Private Limited, which imported approximately $14m worth of shipments.</p>
<p>In addition, it also placed sanctions on a number of China and UAE-based companies and several oil tankers.</p>

                <h2>CM Gandapur changes his mind, ‚Äòbacks‚Äô military action</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>PESHAWAR: A day after he and his party came out all guns blazing against a military offensive in Bajaur ‚Äî which he claimed was launched without taking the province on board ‚Äî Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gand¬≠apur on Wednesday appea¬≠red to throw his full weight behind a ‚Äútargeted operation‚Äù against militants.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Bajaur administration imposed a three-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927438">curfew</a> in several places in the district as an operation against militants was launched in the areas, prompting a fiery response from the CM.</p>
<p>CM Gandapur, who has been opposed to the idea of fresh military operations in the province, said in a heavily-edited video message iss¬≠u¬≠ed after the KP apex committee meeting that the for¬≠ces were in the province at the request of the KP government and should be treated as ‚Äúguests‚Äù and with respect.</p>

<p>He pointed out that militants tend to take shelter in residential areas, from where they targeted the security forces, while retaliation by the forces to root them out results in collateral damage.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey are doing this to create distrust between the people and the armed forces. This is why we need to expel them from our cities. We will not tolerate their presence in populated areas.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said the militants would not be allowed to hide inside residential areas and action would be taken against them and their facilitators. He emphasised that public support was essential in the fight against terrorism and praised the police and the security forces for their role in eradicating terrorism.</p>
<p><strong>Jirgas from Aug 2</strong></p>
<p>CM Gandapur also said that jirgas at the divisional level would start on August 2, with all stakeholders coming together to alleviate people‚Äôs reservations and concerns.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFollowing these jirgas, there will be a grand jirga, where we will present our policy, a plan and future steps and discuss it with stakeholders and government officials,‚Äù he said, while expressing his opposition to any major offensive that could lead to mass displacement. He, however, reiterated that action would be taken in case militants were present in any area. He said their strategy would also ensure that no collateral damage would occur.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúIn order to avoid any damages while eliminating militancy, we will go with the action plan which will not cause any loss to life and property,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The CM blamed the ‚Äòenemy countries‚Äô for conspiring against Pakistan as well as orchestrating deliberate campaigns to sow distrust between the government, the public, and the security forces, saying the ‚Äúconspiracy must be exposed and countered‚Äù.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄòConcerted efforts‚Äô</strong></p>
<p>Separately, a statement issued by the Chief Minister‚Äôs Secretariat read that the meeting agreed that public trust must be secured to effectively counter militancy. The participants underscored the need for enhanced coordination among civil administration, police, security forces, and intelligence agencies to carry out decisive operations.</p>
<p>It read that during the meeting, the participants unanimously acknowledged that militancy had become a threat that could only be eliminated through concerted efforts by the government, the public, and state institutions. They noted that militants were a common enemy and all stakeholders desired their elimination, the statement read.</p>
<p>The meeting, chaired by CM Gandapur, was also attended by Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah, KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed, Additional Chief Secretary Abid Majeed, Peshawar‚Äôs Corps Commander Lieutenant General Syed Omer Ahmad Bukhari, lawmakers from the merged districts, and senior government officials.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄòU-turn‚Äô on operation</strong></p>
<p>The video statement on Wednesday came in complete contrast to the one issued by CM Gandapur on Tuesday night following a PTI parliamentary meeting, in which he vowed to take stringent measures, such as the withdrawal of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1505809">Action in Aid of Civil Power Regulations 2011.</a></p>
<p>He had said the KP Assembly would discuss if the armed forces‚Äô presence in the province under the said ordinance had borne fruitful results or harmed trust between people and the armed forces.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe KP government, workers of founder PTI Imran Khan, stand by the people and we will go to any extent. I direct all the deputy commissioners not to impose curfew unless permitted by the KP home department,‚Äù CM Gandapur had said in his fiery video message. He said that innocent civilians were martyred in a military offensive launched against militants in Bajaur district, adding that such operations had a negative impact and eroded trust between people and the forces.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Though the CM took a U-turn, his party, the ruling PTI, denounced the Bajaur operation, alleging that the decision bypassed the constitutionally elected government and it was nothing but a ‚Äúdangerous replay of past mistakes‚Äù.</p>
<p><strong>PTI opposes operation</strong></p>
<p>PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram, in a statement on Wednesday, lambasted the government for ‚Äúsquandering‚Äù the hard-won peace.</p>
<p>He urged the government to recognise the growing anger and resentment among the people of KP. ‚ÄúThis repetition of failed strategies while expecting different outcomes is the height of strategic insanity,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúSuch reckless actions will only deepen the alienation of an already traumatised and marginalised population, with catastrophic consequences for both this government and the nation‚Äôs stability.‚Äù</p>
