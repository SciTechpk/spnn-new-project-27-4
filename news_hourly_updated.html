                <h2>Ties scarred with Tehran but should recover after Iranian missile salvo at US base, Qatari PM says</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Qatar‚Äôs prime minister said on Tuesday that relations with Iran have been scarred by an Iranian missile volley at a United States airbase in the Gulf Arab state, but added that he hoped ties would eventually ‚Äúcome back to normal‚Äù.</p>
<p>Iran responded to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842/trump-says-irans-key-nuclear-facilities-obliterated-by-us-airstrikes">US participation</a> in Israel‚Äôs air war against Iran by firing missiles on Monday at the Al Ubeid air base, but no one was hurt after Tehran gave warning, and a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919647/israel-reports-waves-of-iranian-missiles-soon-after-trump-announced-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> was announced hours later by Washington.</p>
<p>Qatar, situated just across the Gulf from Iran, has often acted as a mediator in regional conflicts, including between Iran and the US and between Israel and Hamas in the continuing Gaza conflict.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat happened will definitely have its scar on the relationship [with Iran], but I hope by the time everyone learns the lesson that this kind of neighbourhood relationship should not be violated and should not be undermined,‚Äù Qatar‚Äôs prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, told a press conference with his Lebanese counterpart in Doha.</p>
<p>The prime minister described the attack as ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù but said Qatar‚Äôs response would be ‚Äúdiplomatic and legal‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe attack on the State of Qatar is an unacceptable act, especially that the State of Qatar has been making great diplomatic efforts in order to have the situation de-escalated,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe partnership between Qatar and the US is just growing stronger ‚Ä¶ and I hope the good relationship with Iran comes back to normal as soon as possible,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Al Thani added that Qatar had liaised with Iran at Washington‚Äôs request to help facilitate the ceasefire.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe hope the ceasefire will continue as agreed upon, and we urge both the US and Iran to return to the negotiating table with the aim of reaching a comprehensive diplomatic solution, something that Qatar has consistently sought,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He added that Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian expressed regret in a phone call with Qatar‚Äôs ruling Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani that Tehran‚Äôs target in retaliating for US airstrikes was a military base in Qatar.</p>
<p>Sheikh Mohammed also urged Washington and Tehran to resume Oman-mediated talks on Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme that were frozen when Israel began striking Iran.</p>
<p>He said that Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, was working on resuming talks for a fresh ceasefire in the Gaza conflict.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are still continuing our efforts, and God willing, we will try to look for an opportunity during the next two days for having indirect negotiations between the two parties,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe hope that the Israeli side will not exploit the ceasefire with Iran to unleash what it wants to unleash on Gaza and continue its bombing of‚Äù the strip, Sheikh Mohammed added.</p>

<p>Separately, a source with knowledge of the talks said Qatar‚Äôs prime minister persuaded Iran to agree to the US-proposed ceasefire with Israel after Iranian missiles targeted the American base near Doha.</p>
<p>Sheikh Mohammed spoke to the Iranians at Washington‚Äôs request following Monday‚Äôs unprecedented attack on Qatari soil, the source told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the aftermath of the strikes on Al Udeid [military base], President [Donald] Trump told the Emir of Qatar [that] Israel had signed off on an American ceasefire proposal,‚Äù the source said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe US president then asked that Qatar help get Iran to agree to a deal,‚Äù the source added, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.</p>
<p>US Vice President JD Vance spoke to the Qatari prime minister, ‚Äúwho persuaded Iran to agree to the proposal in a call with the Iranians‚Äù, the source said.</p>
<p>Israel said today it had agreed to the ceasefire, which is now ‚Äúin effect‚Äù, according to Trump.</p>
<p>Iran has yet to formally accept the truce, but its top security body said the Islamic Republic‚Äôs forces had ‚Äúcompelled‚Äù Israel to ‚Äúunilaterally‚Äù cease fire.</p></p>

            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919759/defence-minister-asif-blasts-western-hypocrisy-says-iran-never-initiated-war-with-israel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <h2>Defence Minister Asif blasts ‚Äòwestern hypocrisy‚Äô, says Iran never initiated war with Israel</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has strongly condemned the Israeli aggression towards Iran and criticised the Western world‚Äôs ‚Äúdouble standard‚Äù, saying that the International Atomic Energy Agency‚Äôs (IAEA) performance was ‚Äútainted with hypocrisy and a selective approach‚Äù.</p>
<p>Asif earlier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919222/pakistan-stands-firm-with-iran-asif">stressed</a> that Pakistan stood in ‚Äúcomplete solidarity‚Äù with Iran amid Israel‚Äôs unprovoked and ‚Äúunjustified aggression‚Äù against Tehran, which began on June 13 and escalated over 12 days. The conflict intensified after the US intervened by striking three of Iran‚Äôs nuclear sites. Tehran first responded by launching missiles at Tel Aviv, then targeted US bases in Qatar following the American strikes. On Tuesday morning, US President Donald Trump announced that Iran and Israel had reached a ‚Äúceasefire‚Äù.</p>
<p>Israel, without evidence, claimed that its initial strike on Iran was ‚Äúpreventive‚Äù, meant to address an immediate, inevitable threat from the Islamic Republic‚Äôs part to construct a nuclear bomb. Tel Aviv also suggested that the IAEA report released on June 12, which condemned Iran for material violations of its Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) commitments until the early 2000s, constituted such an emergency. However, the IAEA also seemed to reject that claim, since there was nothing in the report that was not already known to the relevant parties, according to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/6/15/the-real-reason-israel-attacked-iran" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a>.</em></p>
<p>In an <a class="link--external" href="https://www.irna.ir/news/85871529/%D9%88%D8%B2%DB%8C%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D9%BE%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%BA%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D9%88-%D8%A2%DA%98%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B3-%D8%A8%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%84%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B1%DA%98%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%A2%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%87" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with an Iranian state-run news agency <em>IRNA</em> in Islamabad, Asif said, ‚ÄúUnlike Iran, the Westerners have destroyed the opportunity for diplomacy and are the cause of the beginning of the aggressions of the Zionist regime and the United States.‚Äù</p>
<p>The defence minister emphasised that Iran‚Äôs approach had been ‚Äúvery constructive‚Äô and Tehran never sought confrontation, adding that Israel wanted to ‚Äúovershadow the region to push the situation towards war‚Äù.</p>
<p>He added that ‚Äúa regime that is not even a member of the NPT and there is no monitoring and inspection of its nuclear arsenals, can do anything and has the authorisation to carry out any aggression and attack on Palestine, Gaza, Yemen and now against Iran.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll these countries are the targets of these deliberate and reckless actions of Tel Aviv, which is not held accountable by the IAEA,‚Äù Asif further said.</p>
<p>He condemned Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúterrorist attacks and the US aggressive crime against Iran‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">nuclear facilities</a>‚Äù, considering these actions contrary to international law, the UN Charter and humanitarian norms.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think the situation has escalated to a dangerous level, especially over the past few weeks when Iran continuously emphasised the need for negotiations and participation in this entire process, and that the Iranians have never left the negotiating table,‚Äù he was quoted as saying by <em>IRNA</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIran has never initiated the war, but both the destruction of diplomacy and the initiation of the war were carried out by the other side (America and Israel), which led to the illegitimate aggression of Israel against the nation,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Asif further said, ‚ÄúIt is ridiculous that the West always wants Iran to return to the negotiating table, because the Iranians did not leave the negotiating table, but have always demanded interaction and negotiations.‚Äù</p>
<p>He noted that even when Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was negotiating with the Europeans, another aggression against the country took place.</p>
<p>Asif said Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúcontinued aggression against Palestinians had now reached Iran‚Äù, calling it a ‚Äúconspiracy planned and implemented by the Zionist regime‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIranians stand with Palestine, and this is never a crime. Human dignity and the defence of religious values must be followed by the international community, and they must stand against Israeli aggression and rush to help the Palestinians,‚Äù he reaffirmed.</p>
<p>He added that the US and Israel were trampling on all international laws, human values and traditions, and ‚Äúmassacring children, women, old and young in Gaza‚Äù.</p>
<p>The defence minister told the people of Iran to stand firm and steadfast because ‚ÄúGod is with them and all nations in the world feel the pain of the Iranian nation because this is a crime and a clear aggression against Iran, and these crimes will definitely be responded to.‚Äù</p></p>
