            <p><p>Pakistan has conducted a successful training launch of the Abdali Weapon System, a surface-to-surface missile with a range of 450 kilometres, the military‚Äôs media affairs wing said on Saturday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile‚Äôs advanced navigation system and enhanced maneuverability features,‚Äù the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release.</p>
<p>It noted that the launch was a part of ‚ÄúEx Indus‚Äù and was witnessed by the commander of the Army Strategic Forces Command (AFSC), senior officials from the Strategic Plans Division and the AFSC, as well as scientists and engineers from Pakistan‚Äôs strategic organisations.</p>

<p>President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza and the services chiefs extended their congratulations to the participating troops, scientists, and engineers, the ISPR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey expressed complete confidence in the operational preparedness and technical proficiency of Pakistan‚Äôs Strategic Forces to ensure credible minimum deterrence and safeguard national security against any aggression,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>The test launch comes amid heightened tensions between nuclear powers Pakistan and India in the wake of New Delhi‚Äôs aggressive measures in the wake of a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt could be an important part of President [Donald] Trump‚Äôs legacy to attend to this situation ‚Äî not with a Band-Aid solution, but by addressing the core issue: the Kashmir dispute,‚Äù Pakistan‚Äôs Ambassador to the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855847">Rizwan Saeed Sheikh</a> said in an interview with <em>Fox News Digital</em> published earlier today.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is one nuclear flashpoint,‚Äù the envoy said.</p>

<p>Sheikh‚Äôs statement echoes his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907760/pm-shehbaz-thanks-china-for-endorsing-pakistans-proposal-of-neutral-probe-into-pahalgam-attack#:~:text=Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20envoy%20calls%20on%20Trump%20to%20ease%20tensions%20with%20India%3A%20report">recent call to Trump</a> to step in and help ease soaring tensions with India. He had highlighted that as a president ‚Äústanding for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration‚Äù, there was no ‚Äúhigher or flashier flashpoint‚Äù than the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>Trump, in his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=Overseas%20wars%20and%20plans%20for%20peace">inaugural speech</a> as the US president, had said: ‚ÄúMy proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.‚Äù</p>
<p>A ceasefire ‚Äî which has since been broken ‚Äî was secured between <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886289">Israel and Hamas</a> following Trump‚Äôs election, and he has also been engaging with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906950">Ukraine and Russia</a> to halt their war.</p>
<p>During his interview with <em>Fox News</em>, Sheikh also called on nations around the globe to help with a lasting settlement to the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>He said: ‚ÄúPreviously, when the situation has been at this level or the tensions have escalated, the international community has attended to the situation, but taken their eyes [and] attention away, even before the situation could fully diffuse.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis time, perhaps it would be [‚Ä¶] timely in terms of the situation elsewhere on the globe, with similar instances, [‚Ä¶] to perhaps not afford a Band-Aid solution, but to address the broader problem.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAny misadventure or miscalculation can lead to a nuclear interface,‚Äù the ambassador was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúThat is certainly not desirable in such a densely populated region.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe want a peaceful neighbourhood,‚Äù Sheikh emphasised, adding that Pakistan did not want any instability in the region.</p>
<p>However, he stressed, Pakistan‚Äôs desire for peace ‚Äúshould not in any way be misconstrued as a sign of weakness‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe want peace with dignity.‚Äù</p>
<p>Sheikh described India‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">response</a> to the Pahalgam attack as dangerously premature and inflammatory, according to the report.</p>

<p>The envoy reiterated Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif‚Äôs offer to hold a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral and transparent</a>‚Äù probe into the Pahalgam attack. He pointed out that both the investigation offer and Pakistan‚Äôs request for evidence linking it to the attack had gone ‚Äúunanswered‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWithin minutes of the attack, India began levelling accusations against Pakistan,‚Äù he said, noting that a post-investigation report was filed just 10 minutes after the incident occurred, despite the remote and rugged terrain near the scene.</p>
<p>The ambassador warned that the region was once again being held ‚Äúhostage to the war of hysteria‚Äù by India‚Äôs government and media, who immediately ‚Äúbegan beating war drums‚Äù.</p>
<p>On the allegations implied by India, which has not yet named Pakistan or any entity directly, Sheikh said the suspects were reportedly Indian nationals whose homes have already been raided.</p>
<p>He questioned why India is looking outside its borders rather than addressing ‚Äúadministrative inadequacies‚Äù in occupied Kashmir. He slammed India‚Äôs broader policies in held Kashmir, including the alleged settlement of non-residents into the region.</p>

<p>Speaking about India‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unilateral suspension</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>, Ambassador Sheikh said: ‚ÄúThat is as grossly illegal as it can get. This is one treaty that has withstood wars between India and Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>Law Minister Azam Naz¬≠eer Tarar said yesterday that Pakistan‚Äôs final response to India‚Äôs letters on the IWT <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908128/multiple-ministries-to-craft-pakistans-response-on-iwt">would be crafted</a> in consultation with all relevant ministries, including foreign affairs, water resources and law.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik has also said Islamabad would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907454">approach international forums</a>, including the World Bank that brokered it, regarding the treaty‚Äôs suspension.</p></p>
