            <p><p>Three people were killed and seven others were injured as a passenger bus was fired upon in Balochistan’s Kalat, according to the provincial government spokesperson.</p>
<p>A statement from Shahid Rind said: “Three passengers were martyred and seven were injured in the tragic incident” when a shooting occurred on a passenger coach coming from Karachi to Quetta in Kalat’s Nemargh area.</p>
<p>He said the injured were being moved to the District Headquarters Hospital Kalat for treatment, adding that an emergency had been imposed at the facility. Meanwhile, an update from the EdhI Foundation rescue service put the number of injured at 10, saying they were taken to Civil Hospital Quetta for treatment.</p>
<p>“Security agencies, district administration and rescue teams have immediately reached the scene. Security forces have surrounded the area and a search operation is underway. Security forces are pursuing the attackers,” Rind said.</p>

<p>Speaking to <em>Geo News</em>, he said Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti had taken notice of the incident and sought a report from police and law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>“Based on initial info, terrorists were sitting in ambush, they stopped the bus and then attacked. We cannot confirm the number of terrorists, but it was carried out from both sides of the road,” Rind said.</p>
<p>State broadcaster <em>PTV</em> also posted a video of a passenger who said the terrorists had indiscriminately fired at the bus.</p>
<p>It also shared a statement from security sources that said: “Ever since the security forces started successful operations against the terrorists of <em>Fitna-Al-Hindustan</em> and the FC (Frontier Corps) sealed the border, cutting off their smuggling income, these cowardly terrorists, in a state of frustration, are targeting the lives of innocent people.</p>
<p>“One of the two reasons for terrorist attacks on passenger buses on highways is that they are soft targets. The second reason is that by carrying out such incidents, they want to divert the army and FC from the border and operation areas to these locations so that the terrorists can operate more easily in the border and operation areas.”</p>

<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the shooting in Kalat in a statement from his office, extending his condolences and assailing <em>Fitna-Al-Hindustan</em> — a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">term</a> the government uses for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan — for targeting civilians.</p>
<p>“The targeting of innocent passengers by <em>Fitna-Al-Hindustan</em> terrorists is a very cowardly act,” he was quoted as saying. “These terrorists are hatching a heinous conspiracy to sabotage peace by targeting soft targets. With the support of the nation, we will foil these conspiracies by Indian-sponsored terrorists.”</p>
<p>“The attack on the passenger coach in Qalat is a cowardly and despicable act of terrorism. The loss of precious lives is an irreparable tragedy. The terrorist organisations of <em>Fitna-Al-Hindustan</em> have previously carried out attacks based on identity, but now they are indiscriminately targeting civilians, which clearly shows that this war is against every ordinary Pakistani, and we will defeat it at all costs!” CM Bugti said in a post on X.</p>

<p>The incident comes a week after at <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923342/passengers-kidnapped-in-sardhaka-rescue-operation-underway-balochistan-govt">least nine passengers</a> travelling on two Punjab-bound coaches were abducted and killed by unidentified armed men in the Sur-Dakai area, situated on the border between Balochistan’s Zhob and Loralai districts.</p>
<p>The government had said that <em>Fitna-Al-Hindu­stan</em> had carried out attacks at three different places — Kakat, Mastung and Sur-Dakai.</p>
<p>The Balochistan Liberation Front, a banned outfit, later claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group said it had killed the nine individuals after blocking the highway between Musakhail-Makhtar and Khajuri.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923476/bodies-of-slain-passengers-in-balochistan-bus-killing-sent-to-punjab-hometowns-official">sources</a>, two passenger coaches en route to Punjab were intercepted in the Sur-Dakai area near the N-70 highway, close to Dab — a place along the Loralai-Zhob border. A group of armed men had blocked the road and stopped the two vehicles.</p>
<p>The armed assailants boarded the coaches, checked the identity cards of passengers and forced 10 persons off the vehicles at gunpoint. “They dragged out 10 passengers — seven from one coach and three from the other — and took them away (to an unknown place),” a surviving passenger had told Levies. “I don’t know what they did to them, but I heard gunfire as we were leaving.”</p>
<p>After abducting the nine passengers, the assailants allowed both coaches to leave the area. According to sources, the attackers had checked the national identity cards of all passengers and specifically targeted individuals with Punjab addresses. They also opened fire on the coaches during the abduction to prevent any escape.</p>
<p>In May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna-Al-Hindu­stan</em>.</p>
<p>In March, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900559/several-killed-vehicles-torched-in-balochistan">five people</a> were killed by armed men who blocked the highway in the Kalmat area of Gwadar district, while three long-body trailers carrying urea from Gwadar port were set on fire in the Tajaban area.</p>
<p>In February, seven Punjab-bound passengers were offloaded from a bus and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892974/">shot dead</a> in Barkhan district. The incident came days after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892214">12 were killed</a> in a blast targeting a bus carrying coal miners in Harnai.</p>
<p>Balochistan has witnessed a spate of attacks targeting those hailing from Punjab. In two separate incidents in April 2024, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1827193">nine people</a> were killed after being forced off a bus near Noshki, while <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1830243">two labourers</a> from Punjab were shot in Kech.</p>
<p>In May last year, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832433">seven barbers</a> from Punjab were shot dead near Gwadar, while August saw <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854830">23 travellers</a> offloaded from trucks and buses and shot in the Musakhail district.</p>
<p>The Musakhail incident was part of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855006">flare-up of violence</a>, where dozens of militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army — a separatist outfit — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854776/gun-grenade-attacks-in-balochistan">launched numerous attacks</a> across Balochistan, targeting security personnel as well as civilians.</p>

<p>Separately, the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in Awaran district today based on the reported presence of <em>Fitna-Al-Hindustan</em> terrorists.</p>
<p>“During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the terrorist location and, resultantly, three Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell.”</p>
<p>However, the ISPR said that 34-year-old Major Syed Rabnawaz Tariq from Muzaffarabad district was martyred during the intense fire exchange while leading his troops from the front.</p>
<p>“Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p>The interior minister praised the martyr and said his sacrifice would not go in vain while paying tribute to him.</p>

            <p><p>Israel bombed the Syrian army’s headquarters in Damascus on Wednesday after warning the government to leave the country’s Druze minority alone, as authorities announced a ceasefire in the community’s southern heartland after deadly sectarian clashes.</p>
<p>Syrian government forces entered the majority-Druze city of Sweida on Tuesday with the stated aim of overseeing a ceasefire agreed with Druze community leaders following <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924259">days of fighting</a> with local Bedouin tribes.</p>
<p>However, witnesses reported that the government forces joined with the Bedouin in attacking Druze fighters and civilians in a bloody rampage through the city.</p>
<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said that the violence in Sweida province since Sunday had left more than 300 people dead, including government forces, local fighters and 27 Druze civilians killed in “summary executions … by members of the defence and interior ministries”.</p>
<p>The Syrian presidency vowed to investigate the “heinous acts” in Sweida and to punish “all those proven to be involved”.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>State media said a fresh ceasefire had been agreed, announcing “the deployment of security checkpoints” in Sweida city. A previous truce declared on Tuesday appeared to have had little effect on the ground.</p>
<p>The fighting was the most serious outbreak of violence in Syria since government forces battled Druze fighters in Sweida province and near Damascus in April and May, leaving more than 100 people dead.</p>
<p>The authorities have had strained relations with Syria’s patchwork of religious and ethnic minorities since they toppled longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in December.</p>
<p>Israel, which has its own Druze community, has presented itself as a defender of the group, although some analysts say that is a pretext for pursuing its own military goal of keeping Syrian government forces as far from their shared frontier as possible.</p>
<p>Following Assad’s fall, the Israeli military took control of the UN-monitored demilitarised zone in the Golan Heights and conducted hundreds of strikes on military targets in Syria.</p>
<p>Syrian state TV reported several Israeli strikes today near the army and defence ministry headquarters in central Damascus, with Israel’s army saying it had “struck the entrance of the Syrian regime’s military headquarters”.</p>

<p><em>AFP</em> images showed the side of a building in the defence complex in ruins after the strike, as smoke billowed over the area.</p>
<p>Israel said it had also struck a “military target” in the area of the presidential palace in Damascus.</p>
<p>The Syrian health ministry said that at least one person was killed and 18 others wounded in the strikes on Damascus.</p>

<p>Turkey, which has backed Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s administration, said “Israel’s attacks on Damascus … constitute an act of sabotage against Syria’s efforts to secure peace, stability and security.”</p>
<p>Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz called on Damascus to “leave the Druze in Sweida alone”, later threatening to unleash “painful blows” to “eliminate the forces that attacked the Druze until their full withdrawal” from Syria’s south.</p>
<p>Israel said it was sending more troops to the armistice line between the occupied Golan Heights and Syrian-controlled territory.</p>
<p>A military official said some troops would be redeployed there from the Gaza Strip, where Israel’s conflict against Hamas was in its 22nd month.</p>
<p>Dozens of people were crossing the heavily fortified Golan frontier, according to an <em>AFP</em> correspondent in Majdal Shams, a mainly Druze town in the Israeli-annexed area.</p>
<p>A military statement said Israeli forces were “operating to prevent the infiltration” from Syrian territory and to “safely return the civilians who crossed the border” from the Israeli-controlled side.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in February that southern Syria must be completely demilitarised, warning that Israel would not accept the presence of forces of the government near territory it controls.</p>
<p>The head of the Druze community in Israel, Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, called the situation “an existential battle for the Druze community”.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#abuses-must-stop" id="abuses-must-stop" title="Permalink"></a>Abuses ‘must stop’</h2>
<p>Sporadic gunfire continued to ring out in Sweida today, an <em>AFP</em> correspondent reported before the latest ceasefire was announced.</p>
<p>The correspondent counted the bodies of around 30 combatants, some in plain clothes and some in military uniform.</p>
<p>The Observatory, witnesses and Druze armed groups have said government forces took part in fighting alongside the Bedouin against the Druze.</p>
<p>The Syrian defence ministry accused “outlaw groups” of attacking its forces inside the city, saying they are now “continuing to respond to the sources of fire”.</p>
<p>The Bedouin and the Druze have been at loggerheads for decades, with the latest violence triggered by the kidnapping of a Druze vegetable merchant, the Observatory said.</p>
<p>Since they toppled Assad in December, Syria’s authorities and their allies have been repeatedly accused of not doing enough to protect the country’s religious and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>The United States, a close ally of Israel, was “talking to both sides, all the relevant sides on this and hopefully we can bring it to a conclusion, but we’re very concerned”, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump’s administration asked Israel again to halt strikes on Syria and engage in dialogue with the government in Damascus, <em>Axios</em> correspondent Barak Ravid reported, citing a senior US official.</p>
<p>Neither <em>Axios</em> nor Ravid said whether that request came before or after Israeli strikes on Syria’s military headquarters and near the presidential palace in Damascus.</p>

<p>Germany criticised the airstrikes, urging Tel Aviv to refrain from actions that could destabilise the country, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/germany-criticizes-israeli-airstrikes-on-southern-syria-warns-of-destabilization/3632531" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anadolu</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>The six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) also condemned the attacks on Damascus in the “strongest terms”, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://aje.io/oy4iku?update=3841022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>In a statement, GCC Secretary-General Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi said the air campaign represented a “flagrant violation” of Syria’s sovereignty, “a breach of international laws and norms, and a serious threat to regional security and stability”.</p>
<p>Albudaiwi reiterated the GCC’s support for Syria’s territorial integrity, adding that the continuation of the repeated Israeli attacks had constituted an “irresponsible escalation” and disregarded international efforts to achieve stability in Syria and the region.</p>
<p>He also called for international action to stop the “serious violations, hold the perpetrators accountable, and work diligently to protect the Syrian people and preserve its sovereignty in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law”.​</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924606/imran-prohibits-pti-members-from-going-public-with-partys-internal-matters' target='_blank'><strong>Imran prohibits PTI members from going public with party’s internal matters</strong></a>
            <p><p>PTI founder Imran Khan has prohibited his party members from publicly discussing the party’s internal matters, according to his conversation with his family and lawyers at Adiala Jail shared on his official X account on Wednesday.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur seemed to throw a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924027">wrench</a> in the works of a nationwide <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923856/pti-brass-gathers-in-lahore-to-kick-start-aug-5-movement">protest</a>, annou­nced by Imran, which is expected to climax on August 5, marking two years of the former prime minister’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisonment</a>.</p>
<p>At a press conference on Sunday, where party leaders were expected to announce the plan for this protest, CM Gandapur caused confusion when he came up with a new 90-day timeline for what he called ‘a final push’, with PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik later <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924027#:~:text=is%20no%20politics%E2%80%9D.-,Dissent%20from%20Aliya,-PTI%20Punjab%20chief">expressing</a> her reservations over this announcement.</p>
<p>“Publicly airing internal matters or individual concerns before the media is entirely unacceptable,” Imran’s post <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ImranKhanPTI/status/1945485693289124204" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">read</a>.</p>
<p>“My instruction is firm: whether a senior officeholder or a junior member, no one is to express internal differences on social media, electronic media, print media, or any other platform,” he added.</p>
<p>“At this time, many, including myself, are enduring some of the harshest imprisonments. Therefore, I direct every member of the party to put aside all personal grievances,” Imran continued.</p>
<p>He called upon the party to focus exclusively on the protest movement so that fundamental human rights are restored in Pakistan.</p>
<p>“If any party official fails to participate in this movement, I will make the final decision about them myself, even from within jail.”</p>
<p>Malik was conspicuous by her absence at the press conference by KP CM Gandapur. While PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja explained that she was “busy”, she questioned this claim in a subsequent tweet.</p>
<p>“What strategy has been announced for the release of Imran Khan, how and where the protest campaign will begin? Who replaced the Aug 5 plan with 90 days?”</p>
<p>“I myself do not know where I was busy for the past two days,” she said, in a jibe at Raja.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920543">dec­ision</a> of the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench on the reserved seats dealt a serious blow to the PTI, which is already emb­roiled in numerous challenges, including internal disunity.</p>
<p>Background briefings revealed a complete lack of trust among PTI leaders, with doubts about each other’s sincerity and intentions, particularly regarding Imran’s messages.</p>
<p>Earlier in June, as the KP government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919906/midnight-passage-of-kp-budget-exposes-rifts-within-pti">passed</a> the budget for the upcoming financial year without the approval of the PTI founder, his sister Aleema Khan claimed that a “minus Imran” formula was now in effect.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media, Aleema had said that if KP CM Gandapur lacked the courage to stand his ground, he should have resigned.</p>
<p>Later, she <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921946">clarified</a> that she meant that the government, not his party, was trying to isolate her brother.</p>
<p>“Minus Imran Khan, is the government trying to minus him. Is it not minusing that they imprisoned him?” she had said.</p>
<p>Many senior party members <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920889/lack-of-trust-sparks-fissures-within-pti#:~:text=senior%20party%20members-,believed,-that%20the%20party">believed</a> that the party was facing a crisis-like situation due to a “communication gap” and the leadership’s failure to hold regular meetings with the jailed leader.</p>
<p>Another senior leader suggested that Aleema Khan’s statement was emotional and provided an opportunity for Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to criticise the party.</p></p>
