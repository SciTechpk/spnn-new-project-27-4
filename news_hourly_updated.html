                <h2>Imran decries lack of ‚Äòmeaningful momentum‚Äô for Aug 5 protest, orders PTI to shun all differences</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Incarcerated PTI founder and ex-prime minister Imran Khan has decried the lack of any ‚Äúmeaningful momentum‚Äù for the party‚Äôs planned <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922952/imran-shuns-dialogue-plans-nationwide-protest">August 5 protest</a> and ordered its members to immediately shun all their differences.</p>
<p>Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a ¬£190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. He has issued a nationwide protest call, which will reach its ‚Äúpeak‚Äù on Aug 5 to mark the second year of his incarceration in multiple cases.</p>
<p>However, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur appeared to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924027">disrupt</a> the nationwide protest plans and sow confusion by introducing a new 90-day timeline for what he described as ‚Äòa final push‚Äô. PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik later voiced her reservations about his announcement.</p>
<p>The resulting discord in the party leadership and ranks had prompted Imran to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924606/imran-prohibits-pti-members-from-going-public-with-partys-internal-matters">prohibit</a> his party members from publicly discussing the party‚Äôs internal matters.</p>
<p>In a post today on his X account ‚Äî which is not operated by Imran himself ‚Äî a message said to be sent on his behalf stated: ‚ÄúLet me make this absolutely clear: every member of the party must immediately set aside all internal differences and focus solely on the movement planned for August 5th. I do not see any meaningful momentum building behind this initiative at present. I am waging a battle against a 78-year-old system, and my greatest success is that despite unprecedented oppression, the public stands firmly with me.‚Äù</p>
<p>The message said the people had expressed their trust in the PTI by voting for it in the general elections, even in the absence of an electoral symbol.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter such a clear mandate, it is the moral and political responsibility of every party member to become the voice of the people. It will be nothing short of disgraceful and condemnable if PTI leaders waste time on internal conflicts at this critical juncture.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnyone found engaging in factionalism within the party will be expelled. I am fighting for the future of our generations and every sacrifice I make is for that cause. To create rifts within the party at this time would be a direct betrayal of my mission and vision,‚Äù the message warned.</p>

<p>Lashing out at the government, the message said it had ‚Äúcrippled the judiciary‚Äù through the 26th Constitutional Amendment.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe way biased judges are now delivering blatantly unjust verdicts under these courts is visible to the entire nation. We must launch a robust campaign to liberate the judiciary, for no nation can survive, let alone progress, without judicial independence.‚Äù</p>
<p>The message claimed ‚Äúinhumane conditions‚Äù were being imposed upon Imran‚Äôs spouse and former first lady Bushra Bibi while the PTI founder‚Äôs conditions were themselves not good.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am enduring the harshest prison term in the country‚Äôs history solely for the supremacy of the Constitution and in service of my nation. The level of oppression and authoritarianism is such that even the water I have for ablution is filthy and contaminated with dirt, unfit for any human being.‚Äù</p>
<p>Separately, a post from PTI‚Äôs central deputy information secretary said the nationwide protest would be led under the banner of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP).</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll provincial organisations will follow their respective plans of action based on their circumstances.‚Äù</p>

<p>Addressing a press conference with other TTAP leaders, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said the first step of the protest movement would be an all-party conference in Islamabad on July 31 and the decisions taken then would shape the future plan of action.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Imran‚Äôs sons continued their engagements in the United States, where they currently are before visiting Pakistan for their father.</p>
<p>They met Republican Congressman Joe Wilson of South Carolina who had introduced a bipartisan bill in the US House of Representatives in March, calling for sanctions on Pakistani state functionaries over alleged human rights violations, including the ‚Äúpersecution‚Äù of their father.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI am concerned to hear that Khan remains isolated from his family, friends, attorneys and doctors. His sons also shared that his physical health may be deteriorating.

                <h2>11 suspects sent on 2-day physical remand in Swat student death case</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Khwazakhela judicial magistrate on Thursday handed over 11 suspects to police custody on a two-day physical remand in relation to the  death of a madressah student in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Swat.</p>
<p>A young student was allegedly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926053/swat-student-death-case-authorities-seal-madressah-police-return-students-to-families">beaten to death</a> by his madressah teachers on Monday evening in Swat‚Äôs Chaliyar village. He was rushed to the nearest hospital by students and teachers, but doctors declared him dead upon arrival. Police announced the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926111/swat-police-arrest-11-in-seminary-student-murder-case">arrest of 11 individuals</a> a day ago, including the administrator of the unregistered seminary, in connection with the brutal killing.</p>
<p>The police presented the 11 suspects before the Khwazakhela judicial magistrate today ‚Äî the administrator of the madressah and another key individual.</p>
<p>Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Omar Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the police had formed special teams and a search operation was underway to apprehend the remaining two suspects.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have some key leads to locate the main suspects and will reach them soon,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the provincial head of Wifaqul Madaris Al-Arabia, Maulana Hussain Ahmad, strongly condemned the brutal beating and killing of the student. He called the incident ‚Äúa deeply tragic and painful event‚Äù for the entire community.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is unfortunate that in the aftermath of this incident, a targeted propaganda campaign has been launched against Islamic seminaries, ignoring their decades of collective service to society,‚Äù Ahmad said at a press conference, where multiple other religious leaders and scholars expressed their condolences.</p>
<p>A day earlier, authorities said that the madressah where the incident occurred had been sealed, adding that police detained all madressah staff, with nine more taken into custody. A case was registered on the police‚Äôs complaint under the Child Protection Act.</p>
<p>Under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act 2010 and its 2018 regulations, corporal punishment is a punishable offence, violation of which can result in up to six months of imprisonment or a Rs50,000 fine, or both.</p>
<p>In May this year, the KP Private Schools Regulatory Authority, through a <a class="link--external" href="https://psra.gkp.pk/notification/15/detail" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a>, strictly prohibited corporal punishment in all private schools across the province after receiving complaints.</p>
<p>Violations, however, continue to prevail. According to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924804/crisis-of-protection-child-rights-violations-surge-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa">recent report</a> by the KP Child Protection and Welfare Commission, children across the province were subjected to 33 different forms of abuses, including 14 incidents of corporal punishment.</p>
<p>In April, a seminary teacher in Kasur was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905109">arrested</a> for allegedly beating a student with a hot iron for not memorising his lesson at Bangla Kambovan.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#cleric-arrested-in-swabi-for-torturing-minor-at-mosque" id="cleric-arrested-in-swabi-for-torturing-minor-at-mosque" title="Permalink"></a>Cleric arrested in Swabi for torturing minor at mosque</h2>
<p>Separately, a cleric was arrested in the Swabi district for ‚Äútorturing‚Äù a six-year-old child in a local mosque in Swabi‚Äôs Chota Lahor area, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Muhammad Noman said.</p>
<p>He said, ‚ÄúThe cleric tortured the child for not remembering his lesson,‚Äù adding that a case was registered against the suspect under Section 44 of the KP Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010.</p>
<p>According to a first information report (FIR), seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, the incident occurred a day ago at 6pm.</p>
<p>According to a press release issued by the DPO office, the father of the child informed the police that his son was acquiring religious education at the Jamia Masjid in Meera Dhok, Mohalla, near Chota Lahor.</p>
<p>The father said his son went to the mosque as per his normal routine, but red marks were clearly visible on his son‚Äôs back and he was in pain when he returned home, adding that his teacher had beaten the child with a stick for being late.</p>
<p>The statement said a police team immediately reached the spot and arrested the suspect, registering a case against him.</p>
<p>DSP Noman said that such incidents should be reported to the local police immediately and they were bound to take prompt and result-oriented steps.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe children of this society are the children of all of us,‚Äù he said in a press conference.</p></p>
