            <p><p>Pakistan’s top military man General Sahir Shamshad Mirza has stressed the need to move towards conflict resolution instead of management, warning that its absence could result in a destructive escalation.</p>
<p>The remarks follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. As New Delhi launched <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> in early May, killing civilians, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downed five Indian jets</a> in retaliation. After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>Gen Mirza, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, made the remarks at the annual <a class="link--external" href="https://www.iiss.org/events/shangri-la-dialogue/shangri-la-dialogue-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shangri-La Dialogue 2025</a> organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore on Saturday evening.</p>
<p>During a panel discussion, titled “<a class="link--external" href="https://www.iiss.org/events/shangri-la-dialogue/shangri-la-dialogue-2025/special-sessions/special-session-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Regional Crisis-Management Mechanisms</a>”, Gen Mirza said: “It has become imperative to move beyond conflict management towards conflict resolution. This will ensure sustainable peace and an assured crisis management.”</p>
<p>He then stressed that an “early resolution of Kashmir in line with the UN Security Council <a class="link--external" href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/111955/?ln=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resolutions</a> and as per the aspirations of the people is essential” for an enduring peace in South Asia.</p>
<p>The CJCSC cautioned: “Given the Indian policies and polities’ extremist mindset, the absence of a crisis management mechanism may not give enough time to the global powers to intervene and affect cessation of hostilities. They will be probably too late to avoid damage and destruction.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>During his address, Gen Mirza also highlighted the Kashmir dispute and the recent military clash between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>“When there is no crisis, Kashmir is never discussed, and as we always say that it is the Kashmir dispute resolution in line with the aspirations of the people of Kashmir and in line with the <a class="link--external" href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/111955/?ln=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UNSC resolutions</a> that will address many issues.</p>
<p>“The core that resides between Pakistan and India is Kashmir,” the CJCSC pointed out.</p>
<p>He added that unless countries did not “enter conflict resolution” — which he said could initially be through conflict management and then lead to resolution — issues would “always erupt”.</p>
<p>Other speakers on the panel included Canada’s Deputy Minister of National Defence Stefanie Beck and Fiji’s army chief Major Gen Jone Logavatu Kalouniwai. India’s Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan also addressed a separate <a class="link--external" href="https://www.iiss.org/events/shangri-la-dialogue/shangri-la-dialogue-2025/special-sessions/special-session-1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discussion</a> on defence innovation yesterday.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Gen Mirza said the recent Pak-India escalation had underscored “how regional crisis management frameworks remain hostage to countries’ belligerence”, noting that the only line of contact between the two countries was the director general military operations <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911867">(DGMO) hotline</a>.</p>
<p>The top general further said that following the military conflict, the “threshold of an escalatory war has come dangerously low, implying greater risk on both sides, not just in the disputed territory but all of India and all of Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“Emboldening of India as a net security provider by the West and its ambition to become a regional hegemon is disincentivising it to engage in conflict management options,” CJCSC Mirza asserted.</p>
<p>He went on to state that Pakistan desired a “peaceful coexistence with India based on mutual respect, sovereign equality and most importantly, dignity and honour”.</p>
<p>“We seek a principal order, an order anchored in sovereign equality and restraint. In this, crisis management is not merely a set of tools but a strategic ethic,” he added.</p>
<p>The CJCSC stressed the need for instead of chalking out new mechanisms, the Asia-Pacific and South Asia regions required to re-energise and strengthen existing bilateral, regional and multilateral frameworks. “States need to communicate more and more often and more effectively.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#conventional-warfare-threshold-now-dangerously-lower" id="conventional-warfare-threshold-now-dangerously-lower" title="Permalink"></a>‘Conventional warfare threshold now dangerously lower’</h2>
<p>During the IISS session, Gen Mirza also asserted that following the Pakistan-India military clash, the threshold of conventional warfare had “significantly degraded” to “dangerous levels”.</p>
<p>“The lowering of this threshold to the dangerous levels, if next time such a conflict occurs and the cities are targeted first and the borders become irrelevant mostly, […] there could be a chance — I’m not trying to create an alarm but I’m speaking based on logic — there could be a possibility that before the international community intervenes because of the restricted or constricted times window, the damage and destruction may have already taken place,” he warned.</p>
<p>Gen Mirza pointed out that the 1965 and 1971 wars with India were “always confined to the disputed territory”. “[However,] this time, it has transcended that and come to the international border.”</p>
<p>The CJCSC further noted: “Instead of targeting the borders first, which used to be the conventional domain or erstwhile domain, the cities have been targeted and the borders have relatively remained, if not silent, comfortable.”</p>

<p>On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi had launched a series of air strikes in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">Punjab</a> and Azad Kashmir, resulting in at least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910848">40 civilians</a> losing their lives with 121 others injured.</p>
<p>The military has confirmed that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910992">13 security personnel</a>, including members of the Pakistan Army and the Pakistan Air Force, were martyred while over 75 were injured during the confrontation with India.</p>
<p>Noting that by those attacks, India had “crossed the threshold of disputed territory into the international border”, Gen Mirza said it had significantly lowered the threshold.</p>
<p>Highlighting the absence of a crisis management mechanism, “jingoistic” role of Indian media and its leadership’s mindset, he said, “Had there been no third party mediation, it would have gone to the next levels.”</p>
<p>The CJCSC mentioned the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">United States</a>, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as the “interlocutors”.</p></p>

• Claims conflict never came close to a nuclear war<br />
• Says ‘channels of communication’ with Islamabad were open<br />
• BJP leader says PAF shot down five Indian aircraft</p>
<p>NEW DELHI: A day after a BJP politician and staunch critic of Prime Minister Nare­ndra Modi, Subrahmanyam Swamy, claimed Pakistan had downed five Indian planes in the recent military escalation, India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914500/indian-military-confirms-fighter-jets-shot-down-by-pakistan">top military general admitted losses.</a></p>
<p>In an interview with <em>Bloomberg</em> on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue on Saturday, Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan admitted losses but dismissed Pakistan’s claims that it shot down six Indian jets, including four Rafales, as “absolutely incorrect”.</p>

<p>“What is important is that, not the jet being down, but why they were being down… Why they were down, what mistakes were made — that are important. Numbers are not important,” he said.</p>
<p>In a separate interview to <em>Reuters</em>, Gen Chauhan said the losses India suffered were in the initial stages, on May 7, when it launched Operation Sindoor.</p>
<p>“What I can say is that on May 7, in the initial stages, there were losses… What was important is why these losses occur and what we will do after that,” he said.</p>

<p>However, the chief of defence staff said the armed forces were quick to analyse the “tactical mistakes”, remedy them, and again target Pakistan on May 8 and May 10.</p>
<p>“The good part is that we are able to understand the tactical mistake which we made, remedy it, rectify it, and then implement it again after two days and flew all our jets again, targeting at long range,” <em>India Today</em> quoted Gen Chauhan as saying.</p>
<p>It may be recalled that Pakistan military says India did not fly its fighter jets again in the conflict after suffering losses on May 7.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, former law minister Swamy became the most candid Indian to admit that Pakistan Air Force had shot down five Indian planes, including French-made Rafales. Speaking in an online interview, Dr Swamy blamed the French planes as being responsible for the losses, implying that the deal the prime minister had made for them was to blame. The interview came as Mr Modi went about holding mammoth meetings in Gujarat and other states claiming victory and threatening more dire conflict with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Gen Chauhan’s remarks were the most direct by the army so far on losses suffered during the hostilities, which came as India attacked nine alleged terror camps deep inside Pakistan. It was in response to the horrific Pahalgam attack, which left at least 25 tourists dead.</p>
<p>As Pakistan retaliated by launching a wave of drone attacks targeting Indian military facilities and border towns, the armed forces struck 11 vital airbases with long-range BrahMos missiles, <em>India Today</em> reported.</p>
<p>Previously, the armed for­ces had deflected questions abo­ut Indian jets being shot down by Pakistan. Addressing a press conference, Air Mar­shal A.K. Bharti, Director Gen­e­ral of Air Operations, said “losses are a part of any combat scenario”. However, he said all Indian pilots “were back”.</p>
<p>“We are in a combat scenario and losses are a part of it. Question is, have we achieved our objective? Answer is a thumping yes. At this time, I would not like to comment on that (loss of jets) as we are still in combat and give advantage to adversary. All our pilots are back home,” he claimed.</p>
<p>The chief of defence staff also claimed that the conflict never came close to a nuclear war, while underscoring that “channels of communication” with Pakistan were always open to control the situation.</p>
<p>This flies in the face of US President Donald Trump’s repeated assertion that he avoided a potential nuclear disaster by mediating the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, the news report said.</p>
<p>“I personally feel that there is a lot of space between conduct of conventional operations and the nuclear threshold,” Gen Chauhan told <em>Bloomberg</em>.</p>
<p>During the hostilities, Indian missiles and jets were able to bypass Chinese-supplied air defence systems to target Pakistani military sites, the report said.</p>

            <p><p>Thousands of Paris Saint-Germain supporters took to the streets of the French capital on Saturday to celebrate their club’s victory in the Champions League <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914402">final</a>, but clashes with the police led to the arrest of over 500 people, while two people lost their lives amid the celebrations in separate instances.</p>
<p>As per the French interior ministry, a woman riding a scooter died after she was hit by a car in the southwest of Paris, while a 17-year-old in the southwestern town of Dax was stabbed to death during the celebrations. In total, 559 people were arrested, including 491 in Paris.</p>
<p>The majority of fans celebrated peacefully, but Paris police said scuffles broke out near the city’s Champs-Elysees avenue and PSG’s Parc des Princes stadium, where 48,000 had watched the 5-0 win against Inter Milan in Munich on big screens.</p>
<p>Most of the people detained were suspected of possessing fireworks and causing disorder, Paris police said.</p>
<p><em>AFP</em> journalists saw police use a water cannon to stop a crowd reaching the Arc de Triomphe.</p>
<p>“Troublemakers on the Champs-Elysees were looking to create incidents and repeatedly came into contact with police by throwing large fireworks and other objects,” police said in a statement.</p>
<p>In a video posted by a user on X, police can be seen dispersing the fans.</p>

<p>Outside Paris, police said a car careered into fans celebrating PSG’s win in Grenoble in southeastern France, leaving four people injured, two of them seriously.</p>
<p>All of those hurt were from the same family, police said.</p>
<p>The driver handed himself in to the police and was placed under arrest.</p>
<p>A source close to the investigation said it was believed the driver had not acted intentionally.</p>
<p>In Paris, most fans showed their joy by singing and dancing in the streets, with cars sounding their horns, after their team won the biggest prize in European club football for the first time in their history.</p>

<p>“But we got our faith back this year with a team without stars. They’re 11 guys who play for each other.”</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron’s office said he would host the victorious players on Sunday to congratulate them.</p>
<p>In a separate message on <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/1928917769828913536" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">X</a>, Macron hailed a “day of glory for PSG”.</p>
<p>“Bravo, we are all proud,” he wrote. “Paris is the capital of Europe tonight.”</p>
<p>Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo hailed it as a “historic” win.</p>
<p>The PSG team will hold a victory parade on the Champs-Elysees on Sunday when tens of thousands of supporters are expected to gather to get a glimpse of their returning heroes.</p>

<p>Teenager Desire Doue scored twice to inspire Paris St Germain to their first European Cup triumph with a crushing victory over Inter Milan.</p>
<p>PSG’s young team achieved what the likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe could not do in their colours as they became only the second French side to win the trophy after Olympique de Marseille in 1993.</p>
<p>“Making history was a goal from the start of last season,” the club’s manager, Luis Enrique, said.</p>
<p>“I really felt a connection with the players and the fans, a very strong connection that we saw throughout the season. We were able to handle the tension and excitement in the best possible way.”</p>
<p>Luis Enrique, visibly emotional after the final whistle and wearing a T-shirt with a tribute to his daughter Xana who died in 2019, has turned PSG from a side of superstars into a group of humble players finally playing as a team.</p></p>
