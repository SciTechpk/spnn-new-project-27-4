            <p><p>Military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has rubbished rumours of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir becoming the president.</p>
<p>His statement follows a similar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923280/interior-minister-rebuts-rumours-about-president-zardari-resigning-from-office">rebuttal</a> by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi early in July, when he clarified that no idea existed “about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency”.</p>
<p>Gen Chaudhry, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general, told <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2025/08/03/pakistans-army-chief-is-cosying-up-to-donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Economist</a></em> that “talk of his boss becoming president is ‘nonsense’”.</p>
<p><em>The Economist</em> noted that COAS Munir’s popularity has surged since the May <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">conflict with India</a>. It added that the ruling coalition’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921643">recently acquired</a> two-thirds majority in the parliament needed for a Constitutional Amendment “ignited rumours that the army chief could become president too”.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856908">government</a>, as well as the military, have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1876905">repeatedly</a> warned about “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=fake%20news%20and%20propaganda%20have%20become%20so%20common%20and%20there%20is%20no%20accountability%20for%20it.%E2%80%9D">fake news and propaganda</a>” proliferating on social media, with Gen Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=theories%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20added.-,%E2%80%98Digital%20terrorism%E2%80%99,-Questioned%20about%20criticism">digital terrorism</a>” under the laws.</p>
<p>On July 10, Naqvi asserted that President Asif Ali Zardari “enjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces”.</p>
<p>He quoted the president as having “clearly” stated: “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”</p>
<p>Naqvi stressed that the “sole focus” of COAS Munir was Pakistan’s strength and stability, and “nothing else”.</p>
<p>In May, President Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formally decorated COAS Munir with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912748/president-pm-decorate-coas-munir-with-rank-of-field-marshal">rank of field marshal</a> for his “sagacious leadership and exceptional strategy” during the recent conflict with India.</p>

<p>The rank of field marshal is the highest rank of armies built on the pattern of the British Army. It has only been awarded to one other — Gen Ayub Khan — by the presidential cabinet in 1959. It is a ceremonial five-star rank that usually signifies extraordinary leadership and wartime achievement.</p>
<p>In a subsequent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913061">dinner</a> hosted by the army chief, Field Marshal Munir lauded the political leadership for their “strategic foresight” during <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> against India.</p>
<p>The next month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who belongs to PM Shehbaz’s PML-N, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918558/whats-behind-khawaja-asifs-praise-for-hybrid-system">hailed</a> the “existing hybrid model of governance” in the country. In a separate interview, he also termed it as a “practical necessity” for Pakistan, saying the system was “doing wonders”.</p></p>

            <p><p>Four security personnel were among seven martyred in two separate incidents of firing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak district and Peshawar city, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906333/3-traffic-cops-injured-in-terrorist-attack-in-kps-lakki-marwat-district-police">witnessed</a> an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Four security personnel including a driver were martyred when unknown assailants attacked a Federal Constabulary (FC) vehicle in the Garagri area of Karak, which the provincial chief minister and governor strongly condemned.</p>
<p>KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur directed relevant authorities to arrest those involved in the incident as he expressed condolences to the families of those martyred.</p>
<p>“We salute the security personnel and their families who sacrificed their lives for the country and the nation,” said a statement today from the office of the press secretary to the KP CM.</p>
<p>Governor Faisal Kundi also condemned the incident, saying: “The sacrifice of those martyred in the war against terrorism will not go in vain.”</p>
<p>In a separate incident on Tuesday night, three people died in a gun attack on Peshawar’s Warsak Road, including police inspector Ali Hussain.</p>
<p>Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Operations Peshawar Masood Ahmed told <em>Dawn.com</em> that Hussain was travelling in a car with two friends last night when four assailants on two motorbikes opened fire on the car, killing all three.</p>
<p>“A pistol and submachine gun (SMG) was used in the attack,” he added.</p>
<p>“We are investigating the incident, and geofencing work is ongoing as well.”</p>
<p>Kundi condemned the “unfortunate and inhumane” incident as he expressed his condolences to the families of the deceased.</p>
<p>Last month, a police official was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926664">martyred</a> in Karak while deployed at a police post in the Koh-i-Maidan area, which borders the Lakki Marwat and Mianwali districts. He embraced martyrdom while the assailants fled into the mountains.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) continued its record-setting rally for a fourth consecutive session on Wednesday on “strong” corporate results, soaring past 144,000 points during intraday high.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,041.24 points (0.73 per cent) to reach 144,078.40 points at 1:29pm, from the previous close of 143,037.16 points.</p>
<p>The market reached an intraday high of 144,285.74 points at 11:37am, gaining 1,248.58 points (0.87pc) from yesterday’s close.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “The market rallied on strong corporate results, along with hefty payouts in the banking and fertiliser sectors.</p>
<p>“Moreover, expectation of clearance of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903565">circular debt</a> during the next week has rejuvenated interest in companies having exposure in coal-based power plants, distribution companies of oil and gas, and upstream exploration and production companies,” he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The interest in the oil and gas sector follows an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927725/us-makes-deal-to-tap-pakistans-oil-reserves">agreement</a> between Pakistan and the United States that will allow the two allies to work together on developing Pakistan’s vast oil reserves.</p>
<p>Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, also said the market was “up as corporate results are expected to be better”.</p>
<p>A key factor behind the market’s upbeat performance was also the release of Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929033/non-tax-bonanza-pushes-tax-ratio-to-21-year-high">fiscal data</a> for FY25. The government reported a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929033/non-tax-bonanza-pushes-tax-ratio-to-21-year-high#:~:text=These%20windfalls%20reduced%20the%20fiscal%20deficit%20to%20a%209%2Dyear%20low%20of%205.4pc%20in%20FY25">nine-year low</a> fiscal deficit of 5.38pc, with revenue growth of 36pc year-on-year (YoY), outpacing an 18pc rise in expenditures.</p>
<p>This performance surpassed both the government’s and the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) forecast of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911133">5.6pc GDP deficit</a>. The positive fiscal data, along with market optimism over fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability, is expected to fuel further market momentum in the coming sessions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, India’s central bank maintained its key interest rate at 5.50pc as US President Donald Trump ramped up <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928704/trump-warns-he-will-substantially-raise-tariffs-on-india-over-russian-oil-purchases">threats</a> to raise tariffs on New Delhi because of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928385">Russian oil purchases</a>.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept steady the repurchase rate, the level at which it lends to commercial banks, after a unanimous vote by a six-member panel.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Bank governor Sanjay Malhotra said global trade challenges remained but that the “Indian economy holds bright prospects in the changing world order”.
“We have taken decisive and forward-looking measures to support growth,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The RBI cut rates for the first time in nearly five years in February and followed up with two other reductions in April and June.</p>
<p>Trump’s announcement on Tuesday to “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928905/trump-says-he-will-very-substantially-raise-tariffs-on-india-in-next-24-hours-over-russian-oil-purchases">substantially</a>” hike tariffs on Indian imports because of New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil has added pressure on India.</p>
<p>Before that threat was made, the existing 1pc US tariff on Indian products was already due to rise to 25pc on Thursday. Malhotra acknowledged that “the uncertainties of tariffs are still evolving” even though “growth is robust”.</p>
