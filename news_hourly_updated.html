                <h2>PTI brass gathers in Lahore to kick-start Aug 5 movement</h2>

            <p><p><strong>‚Ä¢ Gandapur leads KP lawmakers to Punjab‚Äôs capital<br />
‚Ä¢ Gohar says leadership will also take up suspension of 26 MPAs</strong></p>
<p>LAHORE: The PTI top leadership arrived in Lahore on Saturday to devise a strategy for its nationwide protest, which will reach its crescendo on Aug 5 to seek the release of party founder Imran Khan, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur describing the Lahore visit as the formal launch of the movement.</p>
<p>Before their departure, the party leaders held a meeting in Islamabad to discuss several issues, including the potential disqualification of the party‚Äôs Punjab Assembly lawmakers who had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920792">suspended</a> by the speaker.</p>
<p>In the evening, a caravan of KP lawmakers led by CM Gandapur, as well as Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar reached Lahore via G.T. Road. During a layover in Jhelum, the KP CM said that the protest had been launched, and the parliamentary meeting in Lahore would mull the final protest strategy to step up the campaign ahead of the two-year anniversary of Imran Khan‚Äôs imprisonment on Aug 5.</p>

<p>PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the party‚Äôs parliamentarians were going to Lahore for a meeting and added they would discuss the issue of 26 MPAs, suspended by the Punjab Assembly speaker. ‚ÄúThe Punjab government has been unleashing fascism for the past two years, and now it is time that common sense should prevail,‚Äù he stressed.</p>
<p>Though there were reports that the Punjab police could block PTI parliamentarians‚Äô entry into Lahore, the leaders had said they would stage a sit-in at the blocked point. However, the parliamentarians, led by CM Gandapur, made a smooth entry and camped at a farmhouse in Raiwind, Lahore.</p>
<p>The police, however, did raid party leaders and workers‚Äô homes throughout the day and even went to the Shahdra Morr ‚Äì Lahore‚Äôs entry point on G.T. Road ‚Äì and took into custody five leaders, including Yasir Gillani from among those gathered to welcome the PTI caravan.</p>
<p>At a late-night party meeting in Raiwand, CM Gandapur told parliamentarians that they had reached the ‚Äòpolitical hub of the country‚Äô to launch their protest campaign. ‚ÄúAny campaign launched from Lahore earns success and this too will be successful across the country,‚Äù he asserted.</p>
<p>Asserting that party leader Imran Khan is in jail for no valid reason, CM Gandapur advised party leaders to move forward through consultations and plans in respective jurisdictions to step up the protest campaign. ‚ÄúAll the provinces should prepare their protest plans and implement them in line with their local issues and take the protest campaign to its peak by Aug 5,‚Äù he asserted.</p>
<p>He said the establishment had been ruling the country for decades and imposed multiple martial laws as part of different experiments, destroying the country. ‚ÄúThe establishment this time has imposed a new kind of martial law, which is not official, but wielding every kind of power and pressure,‚Äù he observed and added that it destroyed the country but the perpetrators were not even showing any remorse.</p>
<p>At the meeting, Mr Bhachar said Punjab could not warmly welcome CM Gandapur because a ‚Äúfascist government‚Äù was ruling Punjab that even lacked parliamentary as well as social norms. Mr Bhachar said the party‚Äôs 11 MPAs were suspended after Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz came to the assembly and her second visit led to the suspension of 26 members. ‚ÄúThis clearly shows the level of fear the Punjab government is facing from PTI‚Äôs 107 tigers in the Punjab Assembly,‚Äù he asserted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThough the PTI leaders and workers are facing thousands of FIRs, the party is all set to launch a massive protest campaign aimed at the release of Imran Khan, his wife and all political leaders,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>While the PTI parliamentarians have camped in Lahore, the party‚Äôs Punjab chapter, led by Aliya Hamza Malik, had already mobilised party workers across the province and assigned duties to step up the protest campaign and take to its pinnacle on August 5.</p>
<p>Before leaving for Lahore, the party‚Äôs interim chairman Barrister Gohar Khan, while talking to media persons, said that the party had already sent a letter to the provincial government stating that it would hold a meeting in Lahore. However, he made it clear that the party was not planning to hold any rally or public meeting in the provincial capital.</p>

                <h2>Farm worker dies after US immigration raid on cannabis farm in California</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A farm worker has died after being <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923700/worker-in-critical-condition-after-us-immigration-raid-on-california-farm">injured</a> during a raid by US immigration agents on a legal cannabis farm in California, his family said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Raids on agricultural sites on Thursday resulted in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886071">arrests</a> of 200 undocumented migrants, as part of US President Donald Trump‚Äôs wide-ranging anti-immigration <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918869">crackdown</a>, and clashes between law enforcement officials and protesters.</p>
<p>The farm worker‚Äôs family had started a page on the fundraising platform GoFundMe to help support his relatives in Mexico.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the page posted an update to say he had ‚Äúpassed away.‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump campaigned for the presidency on a harsh anti-immigration platform, likening undocumented migrants to ‚Äúanimals‚Äù and ‚Äúmonsters,‚Äù and since taking office he has delivered on promises to conduct a massive deportation drive.</p>
<p>On Friday, he called demonstrators involved in attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents ‚Äúslimeballs‚Äù and said they should be arrested.</p>
<p>The chaotic raid on the cannabis plantation in Ventura County, about 90 kilometres from Los Angeles, saw the worker who later died being chased by ICE agents, his family said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy uncle Jaime was just a hard-working, innocent farmer,‚Äù said a post on the GoFundMe page. ‚ÄúHe was chased by ICE agents, and we were told he fell 30ft (9 meters).‚Äù</p>
<p>The page described his injuries as ‚Äúcatastrophic.‚Äù</p>
<p>Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman, said he was never in custody.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlthough he was not being pursued by law enforcement, this individual climbed up to the roof of a green house and fell 30 feet,‚Äù McLaughlin said.</p>
<p>‚Äú(Customs and Border Patrol) immediately called a medevac to the scene to get him care as quickly as possible.‚Äù</p>
<p>DHS said 200 undocumented migrants were arrested during raids on marijuana growing sites in Carpinteria and Camarillo on Thursday and 10 children were rescued ‚Äúfrom potential exploitation, forced labor, and human trafficking.‚Äù</p>
<p>Glass House Brands, which owns the farms, said in a statement that it has ‚Äúnever knowingly violated applicable hiring practices and does not and has never employed minors.‚Äù</p>
<p>DHS said more than 500 ‚Äúrioters‚Äù had attempted to disrupt the operation and four US citizens are facing charges for assaulting or resisting officers.</p>
<p>Tear gas was used against the protesters, some of whom were seen in television footage throwing projectiles at law enforcement vehicles.</p>
<p>The department said immigration agency vehicles were damaged and a $50,000 reward was being offered for the arrest of an individual who allegedly fired a gun at law enforcement officers.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#american-dream-no-longer" id="american-dream-no-longer" title="Permalink"></a>American dream ‚Äòno longer‚Äô</h2>
<p>In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he had watched footage of ‚Äúthugs‚Äù throwing rocks and bricks at ICE vehicles, causing ‚Äútremendous damage.‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump said he was authorizing law enforcement officers who are ‚Äúon the receiving end of thrown rocks, bricks, or any other form of assault, to stop their car, and arrest these SLIMEBALLS, using whatever means is necessary to do so.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am giving Total Authorization for ICE to protect itself, just like they protect the Public,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Trump has been involved in a showdown over immigration enforcement with Democratic-ruled California for weeks.</p>
<p>The Republican president sent thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles last month to quell protests against round-ups of undocumented migrants by federal agents.</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has said the troops were not necessary to address the mostly peaceful protests, but his legal efforts to have them removed have failed so far.</p>
<p>The cannabis farm in Camarillo was calm during a visit by an <em>AFP</em> reporter on Friday, as workers waited in line to collect their belongings and paychecks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been here since six this morning asking questions but they‚Äôre not giving us any information,‚Äù said Saul Munoz, a 43-year-old Colombian whose son was detained on Thursday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI just want to know how he‚Äôs doing,‚Äù Munoz said. ‚ÄúBring him back to me and if it‚Äôs time for us to leave, we‚Äôll leave.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe truth is the American dream is no longer really the American dream.‚Äù</p></p>
