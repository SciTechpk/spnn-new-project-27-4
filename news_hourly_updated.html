                <h2>We won the war but seek peace: PM Shehbaz invites India to live as ‚Äòpeaceful neighbour‚Äô</h2>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said Pakistan won the war but sought peace and invited India to live as a ‚Äúpeaceful neighbour‚Äù, as the country celebrated Operation Bunyanum Marsoos‚Äôs success with a ceremony.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan began after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> air strikes on Pakistan, causing civilian casualties. Both sides exchanged missiles over the following week, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> tensions. An <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">American intervention</a> led to a ceasefire.

<p>Today‚Äôs ceremony, marking the Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanksgiving Day), was held at the Pakistan Monument in Islamabad and attended by PM Shehbaz, armed forces chiefs, and other civil and military leaders. It began with the recitation of the Holy Quran, opening speeches, a flypast, and national songs.</p>

<p>Beginning his speech, PM Shehbaz praised the martyrs, their families, his cabinet members, service chiefs, and the nation for successfully responding to the Indian aggression.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have won the war but we want peace. We have taught our enemy a lesson but we condemn aggression, he said. ‚ÄúWe want this part of the world to be as prosperous and progressive as others through hard work, undying efforts and living like peaceful neighbours.‚Äù</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz said he had had a meeting with the services chiefs on the night between May 9 and 10, in which it was decided that since the enemy had crossed ‚Äúthe last limit‚Äù and rejected Pakistan‚Äôs offer of an international investigation, a ‚Äúmeasured response‚Äù must be given.</p>
<p>He detailed that around 2:30am that night, the army chief had told him on a secure telephone call that India had launched its ballistic missiles on Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe told me, ‚ÄòMr prime minister, grant us permission to strike the enemy with such force that they never forget it‚Äô.‚Äù</p>
<p>The premier added that later that night after Pakistan retaliated, the army chief had told him: ‚ÄúWe have given a befitting response and now we are being requested for a ceasefire. So, what do you think?‚Äù</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said that he had responded: ‚ÄúWhat could be greater than landing a blow that leaves the enemy‚Äôs head spinning and desperate for a ceasefire? Go ahead and accept the offer.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is a brief account of a long story from that day,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He informed the audience that the technology used by the Pakistan Air Force had stunned the enemy and sent the trust and confidence of allies soaring. ‚ÄúThis is a historic development that God brought about within a matter of hours,‚Äù PM Shehbaz said, adding that the military‚Äôs prowess was being talked about from the United States to Japan.</p>
<p>The premier said no major power can now block Pakistan‚Äôs path, with the entire nation united from Peshawar to Karachi, standing behind and supporting the army. He also reiterated his gratitude to allied nations for their efforts in achieving the ceasefire.</p>
<p>He went on to say that the conflict solved nothing, only bringing more poverty, unemployment and other problems to both sides.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe lesson is that we have to sit down at the table like peaceful neighbours and settle our outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir. Without resolving these issues, I don‚Äôt think we will have peace in this part of the world on a long-term basis.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf we want permanent peace then we need permanent solutions of Jammu and Kashmir and water distribution. Then once we resolve these issues, the sky‚Äôs the limit. We can talk of trade, exchange of business communities and cooperate in the field of counter-terrorism,‚Äù the prime minister emphasised.</p>

                <h2>Rawalpindi man sentenced to death by hanging for raping woman</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A sessions court in Rawalpindi sentenced a man to death on Friday for raping a woman.</p>
<p>Additional Sessions Judge Afshan Ijaz Sufi announced the verdict today, sentencing the convict to be hanged to death under Section 17 of the Anti-Rape (Investigation &amp; Trial) Act, 2021.</p>
<p>The judge also imposed a fine of Rs200,000 and ordered him to pay Rs500,000 in compensatory damages to the victim. In case of failing to pay, the convict will be sentenced to six months‚Äô additional imprisonment.</p>
<p>The first information report of the case was lodged at the Saddar Beroni police station on July 20, 2024, under Pakistan Penal Code Section 376iii (punishment for rape of a minor) on the complaint of the victim‚Äôs mother.</p>
<p>The mother said she worked as a housemaid and had left her 21/22-year-old daughter and nine-year-old son at home when the culprit had entered around noon and raped the former. The woman said her children had raised a hue and cry with her son alerting someone who called her up and informed her about the incident.</p>
<p>The woman had urged the police for the strictest of punishment to be meted out to the culprit.</p>
<p>In February, a Rawalpindi additional sessions judge had convicted a man of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893013">raping his niece</a>, sentenced him to life imprisonment and awarded a Rs500,000 fine.</p>
<p>Rape laws in Pakistan have seen significant reforms, particularly with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1595907">Anti-Rape Ordinance 2020</a>, which introduced special courts for expedited trials, mandated medico-legal examinations within six hours, and established a national sex offender registry.</p>
<p>However, systemic challenges persist, as over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1624732">80 per cent</a> of suspected sex offenders are acquitted due to deficient investigations, weak prosecutions, and societal prejudices.</p></p>
