            <p><p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday reiterated their commitment to working together with each other for the country’s sake.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the Presidency said the two held a meeting today at the President House.</p>
<p>“The meeting involved discussions on the country’s political, economic, and security situation. The state of law and order in the country and measures against terrorism were also discussed.</p>
<p>“The prime minister briefed the president on the government’s measures to improve the economy. Both leaders reiterated their commitment to work together for the country’s stability, development, and prosperity,” the statement said.</p>
<p>The meeting was also attended by Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Law  Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Interior  Minister Mohsin Naqvi and PM’s Adviser on Political and Public Affairs Rana Sanaullah.</p>

<p>The meeting comes in the wake of growing speculation about the upcoming 27th constitutional amendment and it being claimed that President Zardari may soon step down, potentially paving the way for the army chief to assume the country’s presidency.</p>
<p>The reports on social media claim that work is underway to replace the current parliamentary system with a presidential form of government. Some reports also claim that President Zardari has set one condition for his exit — a key role for his son Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in the new dispensation.</p>
<p>Naqvi said earlier this month that there were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922412/dar-naqvi-allay-fears-over-breach-in-coalition">no plans</a> to remove President Zardari and dismissed the reports about any such move.</p>

<p>He had to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923413/mohsin-naqvi-rubbishes-reports-about-presidential-system">dismiss the reports again</a> last week, claiming that the country was shifting to a presidential system and that Field Marshal Asim Munir would replace Zardari as head of state.</p>
<p>“We are fully aware of who is behind the malicious campaign targeting President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the chief of army staff (COAS). I have categorically stated that there has been no discussion — nor does any such idea exist — about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency,” Naqvi had posted on X.</p>
<p>He said the president enjoyed a strong and respe­ctful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces. “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924397/gujranwala-court-dismisses-post-arrest-bail-plea-of-ahmadi-man-held-for-distributing-muharram-niaz' target='_blank'><strong>Gujranwala court dismisses post-arrest bail plea of Ahmadi man held for ‘distributing Muharram Niaz’</strong></a>
            <p><p>A Gujranwala court on Tuesday dismissed the post-arrest bail petition of an Ahmadiyya community member, who was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922568/ahmadi-man-in-gujranwala-arrested-in-blasphemy-case-for-distributing-free-food-on-ashura-police">arrested on blasphemy charges</a> for distributing Niaz (free food and drinks) on the 10th of Muharram (Youm-i-Ashur).</p>
<p>The first information report (FIR) against the suspect was lodged with the Satellite Town police station in Punjab’s Gujranwala city on the complaint of a Hafizabad Road resident under Section 298(C) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), which criminalises certain acts by members of the Ahmadi community, including calling themselves Muslims or referring to their faith as Islam.</p>
<p>In the FIR, the complainant said the incident took place on July 6 at 4:30pm when he saw the suspect distributing free food and drink during Muharram, “posing as a Muslim”. The Ahmadi man was subsequently arrested and sent on judicial remand.</p>
<p>Gujranwala Judicial Magistrate Sidra Gul Nawaz presided over a hearing for the man’s post-arrest bail plea today.</p>
<p>The court order, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, said that the suspect was “found guilty” during the investigation and “sufficient material has come on record connecting him with the commission of the offence”, adding that a large silver cooking pot with chicken biryani was recovered from him.</p>
<p>It also pointed out that the offence under Section 298(C) was related to matters concerning the religious sentiments of a particular community and carried “serious repercussions for law and order”.</p>
<p>Thus, the order said that as a “necessary corollary” of the above, the post-arrest bail plea was dismissed.</p>
<p>PPP Senator Sherry Rehman had condemned the Ahmadi man’s arrest and expressed hope that the government would annul the FIR.</p>
<p>Last month, the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915235">asked</a> the Punjab police chief to prevent the Ahmadiyya community from observing Islamic rituals on the occasion of Eidul Azha and take action against its members if found violating the law.</p>
<p>In a letter, the LHCBA said that the followers of other religions and sects — especially the Ahmadis — are neither legally nor religiously permitted to use Islamic symbols and practices.</p>
<p>In March, the Human Rights Com­­mission of Pakistan (HRCP) said it had observed a growing trend of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895896/mob-led-attacks-on-ahmadis-growing-says-hrcp">mob-led attacks</a> on homes of families belonging to religious minorities, as well as their places of worship.</p>
<p>The HRCP also spoke of Ahmadis’ “arbitrary detention”, “desecration of their graves” and the “vulnerability of Hindu and Christian women” to forced conversion.</p>
<p>The <a class="link--external" href="https://hrcp-web.org/hrcpweb/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2025-Under-siege-EN.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>, titled Under Siege: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2023-24, said over 750 persons were in prison on charges of blasphemy, as of October last year. It documented at least four faith-based killings, three of which targeted the Ahmadi community.</p>
<p>One of the key findings of the report said that disinformation on social media sparked most of the registered blasphemy cases.</p>
<p>HRCP observed an “increasing weaponisation of blasphe­­my laws against Ahmadis”, with cases often initiated by law enforcement officials themselves.</p></p>

            <p><p>Incarcerated PTI leader Yasmin Rashid was shifted to a hospital in Lahore on Tuesday after her health deteriorated in Kot Lakhpat Jail, according to her lawyer.</p>
<p>Rashid has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1835036">been</a> in prison for more than two years now in connection with multiple cases against her regarding the events of May 9. She was first detained on May 12, 2023, under the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance and later arrested for her alleged involvement in the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>She was hospitalised last year in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1835819">May</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1848783">July</a> as well.</p>
<p>“Yasmin Rashid was shifted from jail to Services Hospital Emergency Department,” her lawyer Rana Mudassar told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>He added that Rashid was experiencing severe difficulty in breathing and also suffering from extreme stomach pain.</p>
<p>“Dr Yasmin Rashid has also been given oxygen due to her difficulty in breathing,” Mudassar said, adding that she was being tested at the hospital.</p>
<p>PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram also confirmed the development in a post on X.</p>
<p>“Dr Yasmin Rashid has just been urgently shifted from Kot Lakhpat Jail to a hospital due to her deteriorating health,” he wrote.</p>

<p>He added that Rashid was suffering from various ailments and “has been unjustly imprisoned for 24 months”.</p>
<p>“PTI demands that, keeping the requirements of justice in view, Dr Yasmin’s bail be immediately granted,” he added.</p>
<p>Barrister Taimur Malik, who contested the 2024 polls with the support of the PTI and is a member of the party’s legal team, also called for Rashid to be “granted the right to bail like thousands of others in these cases”.</p>
<p>He said that the PTI had asked the courts repeatedly to decide her bail applications.</p>
<p>“More than two years in prison as an under-trial prisoner is punishment itself before any case has even been decided,” he added.</p>

<p>PTI leader Musarrat Cheema said, “Rashid is a cancer survivor; she also has a breathing issue, but she was not even provided with oxygen. Every day, she endures jail trials in bogus cases.”</p>
<p>She requested prayers for Rashid’s health.</p>
