                <h2>SC Constitutional Bench dismisses pleas against transfer of IHC judges</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Supreme Court‚Äôs Constitutional Bench on Thursday announced its verdict in a case pertaining to the seniority and transfer of Islamabad High Court (IHC) jud¬≠ges, declaring that their transfers were not unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The bench ‚Äî headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and comprising Justices Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Shahid Bilal Hassan, Salahuddin Panhwar and Shakeel Ahmed ‚Äî took up petitions filed by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893249/ihc-judges-petition-sc-to-reclaim-seniority">five IHC judges</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898611">Karachi Bar Association</a> (KBA) and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904020/ihcba-undecided-as-sc-hears-pleas-against-judges-transfer-today">IHC Bar Association</a>, among others.</p>
<p>In February, Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar from the Lahore High Court (LHC), Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro from the Sindh High Court (SHC) and Justice Muham¬≠mad Asif from the Balochistan High Court (BHC) were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889123">transferred to the IHC</a>.</p>
<p>The controversy centres around the alteration of the judges‚Äô seniority list after these transfers as Justice Dogar was made the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889639">senior puisne judge</a>, which paved the way for his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891705">appointment</a> as the acting IHC chief justice after Justice Aamer Farooq‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891044">elevation</a> to the SC.</p>
<p>Today‚Äôs judgement was announced in a 3-2 majority ruling, with Justices Afghan and Ahmed dissenting.</p>
<p>In the short order, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, the SC noted that ‚Äúthe transfer of a judge by the president of Pakistan by means of Article 200 of the Constitution (permanently or temporarily) cannot be construed as a fresh appointment.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The order explained that exercise of powers of transfer by the president under <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912990">Article 200 of the Constitution</a> was not unregulated or unfettered.</p>
<p>Rather, it was structured on a ‚Äúfour tier formula which expounds that no judge shall be transferred except with his consent and after consultation by the president with the chief justice of Pakistan and the chief justices of both high courts‚Äù.</p>
<p>The short order emphasised that before exercising the power of transfer, certain inbuilt procedures and mechanisms had to be followed and the decision was ‚Äúwithin the sphere and realm of judiciary and not within the domain of executives‚Äù.</p>
<p>The short order added: ‚ÄúThus, for all intents and purposes, the transfer of judges by the president of Pakistan (‚Ä¶) is within the framework of the Constitution and cannot be
declared <em>ultra vires</em>.‚Äù</p>
<p>The judges further noted that the terms and conditions of transfer, including seniority, should have been taken up and mentioned by the president at the time of issuing the notification of transfer in terms of Article 200 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>The judges also said that they partially remanded the matter to the president, ‚Äúwithout upsetting the notification of transfer to determine the seniority after examining/vetting the service record of the transferee judges as soon as possible, including the question of whether the transfer is on a permanent or temporary basis‚Äù.</p>
<p>The order concluded that the seniority and transfer of judges was determined by the president by means of a notification/order and that Justice Dogar would continue in his role as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891705">acting chief justice</a> of the IHC till the seniority and nature of posting ‚Äî
permanent or temporary ‚Äî of the transferred judges were determined by the president by means of notification/order.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#dissenting-order" id="dissenting-order" title="Permalink"></a>Dissenting order</h2>
<p>In the dissenting order, authored by Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan, he said that the judges accepted the constitutional petitions.</p>
<p>The order declared the impugned notification regarding the transfer of concerned judges as ‚Äúnull, void and of no legal effect‚Äù.</p>
<p>Justice Afghan said, ‚ÄúThe permanent transfer of three Judges to IHC has been made
by the president in wrong exercise of discretion under Clause (1) of Article 200 of the Constitution.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added: ‚ÄúIt has offended Article 175A of the Constitution and has made the same redundant.‚Äù</p>
<p>The order also stated that the permanent transfer process of three Judges to the IHC was under the ‚Äúconcealment of relevant and material facts from the transferee Judges‚Äù, adding that it was also ‚Äúlacking meaningful, purposive and consensus-oriented consultation‚Äù with the chief Justices of the apex and high courts.</p>
<p>It further said that ‚Äúthe process for permanent transfer of three Judges to IHC has
been completed in an unnecessary haste.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the judges, the proportionate representation of provinces in IHC could have been achieved by ‚Äúmaking fresh appointments of judges from the provinces by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan under Article 175A of the Constitution‚Äù.</p>
<p>The dissenting note added: ‚ÄúIt [notification] is violative of Article 2A, Article 4 and Article 25 of the Constitution and it has undermined the independence of judiciary, due process and principle of equality.‚Äù</p></p>

                <h2>Govt draws five potential buyers for PIA</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>In its efforts to sell its struggling flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), the government has received expressions of interest from five parties, including business groups and a military-owned firm, the Privatisation Ministry said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The bids were submitted ahead of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913616">June 19 deadline</a> to acquire up to 100 per cent of PIA, which has accumulated over $2.5 billion in losses in roughly a decade. Still, following major restructuring, it posted its first <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903037">operating profit</a> in 21 years in the 2024-25 fiscal year.</p>
<p>The sale is seen as a test of Pakistan‚Äôs ability to shed loss-making state firms and meet conditions of a $7bn International Monetary Fund <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">bailout</a>. It would be the first major privatisation in nearly two decades.</p>
<p>Eight parties submitted their expression of interest, but only five of them provided documents of qualification, the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Among the five groups is a consortium of major industrial firms: Lucky Cement Ltd, Hub Power Holdings Ltd, Kohat Cement Co Ltd and Metro Ventures.</p>
<p>Another is led by investment firm Arif Habib Corp Ltd and includes fertiliser producer Fatima Fertiliser Co Ltd, private education operator The City School, and real estate firm Lake City Holdings.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917610/fauji-fertiliser-submits-expression-of-interest-for-pia-purchase">Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd</a>, a military-owned conglomerate, Pakistani airline Air Blue Ltd and a consortium including Bahria Foundation, domestic carrier Serene Air and US-based Equitas Capital LLC also submitted documents.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe government will review the documents and give qualified parties access to data for due diligence,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#full-divestment" id="full-divestment" title="Permalink"></a>Full divestment</h2>
<p>Once a leading global airline, PIA <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884402">resumed</a> European flights in January after a four-year EU ban linked to safety concerns, and is seeking UK clearances, seen as key to its turnaround. Industry insiders say the winning bidder is expected to partner with a foreign airline to run operations.</p>
<p>A previous attempt to sell the airline failed as a $36 million bid from real estate firm Blue World City fell short of the $305m floor price, with concerns over debt, staffing, and limited control.</p>
<p>This time, the government is offering full divestment, has scrapped the sales tax on leased aircraft, and is providing limited protection from legal and tax claims. Around 80pc of the airline‚Äôs debt has been transferred to the state.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre targeting Rs86bn in privatisation proceeds this year,‚Äù Privatisation Minister Muhammad Ali told <em>Reuters</em>. ‚ÄúFor PIA, in the last round of bidding, 15pc of the proceeds were going to the government, with the rest staying within the company.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said bidders would be pre-qualified in early July, with due diligence lasting two to two-and-a-half months, with final bidding and negotiations expected in the fourth quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>Officials hope the sale will revive the stalled privatisation drive. Other planned deals include the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903689">Roosevelt Hotel</a> and several power firms by mid-2026.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFrom the Roosevelt Hotel, we‚Äôre expecting over $100m as [the] first payment during this year,‚Äù said Ali.</p></p>
