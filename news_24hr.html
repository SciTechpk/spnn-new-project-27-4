            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said the government was implementing a comprehensive and effective strategy to “completely eliminate” the menace posed by the proscribed <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>, <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and other terrorist outfits to the country.</p>
<p>Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.</p>
<p>In response, the government labelled the group as <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and directed use of the term <em>khariji</em> for attackers. It later <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525">designated</a> Balochistan-based groups as <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">highlight</a> India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office said the premier chaired a meeting of the Steering Committee on Counter-Terrorism and Establishment of the State Writ (Harden the State) today at the PM House. The meeting was attended by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, National Security Adviser Lieutenant General Muhammad Asim Malik, PM aide Rana Sanallah, the four provincial chief secretaries and police chief, ministers and officials.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is working on a comprehensive, effective and workable strategy to completely eliminate <em>Fitna al Hindustan</em>, <em>Fitna al Khawarij</em> and other such anti-social elements,” the statement quoted PM Shehbaz as saying.</p>
<p>He said the state was determined to eradicate and uproot the scourge of terrorism, adding that even the world recognised Pakistan’s successful operations against terrorists.</p>

<p>The prime minister said the state had adopted a “multi-pronged strategy” in the war against terrorism and made “full and effective use” of important elements such as ground operations, legislation, meaningful public communication and discouraging extremist thinking.</p>
<p>The prime minister directed the committee to ensure effective coordination between the federal and provincial governments against terrorism and to strictly implement the recommendations of the committee in this regard.</p>
<p>Lauding the role of security personnel and law enforcement agencies, he said the provincial governments, Intelligence Bureau, Ministry of Interior and Counter-Terrorism Department had taken “very effective steps” in the war against terrorism.</p>
<p>“With the joint actions and cooperation of all the relevant institutions, effective actions were taken against smuggling, which made it possible to prevent it,” he said, adding that preventing the issue had a positive impact on the economy.</p>
<p>The prime minister said that only a peaceful and strong state structure free from terrorism could restore the confidence of investors at the international level, adding that the government had brought substantial changes, such as the digitisation of all systems and improvement in the tax system, for this end.</p>
<p>Pointing to the performance of the Pakistan Stock Exchange, he said the record increase in its index and the improvement in the country’s global ratings indicated the economy’s stability and would restore the confidence of foreign investors.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also said that the implementation of the repatriation programme for Afghans residing illegally in the country was also continuing effectively in accordance with international laws.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir had, similarly, a day ago <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927575/coas-munir-reaffirms-resolve-to-eradicate-terrorism-warns-of-decisive-response-to-all-threats">reaffirmed</a> the military’s resolve to eradicate the menace of terrorism from the country, underscoring the nation’s preparedness to respond decisively to any external or internal threats.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations, the army chief was speaking to a group of stakeholders at the 16th National Workshop in Balochistan.</p>
<p>“[The] COAS resolutely reaffirmed Pakistan Army’s unwavering commitment to uproot the menace of terrorism and [the] inevitability of socio-economic uplift of Balochistan for national cohesion and integration,” the statement had said.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927841/ogra-slashes-lpg-price-by-rs177-per-kg' target='_blank'><strong>Ogra slashes LPG price by Rs17.7 per kg</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) on Thursday reduced the price of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) by Rs17.7 per kilogramme.</p>
<p>Last month, Ogra <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921342">notified</a> a decrease in the price of LPG by Rs7.51 per kg or 3.1 per cent for July. The new price for 11.8kg cylinder was Rs2,750.6 for July, against Rs2,838.31 for June. It said that the LPG producer price was linked with Saudi Aramco-CP and US dollar exchange rate.</p>
<p>In a notification from the regulator today, available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, Ogra set the new consumer price for an 11.8kg cylinder at Rs2,541.36 for August, compared to Rs2,750.6 last month. The maximum consumer price for LPG per kg was set at Rs215.37.</p>
<p>These prices will go into effect on August 1 (Friday).</p>
<p>The prices “shall be regulated as the maximum LPG price at all levels of the supply chain for indigenous as well as imported LPG”, Ogra said.</p>
<p>The notification also showed that the new producer price for an 11.8kg cylinder stood at Rs2,054.02.</p>
<p>This is the third month in a row where LPG prices have fallen, with an 11.8kg cylinder costing Rs2,892.91 in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914531">May</a>, Rs2,838.31 in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914637">June</a> and Rs2,750.6 in July.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a parliamentary panel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924523/na-body-expresses-concern-over-unregistered-lpg-bowsers">expressed concern</a> over the “poor regulatory environment” in the petroleum sector, observing that lives were in danger after an official disclosure that almost half of a total of 2,000 bowsers handling LPG have not been registered anywhere.</p>
<p>Of an estimated 2,000 bowsers in operation, only 800 are registered with the Department of Explosives and just 247 have licences issued by Ogra. This points to a significant oversight lapse, the participants observed.</p></p>

            <p><p>Authorities abandoned efforts on Thursday to recover the body of German Olympic biathlete Laura Dahlmeier, who died in a mountaineering accident while attempting to scale Gilgit-Baltistan’s Laila Peak.</p>
<p>Dahlmeier was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927619/german-mountaineer-laura-dahlmeier-confirmed-dead-after-attempting-laila-peak-summit">confirmed dead</a> on Wednesday, having been hit by falling rocks while climbing at an altitude of 5,700 metres on Laila Peak in the Karakoram range.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927437/rescue-operation-underway-as-german-climber-laura-dahlmeier-goes-missing-while-trying-to-summit-laila-peak">Attempts</a> to recover her body were abandoned due to “dangerous” conditions at the site, Dahlmeier’s management agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>In consultation with the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the agency said her relatives would “continue to monitor the situation … and are keeping the option of arranging a rescue at a later date”.</p>
<p>Several of Dahlmeier’s colleagues confirmed the two-time Olympic gold medallist had said she did not want her body recovered if it put any would-be rescuers at risk.</p>
<p>German mountaineer Thomas Huber was part of a team that had attempted a rescue but told reporters on Thursday: “We have decided she should stay, because that was her wish.”</p>
<p>Another member of the rescue team, American Jackson Marvell, told <em>AFP</em> it would be “disrespectful” to recover her body contrary to her wishes.</p>
<p>Marvell said, “The recovery of Laura’s body will be possible, but it involves incredible risks, both on foot and by helicopter.”</p>
<p>Dahlmeier’s climbing partner, Marina Krauss, who was with her at the time of the incident, said at a press conference on Thursday that the former Olympian did not move after being caught in a rockfall.</p>
<p>“I saw Laura being hit by a huge rock and then being thrown against the wall. And from that moment on, she didn’t move again,” Krauss told reporters.</p>
<p>Krauss said she was unable to reach Dahlmeier and called for outside support.</p>
<p>“It was impossible for me to get there safely.</p>
<p>“It was clear to me that the only way to help her was to call a helicopter. She didn’t move, she didn’t show any signs [of movement]. I called out to her, but there was no response.”</p>
<p>“She only had a chance if help arrived immediately,” she said.</p>
<p>Dahlmeier won seven world championship gold medals, and at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, she became the first woman biathlete to win both the sprint and the pursuit at the same Games.</p>
<p>Dahlmeier retired from professional competition in 2019 at the age of 25.</p></p>
