            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921342/fuel-prices-go-up-in-aftermath-of-israeli-attacks-on-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Fuel prices go up in aftermath of Israeli attacks on Iran</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday increased the prices of petrol and diesel by Rs8.36 and Rs10.39 per litre, respectively, for the next fortnight ending July 15, owing to higher international prices following Israeli <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">attacks</a> on Iran.</p>
<p>In a late-night announcement, the Ministry of Finance said the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) had reviewed and adjusted prices for petroleum products in view of fluctuations in the international market.</p>
<p>The ex-depot price of high-speed diesel (HSD) was increased by Rs10.39 per litre (four per cent) to Rs272.98 per litre <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917324">from</a> Rs262.59. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD and its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables. Transport fares seldom come down despite lower diesel rate.</p>
<p>The ex-depot price of petrol was set at Rs266.79 per litre against Rs258.43, up by Rs8.36 or 3.3pc. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of middle- and lower-middle class.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>At present, the government is charging about Rs100 per litre tax on both petrol and HSD, with fresh imposition of Rs2.5 per litre climate support levy with effect from July 1. Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all petroleum products, yet the government is charging Rs78 per litre petroleum development levy (PDL) on petrol, diesel and high-octane products that normally impact the masses.</p>
<p>The government is also charging about Rs19 per litre customs duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.</p>
<p><strong>LPG price cut</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, Ogra notified a decrease in the price of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) by Rs7.51 per kg or 3.1pc for the month of July. Ogra notified the new price for 11.8kg cylinder at Rs2,750.60 for July against Rs2,838.31 for June. It said the LPG producer price was linked with Saudi Aramco-CP and US dollar exchange rate.</p>
<p>As compared to previous month, Saudi Aramco-CP price has decreased by 4.29pc, while the average dollar exchange rate slightly increased by 0.47pc, resulting in a decline in the LPG consumer price by Rs88.71 per 11.8kg cylinder (3.1pc).</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921312/government-sees-exports-rising-inflation-at-5-7pc-in-fy26' target='_blank'><strong>Government sees exports rising, inflation at  5-7pc in FY26</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday projected a positive export outlook and a moderate rise in inflation to a range of 5-7 per cent for 2025-26, citing improved global economic conditions and domestic recovery trends.</p>
<p>In its Monthly Economic Update and Outlook for June, the Ministry of Finance said Composite Leading Indicators (CLIs) of Pakistan’s major trading part-ners — including the UK, US, Eurozone and China — were all operating above their long-term average of 100, suggesting a likely increase in demand for Pakistani exports.</p>
<p>For June, inflation is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921197/countrys-june-inflation-likely-to-remain-between-3-4pc-finance-ministry">expected</a> to remain between 3–4pc. The ministry also forecast a positive outlook for Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) in the coming months, driven by robust trends in cement despatches and automobile sales. “The uptick in private sector credit reflects growing production activity and improved investor confidence,” the report said.</p>
<p>On the external front, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897182">rising</a> remittances and exports are expected to keep the current account in surplus during FY25.</p>
<p>From July to May FY25, the current account posted a surplus of $1.8bn, in stark contrast to a deficit of $1.6bn during the same period last year.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Remittances, export growth and fiscal discipline drive economic optimism</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goods exports rose 4pc to $29.7bn, while imports increased 11.5pc to $54.1bn, widening the trade deficit to $24.4bn from $20bn a year earlier. Key export gains were seen in knitwear (14.5pc), garments (16.4pc), and bedwear (10.6pc). Major import increases were recorded in palm oil (26.3pc) and electrical machinery (13.6pc), while crude oil imports declined 1.7pc.</p>
<p>Service exports grew 8.5pc to $7.6bn, with imports rising 6.6pc to $10.3bn, resulting in a $2.7bn services trade deficit. IT exports surged by 18.7pc to $3.5bn.</p>
<p>Worker remittances saw a sharp increase of 28.8pc, reaching $34.9bn from $27.1bn in the same period last year, led by higher inflows from Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</p>
<p>Net foreign direct investment (FDI) stood at $2bn, slightly down from $2.1bn a year ago.</p>
<p>China remained the top investor with $790.4m, followed by the UK with $229m and Hong Kong with $215.2m. The financial services sector attracted the most FDI at $628.9m, followed by power ($562.8m) and oil &amp; gas exploration ($265.6m).</p>
<p>However, foreign portfolio investment recorded net outflows, with $312.5m from the private sector and $311.9m from the public sector. As of June 13, the country’s foreign exchange reserves stood at $17bn, including $11.7bn held by the State Bank of Pakistan.</p>
<p>On the fiscal side, the report noted that revenue growth outpaced expenditure growth during July-April FY25, reflecting the success of the government’s fiscal consolidation drive.</p>
<p>The fiscal deficit declined to 3.2pc of GDP, down from 4.5pc in the same period last year, while the primary surplus improved to 3.2pc of GDP from 1.5pc a year earlier.</p>

            <p><p>WASHINGTON: A Pakistani delegation arrived in Washington on Monday to finalise a trade agreement as the country looks to recalibrate economic ties with the US and ease tensions stemming from high import tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The delegation, led by Commerce Secretary Jawad Paal, is scheduled to hold talks with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and senior officials from other departments.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">Talks</a> between Pakistan and the United States, which have been ongoing for over a month, are expected to conclude this week, the Finance Ministry stated on Wednesday following a meeting between Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.</p>
<p>The ongoing discussions, centred on reciprocal tariffs are part of a broader effort to “reset economic ties at a time of shifting geopolitical alignments,” according to Pakistani officials.</p>
<p>The finance ministry also noted that “a longer-term strategic and investment partnership is also under discussion.”</p>
<p>Pakistan currently faces a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">29 per cent tariff</a> on its exports to the US. In 2024, Pakistan’s trade surplus with the United States was around $3 billion.</p>
<p>To ease tariff pressures and address the trade imbalance, Islamabad has offered to increase imports of American goods, including crude oil and expand investment opportunities for US firms, particularly in its mining sector.</p>
<p>“Both sides showed satisfaction on the ongoing negotiations and resolved to conclude the trade negotiations next week,” the ministry said.</p>
<p>Last week, the two governments co-hosted a webinar to promote investment in Pakistan’s mineral sector, highlighting the $7 billion <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904563">Reko Diq</a> copper-gold project in Balochistan.</p>
<p>Senior officials and US investors discussed public-private partnerships and regulatory reforms aimed at attracting foreign capital.</p>
<p>The US Export-Import Bank is currently reviewing financing proposals worth between $500 million and $1bn for the Reko Diq project.</p>
<p>In an interview with <em>Fox Business</em>, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the administration is negotiating trade deals with 18 “important trading partners” and expects several of them to be finalised in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>“If we can ink 10 or 12 of the important 18 … then I think we could have trade wrapped up by Labour Day,” Mr Bessent said, indicating a more flexible timeline than the previously set July 9 deadline.</p>
<p>President Trump has already <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914608">claimed</a> he used trade as a leverage to stop hostilities between Pakistan and India in May.</p>
<p>US officials have said finalising trade agreements with both India and Pakistan could provide a much-needed stabilising influence and offer a path toward broader economic cooperation.</p>
