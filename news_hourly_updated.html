            <p><p>Pakistan has officially decided to brief the United Nations Security Council on the latest situation in the region amid sky-high tensions with India, according to a statement issued by the foreign ministry on Sunday.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> on April 22 in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> as it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an incursion and India‚Äôs premier granting ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>‚Äù to his military.

<p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has directed Pakistan‚Äôs Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar, to take immediate steps to convene a meeting of the Security Council.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan will inform the UNSC about India‚Äôs aggressive actions, provocations, and provocative statements,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan will specifically highlight India‚Äôs illegal actions to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty,‚Äù it said, adding that the country would clarify how New Delhi‚Äôs aggressive actions are jeopardising ‚Äúpeace and security‚Äù in the region.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis important diplomatic move is part of Pakistan‚Äôs efforts to present accurate facts to the international community.‚Äù</p>

<p>In another development, the federal information minister and the military‚Äôs spokesperson are set to brief the top leadership of all political parties today on the prevailing national security situation amid sky-high tensions with India, state media reported.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The reports did not specify a time or venue for the briefing.</p>
<p>According to <em>Radio Pakistan</em>, the high-level background briefing will focus on national security in the context of Pakistan-India relations and the ‚Äúimplications of recent developments‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúParticipants will be briefed on the defensive preparedness of Pakistan‚Äôs armed forces, ongoing diplomatic efforts, and the official stance of the state on key issues,‚Äù the report read.</p>
<p><em>PTV News</em> highlighted that in the current circumstances, the briefing was a ‚Äúgreat example of national unity, solidarity and consensus‚Äù.</p>
<p>Without <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">investigation</a>, India had accu¬≠s¬≠ed ‚Äúcross-border linkages‚Äù of the att¬≠a¬≠¬≠¬≠c¬≠kers and escalated tensions with Pak¬≠¬≠i¬≠s¬≠tan through military and diplomatic actions.</p>

<p>Pakistan denied involvement and issued retaliatory steps.</p>

<p>The standoff, marked by exchange of fire on the LoC and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908171/pakistan-bans-all-ports-to-indian-flag-carriers-in-tit-for-tat-move">tit-for-tat actions</a>, has raised fears of broader conflict, prompting international <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907930/us-hopes-that-indias-response-to-pahalgam-attack-doesnt-lead-to-broader-regional-conflict-vance">calls for restraint</a> and renewed dialogue.</p>

<p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir on Thursday asserted that any ‚Äúmisadventure‚Äù by India would be met with a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907785/any-military-misadventure-by-india-will-be-met-with-swift-resolute-notch-up-response-coas">swift, resolute and notch-up response</a>‚Äù. The next day, the army‚Äôs top brass also warned India of a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war">sure and decisive</a>‚Äù response should it attempt to impose war.</p>

<p>To prepare itself for any military action by India, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) has accelerated efforts to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908278/ajk-ramps-up-flour-supply-to-loc-areas-amid-tensions">replenish wheat flour stocks</a> in vulnerable areas along the LoC.</p>

<p>Separately, in a statement on X, PTI said its participation in the briefing was ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù as the party believed there was ‚Äúno serious attempt to create a national consensus‚Äù by the government and that there was no intention to include PTI founder Imran Khan either.</p>

<p>The party said it had always unequivocally condemned every kind of terrorism in all its forms.</p>
<p>It said that the government should have immediately convened a multi-party conference, so that a common course of action could have been drawn up by taking all parties into confidence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUnfortunately, the government wasted this opportunity,‚Äù the party said, adding that not only was the multi-party conference not convened, but instead, ‚Äúa one-sided briefing is being given by a government minister‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúConsidering all these factors, the PTI political committee has unanimously decided that the party will not participate in the briefing,‚Äù the statement read.</p>

<p>As several friendly countries and global powers have been attempting to reduce Pak-India tensions, Iran‚Äôs Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is expected to visit Pakistan tomorrow, according to Iranian media.</p>
<p>Araghchi was expected to visit Pakistan on Monday to ‚Äúdiscuss the recent developments at the regional and international levels‚Äù, Iran‚Äôs state news agency <em><a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85821878/Foreign-Minister-Araqchi-plans-to-visit-Pakistan-on-Monday" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IRNA</a></em> quoted Iran‚Äôs Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei as saying.</p>

<p>During their call, Dar ‚Äúcategorically rejected India‚Äôs provocative actions, including its baseless allegations [and] inflammatory propaganda‚Äù.

<p>While reaffirming Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to regional peace and security, Dar asserted that Pakistan reserved the ‚Äúright to safeguard its sovereignty and national interest‚Äù.</p>
<p>Both leaders agreed to maintain close contact on the evolving situation, the FO added.</p>
<p>The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) yesterday had called for restraint and the ‚Äúurgent resumption of dialogue‚Äù between Pakistan and India to de-escalate the situation.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt stressed the need to resolve differences through peaceful means, in accordance with international law and the United Nations Charter, to safeguard peace, security, and stability in South Asia.‚Äù</p>
<p>The OIC recalled the decisions of the Islamic Summit and the resolutions adopted by the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers that reaffirmed the organisation‚Äôs ‚Äúunwavering support for the Jammu and Kashmir question‚Äù.</p>
<p>Noting that the unresolved issue of Kashmir remained the ‚Äúcore challenge to lasting peace and stability in the region‚Äù, the OIC urged the international community to intensify efforts to find a peaceful resolution to it, in line with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.</p>

<p>He described the action as a retaliatory response to the party leader‚Äôs ‚Äúunequivocal and bold stance on the Pahalgam incident‚Äù.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said India‚Äôs move to block the PPP chairman‚Äôs X account proved that India was an undemocratic country and its premier was an ‚Äúextremely cowardly person‚Äù.</p>
<p>Separately, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman, in reaction to the Indian step to block Bilawal‚Äôs X account, said that suppressing voices does not hide the truth.</p>
<p>She added that the Indian government should present evidence and not resort to censorship.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEfforts to suppress critical voices are increasing concern not only in Pakistan but also globally,‚Äù the PPP leader said.</p>

                <h2>Afghanistan fears negative impacts of Pakistan-India tensions on Kabul, region</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Afghanistan officials on Sunday expressed their concern that the ongoing tensions between Pakistan and India would have a ‚Äúdirect negative impact‚Äù on Kabul and the region.</p>
<p>After an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack on April 22</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam killed 26 people, India, without investigation or evidence, implied ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack%20were%20brought%20out">cross-border linkages</a>‚Äù of the att¬≠a¬≠¬≠¬≠c¬≠kers. Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">firmly</a> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315/pahalgam-attack-fm-dar-throws-down-gauntlet-to-india-asks-for-evidence-of-allegations-against-pakistan">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>In response to India‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">aggressive moves</a> against the country, Pakistan had announced <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284/trade-ties-and-flights-off-limits-as-pakistan-retaliates-to-indias-moves">retaliatory measures</a> that have included halting all border trade, closing its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907938/air-india-sees-pakistan-airspace-ban-costing-it-600m-over-a-year-seeks-aid">airspace</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908171/pakistan-bans-all-ports-to-indian-flag-carriers-in-tit-for-tat-move">ports</a> to Indian carriers and expelling Indian diplomats.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Hekmatullah Zaland, the deputy director of the Afghan foreign ministry‚Äôs Centre for Strategic Studies (CSS), said: ‚ÄúSince Pakistan and India are located in our neighbourhood, if this tension spreads, it will have a direct negative impact on the region and Afghanistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>The CSS deputy director added, ‚ÄúWe are currently interacting with both countries in the light of our balanced policy.‚Äù</p>
<p>Zaland was speaking during a roundtable discussion at an academic conference titled ‚ÄúTensions in Pakistan-India relations and their impact on the region‚Äù. The conference was organised by the CSS, according to a foreign ministry statement posted online.</p>
<p>During the discussion, officials pointed out the closure of the Attari-Wagah border, emphasising that the decision would affect Afghan traders.</p>
<p>On April 23, India had announced the closure of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">Attari checkpost</a>, alongside other measures. The next day, Pakistan responded by shutting the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284/trade-ties-and-flights-off-limits-as-pakistan-retaliates-to-indias-moves">Wagah Border</a> for any trade with India, including to or from a third country.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>However, despite Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907774">allowing</a> 150 stranded Afghan trucks carrying goods for India to cross the Wagah Border, India has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908197">not permitted them</a> to cross into its territory, leaving truckers from Afghanistan in a mess.</p>
<p>According to the central leader of the Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PAJCCI), Pakistan has also not permitted vehicles carrying items imported from India to enter Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Afghan traders said up to 2,000 containers carrying goods have arrived at Karachi ports from India under the transit agreement with Pakistan. But these vehicles are stranded in Pakistan, with some waiting at Torkham and Chaman to enter Afghanistan.</p>
<p>CSS Director Waliullah Shaheen discussed the historical background of the tense relations between Pakistan and India, stating that the two nuclear-armed countries would not enter into war and would find a solution to the problem.</p>

<p>Mufti Noor Ahmad Noor, the first political director of the Afghan foreign ministry, delivered a keynote speech at the roundtable discussions, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Discussing the factors behind the recent escalation of the conflict between Pakistan and India, he noted that the Pahalgam attack had exacerbated the long-standing tension. As a result, he added, both countries took measures, such as the closure of the Wagah-Attari border, that have affected the region, especially Afghanistan.</p>
<p>According to Noor, due to the border closures, Afghanistan‚Äôs commercial goods were practically stuck, causing significant damage to the Afghan trade sector. ‚ÄúTherefore, the Islamic Emirate [of Afghanistan] needs to prepare for potential incidents in advance,‚Äù the official stressed.</p>
<p>Noting that Afghanistan had ‚Äúcommonalities and positive interactions‚Äù with both Pakistan and India, Noor stated his country did not want a war between the two arch-rivals.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúRather, in light of the Islamic Emirate‚Äôs balanced and economy-oriented policy, and because regional stability and security are important to the Islamic Emirate, we will strive to resolve this conflict peacefully,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Dr Hafiz Ikramuddin Kamil, another official, spoke about the legal aspect of India‚Äôs potential threat to disrupt flow of water after it suspended the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty.</p>
<p>Kamil observed that blocking the river for a long time seemed technically difficult and also had various legal aspects according to international law. ‚ÄúBut for now, this issue has also emerged as a significant consequence of the tension in relations,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Dozens of foreign ministry employees participated in the discussion, where they shared their opinions and analyses on various aspects of the issue.</p>

<p>Separately, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar presided over a high-level meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Mofa) in Islamabad today to follow up on the outcomes of his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905251">recent visit to Kabul</a>.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/3  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Dar‚Äôs visit to Afghanistan on April 19 marked the high point of a renewed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905824">re-engagement process</a> between Islamabad and the Afghan Taliban administration after months of diplomatic deadlock, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896079">border clashes</a> and mounting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885161">security concerns</a>.</p>
<p>During his trip there, Afghan¬≠istan‚Äôs acting prime minister, Mullah Hasan Akhund, had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905407">assured Pakistan</a> that the Afghan territory would not be used for hostile activities against any country.</p>
<p>In the meeting led by Dar today, officials from Mofa and relevant ministries were briefed on the progress in implementation of earlier decisions, according to the <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1918924638551240764" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Foreign Office</a>.</p>
<p>Dar, also the foreign minister, reaffirmed ‚ÄúPakistan‚Äôs vision for a peaceful neighbourhood, enhanced trade and connectivity, sustainable development, and prosperity‚Äù.</p>
<p>The meeting was attended by Pakistan‚Äôs Special Representative to Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq and senior officials from various ministries.</p>
