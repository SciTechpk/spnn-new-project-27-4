            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911722/sic-seeks-fresh-bench-for-reserved-seats-case-review' target='_blank'><strong>SIC seeks fresh bench for reserved seats case review</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910923">Sunni Ittehad Council</a> (SIC) has obj­e­cted to the composition of an 11-judge constitutional bench hearing the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">reserved seats matter</a>, with a request to refer the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847508/ppp-takes-cue-from-pml-n-files-review-petition-on-sc-reserved-seats-verdict">review petitions</a> against the last year ruling to the relevant committee constituted under Supreme Court (Pra­c­tice and Procedure) Act, 2023, for the formation of a new bench.</p>
<p>The objection was raised through an application filed by senior counsel Faisal Sid­diqi on behalf of the SIC after the party had requested the constitutional bench to decide the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911471">26th Amendment issue</a> before hearing the review petitions against the apex court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">decision of July 2024</a> in the reserved seats case.</p>
<p>Also through senior counsel Hamid Khan, the SIC had requested the constitutional bench to postpone the next hearing of the review petitions scheduled for May 19 (tomorrow).</p>
<p>Mr Siddiqi, who filed the application seeking reconstitution of bench, had also expressed an intention of challenging the composition of the 11-judge bench during the May 13 proceedings after which the court postponed the proceedings till May 19 to allow the party to file a formal application.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Five major objections to the composition of the 11-judge constitutional bench raised</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the fresh application, the party raised mainly five objections to the composition of the bench hearing the review petitions in the reserved seats case.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>It highlighted that the July 2024 judgement was issued by a full court comprising 13 judges. It pointed out that the constitutional bench while taking up the review petitions comprised 13 members but later the strength was reduced to 11 members. It argued that the any judgement can only be reviewed by a bench having same numerical strength that the original bench had. Thus, the existing 11-judge constitutional bench could not review the petitions, the SIC reiterated.</p>
<p>Besides, it argued, since the two dissenting judges of the original 13-judge bench namely Justice Ayesha A. Malik and Justice Aqil Ahmed Abbasi had not recused themselves from hearing the matter, they could not be excluded from the review bench.</p>
<p>It was a settled law, the SIC added, once a bench was constituted and seized of a matter on the judicial side, it could not be reconstituted in exercise of any administrative powers by the SC unless those members had recused themselves or there was some constitutional or legal bar requiring the reconstitution of the bench.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Otherwise, it would amount to stifling the independent view of an individual judge, the party argued. “Any effort to muffle disagreement or to silence dissent or to dampen an alternative viewpoint of a member on the bench, would shake the foundations of a free and impartial justice system, thereby eroding the public confidence on which the entire edifice of judicature stands,” the party emphasised.</p>
<p>According to the SIC, if the two dissenting members were excluded by the present CB, then under no provision or principle of constitutional and statutory law, could they be considered a part of the existing bench by fictional irrationality making it a 13-judge bench and then again by fictional irrationality counting their dismissal decision at the time of final adjudication. “There is no principle of the constitution or law that allows judges, by fiction, be considered to be sitting on a bench, hearing and adjudicating a particular case without these judges being actually present during such hearings,” it reasoned.</p>
<p>The SIC further argued that the July 2024 judgement was not delivered under pre-existing appellate jurisdiction as envisaged under Article 191A(3) and thus, the present challenges could not be considered review petitions to be transferred to the existing constitutional bench under Article 191A(5) of the Constitution. The review petitions must be heard and adjudicated by all the same serving judges who were part of the full court that delivered the July judgement, it emphasised.</p>
<p>Also, the SIC argued that since the constitutional bench under Article 191A(6) had not formulated any rules regulating its practice and procedure, the SC Rules, 1980, Order 26 dealing with review jurisdiction would apply to the CB under which the review applications have to be placed before the same bench that had delivered the original decision.</p>

            <p><p>LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court on Saturday distributed the copies of charge-sheet among 267 suspects, including several senior PTI leaders, and summoned them for indictment in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1755738">Jinnah House attack case</a> next week.</p>
<p>While incarcerated PTI leaders including <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885379">ex-ministers</a> Dr Yasmin Rashid, Mian Mehmoodur Rashid, ex-governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Senator Ejaz Chaudhry were produced before Judge Manzer Ali Gill, who conducted the hearing inside the Kot Lakhpat jail, the latter was informed that ex-minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi was shifted to Punjab Institute of Cardiology for a cardiac complaint before the hearing commenced.</p>
<p>Also, PTI’s former lawmakers <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906372">Aliya Hamza Malik</a> and Rubina Jamil, social media activists <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910246">Sanam Javed</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1830461">Tayyaba Raja</a>, fashion designer <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1827857">Khadija Shah</a> and other suspects out on bail attended the hearing inside the jail.</p>
<p>Senior lawyers Burhan Moazam Malik and Rana Mudassir Umar appeared on behalf of the suspects.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>After being provided with the copies of the charge-sheet, the suspects were informed that they would be indicted on May 24 in the case.</p>
<p>Judge Gill of the ATC-1 later adjourned the proceedings.</p>
<p>Sarwar Road police had registered an FIR against the PTI leaders and workers on charges of attacking and vandalising the Jinnah House, which also serves as residence of corps commander, during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9 protests</a> against the arrest of ex-premier Imran Khan in a graft case by National Accountability Bureau.</p>
<p>Terrorism charge under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997, and various other offences, including waging or attempting to wage war or abetting waging of war against Pakistan, abetting mutiny, or attempting to seduce a soldier from his duty and rioting were added to the FIR.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another ATC court extended the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908229">pre-arrest bail</a> of former legislator Aliya Hamza Malik till May 26 and two sisters of Mr Khan in multiple cases of attacks on police till May 30.</p>
<p>Ms Malik appeared before the court on the expiry of her bail period while Aleema Khan and Uzma Khan sought one-time exemption from personal appearance. A lawyer informed the court that both sisters had to appear before a court of Rawalpindi.</p>

            <p><p>• Insists one of his biggest successes is persuading Pakistan, India to ‘step back from the brink’<br />
• Describes his Gulf tour as ‘a major, major success’, issues another warning to Iran</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911576#:~:text=US%20averted%20likely%20Pak%2DIndia%20nuclear%20war%3A%20Trump">said</a> the United States <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">intervened</a> to prevent a possible “n-war” between India and Pakistan after the two nuclear-armed neighbours had already begun <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">targeting each other</a> with missiles and drones.</p>
<p>Discussing the May 10 ceasefire between the two nations with <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-says-comey-knew-assassination-meaning-behind-deleted-social-media-post#:~:text=pointed%20to%20a%20recent%20ceasefire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News</a></em> anchor Bret Baier, President Trump described the situation as intensifying.</p>
<p>“They were angry, and the next phase was probably — did you see where it was getting? It was tit-for-tat. It was getting deeper and more, I mean, more missiles. Everyone was stronger, stronger, to a point where the next ones are going to be you know what: the n-word.”</p>
<p>The Trump administrat­ion’s decision to mediate was repo­rtedly influenced by remarks from Vice President James David Vance. In a previous <em>Fox News</em> interview, Mr Vance commented that the con­flict was “fundamentally none of our business”. According to <em>The New York Times</em>, this statement “caused alarm in the administration that things could get out of hand if the US sat on the sidelines”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>As the situation escalated, the US recognised that public statements urging de-escalation were insufficient, the reports added. Contrary to his earlier statement, VP Vance then called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom he had met during a trip to India the previous month, stating that the US believed the conflict could lead to a full-scale war between the two nations, according to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/10/us/politics/trump-india-pakistan-nuclear.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The New York Times</a></em>.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio contacted top Pakistani officials before the two sides established the foundations for a ceasefire.</p>
<p>Following the agreement, Pakistan commended Presi­dent Trump “for his leadership and proactive role for peace in the region”. India did not acknowledge the US role in the ceasefire.</p>
<p>This is the fourth time President Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910382#:~:text=adding%20that%20he%20also%20intended%20to%20%E2%80%9Cincrease%20trade%20substantially%20with%20both%20of%20these%20great%20nations%E2%80%9D">highlighted</a> his administration’s role in defusing tensions between India and Pakistan, clearly ignoring India’s policy against third-party mediation. His remarks contradict PM Modi’s claim that the ceasefire was enacted on Pakistan’s request.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>President Trump, who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911229/trump-promises-to-strengthen-ties-with-uae-on-gulf-tour">wrapped up</a> his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910749/saudis-invest-big-in-us-weapons-ai-as-trump-basks-in-welcome">high-stakes</a> Middle East tour on Friday, covered a sweeping range of subjects in his interview, ranging from the tour itself to a $400 million personal gift from Qatar and record-breaking investment commitments totalling an estimated $2 trillion.</p>
<p>But he insisted that “one of (his) biggest successes no one ever gives me credit for” was calling both Indian and Pakistani leaders by phone and persuading them to “step back from the brink” of a potential nuclear clash mere hours before his departure to the Gulf.</p>
<p>President Trump, who wants to be seen as a man of peace, said this was a “bigger success than I’ll ever be given credit for”.</p>
<p>India and Pakistan, he said, “are major nuclear powers. Those are not like a little bit. And they were angry. And the next phase was probably… you know what the ‘n’ word is, right?”</p>
<p>He then lauded his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910565/trump-says-warned-pakistan-india-of-no-trade-if-fighting-not-halted">use of trade incentives</a> as a peace-building tool. “I’m using trade to settle scores and to make peace,” he said, pledging to reduce tariffs by “100 per cent” for US exports to India once full calm was restored.</p>
<p>President Trump described his three-nation tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates from May 13 to 15 as “a major, major success” in strengthening US engagement with the energy-rich Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. He attributed the success of the trip to his personal friendships with the leaders of the three countries.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In the interview with <em>Fox News</em>, the network noted that Mr Trump created geopolitical shockwaves by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911119/trump-asks-syria-to-establish-ties-with-israel">lifting decades-old sanctions</a> on Syria. His meeting in Saudi Arabia with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa was described by his officials as a turning point for the war-torn nation.</p>
<p>Mr Trump also issued another warning to Iran, claiming that his sanctions policy had prevented Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>President Trump again defended his decision to accept a luxury jet worth hundreds of millions of dollars from the Qatari government to replace Air Force One, while also dismissing bipartisan criticism as a “radical left story”.</p>
