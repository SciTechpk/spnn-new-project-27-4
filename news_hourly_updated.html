                <h2>JUI-F‚Äôs Fazl assails child marriage law, announces protest rallies across country</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday rejected the recently enacted Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Act 2025, announcing nationwide protest rallies aimed at ‚Äúcreating awareness‚Äù among the public.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911451">bill</a>, which sought to protect the rights of children and eventually eradicate marriages of children under the age of 18 in Islamabad, was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914268/president-zardari-signs-bill-to-curb-child-marriage-into-law">signed into law</a> by the president on May 27 after sailing through both houses of parliament.</p>
<p>However, the move attracted <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913987">strong opposition</a> from religious segments of society, with the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) ‚Äî a constitutional body responsible for giving legal advice on Islamic issues to the government and the Parliament ‚Äî ruling that ‚Äúclassifying marriage under the age of 18 as rape did not conform with Islamic law.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Peshawar today, the JUI-F chief rejected the law, alleging that it ‚Äúmade fornication easier while making legitimate marriages difficult‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan is a strange country ‚Äî during the time of General Musharraf, a constitutional amendment was passed in the name of women‚Äôs rights that decriminalised fornication,‚Äù Fazl said. ‚ÄúIt took it out of the realm of sin.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNow, they are trying to ban the marriage of people under 18. The CII has already rejected this and all ulemas and their parties have agreed that it contradicts the Quran and sunnah,‚Äù he added, lamenting that despite constitutional guarantees, the Constitution was ‚Äúbeing trampled‚Äù.</p>
<p>Announcing that the JUI-F would ‚Äútake steps‚Äù to protest the legislation, Fazl announced a series of rallies and a large conference in Hazara Division in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on June 29.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will stage rallies, but they won‚Äôt focus on one subject, like Al-Aqsa Mosque,‚Äù the party chief explained. ‚ÄúNow, we will host rallies to create awareness about national sovereignty and Islamic governance.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added, ‚ÄúGod willing, we will present our stance to the world freely. Islam is a faith that moves with the world and can be beneficial.‚Äù</p>
<p>Underage marriages are practised in some parts of the country, most commonly in rural areas, driven largely by poverty and limited access to education. According to a 2019 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1456915/21pc-girls-in-pakistan-become-victim-of-child-marriage-who-reports">World Health Organisation</a> report, about 21 per cent of girls in Pakistan were married before 18.</p>
<p>The same year, the Senate passed the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1479198">Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Bill, 2018</a> ‚Äî a private member bill presented by PPP  Senator Sherry Rehman, proposing that the legal minimum age of marriage in the country be set at 18.</p>
<p>At that time, JUI-F had opposed the bill as well, calling it ‚Äúcontradictory to Islamic principles,‚Äù and suggesting that the bill should be sent to the CII before being discussed in the Senate. It was, however, not passed by the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Similarly, in 2021, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1630556">Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Marriage Restraint Bill, 2021</a> presented by PPP MPA Nighat Orakzai ‚Äî aimed at banning marriages of people under the age of 18 ‚Äî could not become law.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Sindh government had promulgated the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1112097">Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act 2013</a>.</p></p>

                <h2>Afghan FM speaks to Ishaq Dar, terms improvement of ties ‚Äòpositive development‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Acting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi on Sunday described the improvement of ties with Pakistan as a ‚Äúvery positive development in bilateral relations,‚Äù the Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, both nations <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912541/china-makes-taliban-regime-islamabad-agree-on-ties-upgrade">agreed</a> to upgrade their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912365">diplomatic relations</a> by exchanging envoys ‚Äî a key step towards normalising ties after years of strained relations between Islamabad and the Taliban administration in Kabul.</p>
<p>Pakistan on Friday announced its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914300">elevation</a> of diplomatic representation in Afghanistan from Charge d‚ÄôAffaires to Ambassador level, as bilateral ties ‚Äúmove on a positive trajectory.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the statement, Muttaqi spoke to Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar over the phone and discussed upgrading diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMuttaqi called it a positive step and expressed hope that the remaining stages would be completed soon,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúBoth sides expressed that upgrading the level of diplomatic relations would pave the way for expanding cooperation in many areas.‚Äù</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Foreign Office (FO) said that Muttaqi welcomed Pakistan‚Äôs decision to upgrade its diplomatic relations to the Ambassador level and informed that Afghanistan has decided to follow suit.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBoth leaders also reviewed the implementation of decisions taken during DPM/FM‚Äôs visit to Kabul on 19 April 2025 and vowed to continue working together to establish mutual trust between the two brotherly nations,‚Äù the FO said in a statement.</p>
<p>It added that both nations agreed to ‚Äúwork closely‚Äù to swiftly finalise a framework agreement for the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line Project for regional connectivity.</p>
<p>Experts believe that the conversation between Dar and Muttaqi indicates that the two sides remain focused on increasing convergence and cooperation in their bilateral interactions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter a period of unprecedented friction in the relations for the past three years, the actions by both sides to upgrade diplomatic representation, releasing held goods of Afghan companies at Pakistani ports, addressing impediments in trade and transit and extension of CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) to Afghanistan are positive and forward-looking measures,‚Äù Pakistan‚Äôs former ambassador to Afghanistan, Mansoor Ahmad Khan, told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>He added that these decisions should be implemented to ‚Äústrengthen bilateral relations and make progress for achieving regional connectivity with Central Asia and beyond‚Äù.</p>
<p>China has played a key role in the normalisation of relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Both nations made the announcements days after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated in a statement ‚Äúto strengthen exchanges and diplomatic contacts late last month.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfghanistan and Pakistan expressed a clear willingness to elevate diplomatic relations and agreed in principle to exchange ambassadors as soon as possible,‚Äù he said after he hosted Dar and Muttaqi at an informal trilateral meeting in Beijing.</p>
<p>Pakistan-Afghanistan ties have been marred by deep mistrust, cross-border attacks, and sharp disagreements over the presence of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants operating from Afghan territory.</p>
<p>Islamabad has long <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904015">accused</a> Kabul of harbouring TTP fighters, who were blamed for a 70 per cent increase in attacks inside Pakistan in 2024.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#russia-accepts-afghan-nominated-ambassador-to-moscow" id="russia-accepts-afghan-nominated-ambassador-to-moscow" title="Permalink"></a>Russia accepts Afghan-nominated ambassador to Moscow</h2>
<p>Separately, Russia officially accepted Afghanistan‚Äôs nomination of an ambassador to Moscow, the Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday, as economic and political ties grow between the two sanction-hit nations.</p>
<p>Russia in April <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904942/">suspended</a> its ban on the Taliban, which it had designated for more than two decades as a terrorist organisation, in a move that paved the way for Moscow to normalise ties with the leadership of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe hope this new phase will allow both countries to expand cooperation in various fields,‚Äù said Muttaqi in a statement.</p>
<p>Diplomats say formally presenting ambassadorial credentials to a foreign head of state signals a step towards recognition.</p></p>
