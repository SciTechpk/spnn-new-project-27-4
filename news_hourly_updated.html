                <h2>UNSC unanimously adopts Pakistan-sponsored resolution on peaceful dispute settlement</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The United Nations Security Council on Tuesday unanimously adopted a Pakistan-sponsored resolution that called for the peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar opened the UNSC session as he was presiding over the UNSC Open Debate on ‚ÄúPromoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes‚Äù.</p>
<p>This is the first of the two signature events of Pakistan in its capacity as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921308">president</a> of the UNSC for July.</p>
<p>The UNSC unanimously adopted the Pakistan-sponsored resolution urging all nations to utilise effectively mechanisms for peaceful settlement of disputes, such as negotiation, mediation, arbitration, judicial settlement or other peaceful means.</p>

<p>The Foreign Office (FO) said the adoption of the resolution on ‚ÄúStrengthening Mechanisms for Peaceful Settlement of Disputes‚Äù was a noteworthy development since it was an ‚Äúimportant contribution to the promotion of international peace and security through the use of preventive diplomacy, conflict prevention measures and dispute resolution by peaceful means‚Äù.</p>
<p>It added that the resolution sought to strengthen mechanisms for peaceful settlement of disputes, as envisaged in Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter and urged member states to utilise peaceful means for settling disputes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe resolution called upon the member states to take necessary measures for the effective implementation of Security Council resolutions for peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMember states and the United Nations have been encouraged to explore ways and means to prevent disputes from escalating, including but not limited to timely diplomatic efforts, mediation, confidence-building and facilitation of dialogue at the international, regional and subregional levels. The resolution calls for enhancing efforts by all regional and subregional organisations for peaceful settlement of disputes and to strengthen cooperation between these organisations and the United Nations.‚Äù</p>
<p>The FO said that as an active UNSC member, Pakistan sought to contribute to the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security, including through peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe adoption of Pakistan-sponsored resolution would serve as an important instrument to achieve these goals for peace and security at the regional and global level.‚Äù</p>

<p>Earlier, the FO said the signature event reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs unwavering belief in multilateralism and the UN Charter principle of peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>
<p>It said FM Dar would also hold bilateral meetings with the Saudi minister of economy and planning, UK minister for Africa, the United Nations, Commonwealth and Multilateral, as well as Thailand‚Äôs foreign minister on the sidelines.</p>
<p>He would also give an interview to a foreign media outlet and attend a reception hosted by Pakistan Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad for selected UN ambassadors and senior UN officials.</p>

<p>Speaking at the UNSC session, FM Dar said, ‚ÄúWe call for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that Israel‚Äôs latest onslaught in Gaza had killed over 58,000 Palestinians ‚Äî mostly women and children. ‚ÄúThe humanitarian situation is dire, with civilians bearing the brunt of the violence and deprivation,‚Äù Dar said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúToday‚Äôs debate is both timely and urgent. Multilateralism is not merely a diplomatic convenience; it is the need of the hour. Peaceful settlement of disputes is not just a principle; it is the lifeline of global stability,‚Äù Dar continued.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>On the issue of Kashmir, Dar said that the final disposition of the dispute has to be made in line with the relevant UNSC resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo cosmetic measures can serve as a substitute for the fundamental and inalienable right to self-determination of the Kashmiris as guaranteed by the relevant UNSC resolutions,‚Äù Dar said.</p>
<p>Dar also spoke about India‚Äôs unilateral suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, saying, ‚ÄúIt is most unfortunate and regrettable that India has chosen to illegally and unilaterally hold this treaty in abeyance on baseless grounds, with the intention of withholding the flow of water to 240 million people of Pakistan, who rely on it for their livelihood and survival.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Deputy PM said, ‚ÄúLet this debate serve as a collective reaffirmation of our faith in multilateralism, a recommitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes, and a solemn promise to those who look to this Council not for words, but for action.‚Äù</p>

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also addressed the council on this occasion, followed by statements of other member states.</p>
<p>Guterres said that the ‚Äúhorror‚Äù facing Palestinians in Gaza under Israeli military attack was unprecedented in recent years.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe need look no further than the horror show in Gaza ‚Äî with a level of death and destruction without parallel in recent times,‚Äù he said in a speech.</p>
<p>Guterres said ramped-up Israeli operations meant ‚Äúdevastation is being layered upon devastation‚Äù with the Gaza Strip‚Äôs humanitarian system in its ‚Äúlast gasp‚Äù.</p>
<p>He commended FM Dar for convening the debate and for utilising the council‚Äôs presidency to put forward a resolution urging all members to make full use of the tools in collective pursuit of global peace.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is needed now more than ever. The architects of the United Nations Charter recognised that the peaceful resolution of disputes is the lifeline when geopolitical tensions escalate, when unresolved disputes fuel the flames of conflict and when states lose trust in each other,‚Äù the UN chief said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAround the world, we see an utter disregard for, if not outright violations of, international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law, international humanitarian law, and the UN Charter itself, without any accountability.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese failures to uphold international obligations are coming at a time of widening geopolitical divides and conflicts‚Äù with staggering costs measured in human lives, shattered communities, and lost futures, Guterres said.</p>
<p>Diplomacy, he said, may not have always succeeded in preventing conflicts, violence and instability, but it still held the power to stop them.</p>

                <h2>Bangladesh take second T20I for first series win over Pakistan</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Bangladesh survived a late onslaught by Faheem Ashraf and Ahmed Daniyal to pull off a narrow eight-run victory in the second T20I match on Tuesday, winning a first-ever series in the format against Pakistan.</p>
<p>Ashraf hit an aggressive 32-ball 51 while debutant Daniyal smashed an 11-ball 17 but holed out off the second ball of the final over as Pakistan were all out for 125 in their chase of 134 to win in Dhaka.</p>
<p>Earlier, Jaker Ali struck a 48-ball 55 as Bangladesh ‚Äî sent in to bat ‚Äî were bowled out for 133 in 20 overs, with Salman Mirza taking 2-17 and Daniyal close behind on 2-23.</p>
<p>Left-arm Bangladesh pacer Shoriful Islam picked up his best T20I figures of 3-17 on a slow-paced Mirpur pitch as Pakistan lost their first five wickets for just 15 runs by the fifth over.</p>
<p>Ashraf cracked four sixes and as many boundaries to raise hopes of a comeback win, but spinner Rishad Hossain bowled him in the penultimate over.</p>
<p>Ashraf and Abbas Afridi, who scored a 13-ball 19, had revived the innings from 47-7 with a 41-run stand, but Bangladesh had the last laugh.</p>
<p>Bangladesh <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925439/clinical-bangladesh-thump-pakistan-in-first-t20i">won</a> the first match at the same venue by seven wickets and took an unassailable 2-0 lead with the final match on Thursday, also in Dhaka.</p>
<p>This was Bangladesh‚Äôs first T20I series win over Pakistan in four tries.</p>
<p>Pakistan lost opener Saim Ayub to a run out for one in the first over before Islam dismissed Fakhar Zaman (8) and Mohammad Haris (0) to hit Pakistan hard at the top.</p>
<p>Bangladesh skipper Litton Das praised a team effort.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wonderful to win back-to-back series,‚Äù said Litton, who also led the team to a 2-1 T20I series in Sri Lanka last week. ‚ÄúThis shows good improvement in our standards.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pakistan captain Salman Agha rued his side‚Äôs batting lapses.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe thought 134 would be gettable but we lost too many wickets early on and that‚Äôs something we must address quickly,‚Äù said Agha.</p>
<p>Earlier, Jaker smashed five sixes and a boundary for his third T20I half century.</p>
<p>Bangladesh had lost four wickets for 28 by the sixth over before Jaker and Mahedi Hasan revived the innings with a 53-run stand for the fifth wicket.</p>
<p>Mahedi scored a 25-ball 33 with two sixes and as many boundaries.</p>
<p>The final match is on Thursday, also in Dhaka.</p>
<p>Last month, Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915074">whitewashed</a> Bangladesh in a three-match home T20I series at the Gaddafi Stadium. Das-led Bangladesh came into the series on the back of an away 2-1 T20I series <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924702/mahedi-tanzid-shine-as-bd-secure-t20-series-win">triumph</a> over Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Pakistan are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925229">visiting</a> Bangladesh for the first time since December 2021 as they arrived in the country on Wednesday, after taking part in an extensive training camp in Karachi, the PCB said.</p>
