                <h2>Pakistan says deal concluded with US on tariffs; Trump cites oil reserves agreement</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan and the US finalised a trade deal on Wednesday night, expected to lower tariffs ‚Äî although no figure was announced ‚Äî while US President Donald Trump cited a pact aimed at helping <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927725/us-makes-deal-to-tap-pakistans-oil-reserves">develop Pakistan‚Äôs oil reserves</a>.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927252/aurangzeb-to-arrive-in-us-for-final-round-of-tariff-talks">currently</a> in Washington for negotiations on a tariff deal and also began meetings with senior US officials on Wednesday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn a landmark development, Pakistan and the United States finalised a trade agreement today aimed at boosting bilateral trade, expanding market access, attracting investment, and fostering cooperation in areas of mutual interest,‚Äù the Pakistani embassy in the US posted on X on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114943927434273211" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> the deal on his platform Truth Social early Thursday morning.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have just concluded a deal with the country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves,‚Äù Trump wrote.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are in the process of choosing the oil company that will lead this partnership. Who knows, maybe they‚Äôll be selling oil to India some day!‚Äù</p>
<p>There was no formal announcement from either side on what tariff rate was agreed upon, but the Pakistani embassy said the agreement ‚Äúwill result in reduction of reciprocal tariff especially on Pakistani exports to the United States.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis deal marks the beginning of a new era of economic collaboration especially in energy, mines and mineral, IT, cryptocurrency and other sectors,‚Äù the embassy said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe deal complements Pakistan‚Äôs existing efforts of broadening the scope of Pak-US economic ties and to include partnerships at the US states level. The agreement enhances Pakistan‚Äôs access to the US market and vice versa.‚Äù</p>
<p>The deal was reached during a meeting of Aurangzeb, US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer. Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul and Pakistan‚Äôs Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh were also present during the meeting.</p>
<p>The Pakistan embassy said the deal is expected to spur increased US investment in Pakistan‚Äôs infrastructure and development projects.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis trade agreement underscores the commitment of both nations to deepen their bilateral relationship and explore all avenues for strengthening trade and investment ties.‚Äù</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked Trump for his leadership role in finalising the ‚Äúhistoric US-Pakistan trade agreement‚Äù, saying in a post on X that  ‚Äúthis landmark deal will enhance our growing cooperation so as to expand the frontiers of our enduring partnership in days to come.‚Äù</p>

<p>Aurangzeb called the deal a ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù for both countries.</p>
<p>‚ÄúToday marks the culmination of the journey we started a few months back,‚Äù he said in a video message released by the Ministry of Finance on Thursday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen the discussions on tariffs started, the journey we‚Äôve had from then till today, in terms of making sure what non-tariff barriers we have, the trade imbalance we have, and in terms of the tariff lines on both sides.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe had a very constructive final round of discussion which then lead to finalising the trade deal, which was later on announced by President Trump.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFrom our perspective, it was always going beyond the immediate trade imperative. The whole point of this is that trade and investment have to go hand in hand,‚Äù the finance minister said.</p>
<p>He expressed his gratitude to several people and entities for their involvement in the process.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe role of the private sector is prominent, because when we were trying to figure out how to reduce or end the trade imbalance, the private sector was the first constituent who came up and said they will help,‚Äù Aurangzeb said.</p>
<p>He thanked the commerce secretary and Ambassador Sheikh and their respective teams, saying ‚Äúwhere we stand today is because of a teamwork.‚Äù</p>
<p>While reiterating Trump‚Äôs message in his post, Aurangzeb called it a ‚Äúreal win-win situation for Pakistan and the United States‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are in a good place today in Pakistan in terms of where we have arrived before August 1, and for that I congratulate everyone.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think we have come a long way from where we were to where we are today in terms of our overall strategic partnership between Pakistan and the US. It will, God willing, go from strength to strength as we go forward.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>At least 3 dead, another 3 injured in separate roof collapse incidents across KP amid heavy rain</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least three people died and another three were injured in separate roof collapse incidents due to heavy rains across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, rescue officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country. Starting in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919360">late June</a>, Monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country in the past month by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>In Lakki Marwat‚Äôs Sarai Naurang tehsil, three people were reported dead, including two women and a 15-year-old boy, when the roof of a room in their house collapsed amid heavy rain, according to a Rescue 1122 statement.</p>
<p>The Rescue 1122 team has cleared the debris and recovered the bodies of the deceased from the site of the incident, which were transferred to Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Sarai Naurang, said the statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a separate incident in Bannu, at least two others ‚Äî including a man and a young boy ‚Äî were injured when the roof of their house collapsed due to heavy rain, according to a Rescue statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe injured were immediately provided first aid as Rescue 1122 rushed to the site of the incident after the control room received reports of rain-related roof collapse in the Faqirabad Chowk area of Bannu,‚Äù said the statement.</p>
<p>The injured were transferred to the nearby hospital, it added.</p>
<p>Bannu Rescue 1122 spokesperson Ikram Wazir, in a statement, said that ‚Äúrescue teams are on alert to ensure the protection of life and property in case of an emergency.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a similar incident, in KP‚Äôs Tank district, a 35-year-old man sustained ‚Äúserious injuries‚Äù after the roof of a room in his house caved in as a result of rain, as per a statement issued by the media coordinator of Rescue 1122 in Tank.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe injured was rushed to the District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ), Tank,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>On July 26, the Pakistan Meteorological Department had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926575/flood-threat-looms-large-over-kp-as-more-rains-coming">forecasted</a> downpours from July 27 to 31 in KP, while the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) directed district administrations to act immediately, ensuring minimum damage to public life and property.</p>
<p>The advisory cautioned that heavy rainfall, windstorms and lightning could damage weak structures like roofs and walls of mud houses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels.</p>
<p>On July 29, Flash floods triggered by heavy rain <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927592">swept</a> through Naran in KP‚Äôs Mansehra district, where rescue teams had to evacuate 160 stranded tourists.</p>
<p>Last week, 250 tourists and passengers stranded at the Babusar Highway were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">rescued</a> by the Diamer district administration, volunteers, police, Rescue 1122 and the army, according to a spokesperson.</p>
<p>The national death toll from monsoon-related casualties <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930">surged</a> to 234 since late June, according to the National Disaster Mana¬≠gement Authority. Of the 234 deaths, 79 were men, 42 women, and 113 ‚Äî nearly half of the total ‚Äî were children.</p></p>
