            </a>
            <p><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Sunday discussed counterterrorism efforts in a meeting with his Afghan counterpart Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul.</p>
<p>The visit comes after a series of steps between both nations to improve ties, such as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904628">revival</a> of the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914300">upgrading</a> of each country‚Äôs diplomats from the rank of charg√© d‚Äôaffaires to ambassador. Both countries also held the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922614/pakistan-afghanistan-recognise-terrorism-as-serious-threat-in-1st-round-of-additional-secretary-talks">inaugural</a> round of the Additional Secretary-Level Mechanism talks earlier in the month.</p>

<p>Naqvi was warmly welcomed by interim Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani upon arrival at the Afghan Ministry of Interior, the post said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDiscussion on bilateral relations, particularly counter-terrorism, infiltration, and the banned Tehrik-i-Taliban [Pakistan],‚Äù took place, according to the interior ministry.</p>
<p>Effective management of the Pak-Afghan border, prevention of narcotics, and mechanisms for regulating cross-border movement were also discussed, the post said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTerrorist organisations are causing chaos and instability; We must stop them together,‚Äù Naqvi was quoted as having said to his counterpart.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan has selflessly hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades; the doors are open for the legal entry of Afghan citizens,‚Äù the interior minister said.</p>
<p>The process of repatriation of Afghan citizens illegally residing in Pakistan was also a subject of the conversation between Naqvi and Haqqani.</p>
<p>Afghanistan‚Äôs Senior Deputy Interior Minister Ibrahim Sardar, Pakistan‚Äôs Special Representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq, Federal Interior Secretary Khurram Agha and other senior diplomatic officials were there as part of the country‚Äôs delegation. Officials from the Afghan Ministry of Interior were also present on the occasion.</p>

                <h2>Medical board sought as Zahir Jaffer on death row for Noor Mukadam‚Äôs murder preparing mercy plea</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Zahir Zakir Jaffer, who was convicted of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636267">gruesome murder</a> of Noor Mukadam and sentenced to death, is preparing for a presidential mercy petition, according to a series of letters seen by <em>Dawn.com</em> as jail authorities have requested the formation of a medical board to evaluate his condition.</p>
<p>Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir‚Äôs Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636764">tortured</a> before being beheaded. Zahir‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810">death sentence</a> by the trial court had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1741974">upheld</a> by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in 2023.</p>
<p>In May, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912155">upheld</a> the death sentence handed by two courts previously over the murder charges under Section 302B (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). After the ruling by the apex court, a presidential pardon under <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part3.ch1.html#:~:text=President%27s%20power%20to%20grant%20pardon%2C%20etc." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Article 45</a> of the Constitution could possibly provide Zahir pardon, or reprieve, or remit, suspend or commute his sentence.</p>
<p>According to the letters, which are addressed to the hospital director at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) from the superintendent at Adiala Jail, Zahir requires an opinion from a medical or psychiatric board before submitting a presidential mercy petition.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe appeal of above mentioned Confirmed Condemned Prisoner (Zahir) was pending at [the] Supreme Court of Pakistan and the same has been dismissed,‚Äù the letter, dated July 8, read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNow the mercy petition of [the] subject cited Confirmed Condemned Prisoner has to be submitted before the Honourable President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. For that, the medical board and psychiatric board opinion is mandatory.‚Äù</p>
<p>The letter requested that a time and date be chosen for the medical and psychiatric boards to come to Adiala and examine Zahir.</p>
<p>The superintendent made the same request in another letter dated July 14.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In response to the first letter, Pims stated in a document seen by <em>Dawn.com</em> that Dr Shafqat Nawaz from the psychiatry department and Dr Amir Naveed from the neurology department will comprise the medical board.</p>
<p>Zahir was not only convicted of the murder, but was also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810#:~:text=sentenced%20to%2025%20years%20of%20rigorous%20imprisonment%20along%20with%20a%20fine%20of%20Rs200%2C000%20under%20Section%20376%20(punishment%20for%20rape)%20of%20the%20PPC">sentenced</a> to 25 years of rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs200,000 under Section 376 (punishment for rape) of the PPC.</p>
<p>In October last year, Noor‚Äôs father had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867225">urged</a> the apex court to take up the murder case pending for more than one and a half years.</p></p>
