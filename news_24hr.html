            <p><p>US President Donald Trump and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir discussed joint counterterrorism efforts and expanding bilateral trade during their “cordial” meeting in Washington, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Gen Munir met with Trump at the White House yesterday, becoming the first serving chief of army staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. The occasion also marked the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">first time</a> a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law.</p>
<p>The high-level engagement was scheduled at the Cabinet Room over luncheon followed by a visit to the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Senator Marco Rubio and Special Representative for Middle Eastern Affairs Steve Witkoff were present during the meeting from the US side, while National Security Advisor <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907660/in-a-first-isi-chief-made-national-security-adviser">Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik</a> — also the intelligence chief — accompanied the COAS.</p>
<p>“Although initially scheduled for one hour, the meeting extended for over two hours, underscoring the depth and cordiality of the dialogue,” the ISPR said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7323" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Trump “lauded Pakistan’s ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counterterrorism cooperation between the two states”, the statement said.</p>
<p>It noted that both sides reaffirmed their commitment to continued collaboration in the field of counterterrorism.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Discussions also encompassed avenues for expanding bilateral cooperation in multiple domains including trade, economic development, mines and minerals, artificial intelligence, energy, cryptocurrency, and emerging technologies,” the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>“President Trump expressed keen interest in forging a mutually beneficial trade partnership with Pakistan based on long-term strategic convergence and shared interests,” it highlighted.</p>
<p>The US president also commended Field Marshal Munir’s “leadership and decisiveness during a period of complex regional dynamics”.</p>
<p>The army chief extended an invitation to Trump, on behalf of the government, to undertake an official visit to Pakistan at a mutually convenient date, the ISPR said, calling it a “gesture reflecting the warmth of bilateral ties”.</p>
<p>On his part, COAS Munir conveyed the deep appreciation of the government and people of Pakistan for Trump’s “constructive and result-oriented role in facilitating a ceasefire between Pakistan and India in the recent regional crisis”.</p>
<p>He “acknowledged President Trump’s statesmanship and his ability to comprehend and address the multifaceted challenges faced by the global community”, the ISPR press release said.</p>
<p>“A detailed exchange of views also took place on the prevailing tensions between Iran and Israel, with both leaders emphasising the importance of resolution of the conflict,” it added, referring to the ongoing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918048/iran-israel-trade-fresh-air-attacks-as-trump-weighs-us-involvement">missile exchange</a> between the two regional arch foes that marks a week today.</p>
<p>The military notes that the engagement “marks a significant moment in the ongoing efforts to reinforce the longstanding partnership between Pakistan and the United States, built upon shared objectives of peace, stability, and prosperity”.</p>

<p>When questioned about the meeting in an interaction with the media later, Trump said, “I was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917868/trump-says-honoured-to-meet-field-marshal-munir-iran-discussed-in-talks">honoured</a> to meet him (Field Marshal Munir) today.”</p>
<p>Asked whether the talks included the current Iran-Israel conflict, Trump said: “They (Pakistan) know Iran very well, better than most, and they’re not happy about anything. It’s not that they’re bad with Israel. They know them both, actually, but they know Iran better.</p>
<p>“He (Field Marshal Munir) agreed with me. The reason I had him here was that I wanted to thank him for not going into the war [with India]. And I want to thank PM Modi as well, who just left a few days ago. We’re working on a trade deal with India and Pakistan. These two very smart people decided not to keep going with a war that could have been a nuclear war. Pakistan and India are two big nuclear powers.”</p>

<p>Questioned by reporters about the meeting prior to it, Trump remarked, “This man (Gen Munir) was extremely influential in stopping it (India-Pakistan fighting) from the Pakistan side.”</p>
<p>White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Trump was hosting Field Marshal Munir after he called for the president to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625/trump-says-us-stopped-pak-india-nuclear-war">preventing a nuclear war</a> between India and Pakistan, <em>Reuters</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/india-will-not-accept-third-party-mediation-relations-with-pakistan-modi-tells-2025-06-18/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>But insiders <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044#:~:text=But%20insiders%20suggested%20that%20the%20meeting%20was%20not%20arranged%20through%20routine%20diplomatic%20channels">suggested</a> that the meeting was not arranged through routine diplomatic channels, but rather was the outcome of “unorthodox efforts” by a group of advisers, businessmen, and other influential figures.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources in Washington said this initiative had been cooking for months and kept under wraps until the White House released Trump’s official schedule on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sources said that deepened counter-terrorism cooperation, engagement with crypto-linked influence networks, and targeted lobbying via Republican-aligned firms in Washington helped Pakistan secure the meeting.</p>
<p>Previous military rulers — such as Field Marshal Ayub Khan, Gen Ziaul Haq, and Gen Pervez Musharraf — met US presidents only after they had assumed the role of head of state.</p>
<p>Former president Barack Obama did briefly “walk in” on a White House meeting with then-COAS Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, but that too was not a formal engagement.</p></p>

            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The <a class="link--external" href="https://www.visionofhumanity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Global-Peace-Index-2025-web.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Global Peace Index 2025</a> has put the disputed region of Kashmir at the forefront of the critical escalation hotspots in the world, where tensions between India and Pakistan remain ‘perilously high’.</p>
<p>The index released by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) with headquarters in Sydney, says the situation in Kashmir exemplifies the fragility of ceasefire agreements in volatile geographic settings and underscores the dangers posed by non-state actors capable of triggering international crises.</p>
<p>The index, a snapshot of the global state of peace, ranked Pakistan at 144, showing ‘low state of peace’ while India ranked 115 position with ‘medium state of peace’.</p>
<p>Ukraine and Russia have been placed at the bottom of the rankings of 163 countries.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Global Peace Index ranks Pakistan at 144, India at 115; says South Asia tensions remain perilously high</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About conflict history and escalation hotspots in India, the index report says the conflict is highly likely in the Kashmir region over the next year.  Applying the escalation-risk indicators to the Kashmir dispute finds it has the potential for rapid deterioration. A four-day conflict ensued from 7-10 May 2025 and was the deadliest escalation betwe­­en the countries in several years.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>A renewed confrontation over Kashmir would involve the two nuclear-armed rivals. Although a deliberate nuclear strike remains highly unlikely, any conventional campaign confined to the disputed territory could still inflict heavy battlefield losses and easily spill beyond the Kashmir region.</p>
<p>The conflict over Kashmir has the potential to substantially escalate or even become a full-blown war. Past triggers like terror attacks and corresponding Indian strikes on Pakistan have been controlled and external actors have placed significant pressure to de-escalate.</p>
<p>There is also a substantial risk of conflicts or increased violence inside India and Pakistan, with the potential for anti-Muslim violence in India or rebel groups like Balochistan separatists or the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan taking advantage of any conflict between the countries.</p>
<p>The Global Peace Index 2025 has pinpointed a set of critical escalation hotspots and regions where conflict risks are accelerating and could evolve into major wars.</p>
<p>According to the index, South Asia, the second least peaceful region globally, experienced the largest regional decline in peacefulness. This deterioration was driven primarily by repressive measures in Bangladesh under the Hasina government, and the heightened civil unrest and escalating internal and cross-border tensions in Pakistan.</p>
<p>This year’s results found that the average level of global peacefulness deteriorated by 0.36 per cent. This is the thirteenth deterioration in peacefulness in the last 17 years, with 74 countries improving and 87 deteriorating in peacefulness. Iceland remains the most peaceful country in the world, a position it has held since 2008.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918013/pia-resumes-lahore-paris-flight-after-five-years' target='_blank'><strong>PIA resumes Lahore-Paris flight after five years</strong></a>
            <p><p>LAHORE: The PIA has resumed Lahore-Paris flight five years after the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) lifted ban on its operations in Europe.</p>
<p>The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and UK authorities had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1566153">suspended</a> permission for PIA to operate in the region in June 2020 after Pakistan began investigating the validity of pilots’ licences following a deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1558944">plane crash</a> in Karachi that killed 97 people.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875575">ban lift</a> on PIA by the EASA in November last year, the national flag carrier had resumed Islamabad-Paris flights early this year. “We can operate for any destination in Europe now (except the UK) after the lifting of ban by the EASA. However, it depends upon traffic on specific routes in Europe,” a senior official of PIA told <em>Dawn</em> on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He said the PIA was also hopeful that its operation for the UK would resume in a couple of months as well. “Talks with the UK authorities concerned are underway and hopefully the PIA will be operating flights there in a couple of months,” he said.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the first weekly flight PK-733 departed from Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International Airport for Paris, France, with 276 passengers on board.</p>
<p>The PIA has been operating two weekly flights from Islamabad to Paris since January this year.</p>
<p>“A Boeing 777 aircraft was deployed for this route, featuring a newly refurbished cabin interior designed to enhance passenger comfort,” a PIA spokesperson said and added that to mark the occasion, a ceremony was held at Allama Iqbal International Airport.</p>
<p>Passengers were seen off by PIA’s Chief Executive Officer Air Vice Marshal Aamir Hayat, Chief Operating Officer Khurram Mushtaq, Head of Mission of the French Embassy Franck Aubry, and other senior officials of the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA).</p>
<p>“This flight will further boost aviation, tourism, trade and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr Aubry expressed hope for deeper ties between Pakistan and France through this new air link.</p>
<p>On resumption of the Islamabad-Paris flight in January last, the national flag carrier faced criticism for an advertisement featuring one of their planes flying towards the Eiffel Tower, with many finding the image “insensitive and reminiscent of the 9/11 attacks”.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193129/yikes-pias-misplaced-advertisement-for-flights-to-paris-is-worrying-the-internet">ad</a> showing [posted on social media by PIA] a Boeing 777 flying towards the Eiffel Tower with the caption “Paris, we’re coming today” even drew ire of the government functionaries. It was deemed a “stupidity” by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar. The PIA subsequently issued an apology, stating the intention was not to offend or cause alarm.</p>
