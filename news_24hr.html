            <p><p>• Observes things are calming down following contacts between DGMOs; NSA to lead Pakistan side during dialogue<br />
• Says Nawaz was consulted before army chief’s elevation to field marshal</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said Saudi Arabia could be the “neutral” venue for much-needed talks between Pakistan and India on critical issues.</p>
<p>The premier also said that he had consulted PML-N President Nawaz Sharif on his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912186/cabinet-approves-coas-gen-asim-munirs-promotion-to-field-marshal">decision</a> to elevate Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir to field marshal.</p>
<p>Talking to a group of TV anchors at the PM House, he said that Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism will be the key points during the dialogue with India.</p>
<p>In response to a question if there was a possibility of a third venue for talks in light of the mediation offered by US President Donald Trump, the premier ruled out the possibility of China as a neutral venue, saying India would never agree to that.</p>
<p>However, a participant told <em>Dawn</em>, the PM expressed the hope that Saudi Arabia could be the third country where both sides could agree to hold the negotiations.</p>
<p>When it was pointed out that India intends to hold dialogue on terrorism while Pakistan wants to focus on Kashmir, the PM reiterated: “Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism will be the key points during Pakistan-India talks.”</p>
<p>Regarding the appointment of COAS Gen Munir as field marshal, PM Shehbaz said: “It was my own decision to make the army chief a field marshal.”</p>
<p>Responding to a question that Nawaz Sharif had always remained opposed to giving extension to the army chief’s term in office, PM Shehbaz said he took his elder brother into confidence before taking any decision and likewise the COAS was made field marshal after consultation with the ruling party president.</p>
<p>“I always consult Nawaz Sharif before taking any key decision and that also happened in case of [elevation of] Gen Asim Munir,” he added.</p>
<p>In reply to a question that the PTI-led KP government needs to be supported in its efforts for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005">eradicating</a> terrorism, the prime minister said Centre was already helping the province in this regard as over Rs600 billion had been released to the KP government under the Public Sector Development Programme.</p>
<p>He said that situation between Pakistan and India was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910567">de-escalating</a> after the DGMOs of the two sides made contacts with each other.</p>
<p>He said if talks were held between the two arch rivals, the National Secur­ity Adviser will lead Paki­stan’s side in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting on housing</strong></p>
<p>Presiding over a meeting on the low-cost housing, the prime minister said that affordable projects would not only make residential units accessible to the common man but would also boost national economy and create jobs.</p>
<p>He said the relevant task force, in collaboration with the ministry of fina­n­ce and banks, should soon submit recommendations for financing low-cost hou­s­ing projects, which should be included in the upcoming budget proposals.</p>
<p>He observed that sustainable growth of economy was closely linked with the development of the construction sector.</p>
<p>Ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Riaz Hussain Pirzada, Ahad Khan Cheema, Muh­a­mmad Aurangzeb, and Ali Pervaiz Malik, the FBR chairman and other senior officials attended the mee­t­ing, the PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.</p>
<p>The meeting was infor­med that the Condominium Act 2025 and amendments to the Foreclosure Law were in their final stages and after their approval it would become easier to obtain loans for the construction and ownership of homes under the low-cost housing schemes.</p>
<p>The task force briefed the meeting on the progress in initiating construction projects, particularly low-cost housing schemes.</p>

            <p><p>• Three students, two soldiers martyred; eight critical among 43 injured in Khuzdar<br />
• Shehbaz reaches Quetta, asks world to confront use of terrorism as a foreign policy tool<br />
• Army sees India’s hand in attack, says Delhi using ‘proxies’ to foment terrorism in Pakistan<br />
• Bombing draws across-the-board condemnation, including from US and China</p>
<p>QUETTA/KHUZDAR: At least six people, including three students, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357/4-students-killed-several-injured-as-school-bus-comes-under-attack-in-khuzdar-dc">lost their lives</a> and over 40 others — mostly students — sustained injuries after a bomb targeted a school bus in Khuzdar on Wedn­esday, prompting the prime minister to visit Quetta to take stock of the security situation amid across-the-board condemnations.</p>
<p>The condition of at least a dozen is said to be serious due to critical injuries, officials said, adding that at least 15 girl students are among the injured. The incident occurred near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when the bus was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.</p>
<p>“It was a suicide attack through which the Army Public School bus was targeted at Zero Point in Khuzdar,” a senior police officer confirmed. Deputy Commissioner Yasar Iqbal Dashti also confirmed the explosion as a suicide attack.</p>
<p>A senior official in the Khuzdar administration told <em>Dawn</em> that about 49 people, including over 40 students, were on the bus when a powerful explosion took place next to it, which completely destr­oyed the vehicle.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Three girls who perished in the incident were identified as Ayesha Saleem (class 10), Hafsa Kausar (class 7), and Sania Somroo (class 6). “They were martyred on the spot,” an official said, adding that two of the three other deceased were identified as Muhammad Iqbal, driver, and Sepoy Qadeer.</p>
<p>According to the officials, some of the victims who received serious injuries were shifted to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) in Quetta.</p>
<p>No one had claimed responsibility for the attack till the filing of this report.</p>
<p>The attack on school bus prompted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his cabinet members to rush to Quetta where they received a security briefing. Later, a statement issued by the PM Office quoted him as saying, “Pakistan’s security forces and law enforcement agencies will relentlessly pursue all those involved in this barbaric act.</p>
<p>“The architects, abettors, and enablers of this crime will be held accountable and brought to justice and the truth about India’s cunning role, a real perpetrator of terrorism but feigns as a victim, stands exposed before the world.”</p>
<p>The statement detailed the incident, claiming the act was carried out by “state-sponsored proxies of India (<em>Fitna al Hindustan</em>)” and added that “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005/3-terrorists-of-indian-proxy-blf-killed-in-balochistan-engagements-ispr">dastardly terrorist incidents</a>” were being orchestrated through proxies in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, “deliberately targeting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832793/two-children-injured-in-ied-blast-truck-torched-in-balochistan">civilians</a> in a futile attempt to destabilise Pakistan”.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, along with the prime minister also visited the injured victims.</p>
<p><strong>‘Instruments of its state policy’</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, the PM was briefed by the Balochistan chief minister and the Quetta corps commander about the attack, which claimed the lives of three children and two soldiers and left 43 others, including 39 children, injured. The condition of eight students was described as critical.</p>
<p>The premier said the terrorist groups — masquerading under ethnic pretences — were not only being exploited by India as instruments of its state policy, but also a stain on the honour and values of the Baloch and Pashtun people, who have long rejected violence and extremism.</p>
<p>India’s reliance on such morally indefensible tactics, particularly the deliberate targeting of children, demands urgent attention from the international community, he said, adding that the use of terrorism as a tool of foreign policy must be unequivocally condemned and confronted.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz and COAS Asim Munir highlighted that it’s time that the nation displays a very strong resolve similar to the one shown recently against the aggression by India, to bring the fight against foreign-sponsored terrorism to its logical and decisive end.</p>
<p><strong>Bugti presser</strong></p>
<p>Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti, in a press conference, accused India of targeting innocent children following its “political defeat” on May 9 and 10 He claimed that intelligence reports had warned of India-sponsored attacks in Balochistan. “We never imagined children would be targeted. Ajit Doval’s ideology has sunk to such disgraceful levels,” he said.</p>
<p>He claimed that while ‘hundreds of terrorists’ were killed or arrested last year, legal loopholes had led to their release. A new anti-terrorism law was being formulated, which would include provisions for establishing detention centres to address the issue of missing persons. He also urged Afghanistan’s interim government to honour its Doha Agreement commitments and ensure its soil is not used for cross-border terrorism.</p>
<p><strong>‘Most heinous and cowardly’ attack</strong></p>
<p>In a statement following the blast, the Inter-Services Public Relations said that “after having miserably failed in the battlefield, through these most heinous and cowardly such like acts, Indian proxies have been unleashed to spread terror and unrest in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa”.</p>
<p>The ISPR said, “Indian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians”</p>
<p>It noted that India had “failed” in Pakistan’s Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent conflict, and its [proxies] were “being hunted [down] by military and law enforcement agencies”.</p>
<p>“Use of terrorism as a state policy by [the] Indian political government is abhorrent and reflective of their low morality and disregard of [sic] basic human norms,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p>“Planners, abettors and executors of this cowardly Indian sponsored attack will be hunted down and brought to justice and [the] heinous face of India will be exposed in front of the entire world,” the military media wing said.</p>
<p><strong>Condemnation</strong></p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari termed the attack a “heinous and inhumane crime” and vowed to expose this “India-backed terrorism” at an international level. “These terrorists do not want to see Balochistan developed,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz condemned the attack as a cowardly act. “The attack on innocent children in a school bus by terrorists working under Indian patronage is a clear proof of their hostility towards education in Balochistan,” he said in a statement.</p>

<p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari described the attack as ‘a despicable and inhuman act, beneath all moral and human values’. “This cowardice against our children is an attack on the soul of Pakistan. Innocent lives, full of dreams, extinguished in an instant. We share in the grief of the bereaved families,” he wrote on X, vowing that Pakistan would bring all those responsible to light and justice.</p>
<p>The US embassy in Islamabad said it stood with Pakistan in condemning the “brutal” and “unconscionable” attack. “The murder of innocent children is beyond comprehension. We grieve with the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts are with those recovering. No child should ever fear going to school. We stand with those in Pakistan working to end this violence,” it said.</p>
<p>The Chinese embassy said it was saddened to hear about the attack. “China firmly opposes all forms of terrorism. We strongly condemn this terrorist attack, extend our deep condolences to the victims and sincere sympathies to the bereaved families, and wish the injured an early recovery,” it added.</p>
<p>Unicef also released a statement, extending condolences to the families, adding that it stood in solidarity with all those affected.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912486/imf-yet-to-decide-on-budget-relief-request' target='_blank'><strong>IMF yet to decide on budget relief request</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Seeking effective and practical steps for the realisation of agriculture income tax and improvements in retail sector taxation, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has yet to take a position on Pakistan’s request for relief measures in the upcoming <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909569">budget</a>, due on June 2.</p>
<p>The authorities, however, have committed to meeting any revenue shortfall through reduced expenditure in the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) during the current year. An increase in the petroleum levy and the introduction of a carbon levy on petroleum and other energy products are expected to be part of the forthcoming budget, sources said.</p>
<p>Informed sources told <em>Dawn</em> that, on the directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, officials at the Ministry of Finance and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) have discussed possible relief measures with the IMF mission, which has been engaged in budget <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912130">discussions</a> since May 14. Among the proposed concessions is an average 2.5 per cent reduction in income tax rates across all salaried income slabs.</p>
<p>However, this proposal hinges on IMF staff being satisfied with the government’s revenue plan that supports the programme’s target of a 1.6pc primary budget surplus — approximately Rs2.1 trillion. An official told <em>Dawn</em> that discussions on budget targets are still ongoing and that no measures have been finalised.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Authorities pledge PSDP cuts to cover revenue gap</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Datasheets and projections, in line with the proposed budgetary framework reviewed in the first biannual review a few weeks ago, have been shared with the IMF. Responses to the Fund’s queries are currently being compiled. The official said that the IMF’s position on the proposed revenue and expenditure strategy will become clearer once its staff analyses the data through its software-based framework.</p>
<p>He added that the IMF has neither accepted nor rejected the proposed relief measures for the budget, contrary to reports in certain quarters. Formal discussions regarding budgetary proposals for the real estate sector have yet to take place.</p>
<p>The government’s “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1835356">Tajir Dost</a>” scheme for retailers, meanwhile, has failed to yield the desired results and is likely to be replaced by a more effective revenue collection strategy.</p>
<p>The IMF has also emphasised the need to reduce provincial expenditures and increase provincial revenue contributions to maintain fiscal discipline and progress towards implementing a national fiscal pact. A key priority at the provincial level, according to the Fund, should be the effective enforcement of agriculture income tax beginning September 2025.</p>
<p>The government has pledged to withhold PSDP disbursements to offset revenue shortfalls and expects additional tax revenues through the resolution of litigation cases. The Fund has already acknowledged the authorities’ commitment to pursuing resolution of outstanding legal cases — worth Rs367 billion out of a total Rs770bn under dispute. These include cases before the Supreme Court (Rs43bn), high courts in Islamabad, Sindh and Lahore (Rs217bn), and the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (Rs104bn).</p>
<p>A favorable SC ruling could effectively resolve cases involving an estimated Rs120bn, according to the IMF.</p>
