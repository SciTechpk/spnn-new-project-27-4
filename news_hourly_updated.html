                <h2>Trilateral dialogue: Afghan Taliban govt seeks constructive engagement with Pakistan, China</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Afghan government under the Taliban has called for ‚Äúmutual respect and constructive engagement‚Äù with Pakistan and China, according to a statement issued by its interior ministry.</p>
<p>The statement was issued after special envoys of Pakistan and China, Mohammad Sadiq and Yue Xiaoyong, met Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul. The trilateral forum was established in 2017, with earlier meetings held in Beijing and the Afghan capital.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMinister of Interior Khalifa Sirajuddin Haqqani emphasised the importance of strengthening regional ties, stating that, from the Islamic Emirate‚Äôs perspective, the advancement of economic and political relations, as well as regional understanding, can be achieved through mutual respect and constructive engagement,‚Äù the Afghan interior ministry said.</p>
<p>It added that the special envoys of China and Pakistan reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening good neighbourly relations and fostering cooperation with Afghanistan based on mutual engagement. They also agreed that the sixth round of the trilateral dialogue between the foreign ministers would be held in Kabul, continuing the established mechanism.</p>
<p>Separately, in a post on X, Ambassador Sadiq said: ‚ÄúThe meeting aimed to follow up on the fifth trilateral dialogue between the foreign ministers of the three countries, held in Islamabad; prepare for the upcoming sixth ministerial round; and strengthen three-way political and economic cooperation.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe delegations emphasised their commitment to good neighbourly relations, regional stability, mutual respect, and constructive engagement as foundations for stronger ties,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>Separately, the Afghan Foreign Ministry said that Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi held a meeting in Kabul with the Pakistani and Chinese special envoys and their accompanying delegations.</p>
<p>In a statement, the ministry said the meeting ‚Äúfocused on following up on the agenda of the fifthth round of the Afghanistan-China-Pakistan Trilateral Foreign Ministers‚Äô Dialogue‚Äù.</p>
<p>The fifthth round, which was held in Islamabad in May 2023, had ‚Äústressed on the need of not allowing any individual, group or party, including the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) etc., to use their territories to harm and threaten regional security and interests, or conduct terrorist actions and activities‚Äù.</p>
<p>Kabul‚Äôs trilateral meeting on May 10 decided that the sixth round of the Trilateral Foreign Ministers‚Äô Dialogue would be convened in Kabul, with preparatory measures also to be undertaken for the forthcoming meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Afghanistan‚Äôs neighboring countries.</p>
<p>However, no date was announced for the trilateral meeting. ‚ÄúUnderscoring the importance of political and economic relations with both countries, FM Muttaqi expressed hope for continued progress in these areas,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>In a post on X, Ambassador Sadiq said the meeting provided the occasion for convergence of views on economic and security cooperation as well as regional stability.</p>

            </a>
            <p><p>Renowned Pakistani climber Sajid Ali Sadpara on Saturday summited the world‚Äôs seventh highest peak ‚Äî Dhaulagiri at 8,167 metres ‚Äî without oxygen or porter support.</p>
<p>On May 4, four Pakistani climbers <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908451">began</a> their expedition to climb Dhaulagiri, located in Nepal. Sadpara had reached the base camp of the peak on April 6 and had begun his rotation and climbed up to the Camp 3 and descended to the base camp.</p>
<p>The feat, confirmed by the Alpine Club of Pakistan, marks Sadpara‚Äôs ninth 8,000m peak, all of which were climbed without bottled oxygen and were completely unsupported.</p>

<p>In a statement, Seven Summit Treks said the team successfully reached the summit starting at 9:35am on Saturday, marking the first confirmed ascent of Dhaulagiri in the Spring 2025 season.</p>
<p>The expedition team had previously fixed ropes up to 8,050m and launched their final summit push during a favourable weather window.</p>
<p>The team began their summit push from Camp IV at 6:15pm on Friday, making relentless efforts to reach the top while simultaneously securing the final section of the route by fixing over 350m of rope.</p>
<p>This year, Kangchenjunga has seen an impressive turnout, with nearly 70 international climbers and an equal number of Sherpas taking on the challenge.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt just 29 years old, Sajid has displayed remarkable endurance, resilience, and dedication to high-altitude mountaineering,‚Äù the Alpine Club of Pakistan said in a statement.</p>
<p>His Dhaulagiri expedition was organised by Seven Summit Treks Nepal and Sabroso Pakistan, with technical gear sponsored by Kailas.</p>
<p>‚Äú[Sadpara] is the proud son of the legendary Muhammad Ali Sadpara, who tragically lost his life during a winter ascent of K2 in 2021. Carrying his father‚Äôs legacy with honour, Sajid has emerged as a powerful symbol of Pakistani mountaineering strength and global excellence.</p>
<p>Karrar Haidri, secretary of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, congratulated Sadpara, calling it ‚Äúa historic milestone that reflects the strength and courage of Pakistani climbers on the world stage‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is another proud moment for Pakistan and the mountaineering world!‚Äù</p>
<p>While speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em> before beginning his summit push, Sadpara had said he would attempt to climb the peak without supplement oxygen and porter support.</p>
<p>Sadpara has already summited eight of the world‚Äôs peaks above 8,000m, including Everest, K2 , Nanga Parbat, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum-I, and Gasherbrum-II.</p>
<p>He has also taken part in rescue operations at several peaks including K2, and plans to summit all 14 peaks above 8,000m.</p>
<p>Sadpara has made a name for himself in the alpine community with his summits of the most daunting peaks at a young age.</p>
<p>He has climbed K2 twice; once without supplemental oxygen. He also set records when he summited both <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1704579">Gasherbrum-I</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1704247">Gasherbrum-II</a> peaks in three days and 18 hours without supplementary oxygen.</p>
<p>In February 2021, his father Muhammad Ali Sadpara, Iceland‚Äôs John Snorri and Chile‚Äôs Juan Pablo Mohr went <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1608060">missing</a> while attempting to summit the K2 during the winter season.</p>
<p>Their bodies were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1637052">found</a> in July, nearly five months after they went missing.</p>
<p>Sadpara described the search for the bodies of his father and other missing climbers as ‚Äúthe most challenging and extraordinary mission‚Äù of his life.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFirst, the summit of K2 itself was a dangerous adventure and the burial of my father above eight thousand metres was heartbreaking,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was impossible to take the bodies back to base camp so we decided to bury them on the mountain.‚Äù</p>
<p>Now, Sajid Sadpara said his mission to summit all 14 peaks above eight-thousand metres altitude without supplementary oxygen would be the fulfilment of his father‚Äôs dream.</p>
<p>For him, climbing was something he was born to take up.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen you get an environment where you listen and practice only to become a mountaineer, you definitely become one,‚Äù he explained while talking about his father‚Äôs training.</p></p>
