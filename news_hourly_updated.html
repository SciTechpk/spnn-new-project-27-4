                <h2>Pakistani pilgrims barred from by-road travel to Iran, Iraq this Arbaeen: interior minister</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistani pilgrims will be barred from travelling by road to Iran and Iraq for the Arbaeen pilgrimage due to public and national security, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Pilgrims <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855955">visit Iraq</a> to attend the chehlum commemoration ‚Äî also known as Arbaeen (40 in Arabic) ‚Äî to mark the 40th day of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922472/ashura-processions-in-major-cities-of-country-conclude-peacefully">mourning</a> for the martyrdom of Imam Husain, the grandson of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter extensive consultations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [the] Balochistan Government, and security agencies, it has been decided that <em>zaireen</em> (pilgrims) will not be allowed to travel to Iraq and Iran by road for Arbaeen this year,‚Äù Naqvi said on X.</p>
<p>He added that the ‚Äúdifficult decision was taken in the interest of public safety and national security‚Äù.</p>
<p>However, the pilgrims will be able to travel by air, the minister noted.</p>

<p>Naqvi stressed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed authorities to ‚Äúarrange maximum flights to facilitate their pilgrimage in the coming days‚Äù.</p>
<p>Naqvi‚Äôs statement came after he met with PM Shehbaz earlier today to brief him on the new policy for pilgrims, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> (<em>APP</em>) <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/interior-minister-calls-on-pm-briefs-over-zaireens-new-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The premier also directed Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif to arrange ‚Äúspecial flights for the pilgrims, <em>APP</em> stated, citing a press release from the PM Office.</p>
<p>Iraq‚Äôs Karbala, where Imam Hussein and his brother Abbas are buried in two enormous mausoleums facing each other, is the centre of the Shia world during this time. More than <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854804/millions-of-pilgrims-rally-for-arbaeen">21 million</a> devotees took part in the pilgrimage last year.</p>
<p>Pakistan is set to introduce a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922178">new travel management system</a> from Jan 1, 2026, under which pilgrims will only be allowed to undertake the journey under registered organisers.</p>

<p>Under the new measures, the traditional Salar System will be abolished and replaced with a Zaireen Group Organisers model. Alongside weekly flights to Iran being increased from six to 15, 107 additional special flights will also be arranged for pilgrims heading to Iraq.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousuf <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925358/religious-affairs-minister-retracts-40000-missing-pilgrims-remark">retracted</a> his statement that 40,000 pilgrims had not returned from trips to Iran and Iraq. He clarified that a ‚Äúmisunderstanding‚Äù of outdated paper records that had not yet been fully digitised resulted in the statement.</p>

<p>During their meeting, PM Shehbaz and Naqvi also discussed the law and order situation in Balochistan, with the premier telling the minister to initiate work on the Gwadar Safe City project.</p>

<p>Senator Marri had sought a report on a critical discrepancy ‚Äî the Gwadar Development Authority officials blamed a lack of funds for the project delays, while the Finance Division said it had received no funding demand from the Balochistan government.</p>

            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Sunday announced that he has agreed on multiple visa waivers for diplomatic and official Pakistani passports with his Emirati counterpart.</p>
<p>Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The UAE is one of Pakistan‚Äôs largest trading partners in the Middle East and a major source of remittances, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.</p>
<p>In a post on X, Dar announced the agreement with UAE‚Äôs Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, hailing the decision between ‚Äúour two brotherly countries‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have been informed by the UAE authorities that the visa waiver for diplomatic and official Pakistani passports entering the United Arab Emirates has been activated, effective July 25, 2025, at all UAE airports,‚Äù the foreign minister wrote.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe agreed [on] mutual visa waivers on diplomatic and official passports between our two brotherly countries and we both signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to make this arrangement effective and operative after 30 days of the signing,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>According to Dar, reciprocal arrangements have also been activated for Emirati nationals at all Pakistani airports.</p>

<p>Al Nahyan‚Äôs statement came during a meeting with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, who is currently on an official visit to the UAE. During the visit, Naqvi emphasised the importance of easing the visa policy, stating, ‚ÄúWe want Pakistani citizens to come to the UAE with ease. Relaxation in visa policies will bring great relief.‚Äù</p>
