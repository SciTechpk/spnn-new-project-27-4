                <h2>PTI presents ‚Äòmessage of unity‚Äô, warns against toppling KP govt</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Wednesday said that the party was standing together and presenting a ‚Äúmessage of unity‚Äù amid rumours of rifts while warning the federal government against toppling the party‚Äôs Khyber Pakhtunkhwa administration.</p>
<p>Background briefings revealed a complete <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920889/lack-of-trust-sparks-fissures-within-pti#:~:text=Background%20briefings%20revealed%20a%20complete%20lack%20of%20trust%20among%20PTI%20leaders,%20with%20doubts%20about%20each%20other%E2%80%99s%20sincerity%20and%20intentions,%20particularly%20regarding%20Imran%20Khan%E2%80%99s%20messages.">lack of trust</a> among PTI leaders, with doubts about each other‚Äôs sincerity and intentions, particularly regarding messages from party founder Imran Khan, who has been behind bars since August 2023.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Islamabad and flanked by senior PTI leaders, the party chairman outlined the issues discussed in a high-level meeting and maintained that the PTI would continue efforts to try and free Imran.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>‚ÄúWe discussed the aftermath of the reserved seat ruling, which was the first time that the party formed a strategy together,‚Äù Gohar said. ‚ÄúIt is our decision that we will stand up together for Imran Khan. We have no personal conflict, we are and will remain united and a message of unity needed to be sent in today‚Äôs meeting.‚Äù</p>
<p>Gohar added that the meeting discussed Imran‚Äôs plan for the party to launch a protest movement, stating: ‚ÄúWhatever Khan <em>sahib</em> decides, we will execute it.‚Äù</p>

<p>Gohar said that PTI MNAs, MPAs and senators all attended today‚Äôs meeting, which discussed a wide range of issues from the reserved seats verdict and the party‚Äôs direction to addressing dialogue with the government.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhatever direction will be announced, you will see it in due course.‚Äù</p>
<p>Discussing the letter from jailed PTI leaders suggesting dialogue with the government, Gohar noted that the media would often infer that the government extended offers for talks, which were rejected by the PTI.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is incorrect, from the beginning, Khan <em>sahib</em> said that there should be dialogue,‚Äù Gohar said. ‚ÄúEven after our mandate was stolen, he said that. You have taken our seats, but you have registered cases against three of our MNAs, yet Khan <em>sahib</em> says that dialogue needs to be meaningful,‚Äù the party chairman added.</p>
<p>Gohar said that there was no delay on the PTI‚Äôs part, but said that the government was ‚Äúnot sincere‚Äù since it refused to grant the party access to Imran.</p>
<p>Talking about the reserved seats, he noted that there were 25 seats from KP. ‚ÄúEven if these seats go to the opposition ‚Ä¶ then they are 35 members short. We will protect the KP government at all costs,‚Äù Gohar stated. ‚ÄúThose who want to bring a no-confidence motion do not have the required numbers to move even a resolution.‚Äù</p>
<p>PTI KP President Junaid Akbar said that all of the provincial political leadership was also present at the meeting and stressed that within the party, decisions by the founder were respected by all members, with ‚Äúdiscord set to one side‚Äù.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur challenged other parties and institutions to topple the PTI‚Äôs government in KP.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf you have it in you, I challenge your strength and I challenge the state ‚Ä¶ if you are able to topple our government, then I will leave politics,‚Äù he stated.</p>

<p>He criticised the government, saying that it was a ‚Äúdisgraceful stain on the state and its institutions‚Äù within the country‚Äôs political history, but ‚Äúthey are not ashamed‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are time-tested people who have given sacrifices ‚Ä¶ So this is a challenge to your powers to try anything only without any conspiracies or unconstitutional ways. But you cannot do it. You cannot topple Khan‚Äôs people.‚Äù</p>

<p>Speaking on the Feb 8 elections, PTI Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja said that they would always be remembered as the most ‚Äúdemocratic day‚Äù in history, along with the ‚Äúattack on Pakistani people‚Äù, referring to the election results.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will continue to struggle for the public. We will succeed. Do not think that by stealing seats, suppressing the judiciary, the people will step back. We are with the people.‚Äù</p>
<p>He further said, ‚ÄúWe stand with Imran‚Äôs struggle for the public. We will continue to struggle for the public.‚Äù</p>
<p>Meanwhile, party spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram said the assembled leadership passed a unanimous resolution against the Constitutional Bench‚Äôs verdict on reserved seats and stated that the party would work to ensure the release of Imran and other jailed PTI leaders.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLegal action, peaceful protest and negotiation are steps we are willing to take,‚Äù Akram said, quoting the resolution. He too said the party was united under Imran‚Äôs leadership and would remain so.</p></p>

                <h2>Ruling coalition given two-thirds majority as ECP distributes reserved seats</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The ruling coalition was handed its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly on Wednesday with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) distributing the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621">reserved seats</a> to the PML-N, PPP and the opposition Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) following the Supreme Court‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920721/ptis-hopes-dashed-as-rivals-set-to-receive-reserved-seats">verdict</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, the Constit¬≠utional Bench overturned the Supreme Court‚Äôs earlier judgement in the reserved seats case ‚Äî effectively taking away reserved seats from the PTI and handing them to their rival parties in the national and provincial legislatures. The decision, handed down by a majority of seven judges, supersedes the July 12, 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">majority judgement</a> by eight judges, which had declared the PTI eligible for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the assemblies.</p>
<p>The Constitutional Bench‚Äôs decision effectively meant the PTI was no longer a parliamentary party.</p>
<p>Acting on the court‚Äôs verdict, the ECP issued an order today withdrawing its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1848065">July 24</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1848903">29 notifications</a> from last year that had declared returned candidates against general seats of the National Assembly and the Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies as returned candidates of the PTI.</p>
<p>In another order today, the ECP notified the names of the returned candidates under various categories of reserved seats with immediate effect, distributing 13 seats to the PML-N in the National Assembly, four to the PPP and two to the opposition JUI-F.</p>
<p>After this process, the ruling coalition ach¬≠ieves a two-thirds majority; in a house of 336, the mag¬≠ic number required to at¬≠¬≠tain a two-thirds majority is 224.</p>

<p>The National Assembly Secretariat‚Äôs Legislation Branch later issued the National Assembly composition reflecting the actual party position after the apex court‚Äôs verdict and ECP‚Äôs distribution. It showed the treasury benches as now having 235 seats to the opposition‚Äôs 98 seats, for a total of 333 seats with one MNA suspended and two reserved seats being vacant.</p>
<p>The ECP also distributed reserved seats in the provincial assemblies. In the KP Assembly, 10 seats were given to the JUI-F, seven to the PML-N, six to the PPP and one each to the PTI-Parliamentarians and Awami National Party.</p>
<p>The PML-N was given 23 seats in the Punjab Assembly, two for the PPP and one each to the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid and Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party.</p>
<p>In the Sindh Assembly, two seats were given to the PPP and one to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#reserved-seats-case" id="reserved-seats-case" title="Permalink"></a>Reserved seats case</h2>
<p>Through its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1821427">March 25, 2024</a> order, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) had deprived the Sunni Ittehad Council ‚Äî the party <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1816169">joined</a> by PTI-backed independents after the Feb 8, 2024, polls ‚Äî of reserved seats.</p>
<p>On the date of the first hearing of this case, Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908809/two-judges-object-as-sc-accepts-review-pleas-on-reserved-seats-for-hearing">rejected</a> outright the review petitions filed by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1846084">PML-N</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850678#:~:text=ECP%20files%20review%20plea">ECP</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847508/ppp-takes-cue-from-pml-n-files-review-petition-on-sc-reserved-seats-verdict">PPP</a>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, their names were excluded from the strength of the Constitutional Bench, even though they were considered part of the bench.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail had partly allowed the review petitions and maintained his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531#:~:text=Chief%20Justice%20Qazi%20Faez%20Isa%20read%20out%20the%20minority%20judgement%2C%20written%20by%20Justice%20Jamal%20Khan%20Mandokhail">original order</a> of giving 39 seats to PTI, but reviewed the majority judgment to the extent of 41 seats.</p>
<p>In his July 12 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866985#:~:text=Justice%20Jamal%20Khan%20Mandokhail%2C%20in%20his%20dissenting%20note">dissenting order</a>, Justice Mandokhail had declared PTI a parliamentary party consisting of 39 members, and thus entitled to reserved seats. Therefore, the ECP should recalculate and reallocate the reserved seats amongst the political parties, including PTI, he held.</p>
<p>The July 12 majority judgement had asked the rest of the 41 independent candidates to file signed and notarised statements before the commission within 15 days ‚Äî explaining that they contested the Feb 8 general elections as a candidate of a particular political party. Consequently, the ECP had notified them as PTI members, in light of the judgement.</p>
<p>Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, who were part of the earlier majority judgement, also reviewed their positions and allowed the review petitions.</p>
<p>However, they posited that since the controversy at hand could not be resolved, either by the PHC or the Supreme Court, the ECP should examine and consider afresh the nomination papers/declaration and other relevant documents of all <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621#:~:text=the%20verdict%20stated.-,List%20of%2080%20MNAs,-The%20verdict%20listed">80 returned candidates</a>, with regard to their affiliation, and take a decision on the allocation of reserved seats within 15 days from receiving a copy of their short order.</p></p>
