<p>A day after Israel wiped out the top echelon of Iran’s military command, it hit Iran’s oil and gas industry for the first time. Iran then partially suspended gas production at the South Pars gas field, which it shares with Qatar.</p>
<p>The latest wave of Iranian attacks began shortly after 11pm on Saturday (1am PKT Sunday), when air raid sirens blared in Jerusalem and Haifa, sending around a million people into bomb shelters.</p>
<p>Around 2:30am local time (4:30am PKT), the Israeli military warned of another incoming missile barrage and urged residents to seek shelter.</p>

<p>Explosions echoed through Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as missiles streaked across the skies, as interceptor rockets were launched in response. The military lifted its shelter-in-place advisory nearly an hour after issuing the warning.</p>
<p>The ambulance service said at least seven people were killed overnight, including a 10-year-old boy and a woman in her 20s, and more than 140 were injured in multiple attacks.</p>
<p>Search and rescue workers combed through the rubble of residential buildings destroyed in multiple strikes, using flashlights and dogs to look for survivors.</p>
<p>Israeli media said at least 35 people were missing after a strike hit Bat Yam, a city south of Tel Aviv. A spokesperson for the emergency services said a missile hit an eight-storey building there and while many people were rescued, there were fatalities.</p>
<p>It was unclear how many buildings were hit overnight.</p>
<p>So far, at least nine people in Israel have been killed and over 300 others injured since Iran launched its retaliatory attacks on Friday.</p>

<p>Brigadier General Ali Mohammad Naeini, the spokesperson for the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), said in a televised statement that Israel’s fuel production facilities for fighter jets and energy supply centres were targeted with a large number of drones and missiles, <em>Press TV</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/06/14/749850/Iran-IRGC-attack-Israel-fighter-jet-fuel-energy-sites-missiles-drones" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The IRGC spokesperson also claimed that the IRGC aerospace defense system had “successfully intercepted and destroyed” three Israeli cruise missiles, 10 drones, and dozens of “hostile mini-drones in the affected regions”.</p>
<p>The elite force warned Tehran’s attacks will be “heavier and more extensive” if Israel continues its hostilities.</p>
<p>Yemen’s Houthis also said they targeted Israel in coordination with Iran, the first time a regional group has publicly announced joint cooperation on attacks with Tehran.</p>
<p>The Yemeni group targeted central Israel’s Jaffa with several ballistic missiles in the last 24 hours, military spokesperson Yehya Sarea <a class="link--external" href="https://snn.ir/fa/news/1274093/%DB%8C%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B4%DA%A9%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%88%D9%82%E2%80%8C%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%AA-%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%BA%D8%A7%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%81-%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF%DB%8C%D9%85-%D9%81%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%85" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a televised address.</p>
<p>“Triumphing for the oppressed Palestinian and Iranian peoples […] This operation was coordinated with the operations carried out by the Iranian army against the criminal Israeli enemy,” he added.</p>
<p>In Iran, nearly 140 people have been killed since Friday, with 78 on the first day of Israel’s campaign, and scores more yesterday, including 60 when a missile brought down a 14-storey apartment block in Tehran, where 29 of the dead were children.</p>
<p>The Shahran oil depot in Tehran was targeted in an Israeli attack, Iran said, but added the situation was under control.</p>
<p>A fire had erupted after an Israeli attack on an oil refinery near the capital while Israeli strikes also targeted Iran’s defence ministry building, causing minor damage, the semi-official <em>Tasnim</em> news agency said.</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump said earlier today that if Iran attacks the United States in “any way, shape or form”, it would face the might of the US military “at levels never seen before”.</p>
<p>Trump said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114685507052179501" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on his Truth Social platform that the US had nothing to do with an attack on Iran overnight and that “we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict!!!”</p>

<p>Three drones were launched toward the Ain al-Asad air base housing US forces in western Iraq following Israel’s strikes on Iran, the <em>Associated Press</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-iran-war-latest-06-14-2025-19c175edc115d99f0d35c24b38ab1773#:~:text=Drones%20launched%20toward%20base%20housing%20US%20forces%20in%20Iraq%20shot%20down" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>, citing a US military official and a second US official.</p>
<p>The drones were shot down, the officials said. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the report.</p>
<p><em>AP</em> further said that for a second day, supporters of armed factions in Iraq held a demonstration in Baghdad to denounce Israel’s bombing of Iran but did not attempt to breach a high-security zone where the US Embassy is located.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Germany, France and Britain are ready to hold immediate talks with Iran over Tehran’s nuclear programme in a bid to de-escalate the situation in the Middle East, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said.</p>
<p>Wadephul, who is on a visit to the Middle East, said he was trying to contribute towards a de-escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran, adding that Tehran had previously failed to take the opportunity to enter into constructive talks.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>“I hope that’s still possible,” Wadephul told German public broadcaster <em>ARD</em> late on Saturday.</p>
<p>“Germany, together with France and Britain are ready. We’re offering Iran immediate negotiations about the nuclear programme, I hope ]the offer] is accepted.”</p>
<p>“This is also a key prerequisite for reaching a pacification of this conflict, that Iran presents no danger to the region, for the state of Israel or to Europe.”</p>
<p>Tehran called off <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912795">nuclear talks</a> that Washington had said were the only way to halt Israel’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours">bombing</a>, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks were nothing compared with what Iran would see in the coming days.</p>
<p>Netanyahu claimed Israel’s strikes had set back Iran’s nuclear programme “possibly by years” and rejected international calls for restraint.</p>
<p>US intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have “repeatedly said Iran was not pursuing a nuclear weapon before Israel” launched its attacks on the Islamic Republic this week, <em>AP</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-iran-war-latest-06-14-2025-19c175edc115d99f0d35c24b38ab1773#:~:text=U.S.%20intelligence%20agencies%20and%20the%20International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency%20have%20repeatedly%20said%20Iran%20was%20not%20pursuing%20a%20nuclear%20weapon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>.</p>

<p>Trump had warned Iran of worse to come, but said it was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=%E2%80%98We%20knew%20everything%E2%80%99%3A%20Trump%20still%20hopeful%20for%20deal">not too late</a> to halt the Israeli campaign if Tehran accepted a sharp downgrading of its nuclear programme.</p>
<p>A round of US-Iran nuclear talks that was due to be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">held in Oman</a> on Sunday was cancelled, with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi saying the discussions could not take place while Iran was being subjected to Israel’s “barbarous” attacks.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#gas-field-attack" id="gas-field-attack" title="Permalink"></a>Gas field attack</h2>
<p>In the first apparent attack to hit Iran’s energy infrastructure, the semi-official <em>Tasnim</em> news agency said Iran partially suspended production at the world’s biggest gas field after an Israeli strike caused a fire there on Saturday.</p>
<p>The South Pars field is located offshore in Iran’s southern Bushehr province and is responsible for the lion’s share of gas production in Iran, the world’s third largest gas producer after the United States and Russia.</p>
<p>The strike caused a fire, which has been extinguished, the Iranian oil ministry said. The fire broke out in one of the four units of Phase 14 of South Pars, halting production of 12 million cubic metres of gas, <em>Tasnim</em> said.</p>
<p>Iran produces around 275 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas per year or some 6.5pc of global gas output, and consumes it domestically as it cannot export gas due to sanctions.</p>
<p>Iran shares the field with Qatar, which calls the field North Field. Qatar produces 77 million tonnes of liquefied gas from the field with the help of global majors such as Exxon and Shell and supplies the gas to Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Fears about potential disruption to the region’s oil exports had already driven up oil prices 9 per cent on Friday, even though Israel spared Iran’s oil and gas on the first day of its attacks.</p>
<p>An Iranian general, Esmail Kosari, said on Saturday that Tehran was reviewing whether to close the Strait of Hormuz, controlling access to the Gulf for tankers.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>With Israel saying its operation could last weeks, and Netanyahu urging Iran’s people to rise up against their rulers, fears have grown of a regional conflagration dragging in outside powers.</p>
<p>B’Tselem, a leading Israeli human rights organisation, said on Saturday that instead of exhausting all possibilities for a diplomatic resolution, Israel’s government had chosen to start a war that puts the entire region in danger.</p>
<p>Tehran has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916637/iran-threatens-to-target-us-bases-if-conflict-breaks-out">warned</a> Israel’s allies that their military bases in the region would come under fire too if they helped shoot down Iranian missiles.</p>
<p>Israel sees Iran’s nuclear programme as a threat to its existence, and said the bombardment was designed to avert the last steps to production of a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>Tehran has repeatedly said the programme is entirely civilian and that it does not seek an atomic bomb. However, UN’s nuclear watchdog IAEA <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916895">reported</a> it this week as violating obligations under the global non-proliferation treaty.</p></p>

            <p><p>• Lawmakers warn misuse to hurt businesses, turn country into police state<br />
• FBR chief says tampered vehicles to be seized and destroyed<br />
• IMF to review tax authority’s performance every week<br />
• Average annual income of top 1pc households is Rs10m</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary panel on Saturday pressed senior tax officials to drop proposed provisions in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916663">Finance Bill 2025</a> granting arrest and money laundering notice powers to tax commissioners, warning the move would create unnecessary obstacles for businesses.</p>
<p>The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, chaired by Senator Saleem Mandvi­walla, convened for a second consecutive day to examine the Finance Bill 2025. Lawmakers debated the implications of enhanced powers for the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and discussed measures to curb tampered vehicles.</p>
<p>Senator Mandviwalla warned that there is a grave risk of misuse of the power to arrest or issue a notice. Even a junior FBR officer sending a notice could create chaos, he warned. He also emphasised that receiving a money laundering notice often leads to business shutdowns. “Such notices should require the express permission of the FBR chairman and the finance minister,” he said.</p>
<p>Senator Shibli Faraz also stressed that this extension of power to tax commissioners is turning Pakistan into a police state. “Even taxpayers will flee,” he warned.</p>
<p>Senator Farooq H. Naek underscored the imp­act of business bec­ause of the same, stating that money laundering notices are not trivial. “They can cripple a businessman’s ability to import or export,” Mr Naek warned the FBR.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb acknowledged the apprehensions of senators, stating that money laundering notices are indeed a very serious matter and should be reviewed carefully under this provision.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Business Council has also raised alarm, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917240">formally writing</a> to the prime minister to urge the government to reconsider the plan to empower FBR officials with arrest and notice authority.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, FBR Cha­ir­man Rashid Mahmood Langrial defended the move, stressing that tax officials already possess the authority to arrest businesspersons, but the procedure has been further refined in the latest bill.</p>
<p>However, Senator Shibli Faraz strongly opposed the proposal to grant arrest powers to income tax commissioners, arguing that such mea­sures are turning the country into a police state.</p>
<p><strong>Amendments to the Customs Act</strong></p>
<p>The committee also examined proposed ame­­ndments to the Customs Act, 1969, including the rollout of a digital Cargo Tracking System (CTS) to monitor the movement of imports, exports, transhipments and transit cargo. The CTS aims to curb smuggling and ensure duty compliance while easing legitimate trade.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Another amendment would exempt postal or courier imports valued below Rs5,000 from duties and taxes. However, the de minimis limit for courier parcels is set to drop from Rs15,000 to Rs500 to prevent misuse by individuals.</p>
<p>The committee also approved strict measures against tampered vehicles. Under the proposed law, any vehicle found with a tampered chassis number, cut-and-weld modifications or re-stamped identification will be presumed smuggled, regardless of registration status.</p>
<p>The FBR chairman clarified that such vehicles will be confiscated and destroyed. “Such vehicles will not be auctioned again. In principle, these vehicles should be scrapped to prevent the resale of parts,” he said.</p>
<p>The committee recommended that the confiscation and destruction of such vehicles must occur within 30 days of seizure.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Poultry Association requested that customs duty on grandparent chicks be reduced to zero, while the Sindh Chamber of Agriculture sought a cut in duty on imported and reconditioned tractors from 15 to 5 per cent.</p>
<p><strong>FBR chief briefing</strong></p>
<p>Briefing the committee, Mr Langrial highlighted Pakistan’s stark wealth inequality, stating that just 5pc of the population controls most of the country’s wealth.</p>
<p>“Ninety-five per cent cannot afford to pay taxes,” he added, revealing that the top one per cent earn an average of Rs10 million per year.</p>
<p>The focus must shift from expanding the tax net to taxing the rich effectively, he emphasised. He added that only 6m people are registered tax filers, while 132m are under 18 or senior citizens — outside the labour force. At the same time, 67m are unemployed, including a large segment of educated women.</p>
<p>Mr Langrial confirmed that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has asked Pakistan to introduce new tax measures worth Rs701 billion for FY26. The FBR aims to generate Rs500bn through enforcement measures, although the Fund has adjusted this target to Rs389bn.</p>
<p>He said that tax collection from the sugar, cotton, and other sectors is being underreported. In the tobacco sector, strict monitoring will start from July 1 to track green tobacco leaf production, he said, adding, “We will fix cameras at identified places.”</p>
<p>The IMF will also conduct weekly reviews of the FBR’s performance. Mr Langrial claimed that improved enforcement had already led to significant tax collection gains.</p>

            <p><p>Seven people, including a toddler, were killed on Sunday in India when a helicopter ferrying Hindu pilgrims from a shrine crashed in the Himalayas, officials said.</p>
<p>The fatal accident comes as relatives mourn at least 279 people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917107/delhi-launches-inspection-of-boeing-787s-after-air-india-crash">killed</a> when a passenger plane slammed into a residential area in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad on Thursday.</p>
<p>The helicopter crash left the pilot and all six passengers dead when their chopper came down during the flight from Kedarnath temple, in Uttarakhand state, disaster response official Nandan Singh Rajwar told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>The state’s chief minister, Pushkar Singh Dhami, said rescue teams had been dispatched to the scene after the “very sad news”.</p>
<p>The crash was likely caused by bad weather, according to district tourism official Rahul Chaubey.</p>
<p>Pilgrims flock to Kedarnath temple during the summer when it is possible to access the site, which stands at an altitude of 3,584 metres.</p>
<p>A cottage industry of helicopter charter firms has developed to serve wealthy pilgrims who want to visit shrines in the Indian Himalayas, but who prefer to avoid arduous trekking.</p>
<p>Six people were killed last month in another helicopter crash en route to the shrine.</p></p>
