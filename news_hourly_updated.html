                <h2>PM Shehbaz sets up committee, vows to resolve all issues concerning KP</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday vowed to resolve all the issues afflicting Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and set up a committee for the task, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/03-06-2025/pm-vows-to-resolve-all-issues-concerning-khyber-pakhtunkhwa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Addressing a representative jirga in Peshawar, he said the committee would deliberate on all demands and issues raised by the KP chief minister.</p>
<p>He added that the committee would sit together with tribal elders and the KP governor and chief minister to formulate recommendations in this regard, further saying that the federal government would give serious attention to the recommendations to benefit the province‚Äôs valiant people.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Shehbaz affirmed the immense sacrifices rendered by the people of KP in the fight against terrorism and said the federal government would stand by the province until the complete eradication of the menace.</p>
<p>The prime minister said that KP had received Rs700 billion since 2010 under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award as its one per cent share allocated for anti-terrorism efforts.</p>
<p>These funds were released to strengthen the provincial police force, develop the Counter-Terrorism Department and enhance the capacity of law enforcement agencies, he added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe decision to allocate 1pc of the NFC Award for KP, agreed by all provinces, was just and appropriate decision, as KP has remained the frontline province in the war against terrorism,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Highlighting the province‚Äôs unwavering commitment and support to Pakistan, the prime minister said that KP‚Äôs people had voted in favour of the country during the referendum and had stood by the armed forces through all challenges.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe sacrifices of KP‚Äôs people who laid down their lives and sustained injuries for the defence of Pakistan are deeply revered and will be remembered in golden words,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>Referring to the Army Public School attack on December 16, 2014, the prime minister paid tribute to the students and teachers who lost their lives in the brutal incident.</p>

<p>Speaking on recent security developments, PM Shehbaz said Pakistan had given a strong response to last month‚Äôs unprovoked Indian aggression under the leadership of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.</p>
<p>He reiterated that Pakistan‚Äôs decisive retaliation had frustrated India‚Äôs nefarious plans, adding that ‚ÄúIndia will never forget this decisive response of Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>The prime minister further shared that during recent visits to Turkiye, Iran, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan, leaders of these countries expressed joy over Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúhistoric victory‚Äù against India.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>He said that Indian Prime Minister Modi was left ‚Äúfrustrated and in a state of panic‚Äù after the defeat.</p>
<p>Reaffirming Pakistan‚Äôs rights under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, the prime minister asserted that India could not deprive Pakistan of its rightful share of water and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-after-26-tourists-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-attack">suspend</a> the treaty unilaterally.</p>
<p>He emphasised the need to expand existing water storage capacity and accelerate work on major dam projects, including Diamer Bhasha and Dasu dams.</p>
<p>Calling for national unity in the face of external threats, PM Shehbaz appreciated the people of KP for offering special prayers for the country‚Äôs success against India.</p>
<p>The jirga was attended by KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, COAS Munir, federal and provincial ministers, senators, parliamentarians, the Peshawar corps commander and the provincial chief secretary and police chief.</p></p>

                <h2>Hafizabad police launch raids to arrest culprits after wife gang-raped in front of husband</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Police on Tuesday launched raids to arrest eight suspects who allegedly abducted a couple in Hafizabad and subjected them to physical and sexual assault.</p>
<p>According to a first information report (FIR) filed by the victim, he and his wife were attacked by multiple armed men who took them to a secluded place near a graveyard.</p>
<p>The complainant said in the FIR that he and his wife were subjected to physical violence, sexual assault, and robbery, adding that his wife was ‚Äúgang-raped despite me repeatedly pleading with the suspects to stop.‚Äù</p>
<p>The culprits filmed the assault and blackmailed the victims, it added.</p>
<p>The FIR also said, ‚ÄúWe delayed reporting the incident because the suspects had threatened us, saying that if they we took legal action or got a medical examination done, they would kill us.‚Äù</p>
<p>The victim added that the suspects had uploaded the footage of the assault on the internet, requesting justice be served at the earliest, according to the FIR, which named four of the total eight suspects.</p>
<p>Hafizabad Police Officer (DPO) Atif Nazeer told <em>Dawn.com</em> that a case was filed against the suspects, who will be arrested within 24 to 48 hours.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe suspects were being identified using video footage and police raids are currently underway,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe couple has undergone a medical examination, and investigations into other legal aspects are in process.‚Äù</p>
<p>Despite the presence of anti-rape laws ‚Äî with punishment for rape either resulting in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1761373">death penalty</a> or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years ‚Äî cases continue to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899694/two-arrested-for-kidnap-gang-rape-of-minor-girl-in-bahawalnagar">prevail</a> in the country.</p>
<p>In March, Punjab police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900045">arrested</a> three suspects for allegedly gang-raping a woman in Lahore, according to a statement by the police.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Earlier this year, the provincial government planned to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893706">increase</a> the number of Special Sexual Offences Investigation Units (SSOIUs) across the province to investigate scheduled offences under the Anti-Rape (Investigation &amp; Trial) Act of 2021 and offer better services to women.</p>
<p>Around 150 more units would be added Punjab-wide to probe the scheduled offences in this regard.</p>
<p>Since a large number of cases were being reported and registered, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz instructed Home Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal to enhance the number of units and appoint designated trained officers to help out women complainants.</p></p>
