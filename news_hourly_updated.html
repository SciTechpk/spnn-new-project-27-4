                <h2>Pakistan unveils first govt-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib has unveiled the country‚Äôs first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.</p>
<p>Saqib was recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913419">appointed</a> as Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Crypto and Blockchain, with the status of a minister of state. He has been on a tour of the United States seeking investment in Pakistan‚Äôs crypto markets.</p>
<p>He made the announcement about the reserve after delivering a keynote address before an elite audience, which included United States Vice President JD Vance, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr, at the <a class="link--external" href="https://b.tc/conference/2025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bitcoin Vegas 2025</a> in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan is no longer defined by its past. It is being reborn as a forward-looking hub of digital innovation ‚Äî powered by its youth, sharpened by necessity, and led by a new generation of tech statesmen,‚Äù said Saqib, in a statement issued by his office.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not just here as a minister,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here as the voice of a generation ‚Äî a generation that is online, on-chain, and unstoppable.‚Äù</p>

<p>In his keynote speech, Saqib announced the establishment of a national bitcoin wallet, ‚Äúholding digital assets already in state custody ‚Äî not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signalling long-term belief in decentralised finance.‚Äù</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>He also thanked Trump for his role as a peacemaker in the recent India-Pakistan conflict and for his commitment to crypto adoption.</p>
<p>He revealed that the government had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913238">allocated</a> 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity in first phase for bitcoin mining and AI data centres, opening doors to sovereign miners, tech firms, and clean energy partners around the world.</p>
<p>The statement noted Pakistan having over 40 million crypto wallets and one of the ‚Äúlargest and most active freelancer economies in the world‚Äù.</p>
<p>It added that Saqib was leading the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912539">creation</a> of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) ‚Äî a regulatory body designed to empower builders, protect investors, and formalise digital finance frameworks for the future.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBoth Pakistan and bitcoin have suffered from bad PR,‚Äù Saqib declared. ‚ÄúBut if you look past the headlines, you‚Äôll see something else: talent, resilience, and vision.‚Äù</p>
<p>He called on global crypto builders to come and invest in Pakistan. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre building something real ‚Äî come build it in Pakistan. Come build wallets for the unbanked. Come tokenise land. Come scale your mission with our youth and our unstoppable grit.‚Äù</p>
<p>During his keynote, Saqib delivered a ‚Äúblueprint for the future of emerging markets in Web3 that positions Pakistan as a tech-forward, youth-powered, and opportunity-rich nation ready to lead,‚Äù the statement concluded.</p>
<p>On February 25, the government had announced it was considering establishing a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897897">National Crypto Council</a> to adopt emerging digital currencies in line with global trends. In March, it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896070">appointed</a> Saqib as the chief adviser to the finance minister on the PCC and later made him the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897964#:~:text=Bilal%20Bin%20Saqib%2C%20who%20was%20recently%20appointed%20as%20chief%20adviser%20to%20the%20finance%20minister%2C%20has%20been%20made%20the%20council%E2%80%99s%20CEO.">council‚Äôs CEO</a>.</p>
<p>According to a press release, Saqib will now be responsible for developing a comprehensive, FATF-compliant regulatory framework for digital assets, launching bitcoin mining initiatives, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, finance, and land records.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Additionally, he will also facilitate ‚Äúlicensing and oversight of virtual asset service providers (VASPs)‚Äù and champion ‚Äúinvestor protection and Web3 ecosystem growth‚Äù in the country.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the government has announced the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913342">allocation</a> of 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the first phase of a national initiative to power bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.</p>
<p>According to the Finance Division, the ambitious initiative was part of a broader strategy to ‚Äúmonetise surplus electricity, create high-tech jobs, attract billions of dollars in foreign direct investment, and generate billions of dollars for the government‚Äù.</p></p>
