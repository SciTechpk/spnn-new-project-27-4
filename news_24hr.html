            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: All mainstream political parties, except PTI, on Sunday vowed that Pakistan would give a robust response to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907663">India</a> if it resorted to any ‘misadventure’ against the backdrop of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam incident</a>, in which 26 civilians were gunned down.</p>
<p>The political leaders made this pledge during an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908387/dg-ispr-says-armed-forces-ready-to-give-befitting-reply-to-enemys-aggression-state-media">in-camera briefing</a> by the civil and military leadership on Sunday, in which the army spokesperson apprised the mainstream political parties about the latest situation in the region and the preparedness of the country’s armed forces to avert any misadventure by the neighbouring country.</p>
<p>The in-camera briefing was given by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar. However, the main opposition party, PTI, did not attend the huddle.</p>
<p>A source privy to the huddle proceedings told <em>Dawn</em> that the political parties were of the view that they stood by the armed forces to foil any attempt by India to spoil regional peace. Before the briefing, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the main objective of the huddle was to get feedback from the political forces in light of tensions with India.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Participants told India wanted to divert water, intensify Kashmir oppression using Pahalgam</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another source told <em>Dawn</em> that the participants were briefed about how India “prepared and implemented its false flag operation” in Pahalgam. The meeting was informed that India could not sell its narrative to the world and that Pakistan’s stance had emerged stronger in the aftermath of the attack. The participants were also apprised of the preparedness of the armed forces to foil any kind of misadventure by India.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Senator Muhammad Abdul Qadir, who attended the briefing, said that the meeting was informed about how and why India conducted the attack in Pahalgam. Senator Qadir said, as per information shared with the political leaders, the primary objective of the operation was to further divert Indus water, intensify aggression in held Kashmir, and camouflage Indian terrorism with the help of the Afghan Taliban.</p>
<p>With the help of video clips, the participants were given a briefing about Indian involvement in terrorism in Pakistan, especially Balochistan, he added.</p>
<p>PPP leaders Raja Pervez Ashraf, Qamar Zaman Kaira, and Shazia Marri; PML-N’s Barrister Aqeel and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Tallal Chaudhry; PM’s aide Pervez Khattak; MQM-P’s Farooq Sattar; and Kashmiri leader Shah Ghulam Qadir, among others, were in attendance.</p>
<p>Tension between the two nuclear states escalated soon after the Pahalgam attack in which 26 tourists were killed on April 22.</p>
<p>Soon after the attack, India blamed Pakistan for being involved in the attack. On the other hand, Pakistan termed the attack a false flag operation by India and called for a neutral probe.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908457/india-bans-x-accounts-of-imran-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>India bans X accounts of Imran, Bilawal</strong></a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: India has blocked access to X accounts of former prime minister Imran Khan and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari amid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908387/dg-ispr-says-armed-forces-ready-to-give-befitting-reply-to-enemys-aggression-state-media">rising tensions</a> between the two countries, Indian media reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>Users accessing both accounts in India see a mes­sage stating the acco­unts were withheld “in response to a legal demand”.</p>
<p>PPP condemned India’s move to block the account of the party chairman. In a statement on Sunday, a PPP spokesperson said India’s action was a retaliation for Mr Bhutto-Zar­dari’s “unequivocal and bold stance on the Pahalgam incident” which he had presented before the international community.</p>
<p>The press release issued by the Bilawal House media cell said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was afraid of Mr Bhutto-Zardari. “It also proves that India is an undemocratic country and its prime minister is an extremely cowardly person,” the statement added.</p>
<p>Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s narrative on the Pahalgam attack “unsettled the Indian prime minister”, the PPP spokesperson said, adding that it was Mr Bhutto-Zardari who first exposed the “Butcher of Gujarat” before the world, and he would continue to hold up a mirror to Mr Modi’s war-mongering mindset.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> on April 22, the Indian government has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907281">blocked</a> a number of social media accounts belonging to the Pakistan government, news channels, content creators, film stars, sportspersons  and journalists. The accounts were blocked on YouTube, X and Instagram.</p>
<p>X, formerly Twitter, has been banned in Pakistan since February 2024.</p>

            <p><p>LAHORE: As the country has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908460/pakistan-to-knock-on-unsc-door-amid-escalation">decided</a> to approach and brief the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on the latest situation in the region amid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908387/dg-ispr-says-armed-forces-ready-to-give-befitting-reply-to-enemys-aggression-state-media">sky-high tensions</a> with India, the Pakistan Commission on Indus Waters (PCIW) has shared a detailed report with the federal government about massive violation of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">Indus Water Treaty</a> (IWT) by New Delhi.</p>
<p>Though the Commi­ssioner for Indus Waters was not available to comment, a source privy to the development said that the report sent by the commission to government mentions a massive breach of the treaty in the form of construction of three hydroelectric plants / projects at the western rivers, including Jhelum and Chenab. The construction of the 450MW had reportedly been started at Chenab basin in 2005, followed by 330MW Kishan Ganga Hydropower Project in 2010 at Jhelum river basin. The construction of 850MW Ratle Hydropower project is yet to be initiated.</p>
<p>“The report also contains the information about other violations of the treaty by India such as delaying or avoiding giving information regarding release of floodwater during monsoon in rivers, including Ravi and Satluj. Besides these, there are a series of violations India committed already,” said the source while talking to this scribe.</p>
<p>He further said a very recent major violation committed by India was holding the treaty in abeyance that is not at all allowed.</p>
<p>He further said the report also mentioned that New Delhi suspended the treaty unilaterally on the pretext of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> last month.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>According to another source, India always faced defeat whenever Pakistan challenged and raised objections on the design of the aforementioned projects and took up these issues on relevant forums, including neutral expert or international court of arbitration.</p>
<p>“The proceedings on a couple of projects including Ratle are still underway at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, a non-UN intergovernmental organisation located in The Hague,” he said.</p>
<p>Talking to <em>Dawn</em>, Syed Jamat Ali Shah, a former commissioner on Indus Waters said in fact the draft of treaty finalised in 1960 gave no privilege to India to use waters of western rivers—Indus, Jhelum and Chenab on which Pakistan had the full right to use.</p>
<p>“India had full right to use  the water of eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas and Satluj) whether through construction of dams (for water storage and power generation) or other purposes.”</p>
<p>He added that a few months before signing of the treaty, India had started building pressure on the authorities concerned to also allow it to construct run-of-the river hydropower projects and small storages for irrigation purposes in the catchment areas of the western rivers.</p>
<p>He said since a lot of work has already been done on the treaty and there was no time to further delay, it was decided to allow India do so, but with some restrictions / conditions such as consulting Pakistan while finalising design of the projects etc.</p>
<p>He urged the government to brief the UNSC in detail about a series of violations of the treaty India committed.</p>
<p>“The Pakistani team may also take up this issue with the World Bank immediately in a bid to get the India’s unilateral decision of holding treaty in abeyance scrapped,” he urged.</p>
