            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918691/fo-assails-indian-home-ministers-brazen-disregard-for-intl-agreements-with-remarks-on-never-restoring-iwt' target='_blank'><strong>FO assails Indian home minister’s ‘brazen disregard’ for int’l agreements with remarks on never restoring IWT</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Saturday slammed Indian Home Minister Amit Shah’s “brazen disregard” for international agreements after the latter said New Delhi would never restore the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Islamabad.</p>
<p>Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">unilaterally suspended</a> its participation in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">1960 IWT</a>, which governs the usage of the Indus river system, on April 23, shortly after 26 civilians were killed in India-held Kashmir. Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack. The latter has denied the allegations and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe.</a> The accord remains dormant despite a ceasefire agreed upon by the two nuclear-armed neighbours last month following their worst fighting in decades.</p>
<p>“No, it will never be restored,” Shah told <em>The Times of India</em> earlier today. “We will take water that was flowing to Pakistan to Rajasthan by constructing a canal. Pakistan will be starved of water that it has been getting unjustifiably.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The latest comments from Shah, the most powerful cabinet minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet, reveal Delhi’s intentions as Islamabad hopes for negotiations on the treaty in the near term.</p>
<p>Responding to Shah’s comments, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said they reflected “a brazen disregard for the sanctity of international agreements” and noted that the IWT is an apolitical agreement without provisions for unilateral action.</p>
<p>“India’s illegal announcement to hold the treaty in abeyance constitutes a clear violation of international law, the provisions of the treaty itself, and the fundamental principles governing inter-state relations,” the FO stated.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Such conduct sets a reckless and dangerous precedent — one that undermines the credibility of international agreements and raises serious questions about the reliability and trustworthiness of a state that openly refuses to fulfil its legal obligations.”</p>
<p>The FO added that “weaponising water for political ends” is irresponsible and contrary to the behaviour of a responsible state. It demanded that India immediately restore the full implementation of the IWT.</p>
<p>“For its part, Pakistan remains firmly committed to the treaty and will take all necessary measures to protect its legitimate rights and entitlements under it,” the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Addressing a crowd of supporters on Friday night, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had said that New Delhi must accept the IWT, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918592/kashmir-now-a-global-issue-says-bilawal">warning</a> that if it refused to honour the treaty, “we will fight another war and take all six rivers. We know how to defend our rivers.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned India’s unilateral suspension of the IWT, describing it as a “blatant violation and act of water aggression”, and warned that Pakistan would give a befitting response in line with decisions made at the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting held on April 24.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Last month, <em>Reuters</em> reported that India plans to dramatically increase the water it draws from a major river that feeds Pakistani farms downstream, as part of retaliatory action.</p>
<p>The FO did not immediately respond to <em>Reuters</em>’ request for comments, but it has said in the past that the treaty has no provision for one side to unilaterally pull back, and that any blocking of river water flowing to Pakistan will be considered “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">an act of war</a>”.</p>
<p>Islamabad is also exploring a legal challenge to India’s decision to hold the treaty in abeyance under international law.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar slammed Shah’s “provocative and inflammatory” comments on the IWT, warning that stopping Pakistan’s water will be considered an act of war.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is taking all necessary steps to ensure regional stability,” Dar told the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting hosted by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.</p>
<p>“The provocative and inflammatory statements being made by the Indian leadership, as well as India’s unilateral and illegal actions, especially its decision to hold the IWT in abeyance, represent an intent to further destabilise the region,” he said.</p>
<p>“Let me state categorically that Pakistan will not allow India to stop water for our people. It will be treated as an act of war.”</p>

<p>Indian-held Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Friday opposed diverting the state’s waters to Punjab and other neighbouring states now that the IWT with Pakistan stands suspended, asking why they should get more water when they already have three rivers while parts of the Union Territory are facing an acute water shortage, India’s  <em>Telegraph</em> reported.</p>
<p>“Nobody will take it. At least I will not allow it as of now. First allow us to use our water, then we will talk about others. There is a drought-like situation in Jammu. There is no water in taps,” Abdullah told reporters.</p>
<p>Abdullah was reacting to the purported central government move to conduct a feasibility study for constructing a 113km-long canal to direct the surplus flow from the three western rivers of the Indus water system, the report said.</p>
<p>“Why should I take water to Punjab? There are already three rivers with Punjab (and the other two states) under the Indus Waters Treaty. Did they give us water when we needed it?” he was quoted as having said.</p>
<p>Omar referred to Punjab’s purported refusal to share water during disputes over the Ujh multipurpose project and the Shahpur Kandi barrage in Jammu in the past. “We were in dire straits then but they kept us waiting for years…. After years, some work was done on the Shahpur Kandi barrage,” he said.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) on Saturday advised all oil marketing companies (OMCs) to ensure the maintenance of their mandatory 20-day stock levels amid the impact of the Iran-Israel conflict on global oil supply.</p>
<p>In a statement issued today, the authority’s spokesperson said: “Ogra has confirmed that the country currently holds sufficient stocks of petroleum products to meet existing demand.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“However, in view of anticipated future requirements and the prevailing market situation, Ogra has formally advised all oil marketing companies (OMCs) to ensure the maintenance of their mandatory 20-day stock levels, in line with the conditions stipulated in their respective licences.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson said Ogra remained committed to monitoring the situation closely and would continue to take proactive steps to ensure national energy security.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917618/country-has-ample-petroleum-stocks">high-level meeting</a> on Monday reviewed petroleum products prices and supply dynamics in response to the evolving geopolitical situation following Israel’s recent attack on Iran and the resulting volatility in the international oil markets.</p>
<p>The committee was constituted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif with a task to monitor petroleum product pricing and supply dynamics. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chaired the first meeting of the committee in the Finance Division.</p>
<p>An official announcement said that the committee meeting was attended by senior representatives from key federal ministries, regulatory authorities, and energy sector experts. The formation of this committee reflects the government’s proactive approach to safeguarding national energy interests and ensuring market stability during a time of heightened international uncertainty.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the members assessed the global and domestic petroleum market situation. The committee expressed satisfaction that Pakistan currently held adequate stocks of petroleum products and there is no immediate risk of supply disruption.</p>
<p>However, members emphasised the need for continued vigilance given the rapidly changing regional context.</p>
<p>To ensure timely response and effective coordination, a working group will monitor developments on a daily basis, and the full committee will meet weekly to review the situation and submit recommendations to the prime minister.</p>
<p>The committee has been entrusted with the tasks to closely monitor the forward/futures prices of petroleum products and the predictability of supply chain in view of the current conflict in the region. IT will also determine Forex implications of price volatility for the short and medium term.</p>
<p>According to the terms of reference of the committee, it will suggest a plan (if required) to ensure that there are no supply disruptions and the market is well supplied and carry out detailed analysis of the fiscal impact, in the event of a protracted conflict.</p>
<p>The Petroleum Division has been designated to provide secretarial support and ensure effective implementation of the committee’s mandate.</p>
<p>The government remains fully committed to maintaining energy security, stabilising markets, and protecting the national interest during this critical time, added the announcement.</p></p>

            <p><p>The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has issued a 15-day freezing order on properties across the country, including those owned by property tycoon Malik Riaz’s son and his company, Bahria Town Pvt Ltd, in a reference against the influential magnate and others, it emerged on Saturday</p>
<p>The development adds on to NAB’s previous actions against Riaz, who is also an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1803717">absconder</a> in the £190 million <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751790/imran-arrest-what-is-the-al-qadir-trust-case">Al Qadir Trust Case</a>.</p>
<p>According to the order — dated June 19 and seen by <em>Dawn.com</em> — 457 immoveable properties belonging to various individuals and entities have been frozen under Section 12 (power to freeze property), read with Section 34A (delegation of powers) of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999.</p>
<p>Referring to an investigation against “accused persons”, the order read: “It transpired that accused persons in active connivance with each other have usurped the government land admeasuring 16,896 acres situated in District Malir, Karachi,” stating that they violated Section 9A (the offence of corruption and corrupt practice) of the NAO.</p>
<p>According to the order, five properties owned by Bahria Town in DHA Rawalpindi; two properties owned by Ahmed Ali Riaz in Islamabad; and 18 properties owned by Bahria Town in Islamabad have been frozen, making a total of 25.</p>
<p>Two properties owned by Riaz’s son-in-law, Zain Malik, were also listed.</p>
<p>The order will remain in place for 15 days, though it will “continue to subsist until the accountability court adjudicates upon the same as held by the honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in its judgment reported as 2019 SCMR 1106”, the document read.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, an accountability court on issued <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914560">non-bailable warrants</a> for the arrest of controversial property tycoon Malik Riaz, his son and others in the Bahria Town Karachi (BTK) land grab case.</p>
<p>NAB had filed a reference a few months ago against the owners of Bahria Town, senior PPP leaders and government officials for allegedly converting, exchanging, and transferring government land to Bahria Town for its BTK project.</p></p>

Many Zambians have raised the issue of this looting for years, but have met coordinated resistance. Consequently, Zambia’s treasury loses billions of dollars in revenue. These losses are driven by well-known multinationals working in concert with certain insiders close&nbsp;to the Zambian state.</p><p>Your editorial also says: “The US decision to cut $50m a year in aid to Zambia … is dreadful, and the reason given, corruption, rings hollow.” Alas, I disagree and wish to place this in context.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/ordinary-zambians-lose-out-twice-to-global-looting-and-local-corruption">Continue reading...</a></p>
