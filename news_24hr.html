            <p><p>Pakistan on Saturday banned the use of its ports by Indian flag carriers in a tit-for-tat response as diplomatic tensions between the two nations flared in the wake of a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">killed 26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe.</a></p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing</a> its forces and India’s premier granting “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>” to the military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of April 30, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an Indian incursion within 24–36 hours, diplomatic channels have been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension">engaged</a> to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>Earlier today, India said Pakistani-flagged ships would not be allowed to visit any of its ports, and Indian flagged-ships would not visit any ports in Pakistan.</p>
<p>“This order is issued to ensure safety of Indian assets, cargo and connected infrastructure, in public interest and for interest of Indian shipping,” the Directorate General of Shipping said in a statement.</p>
<p>Similarly, an order issued later today from the Ministry of Maritime Affairs’ Ports and Shipping Wing said: “In view of the recent development of maritime situation with neighbouring country, Pakistan in order to safeguard maritime sovereignty, economic interest and national security enforces following measures with immediate effect: Indian flag carriers shall not be allowed to visit any Pakistani port, Pakistani flag carriers shall not visit any Indian port [and] any exemption or dispensation shall be examined and decided on case to case basis.”</p>
<p>Following last week’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284/trade-ties-and-flights-off-limits-as-pakistan-retaliates-to-indias-moves">tit-for-tat measures</a>, New Delhi has taken more steps against Pakistan, including <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907663/diplomatic-channels-work-overtime-amid-threat-of-indian-adventurism#:~:text=PAF%E2%80%99s%20prompt%20response.-,Airspace%20concerns,-With%20tensions%20running">closing its airspace</a> for Pakistani planes until May 23 and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908068/india-continues-blocking-social-media-channels-tries-to-undercut-imf-deal">blocking</a> social media accounts of media and leaders.</p>
<p>Trade between the two nations has dwindled over the last few years.</p>
<p>In August 2019, Pakistan had already <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1499076">formally downgraded</a> its trade relations with India to the level of Israel, with which Islamabad has no trade ties at all, in reaction to New Delhi’s decision to revoke Article 370 of its constitution that granted occupied Kashmir a special status.</p>

<p>India also said it banned the import of goods originating from or transiting via Pakistan and suspended the exchange of inbound mail and parcels.</p>
<p>India’s Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.dgft.gov.in/CP/?opt=notification" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a>, said the ban on all imports will take effect immediately.</p>
<p>“This restriction is imposed in the interest of national security and public policy,” it said.</p>

<p>In response to India’s slew of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">aggressive moves</a> against the country in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan announced <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284">retaliatory measures</a> that have included halting all border trade, closing its airspace to Indian carriers and expelling Indian diplomats.</p>
<p>However, Pakistan earlier this week <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907774/govt-allows-150-stranded-afghan-trucks-to-cross-wagah-border-for-goods-delivery">allowed</a> 150 stranded Afghan trucks carrying goods for India to cross the Wagah Border, easing a weeks-long bottleneck, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.</p>
<p>In another step to cut off ties, the Indian government also announced today it was suspending the exchange of all “inbound mail and parcels” from Pakistan.</p>
<p>“Government of India has decided to suspend exchange of all categories of inbound mail and parcels from Pakistan through air and surface routes,” a public notice issued by its communications ministry said, according to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-suspends-exchange-of-all-inbound-mails-parcels-from-pakistan-101746263268350.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hindustan Times</a></em>.</p>
<p>The notification was also shared on the official X account of India’s Communications Minister Jyotiraditya M. Scindia.</p>

<p>Mail exchanges between the two arch-rivals also saw a breakdown in 2019 following India’s revocation of occupied Kashmir’s special status, according to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/pakistan-resumes-postal-mail-services-with-india20191119123042/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ANI News</a></em>.</p>
<p>Pakistan suspended postal mail services in August 2019 and resumed them in November that year, <em>ANI</em> said, citing Pakistani media reports.</p>
<p>Parcel services, however, remained suspended as of Nov 19, 2019, the report added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, India continued its blocking spree as Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said today his social media account had also been blocked in the neighbouring country, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported.</p>

<p>India has blocked dozens of accounts so far in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, including of high-profile Pakistani <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908068/india-continues-blocking-social-media-channels-tries-to-undercut-imf-deal#:~:text=high%2Dprofile%20Pakistani%20cricketers">cricketers</a>, <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193585/high-school-blocking-another-slew-of-pakistani-celebrities-social-media-accounts-blocked-in-india">actors</a>, entertainment <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193572/drama-fans-left-reeling-after-india-blocks-pakistani-entertainment-channel-social-media-pages">channels</a>, news publications and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907114/16-pakistani-youtube-channels-banned-in-india-after-pahalgam-attack">journalists</a>.</p>
<p>Attempts to access these profiles in India, it said, now return a message stating: “Account not available in India. This is because we complied with a legal request to restrict this content.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#loc-visit-for-media" id="loc-visit-for-media" title="Permalink"></a>LoC visit for media</h2>
<p>Separately, the information ministry said it was facilitating a visit for media representatives, both local and international, to the Line of Control (LoC) for Saturday and Sunday “to expose India’s baseless and fabricated propaganda regarding so-called and imaginary ‘terrorist camps’ in Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“India has repeatedly made unfounded and baseless claims about alleged terrorist hideouts along the LoC,” the ministry said in a press release.</p>
<p>“During the visit, media representatives would be taken to the exact locations falsely propagated by India as terrorist camps and would be presented with factual, on-ground realities that refute these malicious allegations,” it said.</p>
<p>The ministry said that Pakistan reaffirmed its steadfast commitment to peace and “categorically rejected any form of terrorism or terrorist activities anywhere in the world”.</p>
<p>“The nation remains resolute in defending its sovereignty, and any aggression by India will be met with a swift and befitting response,” it concluded.</p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said that Pakistan’s reaction had been responsible and measured so far despite India’s provocative actions following severe tensions between the two countries in wake of the Pahalgam incident.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> and India’s premier granting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">“operational freedom”</a> to the military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an Indian incursion within 24–36 hours, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension">diplomatic channels</a> have been engaged to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said PM Shehbaz held a meeting with Ambassador of the Republic of Turkiye Dr Irfan Neziroglu at the PM House.</p>
<p>The premier reiterated that Pakistan had always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.</p>
<p>The prime minister emphasised that India had failed to share any evidence and was falsely trying to link Pakistan to the Pahalgam incident, the statement said.</p>
<p>“India has yet to respond to Pakistan’s offer to have a credible, transparent and neutral international investigation to ascertain the facts behind the Pahalgam incident,” he said, adding that Pakistan would cooperate fully with such an investigation and would welcome if Turkiye joined it.</p>

<p>The prime minister also highlighted that Pakistan had rendered great sacrifices in its counter-terrorism efforts, including 90,000 casualties and over $152 billion in economic losses over the years.</p>
<p>He further said that India’s actions would distract Pakistan from its counter-terrorism efforts.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz expressed his gratitude to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for his strong statement that supported Pakistan during the prevailing situation in South Asia as well as his call for peace in the region.</p>
<p>The prime minister noted that Turkiye’s support to Pakistan was reflective of the “historic, deep-rooted and time-tested brotherly relations” between the two countries and their peoples.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed the government’s focus on economic recovery and growth for which it required peace and security in its neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The Turkish ambassador informed the prime minister that Turkiye appreciated Pakistan’s position and expressed its solidarity with Pakistan while calling for de-escalation and urging restraint in the current crisis to maintain peace and security in South Asia.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#fm-dars-diplomatic-engagements" id="fm-dars-diplomatic-engagements" title="Permalink"></a>FM Dar’s diplomatic engagements</h2>
<p>Separately, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and stability while resolutely protecting its sovereignty and national interests in a telephone conversation with Greek counterpart George Gerapetritis.</p>
<p>FM Dar briefed him on current regional developments, categorically rejecting India’s “baseless allegations, disinformation campaign and illegal unilateral measures” that threatened regional peace and security.</p>
<p>“He strongly condemned India’s unilateral decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance — a blatant violation of its international obligations,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a press release.</p>

<p>Dar reiterated Pakistan’s call for an independent and transparent investigation to establish the facts.</p>
<p>FM Gerapetritis emphasised the importance of restraint to prevent escalation and preserve peace and stability. He welcomed Pakistan’s proposal for a neutral and transparent inquiry.</p>
<p>Both leaders agreed to maintain close coordination on regional and global developments, particularly in multilateral forums, including their engagement as non-permanent members of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>FM Dar also held a telephone conversation with Swiss Federal Councillor and Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis.</p>
<p>He briefed FM Cassis on the evolving regional security situation, “expressing grave concern over India’s recent provocative actions, including baseless allegations, inflammatory propaganda, and its unilateral decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance — an outright violation of international legal obligations”, the FO said in a press release.</p>
<p>Dar reiterated Pakistan’s call for an independent and transparent international investigation to establish the facts and underscored Pakistan’s commitment to exercising restraint in the interest of regional peace and security, while reserving the right to protect its sovereignty and national interests.</p>
<p>FM Cassis appreciated Pakistan’s commitment to peace and endorsed its proposal for an investigation.</p>
<p>He expressed Switzerland’s readiness to offer its good offices and explore appropriate mechanisms to facilitate an impartial investigation.</p>
<p>The two leaders agreed to remain in close contact on the evolving situation.</p>

<p>According to the report, the high-level background briefing will focus on national security in the context of Pakistan-India relations and the implications of recent developments.</p>
<p>“Participants will be briefed on the defensive preparedness of Pakistan’s armed forces, ongoing diplomatic efforts, and the official stance of the state on key issues,” the report read.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Azad Jammu Kashmir Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq said on Friday that India was hatching conspiracies to create unrest in the territory.</p>
<p>In his address to the All Parties Kashmir Conference hosted in the state metropolis, he warned,  “If India attacks Pakistan, we will respond with full force. India is actively plotting to destabilise AJK.”</p>
<p>He emphasised that Pakistan’s political leadership must demonstrate complete solidarity and stand firmly behind the armed forces against the Indian aggression.</p>
<p>Reaffirming his stance on the Kashmir issue, Haq said his narrative drew strength from the people of Pakistan, the armed forces and the country’s military leadership.</p>
<p>He said that a single action by the Indian government had brought the situation back to what it was before August 5, 2019.</p>
<p>“The Liberation Cell is ready to support if the political leadership from the All Parties Kashmir Conference forum wants to participate in the protest demonstration,” the AJK premier said.</p>
<p>“As far as the Kashmir policy is concerned, we are open for debate and ready to remove any shortcomings,” he remarked.</p>
<p>“We have to think about how to take forward the issue of Kashmir, for which we have lost three generations,” he said.</p>
<p>Highlighting the significance of national unity, Haq said, “The enemy attacks you only when he thinks that the nation is divided.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Influential billionaire investor Warren Buffett said on Saturday he will step down as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year, and hand over the reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel.</p>
<p>“I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive of the company at year end,” Buffett, 94, said at Berkshire’s annual meeting.</p>
<p>He said Abel hadn’t been aware of his plans prior to the announcement.</p>
<p>Buffett also said he had “zero” intention of selling any of his Berkshire stock.</p>
<p>The news was also unexpected, though Buffett said he had told his children about his decision.</p>
<p>During his 60-year run, Buffett managed to transform Berkshire Hathaway from a medium-sized textile company when he bought it in the 1960s into a giant conglomerate, now valued at more than $1 trillion and with liquid assets of $300 billion.</p>
<p>His success, coupled with his ability to explain his thinking in clear soundbites, has made him highly influential in the business and financial communities, earning him the nickname “The Oracle of Omaha”.</p>

<p>Separately, the influential billionaire investor said that “trade should not be a weapon”, in remarks clearly targeting US President Donald Trump’s aggressive <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895724">use of tariffs</a> against countries around the world.</p>
<p>“There is no question that trade can be an act of war,” the renowned businessman told the annual shareholder meeting.</p>
<p>While he did not mention Trump by name, his meaning was unmistakable, and his comments came as analysts in the United States and abroad have expressed growing concern that tariffs could seriously slow global growth.</p>

<p>Two months ago, Buffett told a <em>CBS</em> interviewer that tariffs “are a tax on goods” — and not a relatively painless revenue-raiser, as Trump has suggested — adding, “I mean, the Tooth Fairy doesn’t pay ’em!”</p>
<p>Buffett urged Washington to continue trading with the rest of the world, saying, “We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best. That’s what we did originally.”</p>
<p>Achieving prosperity is not a zero-sum game, with one country’s successes meaning another’s losses, he said, adding that both can prosper.</p>
<p>“I do think that the more prosperous the rest of the world becomes, it won’t be at our expense; the more prosperous we’ll become, and the safer we’ll feel,” Buffett said.</p>
<p>He added that it can be dangerous for one country to offend the rest of the world while claiming superiority.</p>
<p>“It’s a big mistake, in my view, when you have seven and a half billion people that don’t like you very well, and you got 300 million that are crowing in some way about how well they’ve done,” Buffett said.</p>
<p>Compared to that dynamic, the financial markets’ recent gyrations are “really nothing”.</p>
<p>Berkshire Hathaway on Saturday reported first-quarter profits of $9.6bn, down 14 per cent.</p>
<p>That works out to $4.47 per share, also down sharply.</p></p>
