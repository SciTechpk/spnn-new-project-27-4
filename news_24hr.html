            <p><p>• One casualty each reported from Attock, Rawalpindi, Ghotki districts; four troops wounded in Lahore<br />
• Military spokesperson says Israeli-made Harop drones used; calls intrusion ‘a serious, serious provocation’<br />
• India acknowledges carrying out strikes; ISPR chief says New Delhi should ‘transition from cinema into real world’</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: At least three people lost their lives and seven, including four soldiers, sustained injuries as Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390/25-israeli-made-drones-used-by-india-in-attempt-to-attack-pakistan-all-shot-down-ispr">intercepted</a> and destroyed as many as 25 Indian drones that had intruded into its airspace across the country, possibly to target military installations.</p>
<p>According to the military, the locations where these drones were neutralised included Lahore, Attock, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi, and Bahawalpur in Punjab, as well as Sukkur, Umerkot and Karachi in Sindh.</p>
<p>Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the military’s chief spokesperson, confirmed that one civilian lost their life while another sustained injuries in Miano.</p>
<p>Moreover, as per police, one person each was slain in Attock and Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>“One drone, however, managed to engage a military target near Lahore partially,” said the army spokesperson. “Four men of the Pakistan Army have been injured in this attack near Lahore and partial damage to an equipment has occurred,” he said.</p>
<p>The rest of the drones apparently missed their potential targets and caused damages in densely populated areas.</p>

<p>Three drones were shot down in Walton and Burki, near Lahore. Officials said two drones crashed in Walton, while another crashed in Burki soon after security forces intercepted them. According to a witness, they heard multiple explosions in the old Walton airport area, leading to widespread confusion among locals.</p>
<p>In Rawalpindi, one person — a resident of Lahore — lost his life and two were inj­ured after a drone crashed near the Pindi Cricket Stadium on the Murree Road.</p>
<p>A police officer said that the stadium’s food street was not fully open and there were not many people around ; otherwise, there could have been more casualties.</p>
<p>Another drone damaged a house after it crashed on its rooftop in the Westridge locality of the garrison city. However, no casualties were reported.</p>
<p>In Attock, a farmer was killed near Jabbi Kasran — a town in Fateh Jang tehsil — after an Indian drone was downed. The injured person was taken to hospital, but could not survive.</p>
<p>In Gujranwala, three drones were destroyed in different locations of the district. The locals found wreckage of the drones in the Tokrian village of Wahndo and Solakhanabad village on the outskirts of the city. Another drone was found in a field near Aimanabad’s Agu Bhandar village of Gujranwala.</p>
<p>In Gujrat, parts of an Indian drone were found in Peer Jhand village in the jurisdiction of the Dinga police station. According to eyewitnesses, some parts of the drone fell in the field while some crashed on a house, falling through its roof into a room on the ground floor. However, everyone remained safe.</p>
<p>In Bahawalpur, an Ind­ian drone was destroyed in the Cholistan desert. According to the announcement, the Indian drone hit the area of Chapoowala in the desert in the limits of tehsil Yazman.</p>
<p>In Karachi, two drones fell on the outskirts of the Malir district, partially damaging the roof of a house. The first drone fell on a house in the Sharafi Goth slum, said area police SHO Sadaruddin Mirani. It damaged the roof partially, but no one was hurt. He said the incident occu­rred at around 10:30am.</p>
<p>The officer said that the drone was two and a half feet long.</p>
<p>Soon after, another dr­­o­ne fell near the residential neighbourhood of Gulshan-i-Hadeed.</p>
<p>Malir SP Mansoor Gulzar Bozdar told <em>Dawn</em> the drone fell in a hilly area near Link Road. He said it did not cause any damage to life or property.</p>
<p>In Umerkot, an Indian drone also crashed near the village of Sufi Akbar, close to the Chhor cantonment. Fortunately, no casualties or injuries were reported.</p>
<p><strong>‘Serious, serious provocation’</strong></p>
<p>India also admitted that it targetted military installations.</p>
<p>A statement by India’s Press Information Bureau said army installations were targeted “at a number of locations across Pakistan”. However, the attacks mostly took place in areas heavily populated by civilians.</p>
<p>As he shared details about the operation that downed drones, Lt-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that the Pakistan Army used “their soft-kill (technical) and hard-kill (weapons) skills fully” to shoot down 25 Israeli-made Harop drones.</p>
<p>Referring to Pakistan’s response to Indian strikes, the ISPR press release said, “After the destruction of its five modern jets, drones and several posts, as well as soldier deaths, India is attacking Pakistan using these Israeli-made Harop drones in panic.”</p>
<p>“This cowardly attack is a sign of India’s worry and panic,” it added.</p>
<p>“The debris of these Israeli-made Harop drones is being collected from various locations across Pakistan,” the military’s media wing said. It asserted that the Pakistan Army was “giving a befitting reply to the enemy and crushing all its nefarious designs”.</p>
<p>During the press briefing, the military’s media spokesman also showed a series of pictures showing the debris of the drones. He added that the debris and downed drones were being collected from multiple locations.</p>
<p>“As we speak, the process of India sending across these Harop drones, this naked aggression continues, and the armed forces are on high degree of alert and neutralising them as we speak,” Lt-Gen Chaudhry continued.</p>
<p>“This is a serious, serious provocation,” the ISPR chief added.</p>
<p>According to BBC News, Lt-Gen Chaudhry said the Indian government needs to transition from “cinema” into the “real world we live in” and called the strikes a “phantom defence”.</p>

            <p><p>Pakistan’s armed forces have taken down 25 Israeli-made <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909385/all-you-need-to-know-about-israel-made-harop-drones-used-by-india-in-pakistan">Harop drones</a> sent into the country by India since last night, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A day earlier, Pakistan mourned the loss of 31 lives in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">overnight attacks</a> by Indian forces on civilians, describing New Delhi’s actions as “terrorism” and accusing it of continuous ceasefire violations on the Line of Control (LoC).</p>
<p>The Pakistan military termed the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824#:~:text=The%20Pakistani%20military%20has%20brought%20down%20five%20Indian%20jets%20in%20retaliation%20for%20late%2Dnight%20strikes%20launched%20by%20its%20neighbouring%20country%20at%20six%20sites%2C%20including%20in%20Punjab%E2%80%99s%20Sialkot%20and%20Bahawalpur%2C%20as%20well%20as%20Azad%20Jammu%20and%20Kashmir.">downing of five Indian fighter jets</a> as a major victory —  and it was seemingly acknowledged when Indian officials <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909047">admitted</a> that at least three of their aircraft had “crashed” within their territory.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, as both countries continued to trade heavy artillery fire, authorities revealed the extent of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">damage caused by Indian strikes</a> at six locations — Ahmedpur East, Muridke, Sialkot and Shakkargarh in Punjab and Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Azad Kashmir.</p>
<p>“The Pakistan Army, using their soft-kill (technical) and hard-kill (weapons) skills fully, have shot down 25 Israeli-made Harop drones,” the ISPR said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7282" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> today.</p>
<p>Referring to Pakistan’s response to Indian strikes, the ISPR press release said: “After the destruction of its five modern jets, drones and several posts, as well as soldier deaths, India is attacking Pakistan using these Israeli-made Harop drones in panic.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Indian defence ministry <a class="link--external" href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2127670" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">admitted</a> that its armed forces targeted a number of locations in Pakistan in the morning today. Indian outlet <em><a class="link--external" href="https://aninews.in/news/national/general-news/harpy-drones-used-by-indian-military-to-target-enemy-air-defence-systems20250508154319/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ANI News</a></em> reported that Harpy drones were used by the Indian military to target Pakistan’s “air defence system”. According to the <a class="link--external" href="https://dimse.info/harpy-harop/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Database of Israeli Military and Security Export</a>, the Harop is a “later development of the Harpy”.</p>
<p>The ministry’s statement also alleged that Pakistan had “increased the intensity” of firing at the LoC, where the two countries’ troops have been exchanging fire for the past several days.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>“The Harpy is designed to attack radar systems and is optimised for the suppression of enemy air defences (Sead) role. It carries a high explosive warhead,” the <em>ANI</em> report read.</p>
<p>In a press briefing early today, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said Pakistan’s forces had neutralised 12 drones sent by India since last night. He also stated that four army personnel were injured as one drone, besides those downed, managed to engage a military target partially.</p>
<p>The ISPR DG detailed the locations where 12 of those drones sent by India were neutralised — Lahore, Attock, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi and Bahawalpur in Punjab, as well as Sukkur’s Miano, Umerkot’s Chhor and near Karachi in Sindh.</p>
<p>“Other than these 12, one drone, however, managed to engage a military target near Lahore partially,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said.</p>
<p>“Four men of the Pakistan Army have been injured in this attack near Lahore and partial damage to an equipment has occurred,” he said.</p>
<p>The DG ISPR further said that as a result of India’s drone activity, one civilian embraced martyrdom and another was injured in Miano.</p>

<p>He further said: “Not only that, having faced the destruction of five of their aircraft, multiple drones, and suffering heavy casualties along LoC and damage, it appears that India has apparently lost the plot.</p>
<p>“And rather than going on a path of rationality, it is further escalating in a highly charged environment to satisfy the hubristic mindset of the Indian government,” Lt Gen Chaudhry asserted.</p>
<p>“The international community can visibly see the path that India is treading through this extremely provocative military aggression in a region, which is highly fragile and putting the security of the region and beyond at risk,” he said.</p>
<p>The DG ISPR added that the Pakistan armed forces remain “fully vigilant to any type of threat”. He then repeated the details of the Indian drones downed in Urdu.</p></p>

            <p><p>The UN appointed Spanish diplomat Miguel Angel Moratinos Cuyaube on Wednesday as Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ special envoy to combat Islamophobia.</p>
<p>Moratinos will continue in his current role as High Representative for the United Nations Alliance of Civilisations (UNAOC), which he has held since 2019, according to a statement by the UN spokesperson’s office.</p>
<p>“Moratinos brings decades of diplomatic experience and leadership on multilateral issues, including dialogue among civilisations and combating discrimination,” it said. “Moratinos has reinforced UNAOC’s role as a global platform for dialogue and bridge-building.”</p>
<p>A seasoned diplomat, Moratinos served as Spain’s foreign minister from 2004 to 2010, during which his country held the presidency of the Security Council and led several international organisations, including the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe.</p>
<p>On X, Moratinos uploaded a statement expressing his gratitude and stating he was truly honoured for the appointment.</p>
<p>“I thank the secretary general for the new responsibility that I have been entrusted with. I am also grateful for the support of member states and especially the OIC Core Group,” he wrote.</p>
<p>“The appointment of a UN special envoy to combat Islamophobia will contribute to strengthening our response to Islamophobia,” he added. “I wish to reaffirm my commitment to stand in solidarity with Muslim communities and to stand up against all forms of discrimination and bigotry.”</p>
