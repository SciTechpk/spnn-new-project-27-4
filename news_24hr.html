            <p><p>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on Monday it has appointed Leah Gutierrez as the director general for its Central and West Asia Department, which oversees engagement with Pakistan and 10 other countries.</p>
<p>The ADB is a key <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915179">lender</a> for Pakistan, with vital financing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917938">programmes</a> underway, along with assisting in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918863">digital overhaul</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913568">climate policy</a> plans.</p>
<p>As director general, Gutierrez will deliver ADB’s strategic agenda in the Central and West Asia region, which includes Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkiye, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>Her appointment takes effect today, read a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.adb.org/news/leah-gutierrez-appointed-director-general-adb-central-and-west-asia-department" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by ADB.</p>
<p>“I am honoured to serve in this position and will continue to engage with developing member countries and stakeholders to promote inclusive growth, regional cooperation, and sustainable development across the region,” Gutierrez was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>Gutierrez has over four decades of professional experience, including 25 years at ADB, the statement noted.</p>
<p>“Prior to her appointment, Gutierrez was the director general for ADB’s Sectors Department 3, where she managed operations for finance, human and social development, and public sector management and governance.</p>
<p>“She is also a former director general of the Pacific Department. She has held senior positions in ADB’s Strategy, Policy, and Partnerships Department; Southeast Asia Department; and Office of the Secretary,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Last October, the ADB <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1865165">appointed</a> Xiaoqin Fan as the new country director.</p>
<p>In June, Pakistan signed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917938">$1 billion financing</a> for a five-year multi-tranche facility with the ADB. The same month, the bank approved an $800 million programme to strengthen fiscal sustainability and improve public financial management in Pakistan.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927118/ttp-terrorists-who-masterminded-attack-on-chinese-engineers-last-year-killed-in-karachi-operation-ctd' target='_blank'><strong>TTP terrorists who masterminded attack on Chinese engineers last year killed in Karachi operation: CTD</strong></a>
            <p><p>Three terrorists, including the mastermind behind the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870248">November 2024 attack</a> on Chinese engineers, were killed during a counterterrorism operation in Karachi’s Manghopir area, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>On November 5 last year, two Chinese nationals were shot at and wounded by a private security guard in a textile mill in Karachi’s SITE area. At that time, investigators had suspected that it was a targeted attack.</p>
<p>Following the incident, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870248#:~:text=In%20a%20statement%20issued,and%20institutions%20in%20Pakistan.">statement</a> that the attack was being probed, adding that Pakistan was committed to the safety and security of Chinese nationals, projects, and institutions in the country. A first information report (FIR) was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870532">registered</a> two days later against the security guard who had fled after the incident.</p>
<p>“A terrorist who masterminded an attack on Chinese engineers in November last year has been killed during an operation in Karachi’s Manghopir area,” Additional Inspector-General of Police, Counter-Terrorism Department Azad Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>Khan said the slain terrorist was identified as Zafran, while two of his accomplices were also killed in the operation.</p>
<p>Senior CTD official Raja Umer Khattab said that the operation was jointly carried out by the CTD and personnel of intelligence agencies. “The teams raided a house in the Manghopir area and killed the terrorists during an operation,” he said. “They belonged to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).”</p>
<p>At the time of the incident, Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG-South) Syed Asad Raza told journalists that the incident had occurred as a result of a verbal altercation between the engineers and the guard, but a further probe was underway to ascertain the exact reason.</p>
<p>He had said that a supervisor and three guards of the private security company had been detained for questioning, while efforts were underway to arrest the guard involved in the shooting.  The DIG had added that the suspect’s residence had been traced, and investigators were collecting information about him from his neighbours.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">surge</a> in terrorist activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. However, Chinese nationals have also been targeted inside Pakistan over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1877910/20-chinese-citizens-killed-34-injured-in-14-terrorist-attacks-since-2021-nacta">report</a> by the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta) published in 2024, 20 Chinese citizens have been killed and 34 injured in terrorist attacks in the country since 2021.</p>
<p>In October 2024, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1863586/pm-shehbaz-assures-chinese-envoy-of-personally-overseeing-karachi-terror-attack-investigation">suicide attack near Karachi airport</a>, claimed by the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), left two Chinese citizens dead and injured ten others.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1824034/china-seeks-answers-after-engineers-killed-in-bisham">March 2024</a>, Chinese workers were targeted in KP’s Besham, reportedly carried out by affiliates of either the TTP or Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), resulting in five Chinese fatalities.</p>
<p>At least four people, including three Chinese nationals, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1686920">killed</a> while four others were injured in a suicide attack outside the University of Karachi’s (KU) Confucius Institute in 2022.</p>
<p>The escalation in violence against Chinese nationals had amplified Beijing’s security concerns, especially over progress on China-Pakistan Econo­mic Corridor (CPEC) projects.  Speaking at the event in late October last year, the Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong had expressed frustration over the attacks, stating it was “unacceptable” and urging Islamabad to strengthen security measures for Chinese nationals and crack down on anti-China elements.</p>
<p>Former Foreign Office spokes­person Mumtaz Zahra Baloch had called the statement “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1869028">perplexing</a>” and a stark departure from the longstanding diplomatic norms between the two nations.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927128/thailand-and-cambodia-truce-talks-due-but-strikes-continue' target='_blank'><strong>Thailand and Cambodia truce talks due but strikes continue</strong></a>
            <p><p>Thailand and Cambodia’s leaders are due to meet for peace talks on Monday, as a festering territorial <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926486">dispute</a> along their shared frontier dragged into a fifth day of open combat.</p>
<p>At least 35 people have been killed and more than 200,000 displaced since Thursday as the countries fight over a smattering of contested ancient <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/604355/thai-cambodia-border-fighting-damages-temple">temples</a>.</p>
<p>In an effort initiated by United States President <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926693">Donald Trump</a>, Thailand’s acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai and Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Manet will meet at 3pm (12pm PKT) in Kuala Lumpur. China is also expected to send a delegation.</p>
<p>Ahead of the talks, Thailand and Cambodia <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926693/death-toll-rises-in-thai-cambodian-clashes-despite-ceasefire-call">traded</a> fresh fire and accusations.</p>
<p>“We do not believe Cambodia is acting in good faith, based on their actions in addressing the issue,” Phumtham told reporters as he departed Bangkok airport.</p>
<p>“They need to demonstrate genuine intent, and we will assess that during the meeting.”</p>
<p>Cambodia’s defence ministry spokeswoman Maly Socheata said Monday was “the fifth day that Thailand has invaded Cambodia’s territory with heavy weapons and with the deployment of a lot of troops”.</p>
<p>In Thailand’s Surin city — 30 kilometres from the border and a hub of evacuees fleeing the fighting — 58-year-old Lamduan Chuenjit shared her leader’s scepticism.</p>
<p>“I hope the negotiation goes well today and ends with a ceasefire,” the cleaner told <em>AFP</em> while sweeping a shopfront. “But I do wonder how trustworthy Cambodia is.”</p>
<p>On the eve of the talks, Thailand’s military said Cambodian snipers were camping in one of the contested temples, and accused Phnom Penh of surging troops along the border and hammering Thai territory with rockets.</p>
<p>It said fighting was ongoing at seven areas along the rural border region, marked by a ridge of hills surrounded by wild jungle and agricultural land where locals farm rubber and rice.</p>
<p>“The situation remains highly tense, and it is anticipated that Cambodia may be preparing for a major military operation prior to entering negotiations,” the Thai military statement read.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Trump said he made a late-night call to both leaders, who agreed to “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926810/trump-says-cambodia-thailand-agree-to-work-out-truce">quickly work out</a>” a truce.</p>
<p>Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said the summit — which will be mediated by Malaysian leader Anwar Ibrahim — was also organised “with the participation of China”, a key trade and political ally.</p>
<p>“The purpose of this meeting is to achieve an immediate ceasefire, which was initiated by President Donald Trump and agreed to by both prime ministers of Cambodia and Thailand,” Hun Manet said.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that US officials “are on the ground in Malaysia to assist these peace efforts”, while Anwar told domestic media he would focus on securing an “immediate ceasefire”.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#both-sides-point-the-finger" id="both-sides-point-the-finger" title="Permalink"></a>Both sides point the finger</h2>
<p>Thai King <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1480227">Maha Vajiralongkorn</a> marked his 73rd birthday on Monday, but a notice in the country’s Royal Gazette said his public celebrations scheduled for Bangkok’s Grand Palace have been cancelled amid the strife.</p>
<p>Trump has threatened both countries with eye-watering levies in his global tariff blitz unless they agree to independent trade deals — saying he would “look forward” to signing them once “Peace is at hand”.</p>
<p>Both sides have agreed to a truce in principle, while accusing the other of undermining peace efforts and trading allegations about the use of cluster bombs and targeting of hospitals.</p>
<p>Thailand says eight of its soldiers and 14 civilians have been killed, while Cambodia has confirmed eight civilian and five military deaths.</p>
<p>The Thai military said it has returned the bodies of 12 Cambodian soldiers killed in combat.</p>
<p>More than <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926498/thailand-warns-of-war-with-cambodia-as-138000-flee-fighting">138,000 people</a> have fled Thailand’s border regions, while around 80,000 have been driven from their homes in Cambodia.</p>
<p>With the skirmish enflaming nationalist sentiments, Thailand warned its citizens to “refrain from any kind of violence, whether in speech or action” against Cambodian migrants living in the country.</p></p>
