            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923918/pti-shows-willingness-to-talk-but-demands-accountability-from-institutions' target='_blank'><strong>PTI shows willingness to talk but demands ‘accountability’ from institutions</strong></a>
            <p><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Saturday called on state institutions to engage in dialogue with the PTI, but demanded that they hold themselves accountable.</p>
<p>Gandapur and the PTI’s top leadership are on a visit to Lahore to formally launch a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923856/pti-brass-gathers-in-lahore-to-kick-start-aug-5-movement">movement</a> to seek the release of party founder Imran Khan and devise a strategy for its nationwide protest, which will reach its crescendo on August 5 — marking two years since the ex-premier was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a>.</p>
<p>Since Imran’s incarceration in several cases, which he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1890696#:~:text=He%20claimed%20that%20four%20convictions%20against%20him%20were%20politically%20motivated">claims</a> are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1843176">politically motivated</a>, his party’s relationship with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880551">government</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832432">establishment</a> has turned exceedingly sour. The PTI has held several protests over the last year, most of which escalated into <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1857709">violence</a> after facing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875003/day-of-clashes-in-islamabad-ends-in-pti-protesters-retreat">state repression</a>.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference flanked by PTI’s Punjab leadership, CM Gandapur said: “We have to correct our institutions ourselves. Come, sit together, own your mistakes and move forward.”</p>
<p>He recalled that Imran, despite his wife also being imprisoned in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831">graft case</a>, had repeatedly said he was ready to talk for the sake of the country.</p>

<p>Imran was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">jailed</a> on Aug 5, 2023 in a case related to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878307/imran-khan-bushra-bibi-indicted-in-new-toshakhana-case">state gifts</a>, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831">£190 million graft case</a> and faces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845818">pending trials</a> related to the May 9, 2023 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">riots</a>.</p>
<p>In the wake of the nationwide May 9 protests, which saw important <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">military installations</a> come under attack, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753589">thousands</a> of PTI workers and almost the entire <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1774736">top-tier leadership</a> were rounded up, with many still facing court proceedings under serious <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891122/five-pti-leaders-16-activists-indicted-in-another-may-9-case">charges</a>.</p>
<p>“Come and talk, acknowledge and correct your mistakes,” Gandapur reiterated today, noting that it was everyone’s collective responsibility to think about Pakistan’s future.</p>
<p>“The state institutions have ignored their duties which are stated in the Constitution and are instead doing other work, due to which terrorism has [risen] in the country,” he said, adding that the security situation in KP and Balochistan had worsened because “those responsible for guarding the borders were chasing the PTI instead”.</p>
<p>“The state institutions, whose duty is not to engage in politics, are playing every role in forming, running and overthrowing governments,” the PTI leader alleged.</p>
<p>“And when you ask, they reply with delight that ‘we are non-political’”.</p>
<p>Gandapur, stressing that he was a soldier’s son and brother, said: “My military is being defamed due to a few wrong people and their decisions.”</p>
<p>“Where are those who imposed martial laws? They are not in Pakistan today. Who is suffering? My Pakistanis,” the KP CM said.</p>
<p>Gandapur also called on the political parties in the ruling coalition to go into the public, which he said had “rejected” them. He cautioned that those parties will then face the consequences later on of the “culture” they had developed. Addressing their supporters, he said, “They (leaders of other political parties) will flee abroad. You have to stay here.”</p>
<p>He asked if it was “right as a human and a Muslim” if a PTI leader’s home was raided and their privacy was violated. “If you are silent on this, then if this happens with you tomorrow, then no one will raise a voice for you either.”</p>
<p>Thanking PTI workers, leaders, its lawmakers and overseas supporters, Gandapur vowed to organise a grassroots movement upwards from the streets, towns, and cities.</p>
<p>A caravan of KP lawmakers led by CM Gandapur, as well as Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923856/pti-brass-gathers-in-lahore-to-kick-start-aug-5-movement">reached Lahore</a> via G.T. Road yesterday evening. During a layover in Jhelum, the KP CM said that the protest had been launched, and the parliamentary meeting in Lahore would mull the final protest strategy to step up the campaign seeking Imran’s release.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923916/farm-worker-dies-after-us-immigration-raid-on-cannabis-farm-in-california' target='_blank'><strong>Farm worker dies after US immigration raid on cannabis farm in California</strong></a>
            <p><p>A farm worker has died after being <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923700/worker-in-critical-condition-after-us-immigration-raid-on-california-farm">injured</a> during a raid by US immigration agents on a legal cannabis farm in California, his family said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Raids on agricultural sites on Thursday resulted in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886071">arrests</a> of 200 undocumented migrants, as part of US President Donald Trump’s wide-ranging anti-immigration <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918869">crackdown</a>, and clashes between law enforcement officials and protesters.</p>
<p>The farm worker’s family had started a page on the fundraising platform GoFundMe to help support his relatives in Mexico.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the page posted an update to say he had “passed away.”</p>
<p>Trump campaigned for the presidency on a harsh anti-immigration platform, likening undocumented migrants to “animals” and “monsters,” and since taking office he has delivered on promises to conduct a massive deportation drive.</p>
<p>On Friday, he called demonstrators involved in attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents “slimeballs” and said they should be arrested.</p>
<p>The chaotic raid on the cannabis plantation in Ventura County, about 90 kilometres from Los Angeles, saw the worker who later died being chased by ICE agents, his family said.</p>
<p>“My uncle Jaime was just a hard-working, innocent farmer,” said a post on the GoFundMe page. “He was chased by ICE agents, and we were told he fell 30ft (9 meters).”</p>
<p>The page described his injuries as “catastrophic.”</p>
<p>Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman, said he was never in custody.</p>
<p>“Although he was not being pursued by law enforcement, this individual climbed up to the roof of a green house and fell 30 feet,” McLaughlin said.</p>
<p>“(Customs and Border Patrol) immediately called a medevac to the scene to get him care as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>DHS said 200 undocumented migrants were arrested during raids on marijuana growing sites in Carpinteria and Camarillo on Thursday and 10 children were rescued “from potential exploitation, forced labor, and human trafficking.”</p>
<p>Glass House Brands, which owns the farms, said in a statement that it has “never knowingly violated applicable hiring practices and does not and has never employed minors.”</p>
<p>DHS said more than 500 “rioters” had attempted to disrupt the operation and four US citizens are facing charges for assaulting or resisting officers.</p>
<p>Tear gas was used against the protesters, some of whom were seen in television footage throwing projectiles at law enforcement vehicles.</p>
<p>The department said immigration agency vehicles were damaged and a $50,000 reward was being offered for the arrest of an individual who allegedly fired a gun at law enforcement officers.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#american-dream-no-longer" id="american-dream-no-longer" title="Permalink"></a>American dream ‘no longer’</h2>
<p>In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he had watched footage of “thugs” throwing rocks and bricks at ICE vehicles, causing “tremendous damage.”</p>
<p>Trump said he was authorizing law enforcement officers who are “on the receiving end of thrown rocks, bricks, or any other form of assault, to stop their car, and arrest these SLIMEBALLS, using whatever means is necessary to do so.”</p>
<p>“I am giving Total Authorization for ICE to protect itself, just like they protect the Public,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump has been involved in a showdown over immigration enforcement with Democratic-ruled California for weeks.</p>
<p>The Republican president sent thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles last month to quell protests against round-ups of undocumented migrants by federal agents.</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has said the troops were not necessary to address the mostly peaceful protests, but his legal efforts to have them removed have failed so far.</p>
<p>The cannabis farm in Camarillo was calm during a visit by an <em>AFP</em> reporter on Friday, as workers waited in line to collect their belongings and paychecks.</p>
<p>“We’ve been here since six this morning asking questions but they’re not giving us any information,” said Saul Munoz, a 43-year-old Colombian whose son was detained on Thursday.</p>
<p>“I just want to know how he’s doing,” Munoz said. “Bring him back to me and if it’s time for us to leave, we’ll leave.</p>
<p>“The truth is the American dream is no longer really the American dream.”</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923917/four-members-of-womans-family-killed-by-husband-his-relatives-police' target='_blank'><strong>Four members of woman’s family killed by husband, his relatives: police</strong></a>
            <p><p>Four members of a woman’s family were shot dead on Saturday in the Tatara area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Nowshera district, allegedly by her husband and in-laws over a domestic dispute, police said.</p>
<p>Nowshera police spokesperson, Turk Ali Shah, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that a first information report (FIR) has been lodged at the Akbarpura police station under section 302 (Punishment for Qatl-i-amd) and section 324 (Attempt to commit murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of the woman, whose parents, brother, and uncle were killed in the attack allegedly by her husband, his brothers and father.</p>
<p>According to the FIR, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, the complainant, a mother of two, said she married her husband a few years ago, but since then had been facing domestic issues and was living with her parents for the last four months. She stated that she had been pursuing a court case seeking a separate residence from her husband, refusing to continue living with her in-laws.</p>
<p>“The court recently asked my husband for a patch-up with me on the issue. He came to my parents’ home for reconciliation but started arguing with my family,” she said in the report.</p>
<p>The complainant said her brother-in-law, whose was standing outside her parents’ house armed with weapons, came inside and opened fire at her parents and brother, killing them instantly.</p>
<p>Police spokesperson Shah said, “Efforts were underway to arrest the suspects who had fled the scene after the incidents.”</p>
<p>Domestic disputes are not uncommon in Pakistan, often triggered by financial issues, inheritance, or family interference. In some cases, these escalate due to lack of conflict resolution mechanisms, weak legal enforcement, and deeply rooted patriarchal norms.</p>
<p>Nowshera Police last month <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915408">arrested</a> the prime suspect in the murder of three children, with the alleged killer revealed to be the victims’ grandmother, according to a statement issued by Nowshera police.</p>
<p>On June 6, a man allegedly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1922354">shot dead</a> his son and daughter-in-law following an argument in the Tangi area of Charsadda district, police said.</p>
<p>In March, a man allegedly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896441">shot</a> his elderly mother and two siblings dead in Nowshera district, a police spokesperson said. Rescue 1122 spokesperson said the suspect allegedly opened fire on his 82-year-old mother, brother and sister after a heated argument over power supply lines.</p></p>
