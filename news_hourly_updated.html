            <p><p>The Israeli army seized the Gaza-bound aid ship Madleen on Monday, towing it to Israel, the Foreign Ministry said, adding the activists will be deported to their countries.</p>
<p>The British-flagged yacht Madleen, operated by the pro-Palestinian FFC, had departed from Sicily on June 6 and had hoped to reach Gaza later in the day, when the interception occurred, the group said on its Telegram account.</p>
<p>Among those on board the boat are Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament. The yacht is carrying a small shipment of humanitarian aid, including rice and baby formula.</p>

<p>The ministry said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/IsraelMFA/status/1931877539871338775" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on X that the vessel “is safely making its way to the shores of Israel. The passengers are expected to return to their home countries”.</p>
<p>It said earlier that “the maritime zone off the coast of Gaza is closed to unauthorised vessels under a legal naval blockade, consistent with international law”.</p>
<p>“Humanitarian aid is delivered regularly and effectively via different channels and routes and is transferred through established distribution mechanisms,” it added.</p>
<p>Earlier, Israeli forces boarded the charity vessel attempting to reach the Gaza Strip in defiance of an Israeli naval blockade, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC) had said earlier on Monday.</p>

<p>The Israeli military had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>Shortly before the FFC statement, the Israeli Foreign Ministry posted a video on X showing the Israeli Navy communicating with the Madleen over a loudspeaker, urging it to change course.</p>
<p>“The maritime zone off the coast of Gaza is closed to naval traffic as part of a legal naval blockade,” a soldier said. “If you wish to deliver humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, you are able to do so through the (Israeli) port of Ashdod.”</p>
<p>The organisers of the Madleen’s voyage said on Saturday that they had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916004/madleen-ship-set-to-arrive-in-palestinian-waters-in-24-hours-eu-lawmaker">reached</a> Egyptian waters and were nearing Gaza, where the conflict between Israel and Hamas entered its 21st month.</p>
<p>The Madleen, a sailing boat operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915389">left</a> Italy on June 1 with the stated aim of delivering humanitarian aid and breaking the Israeli blockade on the Palestinian territory.</p>
<p>“Israel will not allow anyone to break the naval blockade of Gaza, which is aimed at preventing weapons from reaching Hamas — a murderous terrorist group holding our hostages and committing war crimes,” Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said.</p>
<p>“Israel will act against any attempt to break the blockade or support terror groups — by sea, air or land,” he added.</p>
<p>The coalition responded in a statement on X, saying it expected “interception and an attack from Israel at any moment” and calling for the governments of those on board to protect them.</p>
<p>The post added that the Madleen is 160 nautical miles from Gaza and that jamming “briefly disrupted our location, but our tracker is functioning again”.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, activists aboard the vessel have said they will continue their journey “until the last minute”.</p>
<p>“We’ll stay mobilised until the last minute — until Israel cuts the internet and networks,” European parliament member Rima Hassan told <em>AFP</em> from the boat. “There are twelve of us civilians on board. We are not armed. There is only humanitarian aid.”</p>
<p>Hassan voiced concern over the lack of official response from countries whose citizens are part of the crew.</p>
<p>“No state has responded. The message being sent is that Israel is being allowed to act with impunity, without any guarantee of protection for us,” she added.</p>
<p>In a post on X, Hassan said that the activists have “less than 24 hours” before they are detained by Israeli authorities.</p>
<p>“When we are no longer able to communicate with you, I’m counting on you to continue the mobilisation that has been so valuable to us throughout this journey,” she wrote.</p>

<p>Nationals of Germany, France, Brazil, Turkey, Sweden, Spain and the Netherlands are on the boat.</p>
<p>“We’re not scared of them,” said German human rights activist Yasemin Acar, also on board. “The message they have been sending us, that we cannot come closer, is not making us step back.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, French Minister for Foreign Trade and French Nationals Abroad Laurent Saint-Martin said that France was obliged to ensure “consular protection” for its nationals aboard the Madleen.</p>
<p>“The six French citizens on this boat are entitled to consular protection,” he told a state TV channel.</p>
<p>The conflict was sparked by Hamas’s October 7, 2023 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1779807">attack</a> on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an <em>AFP</em> tally of official figures.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the health ministry in Gaza said that the overall toll for the Gaza war had reached 54,880, the majority being civilians. The UN considers these figures reliable.</p></p>

                <h2>5 injured as blaze in Karachi’s Landhi factory continues to burn</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A fire that broke out at a factory in Landhi on Sunday is still burning, more than 24 hours after the blaze, injuring five, according to a Rescue 1122 spokesperson.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassan Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em> that rescue officials are still at the site, trying to put the blaze out.</p>
<p>The fire, which erupted in a factory in the export processing zone in Landhi, caused part of a factory building to collapse, leaving five people injured.</p>
<p>“The injured include 45-year-old Aslam, 30-year-old Hamza, 20-year-old Ayaz, 43-year-old Sajid Mahmood and 53-year-old Mohsin,” Khan said. “They have been transported to Civil Hospital.”</p>
<p>Earlier, Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the fire broke out at 4:31am, meaning that it has been burning for over 24 hours.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em> earlier today, Abid Jalaluddin Sheikh, chief operating officer at Rescue 1122 Sindh, said that the fire broke out early on Sunday morning, spreading rapidly and engulfing two other factories due to the presence of combustible material.</p>
<p>He said, “As soon as the information was received, the Fire and Rescue team of Rescue 1122 reached the spot.”</p>
<p>According to Sheikh, a total of 12 fire brigade trucks,two snorkels and two ambulances of Rescue 1122 and the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) are present at the spot to provide full assistance to deal with any emergency situation.</p>
<p>“The rescue operation is facing difficulties due to the intensity of smoke and other difficulties, as well as the shortage of water, but Rescue 1122 is making efforts to control the fire,” he said.</p>
<p>Sheikh highlighted that firefighting operations were “in full swing and full efforts are being made to reduce the intensity of the fire because the intensity of the fire is very high”.</p>
<p>“The Rescue 1122 team is making full efforts to control this emergency situation by utilising all possible resources,” he said, adding that citizens have been requested to immediately report any emergency to 1122.</p>
<p>Fire incidents are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903361">common</a> in the metropolis due to the absence of adequate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1873091/fire-erupts-in-model-colony-warehouse-after-cylinder-blast">fire safety measures</a> in buildings.</p>
<p>Thirty shops were gutted when a huge fire erupted in a commercial building in Clifton in February.</p>
<p>Four people, including one firefighter, were affected by smoke inhalation and 12 fire tenders worked for four hours to bring the fire under control.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1816066">Last year</a>, the KMC informed the Sindh High Court that it had conducted a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1816066">fire safety audit</a> of over 265 commercial buildings, and not a single one was found to have a fire safety certificate or a no-objection certificate (NOC) issued by the fire brigade department.</p>
<p>Out of <a class="link--external" href="https://Out%20of%20265%20buildings,%20around%20155%20did%20not%20have%20fire%20alarms%20and%20smoke%20detectors%20installed,%20while%20the%20status%20of%20nine%20such%20buildings%20was%20not%20available%20in%20this%20respect,%20the%20KMC%20report%20added." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">265 buildings</a>, around 155 did not have fire alarms and smoke detectors installed, while the status of nine such buildings was not available in this respect, the KMC report added.</p>
<p>Similarly, the condition of the wiring and electric system of over 155 buildings was termed unsatisfactory. Regarding access to firefighting equipment, the report said that around 200 buildings had no or unsatisfactory firefighting equipment.</p></p>
