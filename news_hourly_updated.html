                <h2>PM Shehbaz calls for national policy to address rapid population growth</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called for an immediate national policy to address Pakistan‚Äôs rapid population growth rate on Thursday.</p>
<p>Pakistan is home to a vast population of over 251 million, according to World Bank <a class="link--external" href="https://data.worldbank.org/country/pakistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">figures</a>. In 2023, the population growth rate was reported to have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1829245">reached</a> around 2.55 per cent. However, almost forty-five per cent of Pakistan‚Äôs population lives <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915759">below</a> the poverty line, according to a World Bank report.</p>
<p>The prime minister termed the high population growth rate an ‚Äúalarming trend‚Äù and said that immediate and coordinated policy action was required at a national level to address the issue. The World Bank <a class="link--external" href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.GROW?locations=PK" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> Pakistan‚Äôs annual growth rate for 2024 as 1.5pc.</p>
<p>The statement came during a high-level meeting chaired by the premier at his office to review the challenges posed by Pakistan‚Äôs rising population and deliberate on effective strategies to manage it, according to a statement from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office.</p>
<p>The meeting was also attended by Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal, Federal Minister for Education Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousaf and Federal Minister for Law Azam Nazeer Tarar, along with senior officials from institutions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe need comprehensive planning to ensure our growing population, especially the youth, becomes a productive part of the economy,‚Äù PM Shehbaz stressed.</p>

<p>‚ÄúA large segment of our population comprises young people, who are the most valuable asset for our country.‚Äù</p>
<p>He emphasised that the government was taking several initiatives to empower the youth and integrate them into the country‚Äôs economic mainstream.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOpportunities are being created to enable our youth to play a central role in national development,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>Speaking on gender inclusion, Shehbaz underlined the critical importance of women‚Äôs participation in the workforce.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWomen constitute a significant portion of our human capital. We must ensure greater employment opportunities for them,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The premier instructed the formation of a committee to develop a comprehensive and effective national policy, in close collaboration with provincial governments.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA unified and strategic response is the need of the hour,‚Äù he said, calling for a coordinated federal-provincial framework to tackle population-related issues.</p>
<p>He also stressed the importance of launching a nationwide awareness campaign to educate citizens about the implications of unchecked population growth, especially in the context of sustainable economic development.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the premier was briefed on various proposals and recommendations to manage population growth. Officials stressed that any long-term solution would require active provincial collaboration and public engagement at the grassroots level.</p>
<p>Last month, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923451/population-growth-rate-in-pakistan-alarming-health-minister">said</a> that population growth in Pakistan has reached an alarming level. He highlighted the wide-ranging consequences of the demographic challenge, including over 25m children currently being out of school and overcrowding at government hospitals.</p>
<p>In June, parliamentarians unanimously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919941">approved</a> a resolution on population stabilisation and vowed to table it in the National Assembly.</p></p>

                <h2>Netanyahu confirms Israeli support during Operation Sindoor: reports</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday confirmed his country‚Äôs role in providing support to India during Operation Sindoor in May, when India attacked Pakistani sites under the guise of targeting ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù.</p>
<p>The nuclear-armed rivals exchanged <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">artillery, drone and air strikes</a> in May, after India, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">without evidence</a>, blamed Pakistan for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> on tourists in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam. The four-day confrontation came to an end when US President Donald Trump announced a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">surprise ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>In a post on X, Netanyahu announced that he met the Indian ambassador to Israel, JP Singh, in Jerusalem today, where the pair ‚Äúdiscussed strengthening and expanding cooperation between Israel and India, particularly in the fields of security and economics‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfterward, I held a meeting with a group of senior journalists from India and answered their questions,‚Äù the Israeli leader wrote.</p>

<p>According to Indian television channel <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/things-we-provided-benjamin-netanyahus-nod-to-israeli-weapons-in-op-sindoor-9039633" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NDTV</a></em>, Netanyahu confirmed the use of Israeli weapons during India‚Äôs military operations in May, including the deployment of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home">HARPY drones</a> and the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.spsnavalforces.com/story/?id=811&amp;h=BARAK-8-Advanced-Air-and-Missile-Defence-System" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Barak-8 missile</a>, which is jointly developed with India.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe things we provided before worked very well on the field‚Ä¶ we develop our weapons in the field and they are battle-tested,‚Äù the Israeli PM was quoted as saying by <em>NDTV</em>. ‚ÄúThey worked fine and we have a pretty solid foundation.‚Äù</p>
<p>The channel added that Israel was one of several countries that supported Operation Sindoor. Kobbi Shoshani, the Consul General in Mumbai, said it was ‚Äúessential‚Äù to send a strong message to the terrorists.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat (Operation Sindoor) was an action of self-defence, and I‚Äôm very proud of this operation,‚Äù Shoshani was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>According to Indian channel <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.news18.com/world/israels-netanyahu-says-basic-understanding-in-washington-dc-is-that-india-is-a-solid-partner-9491319.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">News18</a></em>, New Delhi deployed the HARPY and SkyStriker loitering munitions ‚Äúto great effect‚Äù during Operation Sindoor, reportedly targeting Pakistani air defence and surveillance systems.</p>

<p>Over the last decade, India has imported military hardware worth $2.9 billion from Israel, including radars, surveillance and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909385">combat drones</a>, and missiles.</p>
<p>In 2019, India struck what it claimed was a ‚Äúterrorist training camp‚Äù in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1466149">Balakot</a> with Israeli-made Rafael SPICE ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1466845">smart bombs</a>‚Äù, though local residents in the area claimed nobody had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1466286/villagers-near-balakot-say-nobody-killed-or-injured-by-indian-aircraft">injured or killed</a>.</p></p>
