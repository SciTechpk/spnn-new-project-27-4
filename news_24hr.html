            <p><p>One person was killed while three were injured after militants carried out two quadcopter attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Wednesday, according to police.</p>
<p>The incident comes following reports of multiple quadcopter and drone attacks in KP and Balochistan over the past year. In March, at least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901160/11-killed-in-mardan-security-action">11 people</a> were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, while in May, a suspected quadcopter munitions drop <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912007/locals-stage-sit-in-as-kp-minister-denounces-killing-of-3-children-in-alleged-north-waziristan-drone-strike">claimed</a> the lives of four children and injured five others in North Waziristan District’s Mir Ali tehsil. The military <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912393/security-forces-falsely-implicated-in-north-waziristan-incident-ispr">clarified</a> that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “Two quadcopter incidents occurred in the district today.  In the first quadcopter attack by militants, one woman was killed while three children were injured, including two of the woman’s children.”</p>
<p>The woman’s body and the injured people were taken to the hospital for medical assistance, he added.</p>
<p>DPO Kulachi said that another quadcopter attack occurred where terrorists attacked the Meryan police station, damaging the station’s solar panels on the rooftop.</p>
<p>He said, “The police personnel remained safe in the attack,” adding that it was the third such militant attack on the same police station.</p>
<p>“A search operation was underway in the area to track down the terrorists,” he added.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities recently, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Bannu has seen several militant attacks over the past several months.</p>
<p>On Saturday, one person was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922294/jirga-member-killed-3-injured-by-armed-suspects-firing-in-bannu-police">killed</a> and three others were injured after armed assailants attacked a jirga in the district.</p>
<p>In March, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895956">16 terrorists</a> were killed while five soldiers were martyred as security forces responded to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895785">terrorist attack</a> on the Bannu Cantonment.</p>
<p>The incident resulted in the deaths of 13 civilians and injured 32 others after “severe destruction” of a mosque and a residential building due to the suicide blasts, causing the perimeter wall to partially collapse.</p></p>

            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday said Pakistan and Turkiye were pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) for Turkish entrepreneurs in Karachi.</p>
<p>The announcement came as Dar and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who arrived in Islamabad earlier today on an official visit. Turkiye’s Minister of National Defence Yasar Guler is also visiting Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Turkiye enjoy strong bilateral ties built on shared cultural, religious and historical bonds, as well as mutual respect. In February, the twocountries pledged to boost bilateral trade to $5 billion as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891671">visited</a> Islamabad.</p>
<p>“We are pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone dedicated to Turkish entrepreneurs at Karachi,” Dar said, as he addressed a press conference alongside Fidan.</p>

Fidan also <a class="link--external" href="https://www.mfa.gov.tr/turkiye-pakistan-relations.en.mfa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paid a visit</a> to Islamabad in May last year.</p>
<p>Fidan arrived in the early hours of Wednesday to hold discussions on bilateral issues, the Foreign Office <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1942683653701521616" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X.</p>

<p>“During his official engagements in Pakistan, all important issues of mutual interest will be discussed,” the FO said. “The visit reflects the close and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, rooted in shared history, culture, and mutual trust.”</p>
<p>It added that upon their arrival, the visiting dignitaries were received by Pakistan’s Additional Secretary for West Asia, Ambassador Syed Ali Asad Gillani.</p>

<p>Last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met on the sidelines of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) summit in Khankendi, Azerbaijan, to reaffirm their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties.</p>
<p>The two leaders <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/turkiye/efforts-ongoing-to-deepen-turkiye-pakistan-cooperation-in-various-fields-turkish-president/3622179" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discussed</a> deepening cooperation in key areas, including trade, energy, defence, connectivity and investment.

            <p><p>Chinese air force chief Lieutenant General Wang Gang has lauded the “exemplary performance” of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) during the Pakistan-India conflict in May.</p>
<p>As New Delhi launched deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a>, which Islamabad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">denied</a>, PAF <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">downed six</a> Indian jets in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">retaliation</a>. After tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>The praise from Lt Gen Gang came as a high-level defence delegation led by him called on PAF’s Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu at Air Headquarters in Islamabad, the military’s media affairs wing said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7346" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Lauding the professional acumen and strategic foresight of PAF’s leadership, the visiting dignitary paid rich tribute to the exemplary performance of Pakistan Air Force during the recent conflict with India,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) stated.</p>

<p>Gen Wang, chief of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (Plaaf), praised the “decisive and measured response delivered by PAF pilots under the resolute leadership of the air chief, describing it as a textbook example of precision, discipline and courage in the face of unprovoked aggression”.</p>
<p>During their meeting, the two air force heads discussed “matters of mutual interest, regional security dynamics and avenues of enhanced bilateral cooperation, particularly in the domain of airpower and operational synergy”.</p>
<p>During the conflict, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said the PAF <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909332#:~:text=air%20force%20used%20Chinese%20J%2D10C%20jets">used Chinese J-10C jets</a> in its response to India’s attack. However, China’s foreign ministry had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909435">said</a> it was “not familiar with the matter”.</p>
<p>On Monday, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922576/army-chief-dismisses-factually-incorrect-claims-of-external-input-in-operation-bunyanum-marsoos">rejected</a> India’s insinuation of direct Chinese support to Pak­­i­stan during the May conflict, calling it a “shoddy attempt” by New Delhi to repudiate Pakistan’s military capabilities.</p>
<p>According to a <em>Reuters</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-helped-pakistan-with-live-inputs-conflict-with-india-indian-army-deputy-2025-07-04/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>, Indian army’s Deputy Chief Lt Gen Rahul Singh of India’s army had alleged that China gave Islamabad “live inputs” on key Indian positions during the conflict and provided “all possible support”.</p>
<p>During the meeting today, Lt Gen Gang also expressed “deep appreciation for the high state of operational readiness and the cutting-edge capabilities” of the PAF, according to ISPR.</p>
<p>He was “particularly impressed by PAF’s seamless integration of multi-domain operations, terming it a hallmark of modern air warfare and conveyed Plaaf’s keen interest in learning from PAF’s battle-proven experience in multi-domain operations”.</p>
<p>The Plaaf chief was given a comprehensive briefing on PAF’s modern force structure, strategic initiatives and the evolution of its operational doctrine, the ISPR statement added.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Air Chief Marshal Sidhu also reaffirmed the “strong bond of friendship between the two air forces and reiterated PAF’s commitment to expanding cooperation in training, technology and operational domains”.</p>
<p>He extended a gracious welcome to the distinguished guests, reiterating that Pakistan and China enjoy historic and time-tested ties rooted in mutual trust, strategic convergence, and shared aspirations for regional peace and stability.</p>
<p>“The meeting stands as a testament to the shared resolve of Pakistan and China to advance their time-tested strategic partnership through deepened cooperation and innovation-driven collaboration,” the ISPR highlighted.</p>
<p>Last week, the air chief also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921677/air-chief-meets-senior-military-political-leadership-in-landmark-us-visit">met with</a> senior military and political leadership of the United States in the first official visit by a serving PAF air chief in “over a decade”.</p></p>
