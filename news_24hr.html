            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929938/coas-munir-terms-his-2nd-us-visit-a-new-era-in-islamabad-washington-ties' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir terms his 2nd US visit ‘a new era’ in Islamabad-Washington ties</strong></a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir termed his second visit to the United States in just 1.5 months a “new dimension” in ties between Washington and Islamabad, state-run <em>PTV News</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1954547015989313986" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on Sunday.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir is undertaking an official visit to the United States and has engaged in high-level interactions with senior political and military leadership, as well as members of the Pakistani diaspora, the military’s media wing said earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The visit comes shortly after he went to the US in June on a five-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917414">official visit</a>, where he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093/trump-coas-munir-talk-counterterrorism-and-trade-in-cordial-meeting-ispr">met</a> with US President Donald Trump over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">luncheon</a>, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.</p>
<p>Addressing members of the Pakistani diaspora in the US in Tampa city of Florida, Field Marshal Munir was quoted as having said: “My second visit after a gap of just one and a half months marks a new dimension in Pak-US relations.”</p>
<p>He added that the aim of these visits was to take the relations on a constructive, sustainable and positive path.</p>
<p>“It is an honour for me to address Pakistanis living in the US,” he said, adding, “Overseas Pakistanis are a source of pride and dignity and are as enthusiastic as other Pakistanis.”</p>
<p>Speaking on regional issues, the army chief said: “India wants to present itself as a ‘<em>Vishva Guru</em>’ (global teacher), but in practice, it is nothing like that.”</p>
<p>“The involvement of India’s intelligence agency, RAW [Research and Analysis Wing] in transnational terrorist activities is a cause of serious concern at the global level,” he added.</p>
<p>He cited the example of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1869510">killing</a> of a Sikh leader in Canada, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1801517">case</a> of eight Indian naval officers in Qatar, and incidents like <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904756">Kulbhushan Jadhav.</a></p>
<p>“Pakistan has fought a successful diplomatic war against India’s discriminatory and duplicitous policies,” Field Marshal Munir added.</p>
<p>Commenting on the recent conflict with India, he said: “This Indian aggression has brought the region to the brink of a dangerously flaming war, where any mistake would lead to a bilateral conflict.”</p>
<p>He also said that Pakistan was extremely grateful to US President Donald Trump, “whose strategic leadership has not only stopped the Pakistan-India war but also prevented many wars in the world.”</p>
<p>Speaking on the issue of Kashmir, He said: “Occupied Kashmir is not an internal matter of India but an unfinished international agenda. As the Quaid-e-Azam had said, Kashmir is the ‘jugular vein’ of Pakistan.”</p>
<p>He added that there were also UN Security Council resolutions on occupied Kashmir, and Pakistan fully supports these resolutions.</p>
<p>He also spoke on the topic of terrorism, saying: “Many terrorist organisations from Afghanistan, including <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em>, are active against Pakistan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna">Fitna al Khawarij</a> is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>He added that Pakistan’s progress and prosperity are linked to Pakistanis living around the world, saying, “Pakistan is currently the last bulwark against terrorism.”</p>
<p>“There is no sympathy for terrorists, and they will have to face justice with all their might,” he continued. “Pakistan is the last stronghold against terrorism at this time.”</p>
<p>The army chief said a potential trade deal with the United States is expected to bring significant investment.</p>
<p>“Pakistan has achieved remarkable successes on the international diplomatic front,” he added.</p>
<p>“Implementation is underway on several MoUs [memorandums of understanding] with the US, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and China, which will enhance economic cooperation and investment.”</p>
<p>He said Pakistanis living abroad are a source of dignity and pride, and they are as passionate and committed as those in Pakistan.</p>
<p>“Overseas Pakistanis are not a case of “brain drain” but rather a “brain gain.”</p>
<p>The COAS also said that social media today is a powerful platform, but “anti-state elements are using it to create engineered chaos”.</p>
<p>During the trip in June, Field Marshal Munir had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918382">stressed</a> the “immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect” with Washington.</p>
<p>Today’s <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7386" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on the visit said: “In Tampa, COAS attended the Retirement Ceremony of outgoing Commander United States Central Command (Centcom), General Michael E. Kurilla, and the Change of Command Ceremony marking the assumption of command by Admiral Brad Cooper.</p>

<p>“COAS lauded General Kurilla’s exemplary leadership and his invaluable contributions to strengthening bilateral military cooperation, and extended his best wishes to Admiral Cooper, expressing confidence in continued collaboration to address shared security challenges.</p>
<p>In June, Gen Kurilla hailed Pakistan as a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524/us-centcom-chief-lauds-phenomenal-partner-pakistan-in-counter-terrorism-efforts">phenomenal partner</a>” in the arena of counter-terrorism, citing their struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State.</p>
<p>The field marshal also met with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine, where matters of mutual professional interest were discussed and Munir extended an invitation to General Caine to visit Pakistan.</p>
<p>The army chief also interacted with the chiefs of defence from friendly nations on the sidelines of the meeting, ISPR said.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929989/mastung-blast-derails-6-bogies-as-jaffar-express-targeted-2nd-time-in-a-week' target='_blank'><strong>Mastung blast derails 6 bogies as Jaffar Express targeted 2nd time in a week</strong></a>
            <p><p>No loss of life was reported after a bomb blast on a railway track in Balochistan’s Mastung district derailed six bogies of the Jaffar Express, an official said on Sunday.</p>
<p>With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province’s transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train. Fortunately, there was no loss of life.”</p>
<p>The incident occurred near the Spezand station in Mastung’s Dasht tehsil, when the train was heading from Quetta to Peshawar City station with 350 passengers on board.</p>
<p>“Security forces and rescue teams rushed to the site as soon as they were alerted about the incident, and began a search operation after cordoning off the area,” Kashif said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Four bogies of the Jaffar Express had been placed back on the track, while efforts were underway to restore the other two,” the official noted.</p>
<p>A relief train of the Pakistan Railways brought the 350 passengers back to Quetta, while bogies stuck on the track will be returned to the city as well, according to a later statement from Kashif, who said that all tickets will be refunded.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, Kashif said the services of the Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail were suspended till August 14.</p>
<p>The Bolan Mail will resume its operations on August 16 (Saturday), when it will depart from Karachi “in its proper turn” and will arrive in Quetta the next day, he added.</p>
<p>Today’s incident comes just three days after Quetta-bound Jaffar Express <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929447">narrowly escaped</a> a disaster in Balochistan’s Sibi, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train passed.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In another near-miss incident on July 24, a powerful explosion ripped through the Quetta-Sibi rail section, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926300">damaging a bogie</a> of the Bolan Mail.</p>
<p>A July 28 derailment of the Jaffar Express train in Sindh’s Sukkur was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927185">initially attributed</a> to an explosion — even by government-run media — but the Ministry of Railways later said a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927307">technical fault</a> was the cause.</p>
<p>In June, a powerful explosion of a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks caused four bogies of the Jaffer Express to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917945">derail in Jacobabad</a>. No one was hurt in the incident.</p>
<p>In April, the 3UP train heading from Karachi to Quetta was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904018">stopped</a> at Jacobabad railway station due to security reasons.</p>
<p>Train services betw­een Quetta and the rest of the country were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900566">restored</a> on March 27, after they were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897306/all-trains-to-and-from-balochistan-suspended">suspended</a> due to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419">unprecedented hijacking</a> of the Pesha­war-bound Jaffar Express earlier that month.</p>
<p>The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897595/balochistan-standoff-ends-after-all-jaffar-express-hostages-rescued#:~:text=In%20all%2C%2021%20passengers%20lost%20their%20lives%2C%20while%20four%20FC%20personnel%20were%20martyred%2C%20the%20ISPR%20DG%20said.">21 passengers</a> and four security personnel. “All 33 terrorists” were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.</p></p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday evening received a telephone call from Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, who expressed his appreciation for Pakistan’s consistent support on the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh, a statement from the PM’s office said.</p>
<p>Azerbaijan and Armenia <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929655/azerbaijan-and-armenia-sign-peace-deal-at-white-house">signed</a> an initial US-brokered peace agreement during a meeting with President Donald Trump on Friday, a deal aimed at boosting economic ties between the two countries after decades of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897786">conflict</a>, the White House said.</p>
<p>The PM on Saturday hailed US President Donald Trump’s peace efforts following his role in brokering the Armenia-Azerbaijan peace deal, congratulating both countries on “charting a course for a peaceful future for their region” and stating: “Pakistan has always stood by the brotherly nation of Azerbaijan and we stand with them at this proud moment of their history.”</p>
<p>In a post on X, PM Shehbaz said that he had a phone call with Aliyev, where he conveyed warm felicitations to him and the people of Azerbaijan on the peace deal.</p>
<p>“Lauded him for his vision and statesmanship, and deeply appreciated President Donald Trump, who played the role of peace maker in facilitating this landmark agreement,” the prime minister wrote.</p>

<p>During today’s phone call, PM Shehbaz offered his warm felicitations to Aliyev and the people of Azerbaijan on the historic peace agreement and hailed Trump’s role in the peace process.</p>
<p>“During their warm and cordial telephone conversation, the prime minister lauded the visionary role of President Ilham Aliyev in bringing the three-decades-old conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia to a peaceful and mutually beneficial end, especially as it would usher in a new era of prosperity for the Caucasus,” the statement read.</p>
<p>“The prime minister particularly appreciated the role played by US President Donald Trump in facilitating this historic deal that would now bring peace and prosperity to the region.</p>
<p>“President Aliyev expressed deep appreciation for Pakistan’s longstanding and consistent support for Azerbaijan on the Karabakh issue,” the statement added.</p>
<p>“The prime minister responded that it has always been a matter of duty for the people of Pakistan to extend their support to their Azerbaijani brothers and sisters on this core issue and it was heartening to note that, under President Aliyev’s bold leadership and statesmanship, peace had finally been established in this region.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>Aliyev told PM Shehbaz that peaceful development in the region would create new opportunities for enhanced connectivity between Pakistan and Central Asia. The statement said that both leaders also expressed satisfaction with the positive trajectory of their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928393">bilateral cooperation</a>.</p>
<p>“While recalling their recent interactions in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913657">Lachin</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922079">Khankendi</a>, the prime minister reiterated his invitation to President Aliyev to undertake an official visit to Pakistan soon,” the statement added. “Both leaders are also expected to meet in Tianjin on the margins of the upcoming SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929105/modi-to-visit-china-for-first-time-in-7-years-as-tensions-with-us-rise#:~:text=China%20for%20a%20summit%20of%20the%20multilateral%20Shanghai%20Cooperation%20Organisation%20(SCO)%20that%20begins%20on%20Augst%2031">summit</a>.”</p>
<p>Armenia and Azerbaijan had been at odds since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh — a mountainous Azerbaijani region that had a mostly ethnic Armenian population — broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia.</p>
<p>Baku and Yerevan fought two wars for control of Azerbaijan’s Armenian-populated region of Nagorno Karabakh, at the end of the Soviet Union and again in 2020, before Azerbaijan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1778457">seized</a> the entire area in a 24-hour offensive in September 2023.</p></p>
