                <h2>BLA and TTP are Indian proxies, govt will prove India‚Äôs involvement in Khuzdar bus attack: Asif</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has said that two major terrorist groups operating in Pakistan were ‚ÄúIndian proxies‚Äù, adding that Islamabad will present ‚Äúcomplete evidence‚Äù to prove New Delhi‚Äôs involvement in the attack on a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912542/pm-vows-strong-action-against-perpetrators-after-school-bus-blast-in-khuzdar">school bus</a> in Balochistan‚Äôs Khuzdar district that killed three children and injured several others.</p>
<p>At least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others ‚Äî mostly students ‚Äî sustained injuries after a bomb targeted the bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.</p>
<p>The condition of at least a dozen is said to be serious due to critical injuries, officials <a class="link--external" href="https://https:/https://www.dawn.com/news/1912542/pm-vows-strong-action-against-perpetrators-after-school-bus-blast-in-khuzdar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>, adding that at least 15 girl students were among the injured. Security forces vowed to ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357/4-students-killed-several-injured-as-school-bus-comes-under-attack-in-khuzdar-dc">relentlessly pursue</a>‚Äù the culprits of the attack as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir visited the injured in Quetta yesterday.</p>
<p>Speaking on <em>Geo News</em> programme ‚ÄòAaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath‚Äô late on Wednesday, Asif asserted there was evidence that the proscribed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) was working as an Indian proxy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will present evidence of India‚Äôs involvement. We will corroborate whatever we have claimed,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúThe relation between BLA and India is well-known as their leadership is in New Delhi. The allegation against us was unsubstantiated but BLA is fighting like an Indian proxy,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>He was referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> last month in occupied Kashmir that killed 26 people, following which India, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">without evidence</a>, had blamed Pakistan for backing the attackers.</p>
<p>Asif further said, ‚ÄúBLA and TTP are Indian proxies. They have nothing to do with religion or nationalism, India is financing them and they‚Äôre involved in bloodshed here.‚Äù</p>
<p>In reply to a question on dealing with the situation, the minister said that ‚ÄúPakistan will strike with full force and there will be no leniency‚Äù, stressing that attacking non-combatants, including school children, was unacceptable.</p>
<p>Asif said Pakistan called for an investigation into the Pahalgam attack, which India didn‚Äôt agree to, adding that the world should be informed that the Narendra Modi-led regime was ‚Äúvery irresponsible for using a false incident as a pretext to wage a nuclear war‚Äù.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan ‚Äúwill not start nuclear confrontation but cannot stay silent if nuclear devices are thrown at us‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan showed restraint, but still India attacked our bases in the dark of the night,‚Äù he highlighted.</p>
<p>A day ago, the military‚Äôs media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), also said that ‚ÄúIndian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians‚Äù.</p>
<p>It noted that India had ‚Äúfailed‚Äù against Pakistan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/india-attacks-pakistans-air-bases-pakistan-retaliates#:~:text=Force.%20Pakistan%20Zindabad.%E2%80%9D-,Operations%20commence,-At%20around%203">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a> during the recent conflict, and its [proxies] were ‚Äúbeing hunted [down] by military and law enforcement agencies‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUse of terrorism as a state policy by [the] Indian political government is abhorrent and reflective of their low morality and disregard of <em>[sic]</em> basic human norms,‚Äù the ISPR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPlanners, abettors and executors of this cowardly Indian-sponsored attack will be hunted down and brought to justice and [the] heinous face of India will be exposed in front of the entire world,‚Äù the military vowed.</p>

<p>On Monday, the ISPR said <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005/3-terrorists-of-indian-proxy-blf-killed-in-balochistan-engagements-ispr">12 terrorists</a> of ‚ÄúIndian proxy‚Äù outfits were killed by security forces in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.</p>
<p>Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said India was activating its ‚Äúassets‚Äù to inte¬≠nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan. He had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">detailed the arrest</a> of a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India as ‚Äúirr¬≠e¬≠futable evidence‚Äù of state-sponsored terrorism directed by Ind¬≠ian military personnel.</p>

<p>In a separate development, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912541">trilateral meeting</a> between China, Pakistan and Afghanistan, all sides agreed that their soil would not be used for cross-border terrorism.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, Dar discussed the possibility of increasing diplomatic engagement with Kabul, referring to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912541">statement</a> by Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. He said, ‚ÄúWe will look into all these aspects. I fully support the idea that we should settle issues with all neighbours. The core principle should be that there should be no terrorism from other countries.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that he had categorically stated the position that ‚Äúwe will not tolerate terrorism‚Äù during his visit to Afghanistan. ‚ÄúYou should not allow use of your soil and we will not allow our soil,‚Äù he added, referring to his talks with Afghan Taliban leaders.</p>
<p>Dar also said, ‚ÄúThe government has a clear resolve. We will deal with terrorism the same way we dealt in 2013 and 2018.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Chinese interest also lies in this. [‚Ä¶] This was also discussed in the trilateral meeting,‚Äù the deputy premier said, referring to the recent moot in China.</p>

<p>The foreign minister further said that in his meeting with Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, the latter offered condolences for the Pakistani lives lost during the recent conflict with India.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe reaffirmed that Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty, territorial integrity and its dignity were very close to them [China],‚Äù Dar said.</p>
<p>Dar highlighted that China agreed the Kashmir issue should be resolved according to the UN resolutions, adding that Beijing, like Islamabad, believed that a major reason for the tension in the region was the Kashmir dispute.</p>

                <h2>Saudi govt launches health awareness kits for Haj pilgrims</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Saudi Arabia‚Äôs health ministry on Thursday launched a health awareness kit, including one in <a class="link--external" href="https://www.moh.gov.sa/HealthAwareness/Pilgrims_Health/Pages/Pilgrims-Health-Urdu.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Urdu</a>, to promote the health and well-being of Haj pilgrims.</p>
<p>Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870331">highest</a> Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/SaudiMOH/status/1922983435066282471" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the Saudi health ministry said that the kit was available in eight languages. ‚ÄúIn all languages, we care about pilgrims‚Äô health.

<p>The multilingual kit contained essential information for pilgrims, such as: preventing heat-related illnesses and managing health in extreme conditions, required vaccinations (meningitis, Covid-19, polio and yellow fever), managing chronic diseases, and accessing free health services during Haj. It also included short videos, social media assets, and printable posters.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Saudi Arabia <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884916/pakistan-saudi-arabia-sign-annual-agreement-for-nearly-180000-citizens-to-perform-haj-in-2025">signed</a> the annual Haj agreement in January, which would see 179,210 Pakistani pilgrims perform Haj this year.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the Pakistan Haj Mission <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911588">welcomed</a> 38,229 pilgrims in Saudi Arabia (Madina and Makkah) under the government scheme since the start of the month-long pre-Haj flight operation on April 29.</p>

<p>The religious gathering has seen a high number of fatalities in recent years, with the number of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1841601">deaths</a> during last year‚Äôs Haj pilgrimage totalling 1,301 people. Saudi Arabia‚Äôs health minister had said that deaths were caused by pilgrims ‚Äúwalking long distances under direct sunlight without adequate shelter or comfort‚Äù.</p>
<p>At least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1840771/35-pakistanis-among-900-perished-during-haj">35 Pakistanis</a> were reported to be among those who died during the pilgrimage in 2024.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911444">introduced</a> additional facilities for pilgrims such as air-conditioned Mina tents, family-friendly accommodations, optimised luggage systems and high-quality transportation.</p>
<p>To safeguard the health and well-being of pilgrims, around 400 medical and paramedical officers would be deployed across dedicated healthcare facilities. These include one well-equipped hospital and nine dispensaries in Makkah, along with one hospital and two dispensaries in Madinah.</p></p>
