                <h2>Pakistani passport still ranked among ‘weakest’ despite improvement</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: While the passports of other Asian countries have emerged as the most powerful in the world, Pakistan’s travel document continues to be ranked among the ‘weakest’ in the world, with visa-free access available to only 32 destinations.</p>
<p>According to the Henley Passport Index for 2025, Pakistan currently ranks 96th on the list — ahead of the war-torn nations of Somalia, Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Although still quite low, the country’s ranking has improved slightly; in 2024, the Pakistani passport was tied with Yemen as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847754">fourth-worst</a> in the world for the fourth consecutive year.</p>
<p>The Henley Passport Index compares the visa-free access of 199 different passports to 227 travel destinations, and ranks all the world’s passports based on the number of destinations their holders can enter without a prior visa.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Singapore, Japan and South Korea top the list; Afghanistan placed at the bottom</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If no visa is required, then that passport is given a score value of 1. The same applies if you can obtain a visa on arrival (VOA), a visitor’s permit, or an electronic travel authority (ETA) when entering the destination.</p>
<p>Where a visa is required, or where a passport holder has to obtain a government-approved electronic visa (e-Visa) before departure, a score with value of 0 is assigned. This also applies if you need pre-departure government approval for a visa on arrival.</p>
<p>The total score for each passport is equal to the number of destinations for which no visa is required.</p>
<p>Singapore occupies the top spot, with Japan and South Korea sharing second place on the index. Seven EU passports share 3rd place — Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Spain.</p>
<p>Another seven-nation Euro­pean cohort are joint 4th — Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Neth­erlands, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden. Meanwhile, New Zealand is tied for 5th place with Greece and Switzerland.</p>
<p>The UK and US have each dropped a place in the global passport rankings since January, continuing a long-term downward trend. Once the most powerful passports in the world — the UK in 2015 and the US in 2014 — they now rank 6th and 10th, respectively.</p>
<p>India has recorded the largest jump in ranking over the past six months, climbing eight places from 85th to 77th. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has made the biggest gain in visa-free access.</p>
<p>The UAE continues to be a standout among the top risers, shooting up 34 places over the last 10 years from 42nd to 8th place, making it the only big riser to break into the Top 10 in the ranking.</p>
<p>Another notable country is China, also rising 34 places from 94th to 60th since 2015 — particularly impressive considering that it has not yet gained visa-free access to Europe’s Schengen Area.</p>

            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926220/columbia-university-to-pay-over-200m-to-resolve-trump-probes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <h2>Columbia University to pay over $200m to resolve Trump probes</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Columbia University said on Wednesday it will pay $200 million to the US government after President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915741">threatened to pull</a> federal funding over what he said was its unwillingness to protect Jewish students.</p>
<p>In a sweeping deal that will restore the prestigious New York institution’s federal monies, Columbia has pledged to obey rules that bar it from taking race into consideration in admissions or hiring, among other concessions.</p>
<p>“Columbia University has reached an agreement with the United States government to resolve multiple federal agency investigations into alleged violations of federal anti-discrimination laws,” <a class="link--external" href="https://president.columbia.edu/content/our-resolution-federal-government" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement said</a>, adding that the $200m would be paid over three years.</p>
<p>The university will also pay $21m to settle investigations brought by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, it said.</p>
<p>“Under today’s agreement, a vast majority of the federal grants which were terminated or paused in March 2025 will be reinstated and Columbia’s access to billions of dollars in current and future grants will be restored,” the statement said.</p>
<p>The promise of the federal funding spigot reopening offers relief for the university, which was under growing financial pressure, despite a comfortable endowment and a reputation it can bank on.</p>
<p>The agreement also represents a victory for Trump, who has repeatedly claimed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912827">elite universities</a> brainwash students against his nationalist ideas with left-wing bias.</p>
<p>Thanking Columbia for “agreeing to do what is right,” Trump warned in a social media post that “numerous other Higher Education Institutions that have hurt so many, and been so unfair and unjust… are upcoming.”</p>
<p>The centuries-old Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is also in a fight with the administration over Trump’s threats to rip away federal funding, and Wednesday’s carefully worded agreement — in which Columbia admitted no wrongdoing — could offer a framework for future deals.</p>
<p>“This agreement marks an important step forward after a period of sustained federal scrutiny and institutional uncertainty,” Columbia’s acting president Claire Shipman said.</p>
<p>“The settlement was carefully crafted to protect the values that define us and allow our essential research partnership with the federal government to get back on track.</p>
<p>“Importantly, it safeguards our independence, a critical condition for academic excellence and scholarly exploration, work that is vital to the public interest.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#disciplinary-actions" id="disciplinary-actions" title="Permalink"></a>Disciplinary actions</h2>
<p>Under the settlement, Columbia will maintain a security force to prevent <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1192400">demonstrations</a> in academic spaces, such as those that rocked the campus last year when pro-Palestinian protestors clashed with law enforcement and occupied university buildings.</p>
<p>The school also agreed to “promptly provide” federal authorities with any requested information on “disciplinary actions involving student visa-holders resulting in expulsions or suspensions, and arrest records that Columbia is aware of for criminal activity, including trespass or other violation of law.”</p>
<p>Columbia found itself at the centre of a firestorm last year over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1828969">claims of anti-Semitism</a> triggered by campus protests against Israel’s conflict in Gaza.</p>
<p>Some Jewish students claimed they were intimidated and that authorities did not act to protect them.</p>
<p>The school announced a wave of various student punishments on Tuesday, including expulsions and degree revocations, against nearly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1926027">80 students</a> involved in the pro-Palestinian protest movement that has called on the university to divest from Israel.</p>
<p>“Our institution must focus on delivering on its academic mission for our community,” Columbia said <a class="link--external" href="https://communications.news.columbia.edu/news/university-statement-ujb-determinations-butler-library-disruption-and-alumni-weekend" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement</a> about student protests on its campus.</p>
<p>“Disruptions to academic activities are in violation of University policies and rules, and such violations will necessarily generate consequences.”</p>
<p>While the university appears to be acquiescing to the Trump administration’s demands to quash student protest, one of the most prominent leaders of the US pro-Palestinian campus protests is still raising his voice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919637">Mahmoud Khalil</a>, a Columbia University graduate active in campus demonstrations, has sued the Trump administration for $20m over his arrest and detention by immigration agents.</p>
<p>Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States who is married to a US citizen, missed the birth of his son while being held in a federal immigration detention centre in Louisiana.</p>
<p>He called the lawsuit a “first step towards accountability.”</p></p>
