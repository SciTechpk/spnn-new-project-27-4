            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625/trump-says-us-stopped-pak-india-nuclear-war' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says US stopped Pak-India ‘nuclear war’</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Offers trade boost if both nations continue to engage in dialogue<br />
• Modi warns New Delhi will not tolerate ‘nuclear blackmail’<br />
• Khawaja Asif says future talks to focus on Kashmir, terrorism and water<br />
• Asserts any attempt to deprive Pakistan of its water rights will never be allowed</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: Amid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910185/normality-returns-as-nuclear-armed-neighbours-step-back-from-the-brink">easing tensions</a> following a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> bet­ween India and Pakistan, Presi­dent Donald Trump has claimed that US intervention prevented a “bad nuclear war” between the two nations, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a televised address to the nation asserted that New Delhi would not tolerate “nuclear blackmail” in the event of further conflict with Islamabad.</p>
<p>Trump’s comments, made during a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2Ftw_VuedA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press interaction</a> at the White House, signal a rare moment of US diplomatic mediation bet­ween the two South Asian nuclear powers and suggest a broader Ameri­can strategy that ties peace to economic engagement.</p>
<p>“We stopped a nuclear conflict. I think it could have been a bad nuclear war. Millions of people could have been killed,” Trump said while talking to reporters.</p>
<p>This is perhaps one of the starkest warnings yet from the US leader, who has rarely minced words in highlighting global security threats. His remarks reflect Washing­ton’s growing concern about the fragile peace between India and Pakistan, both of whom possess significant nuclear arsenals and a long history of military confrontations.</p>
<p>In a tone that combined both reassurance and transactional diplomacy, Trump added that the United States is prepared to enhance trade with both countries — if they continue to engage in dialogue. “We’re going to do a lot of trade with Pakistan. We’re going to do a lot of trade with India. We’re negotiating with India right now. We’re going to be soon negotiating with Pakistan,” he said, linking the prospect of economic cooperation to continued regional stability.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Trump, who appeared eager to underscore his adm­inistration’s peacemaking role, said: “On Sat­u­rday, my administration helped broker an immediate ceasefire, I think a maybe permanent one bet­ween India and Pakistan — the countries having a lot of nuclear weapons.”</p>
<p>His assertion, while dramatic, underscores the high stakes involved in this latest confrontation and his belief that trade can be a powerful tool of diplomacy.</p>
<p>He also praised the leadership of both countries for their roles in defusing the situation. “I’m very proud to let you know that the leadership of India and Pakistan was unwavering and powerful, but unwavering in both cases — they really were from the standpoint of having the strength and the wisdom and fortitude to fully know and to understand the gravity of the situation,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump also offered a unique insight into how he leveraged economic incentives to push both sides toward de-escalation.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“We helped a lot, and we also helped with trade. I said ‘Come on, we’re going to do a lot of trade with you guys. Let’s stop it, let’s stop it. If you stop it, we’re doing trade’,” he said. He then added: “If you don’t stop it, we’re not going to do any trade. People have never really used trade the way I used it. By that, I can tell you, and all of a sudden they said. I think we’re gonna stop, and they have.”</p>
<p>In concluding his remarks, the president emphasised once again the magnitude of what he believed had been averted. “We stopped a nuclear conflict,” he declared, before offering thanks to members of his administration. “I also want to thank VP JD Vance and Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, for their work,” he said, crediting them for helping facilitate the peace process.</p>
<p>While the claims made by President Trump will be scrutinised in Washington and South Asia, they do indicate a willingness on the part of the US to reassert its role as a mediator in global conflicts. Whether these efforts translate into a lasting peace between India and Pak­i­stan, however, remains to be seen.</p>
<p><strong>‘Nuclear blackmail’</strong></p>
<p>Indian PM Modi vowed on Monday to respond strongly to any future “terrorist attack”, and cautioned that India would not succumb to ‘nuclear blackmail’ in the face of future provocations.</p>
<p>A weekend ceasefire which Trump said he brokered appeared to be holding on Monday after four days of intense jet fighter, missile, drone and artillery attacks — the worst violence between the two nuclear-armed neighbours since 1999.</p>
<p>The conflict followed an April 22 attack on tourists in Pahalgam, in India-held Kashmir, which killed 26 civilians.</p>
<p>Modi, in a televised address to the nation — his first since hostilities began last Wednesday — said Pakistan has chosen to attack rather than help it fight “terrorism”. “If another terrorist attack against India is carried out, a strong response will be given.”</p>
<p>“India’s stand is very clear. Terror and talks cannot go together… Terror and trade cannot go together… Water and blood cannot flow together.”</p>
<p>Pakistan had strongly denied having any role in the attack on tourists in India-held Kashmir, and has repeatedly asked New Delhi for sharing any evidence.</p>
<p>Proclaiming victory in the short and bitter standoff in which foreign media reported the downing of several Indian warplanes, including the highly rated French-made Rafale jets, and Indian military claiming hitting what it called terrorist targets in Pakistan, Modi said it would be the new normal against terrorism.</p>
<p>India launched a missile barrage against Pakistan on May 7, but remained silent about the downing of its estimated five warplanes in response.</p>
<p>The Indian PM underplayed the role of foreign interlocutors in brokering the ceasefire. “And I am repeating again, we have just postponed our retaliatory action on Pakistan’s terrorist and military bases. In the coming days, we will measure every step of Pakistan on the basis of what attitude it adopts.”</p>
<p><strong>Three key issues</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday that any future talks with India would focus on three key issues — Kashmir, terrorism and water.</p>
<p>In an exclusive talk with a private news channel, he said India’s arrogance is the main reason why these matters remain unresolved. Kashmir can be resolved under UN resolutions, but India’s stubbornness is the hurdle, he added.</p>
<p>The minister stated that terrorism has affected Pakistan for decades, and there is solid evidence of India’s involvement in sponsoring terror activities inside the country. India had violated the Indus Water Treaty, he said, adding that an attempt to deprive Pakistan of its water rights will never be allowed.</p>
<p>Mr Asif emphasised the world has recognised Pakistan’s military readiness and its responsible approach in times of conflict.</p>

            <p><p>• DGMOs from both sides hold ‘initial round’ of talks to reinforce truce<br />
• Dar says second round to follow within two days<br />
• COAS calls conflict ‘defining chapter in the country’s military history’ as ISPR rejects reports of ceasefire breach</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistani and Indian senior military officials on Monday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910567/pak-india-dgmos-discuss-ceasefire-in-1st-round-of-talks">agreed</a> to uphold the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910113/world-community-hails-ceasefire-decision-between-pakistan-and-india">ceasefire</a> reached last week and reduce troop deployments along the international border, following days of hostilities between the two countries that had raised fears of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625/trump-says-us-stopped-pak-india-nuclear-war">wider conflict</a>.</p>
<p>The directors general of military operations (DGMOs) from both countries held a scheduled conversation at 4:30pm that lasted about 45 minutes. The discussion was originally scheduled for noon, but was postponed till afternoon — the delay was attributed by some sources to a difference over the agenda of the meeting.</p>
<p>The two officers — Pakis­tan’s Maj Gen Kashif Abdul­lah and India’s Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai — discussed measures to reinforce their mutual co­mmitment not to fire or eng­age in any aggressive or in­imical actions, according to Indian authorities. There was no official statement r­eleased by the Pakistan Army regarding the meeting.</p>
<p>In addition to reaffirming the ceasefire, the two sides reportedly agreed to pursue immediate steps to reduce troop presence along the borders and forward areas, which is seen as a significant move amid fragile calm after a four-day flare-up from May 7 to May 10.</p>
<p>Pakistani officials described the conversation as the initial round of talks after the ceasefire took effect. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that the DGMOs are expected to have another round of talks within 48 hours for further discussions.</p>
<p>In peacetime, Pakistan and India typically station border security forces — the Pakistan Rangers and India’s Border Security Force, respectively — along the international border, while regular army troops remain in nearby cantonments for rapid deployment if needed. Under the existing terms of engagement, helicopters are restricted from flying within 1 kilometre of the border, and combat jets must remain at least 10 kilometres away.</p>
<p>During heightened tensions, both countries activate wartime formations, repositioning offensive and defensive units closer to the border. After escalation, defensive formations occupy positions on border, whereas offensive forces get into ‘concentration areas’ — usually behind the front lines, where units gather, assemble, and prepare before launching an attack or advancing, according to deployment contingencies. The same happened during this crisis. This understanding reached at the DGMOs interaction implies that some of the troops would move back to their peacetime locations. Pakistan’s defensive units are assigned specific sectors, while its offensive formations operate flexibly, without a pre-designated area of responsibility.</p>
<p>The latest contact between DGMOs comes after both countries agreed on May 10 to a “full and immediate ceasefire” following a sharp escalation that included drone and missile attacks, artillery fire, and airbase strikes. The violence was triggered by India’s May 7 aggression against Pakistan on the pretext of April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Indian-Occupied Kashmir. Pakistani armed military responded with ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’.</p>
<p>Though the ceasefire was brokered through high-level US mediation, violations were reported just hours after the agreement took effect. Both sides blamed each other for the breaches and Monday’s meeting aimed to reinforce the fragile truce.</p>
<p>On Monday night, the army’s media wing responded to reports in the Indian media, saying that Pakistani forces were fully abiding by the ceasefire. It rejected Indian allegations regarding the violation of the ceasefire.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a televised speech, said India had “suspended retaliatory action” but warned that future conduct would be judged by Pakistan’s posture. “We will measure every step of Pakistan on the criterion that what sort of attitude Pakistan will adopt ahead,” he said.</p>
<p>In a detailed statement, Pakistan’s military described Operation Bunyan un Marsoos as a “textbook demonstration” of tri-services integration across land, air, sea, and cyber domains, delivering precision strikes against Indian military targets.</p>
<p>The operation employed long-range missiles, drones, and cyber warfare to hit 26 key installations in Indian-occupied Kashmir and mainland India, including air force bases, logistics hubs, command centres, and missile storage facilities, the Inter-Services Public Relations said in its statement. “Pakistan Armed Forces possess an ‘adequate’ suite of very sophisticated ‘niche military technologies’, and only a limited number and type were used with restraint in this conflict,” it maintained.</p>
<p>The ISPR emphasised that the operation was “precise, proportionate, and remarkably restrained,” targeting only those directly involved in attacks on Pakistani civilians.</p>
<p>“No hostile design can erode the determination of the Armed Forces of Pakistan,” army chief Gen Asim Munir said during a visit to injured personnel at CMH Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>“The resolute and unified response exhibited during Marka-i-Haq /Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, in concert with the steadfast support of the Pakistani people, constitutes a defining chapter in the country’s military history.”</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910621/psl-resumption-hinges-on-foreign-players-return' target='_blank'><strong>PSL resumption hinges on foreign players’ return</strong></a>
            <p><p>• PCB to make a decision after franchises’ report<br />
• Organisers plan remaining eight matches from May 17 to 25</p>
<p>LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is aiming to hold the remaining eight matches of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909572/psl-to-be-held-in-dubai-as-tensions-escalate">Pakistan Super League</a> — postponed due to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910567/pak-india-dgmos-discuss-ceasefire-in-1st-round-of-talks">conflict</a> with India — from May 17 provided foreign players return to the country.</p>
<p>The six franchises have reached out to players, who were flown from the country on a charter flight over the weekend as the cross-border skirmishes with India intensified last week, to return after a ceasefire agreement was reached.</p>
<p>“The franchises are in negotiations with their foreign players regarding the tentative dates of May 17 to 25 with Raw­a­lpindi proposed to be the ve­nue for the remaining matc­hes,” sour­ces told <em>Dawn</em> on Monday.</p>
<p>The PSL was first moved to the UAE and subsequently postponed after an Indian drone crashed close to the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium last week.</p>
<p>“As soon as the franchises confirm the availability of the foreign players, the PCB will announce the schedule of the remaining matches after getting the approval from chairman Mohsin Naqvi,” sources added.</p>
<p>On Monday morning, the PCB chief had told reporters that “a decision regarding the PSL would be taken by the evening”.</p>
<p>Sources added there will be “more clarity by Wednesday morning as the PCB is awaiting replies from the six franchises to confirm if their foreign players are available or not”.</p>
<p>“Only the availability of the players is a hurdle and there is no issue with the broadcasters as they could make arrangements in a few days.”</p>
<p>With no international cricket during the proposed window, the PCB remains hopeful that the foreign players will return.</p>
<p>However, reports suggest Australian players might not be open to the idea of returning to Pakistan or India, which also saw its T20 tournament — the Indian Premier League — suspended due to the escalating hostilities.</p>
<p>While most Australian players in both countries left for home, former Australia batter Ricky Ponting — now coach of IPL side Punjab Kings — deboarded his flight home following the ceasefire agreement.</p>
<p>The Board of Control for Cricket (BCCI) in India anno­unced on Monday that the IPL will resume from May 17.</p>
<p>“After extensive consultations with government and security agencies, and with all the key stakeholders, the Board has decided to proceed with the remainder of the season,” the BCCI said in a statement.</p>
<p>The tentative window for the resumption of the PSL sees an overlap with Bangla­desh’s upcoming tour to Pak­is­tan, with the two teams slated to meet in the first Twenty20 International on May 25.</p>
<p>The Bangladesh Cricket Board said on Sunday that it would make a decision regarding the tour after “careful consideration of the current situation in Pakistan”.</p>
<p>On Monday, Bangladesh’s T20 skipper Litton Das told reporters that the fate of the tour will be decided between the PCB and the BCB.</p>
<p>Bangladesh spinner Rishad Hossain and pacer Nahid Rana were involved in the PSL before they returned to Dhaka on Saturday.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Rishad issued a public apology after his comments about fellow Lahore Qalandars teammates Daryl Mitchell and Tom Curran sparked confusion and controversy.</p>
<p>Hossain had given a brief interview at Dubai airport where he had claimed that several overseas players, including Mitchell and Curran, were visibly frightened.</p>
<p>He quoted New Zealand’s Mitchell as saying he wouldn’t return to Pakistan, and described Englishman Curran as “crying like a child” during tense moments following nearby explosions in Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>The remarks quickly circulated online, prompting criticism and concern.</p>
<p>“I’m aware that a recent comment I made has caused confusion and has unfortunately been misrepresented in the media creating a false perception,” he said on social media.</p>
<p>“The comment was made during a brief interview with Bangladeshi journalists while I was in transit at Dubai airport. It lacked full context and unintentionally overstated the emotions involved.</p>
<p>“I sincerely regret any misunderstanding it may have caused. I’ve offered an unconditional apology to Daryl Mitchell and Tom Curran. I hold deep respect for my fellow teammates and truly value the Qalandars brotherhood — where we always stand by one another, no matter what.</p>
<p>“I look forward to rejoining my team when the Pakistan Super League resumes.”</p>
<p>Mitchell, who has also featured in the IPL, had earlier refuted Hossain’s claims.</p>
<p>“Both the PSL and IPL have played major roles in my career, and I’ve always cherished my time in both tournaments,” he said. “I hope peace prevails and we can get back to playing the game we love and continue giving back to the amazing people who support us.”</p>
