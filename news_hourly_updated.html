                <h2>SC dismisses PTI petitions, making party ineligible for reserved seats</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Supreme Court‚Äôs Constitutional Bench on Friday dismissed the petitions filed by the PTI in the reserved seats case, declaring that the party will not be eligible for them in the national and provincial assemblies.</p>
<p>The verdict came as an 11-member bench of the SC, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, resumed the hearing of the reserved seats case today. However, Justice Salahuddin Panhwar recused himself. The bench previously had 13 members, but  Ayesha A. Malik and  Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had declared the applications inadmissible and were not part of the subsequent proceedings, with the CB head judge noting they had stepped back voluntarily.</p>
<p>Among the remaining 10 members, the review petitions were accepted by a majority of seven judges, including Justices Aminuddin Khan, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhter Afghan, Shahid Bilal Hassan, Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi. The judges who rejected the petitions today included Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi.</p>
<p>As part of the verdict, the SC upheld the Peshawar High Court‚Äôs March 2024 decision and set aside its own July 2024 ruling. As a result, the PTI‚Äôs petitions were dismissed, rendering the party ineligible for the 39 reserved seats.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor detailed reasons to be recorded later, by majority of seven, all civil review petitions are allowed and the impugned majority judgment dated July 12, 2024, is set aside,‚Äù the short order of today‚Äôs verdict, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, noted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs a consequence thereof, Civil Appeals number 333 of 2024 and 334 of 2024 filed by the SIC are dismissed and the judgment rendered by the Peshawar High Court is restored.‚Äù</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail partly allowed the review petitions and maintained his original order with regard to 39 seats, but reviewed the majority judgment to the extent of the remaining 41 seats.</p>
<p>The court instructed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to examine and consider the nomination and declaration appers, as well as any other relevant documents, of all 80 returned candidates ‚Äúby means of de novo exercise with regard to their affiliation and take appropriate decision in accordance with law and applicable rules for allocation of reserve seats‚Äù.</p>
<p>The ECP has 15 days from receiving the copy of the short order to carry out the court‚Äôs instructions.</p>

<p>PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Khan said he was disappointed by the ‚Äúinjustice and the violation of the Constitution.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm disappointed. This is a huge injustice. For the PTI, it seems that the shadow of Qazi Faez Esa still lurks in the Supreme Court,‚Äù he said while speaking to <em>Geo News.</em></p>
<p>‚ÄúThe right that has been snatched from us is a huge injustice. The framers of the Constitution could not have imagined that a party would get more seats than it won.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said the PTI deserved to receive 78 reserved seats, including 66 for women and 11 for non-Muslims. ‚ÄúThey belong to the PTI, and it is their right,‚Äù he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Gohar went on to say that the PTI contested elections from across the country and joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) as per the affidavit by the ECP for an independent candidate to join a political party.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is no further legal recourse, but we will protest the decision in the assemblies and all forums against this injustice,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>PTI leader Salman Akram Raja also criticised the verdict in a post on X, stating that the party contested the election and received votes ‚Äúonly because we were contesting under Imran Khan‚Äôs banner‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo deny the existence of PTI is to deny the people their voice,‚Äù he wrote.</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#phc-2024-decision" id="phc-2024-decision" title="Permalink"></a>PHC 2024 decision</h2>
<p>In March 2024, the PHC had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1821427">dismissed</a> the SIC‚Äôs petition challenging the election regulator‚Äôs decision to reject the party allocation of reserved women and minority seats.</p>
<p>In a 4-1 verdict, the electoral watchdog ruled that the SIC was not entitled to claim quota for reserved seats ‚Äúdue to having non-curable legal defects and violation of a mandatory provision of submission of party list for reserved seats, which is the requirement of law‚Äù.</p>
<p>The SIC ‚Äî joined by PTI-backed independents who won the elections sans their electoral symbol ‚Äî had filed the petition through its chairman, Sahibzada Muhammad Hamid Raza, seeking directives of the court for the ECP to allocate reserved seats to the council based on their strength in the national and provincial assemblies.</p>
<p>The commission had also decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the PML-N and the PPP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1819514/pml-n-gets-lucky-as-reserved-seats-doled-out">becoming major beneficiaries</a>. The decision was challenged by the PTI in the top court.</p>
<p>On July 13, the apex court, in a unique majority <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">verdict</a>, declared the PTI eligible to receive reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the national and provincial assemblies, giving it a new lease of life in the legislature by declaring it to be a parliamentary party.</p>
<p>However, the ruling was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1868333">not implemented</a> by the National Assembly, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had raised some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859716">objections</a>. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1846084">PML-N</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847508/ppp-takes-cue-from-pml-n-files-review-petition-on-sc-reserved-seats-verdict">PPP</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850678#:~:text=ECP%20files%20review%20plea">ECP</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#todays-hearing" id="todays-hearing" title="Permalink"></a>Today‚Äôs hearing</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, as the Supreme Court resumed hearing the review petitions in the reserved seats case, Justice Panhwar recused himself from the bench after SIC counsel Hamid Khan raised an objection.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHamid Khan objected to judges who joined the Supreme Court after the 26th Amendment being part of the bench,‚Äù Justice Panhwar said, adding that he himself was among those judges.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPublic trust in the judiciary is crucial,‚Äù he remarked. ‚ÄúIt is important that no party questions the composition of the bench. Given these objections, I cannot remain part of this bench.‚Äù</p>
<p>Hamid responded by saying he appreciated the recusal, prompting a stern exchange. Justice Aminuddin remarked, ‚ÄúThere is no need for appreciation. This is the result of your conduct.‚Äù</p>
<p>Justice Mazahir Ali Akbar Naqvi added, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre listening to you out of respect. Otherwise, we were not bound to do so. Don‚Äôt misuse the opportunity you‚Äôve been given.‚Äù</p>
<p>Following Justice Panhwar‚Äôs withdrawal, SIC‚Äôs counsel raised a fresh objection ‚Äî this time to the constitution of the 10-member bench itself.</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail questioned the legal basis for the objection, asserting that the 10-member bench would continue hearing the case.</p>
<p>When asked to clarify, Hamid stated, ‚ÄúI object to a 12-member bench reviewing the decision of a 13-member bench.‚Äù</p>
<p>Justice Aminuddin dismissed the objection and directed him to proceed with his arguments.</p></p>

                <h2>Pakistan hails Hague court‚Äôs supplemental award in Indus Waters case, says India can‚Äôt sideline arbitration process</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan on Friday welcomed the decision by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague to issue a ‚ÄúSupplemental Award of Competence‚Äù in the Indus Waters case, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance, a statement issued by the government said.</p>
<p>According to the PCA‚Äôs rules, a supplemental award is an additional ruling issued by a court or tribunal after its initial decision, usually to address a specific issue that wasn‚Äôt fully resolved or to clarify certain points, such as jurisdiction, competence, or interpretation of a treaty or agreement.</p>
<p>India in April held the Indus Waters Treaty <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">in abeyance</a> following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam that killed 26 ‚Äî an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">termed</a> any attempt to suspend its water share an ‚Äúact of war‚Äù, noting the <a class="link--external" href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTs/Volume%20419/volume-419-I-6032-English.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IWT</a> had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907454">considering</a> court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.</p>
<p>According to the government‚Äôs statement, Pakistan welcomed the PCA‚Äôs decision and stated that the court affirmed its competence despite India‚Äôs unilateral action against the IWT.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan looks forward to receiving the Court‚Äôs Award on the First Phase on the Merits in due course following the hearing that was held in Peace Palace in The Hague in July 2024,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe high priority, at this point, is that India and Pakistan find a way back to a meaningful dialogue, including on the application of the Indus Waters Treaty,‚Äù the government said, reiterating remarks made by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that Pakistan was ‚Äúready to engage in a meaningful dialogue with India on all outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism‚Äù.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Indian Ministry for External Affairs (MEA) ‚Äúcategorically rejected‚Äù the PCA‚Äôs supplemental award and stated that it did not recognise the court itself, according to Indian newspaper <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-categorically-rejects-court-of-arbitrations-supplemental-award-on-kishenganga-ratle-hydropower-projects/article69745841.ece" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Hindu</a></em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia has never recognised the existence in law of this so-called Court of Arbitration, and India‚Äôs position has all along been that the constitution of this so-called arbitral body is in itself a serious breach of the Indus Waters Treaty and consequently any proceedings before this forum and any award or decision taken by it are also for that reason illegal and per se void,‚Äù the ministry maintained.</p>
<p>According to <em>The Hindu</em>, the MEA said that after the Pahalgam attack, India exercised ‚Äúits rights as a sovereign nation under international law‚Äù and placed the IWT in abeyance ‚Äúuntil Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism‚Äù. The ministry additionally described the Court of Arbitration‚Äôs latest declarations as a ‚Äúcharade at Pakistan‚Äôs behest‚Äù.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#the-treaty-remains-in-force" id="the-treaty-remains-in-force" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòThe treaty remains in force‚Äô</h2>
<p>According to a <a class="link--external" href="https://pcacases.com/web/sendAttach/76022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> from the PCA, the court found that it was not open to India to unilaterally suspend the IWT or hold it in abeyance.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Court first considered the terms of the Treaty (IWT), which do not provide for the unilateral ‚Äòabeyance‚Äô or ‚Äòsuspension‚Äô of the Treaty; rather, according to its terms, the Treaty continues in force until terminated with the mutual consent of India and Pakistan,‚Äù the press release read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Court found that the terms of the Treaty, read in light of the Treaty‚Äôs object and purpose, do not allow either Party, acting unilaterally, to hold in abeyance or suspend an ongoing dispute settlement process, given that to do so would fundamentally undermine ‚Äòthe value and efficacy of the Treaty‚Äôs compulsory third-party dispute settlement process‚Äô.‚Äù</p>
<p>During the court proceedings, the PCA noted that it was not open to India to unilaterally hold the IWT in abeyance ‚Äúregardless of how India‚Äôs position was characterised or justified under international law‚Äù.</p></p>
