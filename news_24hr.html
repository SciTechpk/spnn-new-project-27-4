            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Interior announced on Wednesday that Pakistan and Iran had agreed to keep their shared border open round the clock during Muha­rram and Arbaeen.</p>
<p>The understanding was reached during a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MOIofficialGoP/status/1927638934474956908" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">meeting</a> in Tehran between Interior Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi and his Ira­nian counterpart, Eska­ndar Momeni. The discussions focused particularly on the movement and welfare of pilgrims, the ministry said.</p>
<p>According to an official statement, Mr Momeni said the Iranian government “will provide boarding and lodging facilities in Mashhad for 5,000 Pakistani pilgrims”. Also, Iran “will make special arrangements from the border to Iraq for them,” he said, adding that serving the pilgrims is considered a “religious duty”.</p>
<p>Both countries also agreed to establish a hotline to resolve issues concerning pilgrims swiftly. A trilateral conference of the interior ministries of Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq will be convened in Mashhad before Arbaeen to discuss matters related to Pakistani pilgrims. The ministers also agreed to increase the number of flights to ensure pilgrim’s safety and convenience.</p>

<p>Discussions also included sending pilgrims via sea routes to Iran and Iraq. Furthermore, the leaders talked about strengthening Pakistan-Iran <a class="link--external" href="https://https://www.dawn.com/news/1913570" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">relations</a> and mutual cooperation in various fields, including curbing illegal immigration, human trafficking, and drug control, with an agreement to enhance coordination for better border security management.</p>
<p>The Iranian interior minister emphasised that Iran and Pakistan enjoy “excellent relations” and that “Pakistan’s security is of utmost importance to Iran”.</p>
<p>Talks also covered the release of Iranian fishermen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1823798">detained</a> after they unintentionally entered Pakistani territorial waters. Mr Naqvi assured full cooperation in this regard at the request of his Iranian counterpart.</p>
<p>He expressed gratitude to the Iranian government for facilitating the pilgrims and said the establishment of a hotline would “help resolve issues promptly.”</p>
<p>Attending from the Iranian side were Deputy Interior Minister Ali Akbar Pourjamshidian, Deputy Minister Nader Yar Ahmadi, Adviser Hadian, Governor General of Sistan and Baluchestan Mansour Bager, and Colonel Javaheri, Head of International Affairs at the Ministry of Interior.</p>
<p>FIA director general and senior officers from Pakistan also attended the meeting.</p>

            <p><p>Billionaire Elon Musk on Wednesday announced he was leaving his role in the US government, which was intended to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891574">reduce</a> federal spending, shortly after his first major break with US President Donald Trump over his signature spending bill.</p>
<p>“As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President Donald Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,” he <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1927877957852266518" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on his social media platform X.</p>
<p>“The DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government,” he added.</p>

<p>The South African-born tech tycoon had said Trump’s bill would increase the deficit and undermine the work of Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892119">fired</a> tens of thousands of people.</p>
<p>Musk — who was a constant presence at Trump’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892999">side</a> before <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901662">pulling back</a> to focus on his Space X and Tesla businesses — also complained that DOGE had become a “whipping boy” for dissatisfaction with the administration.</p>
<p>“I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,” Musk said in an interview with <em>CBS</em> News, an excerpt of which aired late Tuesday.</p>
<p>Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” — which passed the US House last week and now moves to the Senate — offers sprawling tax relief and spending cuts and is the centrepiece of his domestic agenda.</p>
<p>But critics warn it will decimate health care and balloon the national deficit by as much as $4 trillion over a decade.</p>
<p>“A bill can be big, or it can be beautiful. But I don’t know if it can be both. My personal opinion,” Musk said in the interview, which will be aired in full on Sunday.</p>
<p>The White House sought to play down any differences over US government spending, without directly naming Musk.</p>
<p>“The Big Beautiful Bill is NOT an annual budget bill,” Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said on Musk’s social network, X, after the tech titan’s comments aired.</p>
<p>All DOGE cuts would have to be carried out through a separate bill targeting the federal bureaucracy, according to US Senate rules, Miller added.</p>

<p>But Musk’s comments represented a rare split with the Republican president whom he helped propel back to power, as the largest donor to his 2024 election campaign.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#whipping-boy" id="whipping-boy" title="Permalink"></a>‘Whipping boy’</h2>
<p>Trump tasked Musk with cutting government spending as head of DOGE, but after a feverish start, Musk announced in late April he was mostly stepping back to run his companies again.</p>
<p>Musk complained in a separate interview with the <em>Washington Post</em> that DOGE, which operated out of the White House with a staff of young technicians, had become a lightning rod for criticism.</p>
<p>“DOGE is just becoming the whipping boy for everything,” Musk told the newspaper at the Starbase launch site in Texas ahead of Space X’s latest launch on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Something bad would happen anywhere, and we would get blamed for it even if we had nothing to do with it.”</p>
<p>Musk blamed entrenched US bureaucracy for DOGE’s failure to achieve all of its goals — although reports say his domineering style and lack of familiarity with the currents of Washington politics were also major factors.</p>
<p>“The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realised,” he said. “I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.”</p>
<p>Musk has previously admitted that he did not achieve all his goals with DOGE even though tens of thousands of people were removed from government payrolls and several departments were gutted or shut down.</p>
<p>Musk’s own businesses suffered in the meantime.</p>
<p>Protesters against the cost-cutting targeted Tesla dealerships while arsonists even torched a few of the electric vehicles, and the firm’s profits slumped.</p>
<p>“People were burning Teslas. Why would you do that? That’s really uncool,” Musk told the <em>Post</em>.</p>
<p>Musk has also been focusing on Space X after a series of fiery setbacks to his dreams of colonising Mars — the latest of which came on Tuesday when its prototype Starship <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913851">exploded</a> over the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>The tycoon last week also said he would pull back from spending his fortune on politics, having spent around a quarter of a billion dollars to support Trump.</p></p>

            <p><p>MUZAFFARABAD: Four alleged terrorists were killed after a fierce exchange of fire with police in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Wednesday, during which two policemen were martyred and at least five others sustained injuries, police sources said.</p>
<p>The encounter occurred in Hussain Kot village, located on the outskirts of Rawalakot in Poonch district, following intelligence reports that a group of militants, allegedly led by a man named Zarnosh Na­sim, was hiding in the area.</p>
<p>The operation was set in motion following the April 10 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903615">arrest</a> of a suspect, Muiz, a resident of Chak Dhamni near Rawalakot. Muiz, who was found in possession of arms and ammunition, disclosed during interrogation that he was an associate of Zarnosh, a resident of Bagh district, and had delivered weapons to him just a day earlier.</p>
<p>Based on his information, a joint police team from Poonch and Bagh districts launched a raid in the Petaratta Morh area of Bagh on April 11. However, the suspects reportedly opened fire during the operation, resulting in the death of a passerby and injuries to two constables.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, acting on fresh intelligence, police launched another operation in the forested area near Hussain Kot. Upon arrival, the raiding party came under heavy fire and grenade attacks from the suspects.</p>
<p>Two constables were martyred while at least five others were reported injured in the exchange of fire. In retaliatory fire, police gunned down four militants, including Zarnosh.</p>
<p>There were unconfirmed reports suggesting that the militants may have detonated suicide jackets.</p>
