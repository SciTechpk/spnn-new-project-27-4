            <p><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept its policy rate unchanged on Wednesday at 11 per cent.</p>
<p>The central bank’s policy rate, after being slashed by 1,000bps from 22pc since June 2024 in seven intervals, was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908601">cut to 11pc</a> in May. The bank had kept the rate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917488">unchanged</a> on June 16 as well.</p>

<p>A press release issued by the SBP said its Monetary Policy Committee noted that inflation in June had decelerated to 3.2pc year on year, led mainly by lower food prices, whereas core inflation also declined slightly.</p>
<p>However, it noted that the inflation outlook had worsened in the wake of higher-than-anticipated adjustment in energy prices, especially gas tariffs.</p>

<p>“Nonetheless, inflation is projected to stabilise in the target range going forward.</p>
<p>“Moreover, economic activity is gaining further traction amidst the still-unfolding impact of the earlier
reductions in the policy rate. At the same time, the committee noted that the trade deficit is expected to
widen further in FY26 amidst the pickup in economic activity and slowdown in global trade. Given this
macroeconomic outlook and the emerging risks, the MPC considered today’s decision as necessary to ensure price stability,” the SBP said of the decision to keep the policy rate unchanged.</p>
<p>The bank noted that since the MPC’s prior meeting, its foreign exchange reserves had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921678">crossed $14 billion</a> on the back of improved financial inflows and a current account surplus.</p>
<p>It said the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926320">recent upgrade</a> in Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating had led to a decline in Eurobond yields and narrowed credit default swap spreads in international markets. It also said that inflation expectations had increased slightly for consumers but declined for businesses in the latest sentiment surveys.</p>
<p>The SBP said that the Federal Board of Revenue’s tax revenue for FY25 was recorded at Rs11.7 trillion, which fell short of the revised estimate by around Rs200bn. Lastly, it said that global oil prices
had remained volatile, whereas metal prices increased, while at the same time, the impact of global trade tariffs remained uncertain, prompting central banks to maintain their cautious monetary policy stance.</p>
<p>“In view of these developments and potential risks, the committee assessed that the real policy rate
should continue to be adequately positive to stabilise inflation in the target range of 5-7pc. The MPC
emphasised on the need to continue the ongoing prudent monetary and fiscal policy mix to sustain
macroeconomic stability. Moreover, the committee reiterated its view that without structural reforms, it
would be difficult to achieve higher growth on a sustainable basis,” the press release said.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said that stability in the currency market along with clarity on the inflation front would allow the SBP to cut interest rates into the single digit.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927245">Pakistan Business Forum</a> (PBF) had claimed that both interest and exchange rates were being kept artificially high without economic justification, and appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to ensure a correction to support growth and stability.</p>
<p>The PBF also criticised the current interest rate of 11pc, calling it unjustifiable given that the Consumer Price Index-based inflation had dropped to 4pc. It urged the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to reduce the policy rate to at least 9pc in its upcoming monetary policy announcement scheduled for July 30.</p></p>

            <p><p>A magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck off Russia’s Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula on Wednesday, the strongest in the region since 1952, damaging buildings and generating a tsunami of up to 4 metres that prompted warnings and evacuations in Hawaii, Japan and across the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Several people were injured in the remote Russian region, while much of Japan’s eastern seaboard — devastated by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in 2011 — was ordered to evacuate as Tsunami waves hit the Pacific coast of the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hawaii recorded tsunami waves measuring up to 5ft, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre. However, no waves of consequence have hit Hawaii yet.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>What we know so far:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>8.8-magnitude quake hit Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula at 8:24am local time (4am PKT)</li>
<li>Several people injured, no casualties reported</li>
<li>Tsunami warnings issued in Japan, Mexico, Hawaii, Ecuador, China, Chile, Costa Rica</li>
<li>Tsunami waves up to 1.7m hit Japan, Hawaii, California; 3-4m recorded in parts of Kamchatka</li>
<li>Russian mayor says ‘everyone’ on tsunami-hit islands evacuated</li>
<li>French Pacific Marquesas islands warned of 4m tsunami waves</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>The magnitude 8.8 quake struck at 8:24 am (4am PKT) off Petropavlovsk on Russia’s remote Kamchatka peninsula and was one of the 10 biggest recorded, according to the US Geological Survey.</p>
<p>The USGS said the earthquake was shallow at a depth of 19.3km, and was centred 119 km east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a city of 165,000.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The epicentre of the earthquake is roughly the same as the massive 9.0 temblor in 1952, which resulted in a destructive, Pacific-wide tsunami, according to the USGS.</p>
<p>“Today’s earthquake was serious and the strongest in decades of tremors,” Kamchatka Governor Vladimir Solodov said in a video posted on the Telegram messaging app.</p>
<p>A tsunami with a height of 3-4m was recorded in parts of Kamchatka, said Sergei Lebedev, regional minister for emergency situations, urging people to move away from the shoreline.</p>

<p>Russian authorities said a tsunami hit and flooded the port town of Severo-Kurilsk, while local media said one wave of between three and four metres high was recorded in the Elizovsky district of Kamchatka.</p>
<p>“The strongest earthquake since 1952 has just occurred in the Kamchatka seismic zone … Given the scale of the event, strong aftershocks with a magnitude of up to 7.5 should be expected,” Kamchatka’s geophysical service said on Telegram.</p>
<p>Thirty additional tremors were recorded following the main earthquake off the Kamchatka Peninsula, a regional branch of the Geophysical Service of the Russian Academy of Sciences said.</p>
<p>In December 2004, a 9.1 magnitude earthquake struck off the Indonesian island of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that killed around 220,000 people in 11 nations.</p>
<p>Several people sought medical assistance following the quake, Oleg Melnikov, regional health minister, told Russia’s <em>TASS</em> state news agency.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, there are some people injured during the seismic event. Some were hurt while running outside, and one patient jumped out of a window. A woman was also injured inside the new airport terminal,” Melnikov said.</p>
<p>“All patients are currently in satisfactory condition, and no serious injuries have been reported so far.”</p>
<p>While a kindergarten was also damaged, most buildings withstood the quake, and no fatalities had been reported, the ministry added.</p>
<p>Russia’s Ministry for Emergency Services said on Telegram that the port in the Sakhalin town of Severo-Kurilsk and a fish processing plant there were partially flooded by a tsunami. The population has been evacuated.</p>
<p>“Everyone was evacuated. There was enough time, a whole hour. So everyone was evacuated, all the people are in the tsunami safety zone,” Mayor Kuril Islands district Alexander Ovsyannikov said at a crisis meeting with officials.</p>
<p>Authorities in Russia’s far eastern Sakhalin region declared a state of emergency in the northern Kuril Islands.</p>
<p>“A state of emergency has been declared in the North Kuril District, where an earthquake and tsunami occurred today,” the Sakhalin government said in a statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team recorded that the Klyuchevskoy volcano —  a highly active volcano in the region — ejected ash to a height of up to 3km above sea level as a result of the quake, <em>Al Jazeera</em> reported.</p>
<p>“The volcano is continuing to erupt explosively at the summit. Ash emissions at altitudes up to 8km above sea level may occur at any time,” said KVERT in a statement.</p>
<p>KVERT has assigned an orange colour code for aviation hazards to the volcano, which indicates an increased likelihood of eruption.</p>

<p>The whole Pacific coast of Japan has reported tsunami waves, <em>Al Jazeera</em> reported, citing Japanese broadcaster <em>NHK World.</em></p>
<p>Waves as high as 60cm were recorded along some parts of the coast, including Kuji Port and Hamanaka town, according to <em>NHK.</em></p>
<p>The size of the waves has grown steadily from 20cm earlier this morning, and authorities say they could reach as high as 3m.</p>
<p>Tsunami warning advisories will be in place across Japan for at least the next 24 hours, the Japanese broadcaster said.</p>
<p>According to Japan’s Meteorological Agency, the country’s Pacific coast has already been hit by four to five rounds of tsunami waves, and has warned that there are no signs of the Tsunami waves receding, <em>Al Jazeera</em> reported.</p>
<p>There is also a chance of powerful and unexpected surges, it added.</p>
<p>Earlier, Japan’s weather agency issued a warning, saying it expected tsunami waves of up to 3m to reach large coastal areas starting around 1am GMT (6am PKT).</p>
<p>Tsunami alarms sounded in coastal towns across Japan’s Pacific coast with authorities urging people to seek higher ground.</p>
<p>Footage on public broadcaster <em>NHK</em> showed scores of people in the northern island of Hokkaido on the roof of a building, sheltering under tents from the beating sun, as fishing boats left harbours to avoid potential damage from the incoming waves.</p>
<p>“We came here hoping to swim, but once we heard a tsunami warning had been issued, we didn’t go in at all, not even close to the water,” local Tomoyo Fujita, 35, told <em>AFP</em> as she left the area with her young daughter.</p>
<p>Television footage showed several whales washed up on a beach.</p>
<p>Workers evacuated the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant, where a meltdown following the 2011 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/612370">tsunami</a> caused a radioactive disaster, operator TEPCO said.</p>
<p>There were no injuries or damage reported so far, and no irregularities at any nuclear plants, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said.</p>

<p>The US Tsunami Warning System also warned of “hazardous tsunami waves” within the next three hours across the Pacific. According to the seismology centre, waves reaching more than 3m were possible along some coasts of Russia and Ecuador, while waves of 1-3m were possible in Japan, Hawaii, Costa Rica, French Polynesia, Guam, Chile and the Solomon Islands, it said. Smaller waves were possible along coastlines across much of the Pacific, including the US West Coast.</p>
<p>Waves of up to one metre were possible elsewhere, including Australia, Colombia, Mexico, New Zealand, Tonga and Taiwan.</p>
<p>It described the potential conditions as “hazardous.”</p>
<p>In Mexico, the Navy warned that strong currents are expected at port entrances from Baja California in the northwest to Chiapas in the south of Mexico, <em>AFP</em> reported.</p>
<p>The country has mobilised authorities at all levels of government to keep its population away from Pacific beaches.</p>
<p>Following suit, Peru also issued a statement warning of a possible tsunami.</p>
<p>“After an analysis and evaluation by the National Tsunami Warning Centre, it has been determined that this event generates a tsunami warning for the Peruvian coast,” the Directorate of Hydrography and Navigation of the Peruvian Navy said in a statement, adding that the situation “will be kept under constant surveillance.”</p>
<p>Ecuador officials ordered ‘preventive evacuations’ from Galapagos beaches and the suspension of all maritime activities, <em>AFP</em> reported.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927593/another-couple-killed-in-balochistans-mastung-by-family-over-honour-police' target='_blank'><strong>Another couple killed in Balochistan’s Mastung by family over ‘honour’: police</strong></a>
            <p><p>A couple was shot dead by the woman’s family over ‘honour’ in Balochistan’s Mastung district, police said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The incident comes over a week after the killing of a man and a woman in the Degari area of Quetta on the orders of a tribal jirga ahead of Eidul Azha for so-called ‘honour’. The police had subsequently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925718">arrested</a> at least 14 suspects for their involvement in the incident.</p>
<p>Wali Khan Station House Officer Pir Muhammad Alizai said in a statement today that the deceased couple got married seven years ago.</p>
<p>“The couple was travelling from Panjgur to Lakpass in a pickup upon the invitation of the woman’s brothers,” the police said. “The suspects told them to wait at the Noshki Cross, arrived on two motorcycles at about 7am on Tuesday, shot the couple dead with a pistol, and fled.”</p>
<p>“Action to arrest the suspects is underway,” SHO Alizai said.</p>
<p>According to a first information report (FIR) of the incident, dated July 29, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, the deceased were travelling with their two children and brother. They stayed at a hotel near Lakpas at night.</p>
<p>A case was registered by the deceased husband’s brother at the Wali Khan Levies police station under Sections 34 (common intention), 302 (murder) and (assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).</p>
<p>Five people were nominated as suspects in the FIR.</p>
<p>“The reason for the murder is enmity and a love marriage,” it said.</p>
<p>Last week, a man allegedly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925885">shot dead</a> his daughter and nephew in Quetta in the name of ‘honour’, just days after the Degari case, in which a couple was gunned down in broad daylight, drawing widespread condemnation, according to the police.</p>
<p>On July 26, a court in Rawalpindi remanded three suspects to police custody over an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926722/rawalpindi-court-sends-3-suspects-on-physical-remand-in-alleged-honour-killing-case">alleged murder</a> and ‘honour’ killing case of a newlywed woman.</p>
<p>Police had initiated the investigation based on information that a woman had been murdered in the name of ‘honour’ in Pirwadhai, following a jirga in which members of both families participated.</p>
<p>As the woman’s family and in-laws became aware that the police were secretly investigating the incident, the deceased’s husband registered a case with the police under Section 496A. Police sources had said that the case was registered by the husband on the same day the woman was allegedly killed by suffocation with a pillow.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849480">continued</a> to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.</p>
<p>Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881836">shows</a> that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p></p>
