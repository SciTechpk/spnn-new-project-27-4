            <p><p>Flooding at Punjab‚Äôs Kalabagh on the Indus river reached a ‚Äúmedium‚Äù level on Friday, while low-level floods were reported at four other locations on the river due to heavy monsoon rains and glacial melting, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said on Friday.</p>

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has forecasted that five more such spells of rain are expected in the coming days, leading to rising water levels, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-directs-ndma-ministers-for-climate-planning-to-prepare-comprehensive-disaster-management-plans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The next spell is expected to begin from July 21 and last till July 28, while the fifth is expected in the first week of August, the sixth in the second week of August and the seventh in its third week.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe flow of water in rivers is increasing due to monsoon rains and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660">glacial melting</a>,‚Äù a statement issued by the PDMA spokesperson said.</p>
<p>According to the data released by the Met Office‚Äôs Flood Forecasting Division at 1pm, there was a medium-level flood at Kalabagh with ‚Äústeady‚Äù water inflow (447,941 cusecs) and outflow (440,391).</p>
