                <h2>Rubio lauds Pakistan‚Äôs role in global and regional peace in 1st meeting with FM Dar</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio lauded Pakistan‚Äôs role in ‚Äúglobal and regional peace‚Äù in his first meeting with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday, the Foreign Office (FO) said.</p>
<p>The deputy prime minister arrived in Washington, DC, on Thursday night, on the second leg of his eight-day visit to the US. He had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925622">arrived</a> in New York on Monday to attend ‚Äúhigh-level signature events‚Äù of Pakistan‚Äôs United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency, including a conference on Palestine.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the FO today said that Dar held his first meeting with Rubio. The two have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902727">previously talked</a> over the telephone.</p>
<p>The FO said Rubio acknowledged Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúeverlasting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1381731">sacrifices</a> in the war on terror‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan has always played a positive role in global and regional peace,‚Äù the FO quoted the US secretary of state as saying.</p>
<p>The FO said that detailed discussions were held on bilateral relations and potential cooperation in various sectors.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDiscussions were held on promoting bilateral trade and economic relations, cooperation in important sectors, including investment, agriculture, technology [and] minerals. Counter-terrorism and regional peace were also discussed.‚Äù</p>

<p>FM Dar paid tribute to the efforts of President Donald Trump and the US leadership in promoting global peace, adding that their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">role and efforts</a> regarding the recent Pakistan-India tension were ‚Äúcommendable‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan and the US seek further expansion and stability in bilateral relations,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The FO said FM Dar was optimistic about the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925309">positive progress</a> in the ongoing trade dialogue between the two countries</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan is an attractive destination for the American business community and investors. The two countries have a common approach and interests regarding regional peace. The Pakistani community in the US is playing a bridge role between the two countries,‚Äù the FO quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to promoting bilateral relations and working together in various fields</p>

<p>Upon arrival in the US capital, FM Dar was received by Ambassador of Pakistan to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh and senior embassy officials.</p>
<p>Dar‚Äôs visit comes as Pakistan holds the presidency of the UNSC this month. Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921308">assumed</a> the UNSC presidency for July, marking its first presidency since 2013. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026.</p>
<p>Addressing a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926068">reception</a> hosted by Pakistan‚Äôs Mission in New York on Wednesday, Dar called for an inclusive dialogue and cooperative diplomacy over confrontation amid growing turbulence across the world.</p>
<p>The deputy PM asserted that Pakistan‚Äôs leadership has been guided by ‚Äúthese very principles in both deliberations and concrete actions taken during its tenure‚Äù.</p>
<p>The UNSC unanimously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925923">adopted</a> Pakistan-sponsored <a class="link--external" href="https://press.un.org/en/2025/sc16125.doc.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Resolution 2788</a>, calling for the strengthening of international mechanisms to settle disputes through peaceful means.</p>
<p>Dar also announced Pakistan was seeking a seat at the UN Human Rights Council for the 2026-2028 term, with the Asia-Pacific Group endorsing its candidacy. Pakistan last <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1584934">held</a> the membership from 2020 to 2023.</p></p>

                <h2>Govt to continue assisting in Dr Aafia Siddiqui‚Äôs case, PM Shehbaz assures her sister</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif assured Dr Fouzia Siddiqui on Friday that the government would continue to provide all possible legal and diplomatic support in the matter of her sister, Dr Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist serving a prison sentence in the United States, the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-meets-dr-aafia-siddiquis-sister-assures-all-possible-legal-diplomatic-support/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) Registrar Office <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924527">put</a> on hold the processing of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925717/contempt-notice-to-pm-cabinet-after-unsanctioned-hearing">contempt of court notices</a> issued to PM Shehbaz and his cabinet members as the dealing staff decided to ascertain its validity first.</p>
<p>IHC Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq on July 21 had issued a contempt of court notice to the entire federal government, including the prime minister and all ministers, for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921306">refusing</a> to file an amicus brief to support Dr Aafia‚Äôs case in the US.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe government is in no way negligent regarding the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui,‚Äù the prime minister was quoted as having said by <em>APP</em> in a meeting today with Dr Fouzia.</p>
<p>On the instructions of PM Shehbaz, the government has previously provided diplomatic and legal assistance in the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui, a statement issued by the PM Office said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFurthermore, the prime minister not only wrote a letter to then-US president Joe Biden regarding this issue but also formed a committee headed by Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar to ensure further progress in the matter,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe committee will remain in contact with Dr Fouzia and work to provide the necessary support in this regard.‚Äù</p>

<p>Dr Aafia, a neuroscientist and educator, was convicted by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on charges of attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan and has been serving her <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924527">sentence</a> at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Carswell in the US since 2010.</p>
<p>On July 12, the IHC expr¬≠essed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923643">dissatisfaction</a> over the federal government‚Äôs failure to submit a report in the case concerning Dr Aafia‚Äôs release, health and repatriation, with Justice Ishaq threatening to ‚Äúsummon the entire cabinet‚Äù if the report was not presented.</p>
<p>In February, the IHC was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893509">told</a> that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1496759">proposal</a> to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1384547">exchange</a> Shakil Afridi for Dr Aafia was unfeasible.</p>
<p>The law officer representing the federal government informed the court that Dr Aafia‚Äôs American lawyer Clive Smith had suggested the swap, but Pakistan and the US did not have any agreement for such an exchange.</p>
<p>Last year in October, PM Shehbaz had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866050">requested</a> that Biden pardon and release Dr Aafia from jail.</p>
<p>In a letter dated October 13, which has been seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, the prime minister expressed his concerns about Dr Aafia‚Äôs ‚Äúfragile mental and frail physical health‚Äù while in prison. ‚ÄúNow 52 years old, she has served 16 years behind bars in the US.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNumerous Pakistani officials have paid consular visits to Dr Siddiqui ‚Ä¶ all of them have raised their serious concerns about the treatment she has received,‚Äù the letter read. ‚ÄúIn fact, they fear she may take her own life.‚Äù</p>
<p>Consequently, the US State Department <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867024">declined</a> to comment on the letter written by PM Shehbaz to the Biden administration.</p>
<p>When a journalist inquired about the letter, spokesperson Vedant Patel had stated: ‚ÄúCertainly, we would not get into private diplomatic communications,‚Äù seemingly confirming receipt of the correspondence.</p></p>
