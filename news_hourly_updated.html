                <h2>Imran decries lack of ‚Äòmeaningful momentum‚Äô for Aug 5 protest, orders PTI to shun all differences</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Incarcerated PTI founder and ex-prime minister Imran Khan has decried the lack of any ‚Äúmeaningful momentum‚Äù for the party‚Äôs planned <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922952/imran-shuns-dialogue-plans-nationwide-protest">August 5 protest</a> and ordered its members to immediately shun all their differences.</p>
<p>Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a ¬£190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. He has issued a nationwide protest call, which will reach its ‚Äúpeak‚Äù on Aug 5 to mark the second year of his incarceration in multiple cases.</p>
<p>However, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur appeared to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924027">disrupt</a> the nationwide protest plans and sow confusion by introducing a new 90-day timeline for what he described as ‚Äòa final push‚Äô. PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik later voiced her reservations about his announcement.</p>
<p>The resulting discord in the party leadership and ranks had prompted Imran to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924606/imran-prohibits-pti-members-from-going-public-with-partys-internal-matters">prohibit</a> his party members from publicly discussing the party‚Äôs internal matters.</p>
<p>In a post today on his X account ‚Äî which is not operated by Imran himself ‚Äî a message said to be sent on his behalf stated: ‚ÄúLet me make this absolutely clear: every member of the party must immediately set aside all internal differences and focus solely on the movement planned for August 5th. I do not see any meaningful momentum building behind this initiative at present. I am waging a battle against a 78-year-old system, and my greatest success is that despite unprecedented oppression, the public stands firmly with me.‚Äù</p>
<p>The message said the people had expressed their trust in the PTI by voting for it in the general elections, even in the absence of an electoral symbol.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter such a clear mandate, it is the moral and political responsibility of every party member to become the voice of the people. It will be nothing short of disgraceful and condemnable if PTI leaders waste time on internal conflicts at this critical juncture.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnyone found engaging in factionalism within the party will be expelled. I am fighting for the future of our generations and every sacrifice I make is for that cause. To create rifts within the party at this time would be a direct betrayal of my mission and vision,‚Äù the message warned.</p>

<p>Lashing out at the government, the message said it had ‚Äúcrippled the judiciary‚Äù through the 26th Constitutional Amendment.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe way biased judges are now delivering blatantly unjust verdicts under these courts is visible to the entire nation. We must launch a robust campaign to liberate the judiciary, for no nation can survive, let alone progress, without judicial independence.‚Äù</p>
<p>The message claimed ‚Äúinhumane conditions‚Äù were being imposed upon Imran‚Äôs spouse and former first lady Bushra Bibi while the PTI founder‚Äôs conditions were themselves not good.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am enduring the harshest prison term in the country‚Äôs history solely for the supremacy of the Constitution and in service of my nation. The level of oppression and authoritarianism is such that even the water I have for ablution is filthy and contaminated with dirt, unfit for any human being.‚Äù</p>
<p>Separately, a post from PTI‚Äôs central deputy information secretary said the nationwide protest would be led under the banner of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP).</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll provincial organisations will follow their respective plans of action based on their circumstances.‚Äù</p>

<p>Addressing a press conference with other TTAP leaders, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said the first step of the protest movement would be an all-party conference in Islamabad on July 31 and the decisions taken then would shape the future plan of action.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Imran‚Äôs sons continued their engagements in the United States, where they currently are before visiting Pakistan for their father.</p>
<p>They met Republican Congressman Joe Wilson of South Carolina who had introduced a bipartisan bill in the US House of Representatives in March, calling for sanctions on Pakistani state functionaries over alleged human rights violations, including the ‚Äúpersecution‚Äù of their father.</p>

                <h2>PM Shehbaz lauds World Bank support for Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äòlegitimate position‚Äô on Indus Waters Treaty</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday appreciated the World Bank‚Äôs (WB) support for Pakistan‚Äôs position in light of India‚Äôs suspension of the <a class="link--external" href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTs/Volume%20419/volume-419-I-6032-English.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Indus Waters Treaty</a> (IWT).</p>
<p>In April, India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">held</a> the IWT in abeyance following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam that killed 26 ‚Äî an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">‚Äúact of war‚Äù</a>, noting that the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension.</p>
<p>In a meeting with the WB‚Äôs regional vice president for the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan (MENAAP), Ousmane Dione, in Islamabad, the premier acknowledged the institution‚Äôs principled support for Pakistan‚Äôs legitimate position on India‚Äôs ‚Äúunilateral and unlawful actions‚Äù, which undermined ‚Äúimportant international agreements‚Äù such as the IWT.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to upholding international law, achieving prosperity, maintaining regional peace and reiterated the country‚Äôs resolve to resolve all issues through dialogue.</p>

<p>The prime minister further thanked the WB for its timely and generous assistance during the devastating floods of 2022, which helped Pakistan initiate immediate relief efforts and begin reconstruction and rehabilitation activities.</p>
<p>He especially thanked World Bank President Ajay Banga and former country director for Pakistan Najy Benhassine for their pivotal role in advancing the new country partnership framework (CPF) for Pakistan.</p>
<p>In January, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885518">became</a> the first country to launch a longer-term CPF with the WB, after the bank‚Äôs board of directors approved the 10-year programme and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885337">pledged</a> to provide $20 billion to Pakistan.</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz appreciated the strategic role of the CPF in supporting Pakistan‚Äôs development priorities, particularly in the areas of energy, human capital, climate change, and governance reforms.</p>
<p>Dione expressed gratitude to the premier for the warm hospitality extended during his visit to Pakistan.</p>

<p>He reaffirmed the WB‚Äôs commitment to deepening and expanding its longstanding partnership with Pakistan and enhancing collaboration in key sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>Dione appreciated Pakistan‚Äôs ongoing macroeconomic recovery and praised the prime minister‚Äôs government for steering the country toward financial stability and sustainable growth.</p>
<p>He particularly commended the current administration‚Äôs reform agenda, noting the premier‚Äôs strong leadership in advancing institutional reforms, restoring investor confidence, and promoting inclusive economic development.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz and Dione expressed a shared commitment to further strengthening cooperation in the coming years, to achieve long-term development goals and build a prosperous future for the people of Pakistan.</p></p>
