<p>In his statement, he said: “We reiterate our commitment to workers’ autonomy, fair wages, a safe environment and social security. Workers and the working class are the driving force of our economy and national development.”</p>
<p>He highlighted the role of workers “in building our infrastructure, developing industries, agriculture, and the economy”.</p>
<p>He added: “Our workers are our pride. Our national development is due to the hard work and character of workers. In a rapidly changing world, we must focus on skilling our youth and workers for a bright future. We need to equip our workers and youth with modern skills.”</p>

<p>The president also stressed the need to create a comprehensive system for the skill development of workers.</p>
<p>“We will have to work to create a fair labor environment and for the welfare of workers. Let’s promote meaningful policies, inclusive development, and a culture in the country where the role of every worker is respected,” he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s “unwavering commitment to promoting safe, healthy, and dignified conditions for workers”, <em>PTV</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1917777450391552268" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>“Our hardworking workforce is the driving force behind our nation’s progress and our resilience,” he said.</p>
<p>“The protection of fundamental rights of workers is enshrined in the Constitution of Pakistan and is fully consistent with the core conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), to which Pakistan is a committed signatory,” he added.</p>
<p>The premier highlighted that the country has undertaken legislative and administrative reforms to strengthen labour and workforce protection, including key international labour conventions, such as the Forced Labour Convention and the 2014 Protocol to the Maritime Labour Convention.</p>
<p>He stated, “For the first time, every worker in Pakistan is benefiting from a national occupational safety and health profile, ensuring safe and healthy workplaces across the country.”</p>

            <p><p>Three Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) police personnel were martyred and two injured late Wednesday night in an exchange of fire with terrorists in Bannu, officials said.</p>
<p>According to a statement issued from the office of Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan today, the gun battle took place in the Spin Tangi area of Chashmi, Bannu.</p>
<p>Bannu CTD personnel Assistant Sub-Inspector Benyamin Khan, Constable Inam Khan and Constable Musawar were martyred. Two constables, Wafid Khan and Imran, were wounded.</p>
<p>He said two <em>khawarij</em> — a term the state uses to refer to terrorists — were killed and another two injured in police firing, and their accomplices took bodies and injured with them.</p>
<p>“Weapons, ammunition, IEDs (improvised explosive device) and hand grenades were recovered from the terrorists, which were seized by the police,” the spokesman said.</p>
<p>As soon as the incident was reported, RPO Khan, Bannu District Police Officer Saleem Abbas Kalachi, and CTD Superintendent of Police reached the CTD hospital where they visited the injured personnel and inquired after their well-being.</p>
<p>They also issued instructions to the hospital staff for the best treatment of those injured.</p>
<p>RPO Khan said that all available resources will be utilised for the best treatment of the injured personnel.</p>
<p>“We will soon avenge our martyred brothers and engage the terrorists with an iron hand till the very end,” he said.</p>
<p>A large contingent of Bannu police and CTD police have cordoned off the area and are engaged in search operations. Raids are being conducted on the hideouts of the terrorists, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi condemned the attack and expressed his condolences to the families of the martyred.</p>
<p>According to a statement issued by his office, KP Governor House, Kundi paid tribute to the personnel for bravely confronting the terrorists.</p>
<p>“The sacrifices of the police and security forces against the terrorists will not go in vain,” he said.</p>
<p>In March, two officials of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s CTD were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1883989">martyred</a> at Tanda Dam in Kohat district in a gun attack carried out by unidentified assailants.</p>
<p>In January, an official of the police’s CTD was martyred when unidentified persons opened fire at him in Mirali Bazaar.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907744/bangladesh-begins-three-days-of-mass-political-rallies' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh begins three days of mass political rallies</strong></a>
            <p><p>Three days of political rallies began in Bangladesh on Thursday with rival groups set to stage mass demonstrations in Dhaka, drumming up support for eagerly anticipated <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896291">elections</a> following an uprising last year.</p>
<p>Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, 84, who has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850894">led</a> an interim government since autocratic prime minister Sheikh Hasina <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245/bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-has-resigned-interim-govt-to-run-country-army-chief">fled into exile</a> as crowds stormed her palace in August, has said elections will be held as early as December, and at the latest by mid-2026.</p>
<p>The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), widely <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1803985">tipped</a> to win the poll, will hold a May Day rally in Dhaka.</p>
<p>“We are confident this will be the most memorable grand rally in recent times,” BNP media officer Shairul Kabir Khan said.</p>
<p>Jamaat-e-Islami will also take to the streets of the capital on Thursday.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895032">Jatiya Party</a>, formerly close to Hasina’s regime, will also hold a rally.</p>
<p>It will be its first outdoor political event since its offices were vandalised in October, allegedly for helping Hasina’s Awami League cling to power.</p>
<p>On Friday, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895444">National Citizens Party</a> (NCP), formed by students who spearheaded the youth-led protests that overthrew Hasina, will hold a rally.</p>
<p>NCP leader Nahid Islam initially joined the interim government led by Yunus, before resigning to form the party.</p>
<p>“Political programmes help us build public engagement,” said senior NCP official Ariful Islam Adib. “This rally isn’t about showing strength, but we expect 20,000 to 30,000 attendees.”</p>
<p>Hefazat-e-Islam, a platform of Islamic seminaries, will hold a “grand rally” on Saturday.</p>
<p>“Our rally is a reminder to the government of the sacrifices we’ve made,” said its leader Mamunul Haque, adding they will use the event to present their demands.</p>
<p>Key among them is scrapping recommendations by a government women’s commission for ending discriminatory provisions against women, a further indication of how hardline, religiously fuelled activism is strengthening after years of suppression.</p>
<p>“We will present four demands. Chief among them is scrapping the recommendations of the Women’s Rights Commission,” Haque said.</p>
<p>“We don’t care if it’s Muhammad Yunus in charge or someone even more prominent, we’ll take to the streets,” he added.</p>
<p>Hasina, who remains in self-imposed exile in India, has defied an arrest warrant from Dhaka over charges of crimes against humanity.</p></p>
