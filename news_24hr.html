            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday said that the Pakistani and Iranian leadership were eager to raise bilateral trade volume between the two countries to $10 billion at the earliest, according to a joint statement.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Iran share close ties and have signed multiple <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1829340">agreements</a> across sectors such as energy and trade.</p>
<p>The announcement was made as the two countries signed 12 agreements and memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with PM Shehbaz and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian — who is in Islamabad on a two-day official <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928047">visit</a> — addressing a joint press briefing.</p>
<p>“Both countries signed a number of documents to transform them into agreements and to realise the potential of $10bn trade target, adding that the respective delegations from the two sides would further hold detailed meetings to move forward in this regard,” according to the state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/global/pakistan-iran-keen-to-boost-bilateral-trade-volume-to-10bn-pm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)</a></em>.</p>
<p>During the bilateral meeting, which took place before the joint press briefing, both sides discussed the broad aspects of their bilateral ties, brotherly relations, religious and cultural ties, and held comprehensive talks to further boost them.</p>
<p>Speaking during the joint press briefing, PM Sharif condemned how Israel, on June 13, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/israel-iran-conflict">attacked</a> Iran’s nuclear sites. According to the Iranian government, 610 people were killed during the war, while rights groups put the figure at 974.</p>
<p>“Israel, without any rhyme or reason, unleashed aggression against Iran, which was not only strongly condemned by the government of Pakistan but by the entire 240 million Pakistani people, as there was no reason for Israel to stoke war,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>According to the report, the prime minister also expressed his condolences on the martyrdom of Iranian generals, scientists and civilians during the conflict and prayed for the departed souls and the injured for their early recovery.</p>
<p>He also lauded the Iranian leadership for showing bravery and wisdom during the Israeli aggression and said the Iranian forces and the people faced the aggression and exposed the Israeli defence system with volleys of retaliatory missile attacks.</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s principled stance over Iran’s right to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925977/iran-rules-out-giving-up-its-nuclear-programme">nuclear programme</a> for peaceful purposes under the UN charter, saying that Pakistan would stand by its stance.</p>
<p>In the fight against terrorism, he said both sides shared views that it could not be tolerated at any cost. “If anyone in Iran was affected by terrorism, it was akin to a victim of terror in Pakistan,” he said.</p>
<p>The premier further said that the two brotherly countries would take effective measures to eliminate terrorism.</p>
<p>The prime minister, on behalf of the people and the government of Pakistan, welcomed the president on his maiden visit to Pakistan.</p>
<p>In his remarks, President Pezeshkian expressed gratitude for the position adopted by the parliament, government and the people of Pakistan for supporting Iran during the 10-day Israeli aggression.</p>
<p>He said the bonds of affinities and affection between the two countries and nations were deeply rooted in religion, culture and history, citing poetic verses of Allama Muhammad Iqbal, in which he stressed upon unity among the Muslim countries.</p>
<p>“Advancing the neighbourhood policy is among the priorities of Iran’s foreign policy, as Pakistan is not only our neighbour but also a brotherly country,” he added.</p>
<p>The president expressed his satisfaction that, fortunately, serious and sincere efforts were being initiated by both sides for cooperation in diverse fields, and to take their current trade volume of $3bn to the projected target of $10bn.</p>
<p>President Pezeshkian said that his government was determined to take steps to implement these agreements, while the development of land, sea and air routes would facilitate trade.</p>

<p>“The agreements and MoUs included cooperation for plant protection and plant quarantine, joint use of Mirjaveh-Taftan border gate, collaboration in science, technology and innovation, cooperation in information and communications technology,” the report said.</p>
<p>It added that agreements and MoUs were also exchanged to promote culture, art, tourism, youth, mass media and exports, and cooperation in meteorology, climatology and related hazards.</p>
<p>“MoUs on maritime safety and firefighting, judicial assistance in criminal matters, supplemental MoU to an MoU in 2013 related to air services agreement were also signed,” the report said.</p>

<p>“Welcoming the Iranian president, the deputy prime minister/foreign minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s deep commitment to its historic and brotherly ties with Iran, emphasising their strong foundations in shared history, common cultural heritage, faith, and mutual respect,” the statement said.</p>
<p>President Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan’s support and reaffirmed Iran’s resolve to improve bilateral collaboration in various areas of shared interest. He also looked forward to meaningful discussions with Pakistani leaders to further reinforce the political and economic ties between the two friendly nations, the FO said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#strengthening-bilateral-trade" id="strengthening-bilateral-trade" title="Permalink"></a>Strengthening bilateral trade</h2>
<p>Separately, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal and the Iranian Minister for Industry, Mines and Trade, Mohammad Atabak, also had a high-level discussion on Sunday, where the two sides agreed to accelerate trade, remove border bottlenecks, and build trust-based partnerships across priority sectors, according to a statement from the commerce ministry.</p>
<p>Minister Kamal suggested organising targeted trade delegations that include representatives from federal and provincial chambers of commerce, enabling focused discussions on market access and regulatory facilitation, according to the statement.</p>
<p>“We’ve done this model successfully in Belarus and elsewhere,” he was quoted in the statement as saying. “Let’s do the same for Iran, starting with sectors that show the greatest potential for mutual benefit.”</p>
<p>The ministers also expressed a shared commitment to increasing the use of existing trade corridors and border facilities. Emphasis was placed on maximising the potential of neighbourhood trade, with Kamal highlighting how ASEAN countries have benefited enormously by trading within their region.</p>
<p>“Geography is an advantage. Pakistan and Iran must utilise this discount of distance. If we don’t, we lose both time and cost benefits,” he stated.</p>
<p>Atabak also highlighted ongoing discussions about increasing Pakistani exports to Iran and encouraged swift follow-up on newly signed agreements.</p>
<p>“Traders and industrialists in both countries are ready. They trust each other. What they need now is a clear and consistent facilitation mechanism from our side,” he noted.</p>
<p>Kamal said that beyond bilateral gains, such connectivity could expand to Turkey, Central Asia, Russia, and even parts of the Middle East, creating an economic bloc of substantial power and resilience.</p>
<p>Atabak supported the idea of holding a dedicated business-to-business (B2B) day during every high-level visit and offered to bring Iranian business groups to Pakistan for in-depth meetings, the statement said.</p>
<p>The two ministers acknowledged the historic depth of Pakistan-Iran relations, expressing that recent regional and global developments have pushed both nations closer together.</p>
<p>“Without the rapid engagement and determination from you and your team, we wouldn’t have reached this stage. The momentum we’ve built must now be translated into structured trade outcomes,” Minister Atabak said while praising the Pakistani government’s proactive role in facilitating bilateral trade progress.</p>
<p>Kamal echoed similar sentiments, noting that both governments, as well as the private sector, had shown strong will and passion to work together.</p>
<p>“There’s a moment in diplomacy when the iron is hot — and this is that moment. We must act swiftly. Delays only complicate things,” he said.</p>
<p>He emphasised that formalities follow passion and political will, and highlighted that Pakistan is ready to deepen its economic relationship with Iran through structured channels like the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/global/pakistan-iran-keen-to-boost-bilateral-trade-volume-to-10bn-pm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joint Economic Commission (JEC)</a>, regular B2B exchanges, and sector-focused delegations.</p>
<p>Both ministers agreed on the importance of identifying specific sectors such as agriculture, livestock, services, energy, and cross-border logistics for future collaboration.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the human element of bilateral ties, both sides underscored the cultural and linguistic commonalities between the people of Pakistan and Iran.</p>
<p>The ministers agreed to fast-track the next session of the JEC, ensure participation from both public and private stakeholders, and prioritise border facilitation and trade logistics.</p>
<p>“With high-level political alignment and mutual trust, Pakistan and Iran appear poised to enter a new phase of strategic economic partnership that could reshape regional trade dynamics,” the statement said.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928496/broken-system-experts-stress-need-for-supportive-legal-civil-forums-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>‘Broken system’: Experts stress need for supportive legal, civil forums in Pakistan</strong></a>
            <p><p>Experts from various professions assailed systemic injustice in Pakistan on Sunday, stressing the need for legal and civil institutions to be supportive and have a holistic approach.</p>
<p>At a plenary session of the <a class="link--external" href="https://habib.edu.pk/imagining-futures/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Imagining Futures Conference</a> taking place at Karachi’s Habib University from August 1-4, subject experts and stakeholders discussed human rights and civil liberties in Pakistan.</p>
<p>As the session began exploring Pakistan’s legal landscape, National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) Chairman Rabiya Javeri highlighted: “Knowledge is capital.”</p>
<p>However, she stressed, people should be aware of their rights but the “system is messed up”.</p>
<p>Responding to a query from the audience about whether knowledge really guaranteed protection if women such as ex-premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1378568/who-killed-benazir-bhutto">Benazir Bhutto</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912155/sc-upholds-zahir-jaffers-death-sentence-in-noor-mukadam-murder-case">Noor Mukadam</a> could be murdered, Javeria pointed out: “Empowerment through education or skills needs to be integrated into systems […] educational, financial, judicial systems have to support you.”</p>
<p>“Only 41 per cent of women raped report it, and even out of those, they back off due to societal pressure,” the NCHR chair said. Noting the low rate of conviction in rape cases (<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894972/conviction-rates-critically-low-in-gender-based-violence-cases-report">0.5pc</a> according to a recent report), she said: “Who will they go to? <em>System hi itna kharab hai, holnaak hai</em> (the system itself is so broken and horrifying).”</p>
<p>“The system has to be responsive,” Javeri stressed, noting the need for human rights impact assessments for projects and systematic and gendered planning in budgets.</p>
<p>She underscored that this aspect needed to be embedded in “service providers”, which include lawyers, courts, police and teachers, among others.</p>
<p>“Human rights are god-given rights. Nobody can take them away.”</p>
<p>Javeri detailed certain cases she had come across during her role at NCHR, including one where a woman had gotten her daughter — a Master’s student in her 30s — abducted and sent to a rehabilitation centre.</p>
<p>The mother’s reason to do so, as told by Javeri, sent shivers down the audience’s spines: the daughter did not want to get married, had cats as pets (as if that’s somehow relevant), and a so-called doctor termed her “depressed”.</p>
<p>The case, Javeri noted, highlighted how ill-equipped responders and people involved in dealing with such situations are. There is a lack of regulation of mental health cases, with every other person presenting themselves as psychologists, and anybody can term someone a “<em>pagal</em>” (mad).</p>
<p>Other speakers on the panel were Police Service of Pakistan’s Superintendent (SP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1662841/us-embassy-nominates-islamabad-polices-amna-baig-for-international-women-of-courage-award">Amna Baig</a>; Karachi Bar Association Treasurer <a class="link--external" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=https://pk.linkedin.com/in/advocate-haseebullah-panhwar-7857aa100&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiZ3I644-6OAxWd9AIHHUO7C8AQFnoECBsQAQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;usg=AOvVaw3HOmPHAHAuUIo632OHs0po" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Haseebullah Panhwar</a>; rights activist and academic <a class="link--external" href="https://habib.edu.pk/AHSS/abira-ashfaq/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Abira Ashfaq</a>; and Air Commodore (retired) <a class="link--external" href="https://www.rashidabad.org/profile/air-cdr-shabbir-ahmed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shabbir Ahmed Khan</a>, founder of <a class="link--external" href="https://rmwo.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rashid Memorial Welfare Organisation</a>. The session was moderated by <a class="link--external" href="https://www.undp.org/pakistan/our-team" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rana Kaiser Ishaque</a> from the United Nations Development Programme in Pakistan.</p>
<p>SP Baig, who was among the first responders who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636267">arrested</a> Noor Mukadam’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912155/sc-upholds-zahir-jaffers-death-sentence-in-noor-mukadam-murder-case">murderer</a> Zahir Jaffer from the crime scene, pointed out that the case was still being discussed four years later “because she was educated”, compared to other “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926223/bahawalnagar-man-held-for-torturing-wife-to-death">worse cases</a>” she had seen while serving in Punjab.</p>
<p>While Baig believed that knowledge empowers people, she also noted that politicians and policymakers did not fully understand social equity.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>“If culture is repressive, it will be reflected in your public service systems, such as police,” she said, explaining that approaching a police station was linked to a woman’s dignity in Pakistan.</p>
<p>“It’s how the police and LEAs (law enforcement agencies) have been portrayed over time. [But] there are women on the other side as well,” she assured the women attending the session, and suggested that it should be taught to people how to report to the police.</p>
<p>The police officer brought attention to a lesser-known term — tech-facilitated gender-based violence <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906339/3171-complaints-of-tech-facilitated-gender-based-violence-reported-in-2024-drf">(TFGBV)</a> — which not only means violence done using technology but also women being killed for even using social media platforms.</p>
<p>An image of a young girl that most people following the news have seen popped up in the audience’s minds; the recent murder of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915163/faisalabad-suspect-held-for-17-year-old-social-media-influencers-islamabad-murder-over-repeated-rejections">Sana Yousaf</a> that rightly ignited fury among women across the country.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Ashfaq, a human rights activist and an associate professor at Habib University, took aim at the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866652/icj-derides-blow-to-judicial-independence-as-26th-constitutional-amendment-becomes-law">26th Amendment</a>, noting it had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908065/suo-motu-facility-no-longer-available-constitutional-bench-judge">snatched away</a> the suo motu power that had allowed judges to take notice of public issues.</p>
<p>She also underscored the lack of legal education: “We don’t know how courts, bureaucracy and parliamentary systems function. These are basic things. We haven’t gotten out of slogans to look at economic justice, climate justice.”</p>
<p>“You have rolled back protective laws. We think about taxing property rather than thinking that housing is a right,” Ashfaq pointed out. Similarly, she wondered, “Where is the right to food?”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Panhwar, ready with his arguments, comprehensively but succinctly listed the troubles afflicting Pakistan’s judicial system.</p>
<p>A serious matter, but an apt chuckle from the audience as the moderator quipped “Pakistan is also a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901963/a-hard-state">hard state</a>” as Panhwar described the local codes as “hard laws”.</p>
<p>The lawyer pointed out that Articles 8 to 28 of the Constitution guaranteed several rights such as freedom of expression and movement, and that Pakistan was a signatory to various international conventions, but “we do not see any kind of implementation at all here”.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Panhwar called out the “ruling parties” for bringing the 26th Amendment that now gave them <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866480#:~:text=3%20stated%20above.-,Appointment%20of%20SC%20judges,-The%20JCP%2C%20besides">more votes</a> to decide who gets to be a judge in the superior courts.</p>

<p>Retired Air Commodore Ahmed offered some words of wisdom, which one would want to blast on loudspeakers at public service institutions across the country.</p>
<p>The creation of Pakistan has given us complete independence, he said, but “we have denied and killed that over time through our actions and self-interest”.</p>
<p>He stressed, “If we are addressing a problem, then we must address it holistically.”</p>
<p>The retired officer also offered us, and Pakistan, hope: “All negative, all dark. But there is a silver lining; that we are talking about it.”</p></p>

            <p><p>The first witness in the trial of Bangladesh’s fugitive ex-prime minister Sheikh Hasina gave evidence on Sunday, a man shot in the face during protests that toppled her last year.</p>
<p>Hasina, 77, who has defied <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921635">court orders</a> to return from India to attend her trial on charges amounting to crimes against humanity, is accused of ordering a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923071/bangladesh-recordings-suggest-ex-pm-hasina-ordered-deadly-crackdown">deadly crackdown</a> in a failed bid to crush the student-led <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245">uprising</a>.</p>
<p>Up to 1,400 people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849978">killed</a> between July and August 2024, according to the United Nations.</p>
<p>The first witness, among the 11 cases that the prosecution is expected to present to the court, was Khokon Chandra Barman, whose story reflects the violence of the protests.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old wears a mask to conceal his face, which was ripped apart by a gunshot during the culmination of the protests on August 5, 2024, the same day that Hasina fled Dhaka by helicopter.</p>
<p>“I want justice for the ordeal I’ve been going through, and for my fellow protesters who sacrificed their lives,” he told the court.</p>
<p>Barman lost his left eye, while his right eye was damaged, as well as his lips, nose and teeth. A video showing Barman’s blood-covered face was played in court, with the opening statements aired on the state-run broadcaster.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Prosecutors have filed five charges against Hasina — including failure to prevent mass murder — which amount to crimes against humanity under Bangladeshi law.</p>
<p>“Sheikh Hasina was the nucleus around whom all the crimes committed during the July-August uprising revolved,” chief prosecutor Tajul Islam told the court on Sunday.</p>
<p>Hasina is on trial in absentia alongside two other accused.</p>
<p>One, her former interior minister, Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, is also a fugitive.
The other, Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, the former inspector general of police, is in custody. He has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923406">pleaded guilty</a>.</p>
<p>Attorney General Md Asaduzzaman said he wanted a “fair trial”, speaking to reporters outside the court.</p>
<p>“People were killed and maimed, we demand the highest punishment for the crimes committed,” Asaduzzaman said.</p>
<p>Amir Hossain, the state-appointed lawyer for Hasina, noted that Barman was shot during the chaotic final day of the weeks-long protests.</p>
<p>He pointed out that several police officers were also killed in clashes with protesters and it was “unclear who actually shot Barman”.</p>
<p>Hossain said he was not in contact with Hasina, who has refused to accept the authority of the court.</p></p>
