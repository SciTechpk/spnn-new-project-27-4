                <h2>Pakistani diplomat in Afghanistan granted rank of ambassador amid improving ties</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan on Friday announced its elevation of diplomatic representation in Afghanistan from Charge d‚ÄôAffaires to Ambassador level as bilateral ties move on a positive trajectory.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Afghanistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912541/china-makes-taliban-regime-islamabad-agree-on-ties-upgrade">agreed</a> to upgrade their <a class="link--external" href="https://The%20understanding%20was%20reached%20during%20an%20informal%20trilateral%20meeting%20of%20foreign%20ministers%20from%20Pakistan,%20China,%20and%20Afghanistan%20in%20Beijing.%20The%20talks%20were%20part%20of%20Beijing%E2%80%99s%20broader%20effort%20to%20ease%20regional%20tensions%20and%20advance%20connectivity%20through%20its%20Belt%20and%20Road%20Initiative." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">diplomatic relations</a> by exchanging envoys ‚Äî a key step towards normalising ties after years of strained relations between Islamabad and the Taliban administration in Kabul.</p>
<p>Ties between the two neighbouring countries had turned sour due to frequent border skirmishes and Islamabad repeatedly demanding that Kabul take action against the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) for using Afghan soil to launch attacks in Pakistan. Kabul has denied the allegations.</p>
<p>The recent understanding was reached during an informal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910314">trilateral meeting</a> of foreign ministers from Pakistan, China, and Afghanistan in Beijing earlier this month. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met Afghanistan‚Äôs interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in the Chinese capital.</p>
<p>In a post on X, Dar said, ‚ÄúPakistan-Afghanistan relations are on positive trajectory after my very productive visit to Kabul with Pakistan delegation on 19th April 2025.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo maintain this momentum, I am pleased to announce the decision of the Government of Pakistan to upgrade the level of its Charg√© d‚ÄôAffaires in Kabul to the level of Ambassador.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am confident this step would further contribute towards enhanced engagement, deepen Pak-Afghan cooperation in economic, security, [counterterrorism] and trade areas and promote further exchanges between two fraternal countries.‚Äù</p>

<p>Although no country has formally recognised the Taliban regime since its return to power in 2021, several including China, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia maintain ambassadors in Kabul.  China and the UAE also host Taliban-appointed ambassadors, while Russia has agreed to accept a Taliban ambassador in Moscow.</p>
<p>Recent diplomatic efforts have aimed to turn the tide. In March 2025, Special Envoy for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq visited Kabul for the first time in over a year. His mission was followed by a high-level visit by Dar on April 19, where both sides pledged to prevent their territories from being used for terrorist activities and agreed on trade facilitation measures.</p></p>

<p>‚ÄúDeputy Prime Minister [and] Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar, today signed, on behalf of Pakistan, the convention on the establishment of the International Organisation for Mediation in Hong Kong,‚Äù the statement by the FO read.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Dar appreciated the Chinese leadership for its wisdom in developing and consistently leading efforts in establishing the IOMed and fostering a global community with a shared future, the statement added.</p>
<p>He added that the creation of IOMed underscores the indispensability and significance of multilateralism as the centrepiece for international peace, stability, and development.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIOMeD also offers new opportunities and fresh hopes to build a more inclusive, more just and more equitable world. As one of the founding members of IOMed, Pakistan would continue to be an active voice in this noble mission,‚Äù the statement quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>The deputy PM underlined Pakistan‚Äôs strong commitment to the promotion of peace and security as well as development. He elaborated on the critical importance of advancing and preserving multilateralism through faithful adherence to the principles of the UN Charter, full implementation of UN Security Council resolutions, as well as international law.</p>
<p>He also drew attention to India‚Äôs violation of international law through its acts of aggression against Pakistan and its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914001/fo-slams-modis-censure-of-iwt">unlawful holding in abeyance</a> of the Indus Waters Treaty. He also highlighted the occupation of Jammu and Kashmir and the occupied Palestinian Territories as drivers of conflict to regional peace and security.</p>
<p>Dar called for the resolution of the longstanding Jammu and Kashmir dispute under the UN Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>The idea for the establishment of the IOMed was one of the key outcomes of the 2nd Belt and Road Forum held in Beijing in April 2019. China initiated discussions for the establishment of IOMed in 2021, and invited Pakistan to join negotiations as one of its founding members, the statement added.</p>
<p>The organisation is open to all countries; is based on respect for the sovereignty, core interests and legitimate concerns of every country; aims to promote dialogue and trust between parties concerned based on equality; and desires inclusion of various legal systems, and their mediators, the FO said.</p>

<p>Noting Hong Kong‚Äôs growing significance in international mediation efforts, FM Dar highlighted the region‚Äôs role as a ‚Äúglobal hub, linking east and west‚Äù.</p>
<p>The pair discussed measures to ‚Äúdeepen economic investment and trade cooperation‚Äù between Pakistan and the administrative region of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHailing the launch of IOMed as a milestone inspired by President Xi Jinping‚Äôs vision, the DPM/FM noted its alignment with Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to dialogue-driven diplomacy and UN Charter‚Äôs principles,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>The foreign minister acknowledged the chief executive and SAR government for their ‚Äúimpressive economic and social development strides under the ‚ÄòOne Country, Two Systems‚Äô framework‚Äù while recalling Pakistan and Hong Kong‚Äôs ‚Äúlong-standing friendship.‚Äù</p>
