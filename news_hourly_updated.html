                <h2>Bilawal calls out India for ‚Äòexcuses‚Äô to avoid dialogue with Pakistan</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Saturday called out India for its ‚Äúexcuses‚Äù to avoid any dialogue with Pakistan to resolve their outstanding issues after recent tensions between the two countries.</p>
<p>Pakis¬≠tan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">launched</a> a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi‚Äôs growing lobbying presence there. As part of its global outreach, the team will also visit London and Brussels. The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow">delegation</a> comprises former foreign ministers Bilawal, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh¬≠mina Janjua.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Washington after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915934/world-less-safe-after-escalation-in-subcontinent-says-bilawal">wrapping up engagements</a> with US lawmakers and think tanks, the PPP chairman said Pakistan‚Äôs civil and military leadership were all on the same page against terrorism and believed that it was in the region‚Äôs interest to establish with India. ‚ÄúIt is India who‚Äôs been running away from calls for an investigation and it‚Äôs been India who‚Äôs been running away from efforts for dialogue. I believe that is perhaps the lamest excuse for not having a dialogue right now,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Bilawal offered to arrange a dialogue with the military or political leadership if India wanted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI believe the true path forward is for India and Pakistan to engage in a dialogue to establish peace. Whatever excuse you want to make sometimes, it‚Äôs this civil military excuse, sometimes it‚Äôs this geopolitical excuse, sometimes it‚Äôs this ‚ÄòOh all Muslims are terrorist excuse so we‚Äôre not going to talk to Pakistan‚Äô ‚Äî it‚Äôs getting [tiresome]. You can‚Äôt be two nuclear armed neighbours with a conflict threshold so low and absolutely no dispute resolution mechanism.‚Äù</p>
<p>Bilawal said India did not want mediation from the US or the United Nations or any interactional actor and did not even want to engage directly with Pakistan, noting that this made no rational sense.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in all our interest to convince India to undo the decision that doesn‚Äôt serve their purposes and come to the table and talk.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Bilawal said the recent ceasefire between the two countries was only the first step.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor durable peace in South Asia, we need to have a comprehensive dialogue with our neighbour where we address all our friction points. Indeed, when Pakistan agreed to the ceasefire, we did so on the condition that going forward, there would be a dialogue in a neutral location on all friction points.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre very confident that that is the only way forward, not only for Pakistan, but also for India. While we‚Äôre very grateful for the ceasefire, we‚Äôre cognizant of the fact that we are all, Pakistan and India, but our region and the globe, by extension, a less safe place today than we were when this conflict started.‚Äù</p>
<p>The former FM said the threshold for ‚Äúfull-blown war between two nuclear-armed powers‚Äù had been drastically decreased and was at a stage it was never before at in history.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs things stand today, if there‚Äôs a terrorist attack anywhere in India or Indian-occupied Kashmir, proof or no proof, that means war. That doesn‚Äôt serve the interest of my country, and that certainly doesn‚Äôt serve the interests of the people of India.‚Äù</p>
<p>Bilawal once again said that Pakistan was ready to discuss the issue of terrorism in any ‚Äúcomprehensive dialogue‚Äù with India.</p>
<p>He stressed that if there was to be new dialogue with India and new promises and new treaties, ‚Äúthen it‚Äôs all the more important that we abide by our old treaties so we have confidence in each other that the new agreements that we are to make are worth more than the paper that they are written on‚Äù.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#indian-disinformation-during-military-conflict" id="indian-disinformation-during-military-conflict" title="Permalink"></a>Indian disinformation during military conflict</h2>
<p>On the topic of misinformation and disinformation during their recent conflict, Bilawal said a factor that played to Pakistan‚Äôs favour was that ‚Äúwe were transparent and we managed to maintain our credibility.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúWe were transparent with the media, we were transparent with our public, and we were transparent with our allies. The events corroborate what we say.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThree people are making claims in this situation, Pakistan, the United States, and India. Two of us are saying one thing, one of them is saying something else. So I think you can try to figure out who‚Äôs telling the truth. India employed disinformation not only during this conflict, they continue to employ disinformation as part of their delegations‚Äô tool.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey lied to the international community and their own people about this terrorist attack. To this day, they haven‚Äôt shared either with the media, with their allies, or with Pakistan, who they fought a war with, who the terrorists were that were involved with this incident in Indian-occupied Kashmir. They have not been honest or forthcoming about the damages they sustained during this conflict. They still, to this day, refuse to admit how many airplanes they lost in this conflict.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Bilawal said that to assess who was speaking more accurately, ‚Äúyou can see who‚Äôs had the same line consistently, whose views are being corroborated by the statements made not only from the presidency, but also from the State Department.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said Pakistan prided itself on its transparency during this period, adding that the country still open to questions and probing on the facts.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia has relied on disinformation throughout this conflict. Even during the war, the Indian media played the role of fake news and amplified some of this disinformation that originated from the Indian government.‚Äù</p></p>

<p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended heartfelt congratulations to the entire Pakistani nation and the Muslim Ummah around the world on the occasion of Eidul Azha.</p>
<p>They emphasised the importance of promoting values of sacrifice, love, brotherhood, and unity in the nation‚Äôs behaviour.</p>
<p>In his message, the president said that the day revives in people the spirit of faith, sacrifice, selflessness, and brotherhood.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe called for drawing lessons from the spirit of sacrifice and selflessness shown by Prophet Ibrahim (AS) and integrating them into our lives,‚Äù <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/07-06-2025/president-pm-exchange-eid-greetings-with-people" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> said.</p>

<p>He said there was a pressing need to support the underprivileged and marginalised segments of our society. ‚ÄúAlong with the act of animal sacrifice, Eid calls upon us to make a solemn pledge to always care for those in need.‚Äù</p>
<p>Zardari said as a nation, we must support each other, share in each other‚Äôs sorrows, and work together to build a prosperous and great Pakistan.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said, ‚ÄúThe message of Eidul Azha is not limited to the sacrifice of animals alone, it also teaches us to sacrifice our ego, desires, and personal interests for higher purposes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs our beloved homeland, Pakistan, moves forward on the path of development, we must embrace the spirit of unity, sacrifice, and selflessness.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said this Eid teaches us not only the importance of sacrificing life and wealth but also that nations achieve greatness when they work for collective welfare and selflessness alongside individual development.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz continued, ‚ÄúToday, we must especially remember our Palestinian brothers and sisters who are enduring ruthless and inhumane oppression and hunger.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added: ‚ÄúLikewise, we reaffirm our unwavering solidarity with the brave people of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, who have been engaged in a just and courageous struggle for their right to self-determination for decades.‚Äù</p>
<p>The prime minister, along with former chief minister Hamza Shehbaz, offered prayers in Lahore‚Äôs Model Town.</p>
