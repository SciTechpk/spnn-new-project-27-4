                <h2>Pakistan secures ‚Äòlandmark‚Äô tariff deal as US attitude shifts</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p><strong>‚Ä¢ No official word from US; PM Shehbaz thanks Trump<br />
‚Ä¢ Islamabad says agreement includes reduction of tariffs; diplomatic circles believe US will charge 15-20pc on Pakistani goods<br />
‚Ä¢ Trump rails against India, Russia; many countries still in a lurch as tariff deadline expires</strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON: A day after signing an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927725">agreement</a> with the United States to develop ‚Äúmassive oil deposits‚Äù in Pakistani territory, Pakistani officials said the two nations had concluded a trade deal on Thursday, establishing a uniform tariff rate for bilateral trade.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe agreement will result in a reduction of reciprocal tariffs, especially on Pakistani exports to the United States,‚Äù said an official statement released by the Pakistan Embassy in Washington.</p>
<p>In a statement issued in Islamabad, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called it ‚Äúa landmark deal, which will enhance our growing cooperation and expand the frontiers of our enduring partnership in the days to come‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

    </figure></p>
<p>He also thanked US President Donald Trump ‚Äúfor his leadership role in finalising this historic US-Pakistan trade agreement‚Äù.</p>
<p>The embassy noted that the deal would boost bilateral trade, expand market access, attract investment and foster cooperation in areas of mutual interest.</p>
<p>The breakthrough was reached during a meeting between Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, along with United States Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer, in Washington. Secretary Commerce Jawad Paul and Pakistan‚Äôs Ambassador to the United States Rizwan Saeed Sheikh were also present.</p>
<p>President Trump announced the trade deal via a post on Truth Social, though he only mentioned the agreement to explore oil deposits. Similarly, the Pakistani statement placed more emphasis on the oil arrangement.</p>
<p>While Pakistan is celebrating the deal, the United States has yet to make an official statement regarding the agreement.</p>
<p>Moreover, while President Trump has mentioned specific tariff rates in announcements with other countries, he did not provide such details regarding the agreement with Pakistan.</p>
<p>However, diplomatic sources said the United States has agreed to charge a 15 to 20 per cent tariff on goods from Pakistan. The sources noted that the deal gives Islamabad an edge over India, which has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927587">slapped</a> with a 25pc tariff rate and penalised for buying weapons and oil from Russia and Iran.</p>
<p>The embassy noted that the deal marks the beginning of a new era of economic collaboration, especially in energy, mining and minerals, IT, cryptocurrency and other sectors.</p>
<p>It complements Pakistan‚Äôs ongoing efforts to broaden the scope of Pakistan-US economic ties and to include partnerships at the US state level. The agreement enhances Pakistan‚Äôs access to the US market ‚Äî and vice versa.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to spur increased US investment in Pakistan‚Äôs infrastructure and development projects.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis trade agreement underscores the commitment of both nations to deepen their bilateral relationship and explore all avenues for strengthening trade and investment ties,‚Äù the official statement added.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄòChanging attitude in Washington‚Äô</strong></p>
<p>Hours after announcing the oil exploration deal, President Trump posted another message on his official site, clearly expressing his frustration with India.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúWe have done very little business with India. Their tariffs are too high ‚Äî among the highest in the world.‚Äù</p>

<p>Dr Aparna Pande, the director of the India Initiative at the Hudson Institute in Washington, told the <em>New York Times</em> that ‚Äúfor the first time in 35 years, [India] is faced with an American administration that is not driven by strategic altruism‚Äù.</p>
<p>The nuance in the bilateral relationship embraced by US presidents since Bill Clinton ‚Äî because of India‚Äôs rising importance to America‚Äôs national security ‚Äî ‚Äúappears to be fading‚Äù, Dr Pande said.</p>
<p>Analysts and officials in New Delhi told the <em>Times</em> that the changing attitude in Washington ‚Äúhas disrupted a relationship built painstakingly over decades, one that recognised India‚Äôs balancing act in a difficult region dominated by China and Russia‚Äù.</p>
<p>India had been allowed to grow closer to the United States on its own terms and had taken a firmer stance on China, the report added.</p>
<p>Christopher Clary, associate professor of Political Science at the University at Albany, said in a social media post that ‚Äúif you were to summarise the history of US-India and US-Pakistan ties, it would go something like this: India sometimes refuses to make positive-sum compromises out of principle, and Pakistan has often compromised ‚Äî or at least pretended to compromise ‚Äî to ensure positive ties with Washington.‚Äù</p>
<p>Other analysts argued that the discovery of vast deposits of rare earth materials and oil also caused the change in Washington‚Äôs thinking.</p>
<p>Some analysts also draw a parallel between recent developments in Iran and the shift in Washington, pointing out that Pakistan borders two sensitive countries, Afghanistan and Iran.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄòNew world trade order‚Äô</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trump‚Äôs dream of a new world trade order faced a crucial test on Thursday, with dozens of economies ‚Äî including key commercial partners like Canada ‚Äî yet to secure US tariff deals ahead of a midnight <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903146">deadline.</a></p>
<p>The last-gasp scramble to strike bilateral accords came as an appeals court in Washington considered the legality behind Trump‚Äôs strategy of invoking emergency economic powers to declare sweeping duties on imports.</p>
<p>The 79-year-old Republican doubled down on the wide-ranging levies, posting on Truth Social: ‚ÄúTariffs are making America GREAT &amp; RICH Again‚Äù.</p>

<p>He insisted in a separate post that the world‚Äôs biggest economy would have ‚Äúno chance of survival or success‚Äù without protectionist measures.</p>
<p>However, in a sign of flexibility, he announced on Friday that he was delaying a tariff hike on Mexican products originally due on Friday for 90 days after talks with counterpart Claudia Sheinbaum.</p>
<p>So far, Washington has announced pacts with Britain, Vietnam, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea and the European Union, with those new rates expected to take effect Friday.</p>
<p>South Korea squeezed in a last-minute agreement on a 15pc tariff, significantly below the 25pc that Trump threatened on its goods.</p>
<p>But Trump announced 50pc tariffs on Brazilian products ‚Äî while postponing imposition and allowing key exemptions ‚Äî as an effort to pressure the US ally to drop its prosecution of right-wing former president Jair Bolsonaro on coup charges.</p>
<p>He also unveiled a 25pc levy on Indian imports, and warned Canada it would face trade repercussions for planning to recognise a Palestinian state.</p>
<p>And the details of the agreements that have been made remain vague. For example, the EU, while having reached a pact, continues pushing for a carve-out for its wine industry.</p>

            </a>
            <p><p>GILGIT: More cloudburst-induced floods hit Ghizer and Hunza districts on Tuesday, causing widespread destruction.</p>
<p>According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA), the heavy rainfall led to flooding in Khatam village in Ghizer‚Äôs Gupis Valley, blocking the Ghizer-Shandur Road and damaging agricultural land and private properties.</p>
<p>The floodwaters also caused significant damage to the irrigation channel in Ghalapan village in Gojal, upper Hunza, which provides water for over 50,000 forest trees, according to residents.</p>
<p>The Gilgit-Baltistan government has declared 37 villages across the region as calamity-hit areas. According to a notification issued by the GB Home and Prisons Department, the affected areas include 12 villages in Diamer, nine in Gilgit, five in Ghizer, four each in Skardu and Shigar, two in Ghanche, and one each in Nagar and Kharmang.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said in a statement that the recent floods across Gilgit-Baltistan have caused an estimated Rs20 billion in damages. The floods have destroyed infrastructure, homes, agricultural land and public utilities.</p>
<p>Mr Faraq added that 22 vehicles were swept away by the floods, while 10 people, mostly tourists, have lost their lives. Four individuals have sustained injuries and between 10 and 15 tourists are still missing. Search operations are currently underway.</p>
<p>Over 500 homes and agricultural land, crops, roads, bridges and both public and private infrastructure have been significantly damaged.</p>
<p>The Gilgit-Baltistan government has initiated emergency and rehabilitation operations across the affected areas.</p>
<p>Pakistan has been grappling with severe flooding caused by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts,</a> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">glacial lake outburst floods</a> (Glofs) and intense monsoon rains since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919360">June</a>. These extreme weather events have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930">resulted</a> in several deaths and injuries across the country, with the Gilgit-Baltistan region among the hardest hit.</p>
