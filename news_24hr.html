            <p><p>US President Donald Trump said US air strikes on Sunday “totally obliterated” Iran’s main nuclear sites, as Washington joined Israel’s war with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.</p>
<p>Condemning the US attacks as a violation of international law, Iran <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/IRIMFA_EN/status/1936675016365515052" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> it was “resolved to defend Iran’s territory, sovereignty, security and people by all force”. It also responded with a volley of missiles at Israel that wounded scores of people in Tel Aviv.</p>

<hr />
<p>The US president had stepped up his rhetoric against Iran since Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">first struck</a> Iran on June 13, repeating his insistence that it could never have a nuclear weapon. Tehran has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a> the claim, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p>
<p>Israel had launched wide-scale air strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences, killing top <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">commanders</a>, scientists and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918702">hundreds</a> others. Both countries have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918048/iran-israel-trade-fresh-air-attacks-as-trump-weighs-us-involvement">traded</a> wave after wave of devastating strikes since then.</p>
<p>In a televised address to the nation from the White House earlier today, Trump warned that the United States would go after more targets if Iran did not make peace quickly.</p>

<p>The intervention by a US president who had vowed to avoid another “forever war” in the region threatens to dramatically widen the conflict, with Iran having said it would retaliate if Washington got involved.</p>
<p>“Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success,” said Trump, adding that they targeted the crucial underground nuclear enrichment plant of Fordow along with facilities at Natanz and Isfahan.</p>
<p>“Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace,” said Trump.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump on the strikes, saying that “the awesome and righteous might of the United States will change history”.</p>

<p>Trump spoke to Netanyahu after the attacks, while the US also gave Israel a “heads up” before the strikes, a senior White House official told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Not long after, sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and explosions were heard from Jerusalem as Iranian state TV announced a fresh salvo of missiles launched.</p>
<p>Tehran said there were “no signs of contamination” after the US attacks and Saudi regulators said “no radioactive effects were detected” in the Gulf region.</p>
<p>Iranian media <a class="link--external" href="https://en.mehrnews.com/news/233460/Official-in-Iran-s-Qom-confirms-attack-on-Fordow-site" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that part of the Fordow plant, as well as the Isfahan and Natanz <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918984/what-are-the-key-sites-in-irans-nuclear-programme">nuclear sites</a>, were attacked.</p>
<p>The US strikes push the Middle East to the brink of a major new conflagration in a region already aflame for more than 20 months with devastating conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as a toppled ruler in Syria.</p>
<p>Tehran had threatened reprisals on US forces in the Middle East if Trump attacked.</p>

<p>US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth hailed the strikes an “incredible and overwhelming success”, adding that the operation was intended at a regime change in Iran.</p>
<p>“We devastated the Iranian nuclear programme, but it is worth noting that the operation did not target the Iranian troops or people,” Hegseth told a press conference at the Pentagon.</p>
<p>The secretary reiterated Trump’s claims that Iran must never get a nuclear weapon, stating that by employing the president’s policy of “peace through strength”, Iran’s nuclear ambitions were “obliterated”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hegseth said the strikes were not a preamble to plans for regime change in Iran, adding that private messages had been sent to Tehran encouraging them to negotiate.</p>
<p>“This mission was not and has not been about regime change,” Hegseth stated. “The president authorised a precision operation to neutralise the threats to our national interests posed by the Iranian nuclear programme.”</p>
<p>“The operation President Trump planned was bold and it was brilliant, showing the world that American deterrence is back,” Hegseth added. “When this president speaks, the world should listen.”</p>

<p>Hegseth also read a statement from Trump, warning that any retaliation by Iran “will be met with force far greater than what was witnessed tonight”.</p>
<p>“Iran would be smart to heed these words,” the defence secretary warned, adding that US forces were postured to defend themselves, and take action if needed.</p>
<p>Hegseth said that the operation took months of preparation and required “a great deal of precision […] misdirection and highest of operational security”.</p>
<p>Describing the complex operation, dubbed “Midnight Hammer”, Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine said the “main strike package comprised” of seven <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/b-2-bombers-moving-guam-amid-middle-east-tensions-us-officials-say-2025-06-21/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">B-2 stealth bombers</a> flying 18 hours from the US mainland to Iran with multiple aerial refuellings.</p>
<p>The US strikes included 14 bunker-buster bombs, more than two dozen submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles and over 125 military aircraft, the top general added.</p>

<p>Trump had earlier told <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/israel-iran-conflict-june-21-2025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News</a></em>’ Sean Hannity show that five to six “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918152/read-why-israel-wants-us-bunker-busters-to-hit-irans-fordow-nuclear-site">bunker-buster</a>” bombs were dropped on the deep-underground Fordow facility, while 30 Tomahawk missiles were fired against other nuclear sites.</p>
<p>Caine said initial battle damage assessments indicated that all three sites sustained “extremely severe damage and destruction”, but he declined to speculate whether any Iranian nuclear capabilities might still be intact.</p>
<p>“Iran’s fighters did not fly, and it appears that Iran’s surface to air missile systems did not see us throughout the mission. We retained the element of surprise,” Caine added.</p>

<p>It said the US actions — “carried out in collusion with the genocidal Israeli regime— once again laid bare the depth of depravity that governs American foreign policy and revealed the extent of hostility harboured by the US ruling establishment against the peace-seeking and independence-loving people of Iran”.</p>
<p>“The world must not forget that it was the United States that, in the midst of a diplomatic process, betrayed diplomacy by supporting the genocidal and lawbreaking Israeli regime to impose a war of aggression on the Iranian nation,” the ministry said.</p>

<p>Iran called for an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to condemn this “criminal act of aggression”.</p>
<p>It also urged the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which it accused of “evident bias in favour of warmongering parties”, to “carry out its legal responsibility” as Iran’s nuclear facilities were under the agency’s safeguards and monitoring.</p>
<p>It highlighted that the US attacks violated the UN Charter and UNSC’s <a class="link--external" href="https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/en/content/2231/background" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Resolution 2231</a> from 2015 on Iran’s nuclear issue, also terming it a “devastating blow” to the global non-proliferation system.</p>
<p>“Silence in the face of such blatant aggression would plunge the world into an unprecedented level of danger and chaos,” the statement added.</p>
<p>Pakistan also condemned the US attacks, saying it was “gravely concerned at the possible further escalation of tensions in the region”.</p>
<p>“We reiterate that these attacks violate all norms of international law and that Iran has the legitimate right to defend itself under the UN Charter,” a <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by the Foreign Office said.</p>

<p>“The unprecedented escalation of tension and violence, owing to ongoing aggression against Iran, is deeply disturbing. Any further escalation of tensions will have severely damaging implications for the region and beyond,” it warned.</p>
<p>It stressed that “recourse to dialogue, diplomacy, in line with the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, remains the only viable pathway to resolve the crises in the region”.</p>
<p>“We emphasise the imperative need to respect civilian lives and properties and immediately bring the conflict to end. All parties must adhere to international law, particularly International Humanitarian Law,” the statement asserted.</p>

<p>Trump had said on Thursday that he would decide “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918331#:~:text=a%20White%20House%20spokesperson%20said%20the%20president%20would%20make%20a%20decision%20on%20whether%20to%20attack%20Iran%20%E2%80%9Cwithin%20two%20weeks%E2%80%9D">within two weeks</a>” whether to join Israel’s campaign, in a move that many saw as a window of diplomatic opportunity.</p>
<p>But the Republican’s decision to strike Iran came far sooner.</p>
<p>Flanked by JD Vance, Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump said that future attacks would be “far greater” unless Iran reached a diplomatic solution.</p>
<p>“Remember, there are many targets left,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump, however, made no mention of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917243">regime change</a>, despite having warned last week that Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was an “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917651">easy target</a>”.</p>
<p>The US contacted Iran diplomatically yesterday to say the strikes are all the US plans and it does not aim for regime change, <em>CBS News</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-launches-strikes-iranian-nuclear-facilities-trump-says/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20reached%20out%20to%20Iran%20diplomatically%20Saturday%20to%20say%20the%20strikes%20are%20all%20the%20U.S.%20plans%20and%20that%20regime%20change%20efforts%20are%20not%20planned%2C%20the%20sources%20said" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114724035571020048" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> earlier on his Truth Social site that a “full payload of bombs” was dropped on Fordow, adding that “all planes are safely on their way home.

<p>“There is not another military in the world that could have done this. Now is the time for peace!” he said.</p>
<p>In another post, the US president called it a “historic moment for the United States of America, Israel, and the world”. “Iran must now agree to end this war,” he <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114724124909451419" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>.</p>

<p>Iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons and says its programme is for civilian purposes only. The IAEA last week Tehran was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914610">in breach</a> of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years.</p>
<p>However, a US intelligence assessment found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was “years away from producing one”, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917691/us-assessment-finds-iran-years-away-from-nuclear-weapon-refutes-israeli-claims">report</a> from <em>CNN</em> released on Tuesday said.</p>
<p>Israel, which is not a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.</p>
<p>Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian had warned yesterday of a “more devastating” retaliation should Israel’s nine-day bombing campaign continue. He said Tehran’s right to pursue a civilian nuclear programme “cannot be taken away … by threats or war”.</p>
<p>Pictures posted by the White House showed Trump in a red “Make America Great Again” cap meeting with top national security officials in the Situation Room, shortly before the strikes were announced.</p>

<p>After the address, Trump warned Iran against “any retaliation”.</p>

<p>Iran and other armed groups have previously attacked US military bases in the region, including in Iraq.</p>
<p>Iran’s Houthi allies in Yemen had yesterday threatened to resume their attacks on US vessels in the Red Sea if Washington joined the war.</p>

<p>However, the issue has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918298/prospect-of-iran-strike-exposes-divisions-in-trumps-maga-base">opened a split</a> in Trump’s “MAGA” movement, with many key Republican supporters calling on Trump to avoid embroiling the United States in another foreign war.</p>
<p>Trump’s first <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1295226">2016 election victory</a> in particular came on the back of his promises to get America out of its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Republican <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1936564082477531596" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> said, “There would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first.”</p>

            <p><p>US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine on Sunday delivered a press briefing, providing details of the air strikes and bombing raids on Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump said US air strikes on Sunday “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842/trump-says-irans-key-nuclear-facilities-obliterated-by-us-airstrikes">totally obliterated</a>” Iran’s main nuclear sites, as Washington joined Israel’s war with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.</p>
<p>The US operation, called Midnight Hammer, was described by Gen Caine as the “largest B-2 operational strike in US history”, which inflicted “extremely severe damage and destruction” to the targets, US outlet <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pentagon-briefing-us-strikes-iran-nuclear-sites/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CBS News</a></em> reported.</p>

<p>“This was a highly classified mission with very few people in Washington knowing the timing or nature of this plan,” Gen Caine said, adding that seven B-2 Spirit stealth bombers flew east from their base in Missouri to participate in the mission in Iran.</p>
<p>“At midnight, Friday into Saturday, a large B-2 strike package, comprised of bombers, launched from the continental United States. As part of a plan to maintain tactical surprise, part of the package proceeded to the west and into the Pacific as a decoy,” he stated.</p>
<p>“Throughout its 18-hour flight, the aircraft completed multiple in-flight refuellings. Once over land, the B-2s linked up with escort and support aircraft once over land in the Middle East in a complex, tightly timed manoeuvre requiring exact synchronisation across multiple platforms in a narrow piece of airspace.” Caine explained, adding that this was done with minimal communication.</p>

<p>Speaking while displaying a map tracing the flight path and timelines of the US bombers, the chairman said: “At about 5pm Eastern Time (ET) [on] Saturday, just before the aircraft entered Iranian airspace, a US submarine in the Central Command (Centcom) area of responsibility launched more than two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles against key surface infrastructure targets at Isfahan.</p>
<p>“As the Operation Midnight Hammer strike package entered Iranian airspace, the US deployed several deception tactics, including decoys, as fourth and fifth-generation aircraft pushed out in front of the strike package at high altitude and high speed, sweeping for enemy fighters and surface-to-air missile threats.”</p>

<p>Gen Caine outlined that US Strategic Command, Transportation Command, Cyber Command, Space Command and the Space Force and US European Command all provided support during the strikes.</p>
<p>“We are currently unaware of any shots fired at the U.S. strike package on the way in,” he said.</p>
<p>Outlining the bombing raid, Gen Caine said that at about 6:40pm ET (2:10am in Iran) the lead B-2 “dropped two GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) weapons on the first of several aimpoints at Fordow”.</p>
<p>“As the president stated last night, the remaining bombers then hit their targets as well, with a total of 14 MOPs dropped against two nuclear target areas. All three Iranian nuclear infrastructure targets were struck between 6:40pm and 7:05pm ET … with the Tomahawk missiles being the last to strike at Isfahan to ensure that we retained the element of surprise throughout the operation.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>“Following weapons release, the Midnight Hammer strike package exited Iranian airspace and began its return home. We are unaware of any shots fired at the package on the way out,” he added. “Iran’s fighters did not fly, and it appears Iran’s surface-to-air missile systems did not see us.”</p>
<p>According to Gen Caine, the US employed 75 “precision-guided weapons” during Operation Midnight Hammer, including the MOPs, marking their first operational use by the US military.</p>
<p>“More than 125 US aircraft participated in this mission, including B-2 stealth bombers, multiple flights of fourth and fifth-generation fighters, dozens and dozens of air refuelling tankers … and a full array of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as hundreds of maintenance and operational professionals,” Gen Caine said.</p>
<p>The chairman warned that the US is prepared for any retaliatory attack by Iran, stating that any such attack would be an “incredibly poor choice”.</p>
<p>“We will defend ourselves; the safety of our service members and civilians is the highest priority. Many assets are still airborne, and we have hundreds deployed.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti on Sunday condemned the murder of Mir Attaur Rehman Mengal, the son of former Balochistan chief minister Naseer Mengal, in an armed clash when gunmen opened fire in district Khuzdar’s Wadh.</p>
<p>Atta Mengal was the brother of Mir Shafiqur Rehman Mengal, a prominent tribal leader and head of the Jhalawan Awami Panel, a political party.</p>
<p><em>Dawn.com</em> has reached out to the police for a comment on the alleged murder.</p>
<p>Bugti condemned the “cowardly terrorist attack” and expressed his heartfelt grief and sorrow over the killing of the younger Mengal.</p>
<p>“He prayed for the bereaved family and expressed his best wishes for the speedy recovery of the injured grandson,” a statement from his office read.</p>
<p>Bugti assured that the provincial government will conduct a thorough investigation into the incident and vowed that the terrorists will be brought to justice.</p>
<p>“The people and government of Balochistan stand in solidarity against terrorism,” he added.</p>
<p>Atta Mengal was killed while his son Mir Matiur Rehman Mengal was injured, after an ambush by terrorists allegedly belonging to the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), said a statement by Jhalawan Awami Panel spokesperson Nadeemur Rehman Baloch.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said Naseer Mengal’s family had “made countless sacrifices for the survival of Pakistan”.</p>
<p>In March, two leaders of JUI-F Balochistan were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895225">killed</a> in the Zehri area of Khuzdar district, according to officials.</p>
<p>The JUI-F leaders, Wa­­dera Ghulam Sarwar and Molvi Amanullah, were on their way home in the Tarsani area of Zehri when unknown assailants riding motorcycles opened fire on them with automatic weapons.</p>
<p>Both died on the spot after being shot multiple times.</p></p>

Many Zambians have raised the issue of this looting for years, but have met coordinated resistance. Consequently, Zambia’s treasury loses billions of dollars in revenue. These losses are driven by well-known multinationals working in concert with certain insiders close&nbsp;to the Zambian state.</p><p>Your editorial also says: “The US decision to cut $50m a year in aid to Zambia … is dreadful, and the reason given, corruption, rings hollow.” Alas, I disagree and wish to place this in context.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/ordinary-zambians-lose-out-twice-to-global-looting-and-local-corruption">Continue reading...</a></p>
