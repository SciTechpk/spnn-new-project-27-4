            <p><p>Amid a spate of terrorist and quadcopter attacks, police on Friday imposed a curfew in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu as a search and targeted operation is ongoing alongside security forces in the Hoveed area.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a>, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773/3-terrorists-killed-during-joint-operation-in-kps-bannu-police">July</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement issued today, Bannu police spokesperson Khanzala Quraishi said: “This operation has been launched on the basis of intelligence reports, the main objective of which is to cleanse the area from the scourge of terrorism and establish lasting peace.”</p>
<p>The operation began at 5am on Friday, according to Quraishi, and was launched on the instructions of Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan under the supervision of District Police Officer Saleem Abbasi Kalachi.</p>
<p>“During the operation, security forces and police personnel have completely surrounded the area and house-to-house searches are ongoing,” the statement said.</p>
<p>“In case of any suspicious activity or resistance, immediate and effective action is being taken so that the terrorists do not get any chance to escape or hide.”</p>
<p>A curfew has been imposed in the area for the sake of public safety, and citizens have been advised to cooperate with security agencies and stay indoors.</p>
<p>“Immediately report any suspicious person or activity to the relevant authorities,” the statement read.</p>
<p>“Authorities have warned that providing any kind of facility or assistance to terrorists is a serious crime, and strict legal action will be taken against such elements.”</p>
<p>Last week, a police constable was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928472">martyred</a> in a terrorist attack on a checkpoint in Bannu, where an exchange of fire also left three terrorists dead and three policemen injured.</p>
<p>In July, ter­rorists used a quadcopter to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923850">attack</a> a police station in Miryan, Bannu, making it the fifth such attack at the installation in a month.</p></p>

            <p><p>Balochistan government spokesman Shahid Rind on Friday said that mobile data services in the province have been suspended until August 31 over “security reasons”.</p>
<p>In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925001">worsened</a>, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419/jaffar-express-hijacking-state-media-reports-190-rescued-2nd-day-of-operation-underway-in-balochistan">attacks</a>. In February, nearly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896269/62pc-of-deaths-from-terror-attacks-in-balochistan">62 per cent</a> of the total terrorism-related deaths in the country occurred in Balochistan.</p>
<p>The move came after a notification issued by the Balochistan Home Department on Aug 6, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, ordered the immediate suspension of data services until Aug 31, citing the “peculiar law and order situation” in the province.</p>
<p>“It is, therefore, requested to please direct the concerned authorities for suspension/closure of 3G and 4G services in the entire province … to avoid any untoward incident,” the notification read.</p>
<p>“The service has been suspended because they (militants) use it for coordination and sharing information,” Rind said, according to <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>The suspension follows the government announcement from last month <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927007">banning</a> Pakistani Zaireen (pilgrims) from travelling by road from Quetta to Iran and Iraq due to national security concerns.</p>

<p>On March 11, the Pesha­war-bound Jaffar Express train became the target of an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897237/rescue-operation-for-hostages-underway-after-terrorists-attack-jaffar-express-in-balochistan">unprecedented hijacking</a>, when terrorists fired on the locomotive and took over 400 passengers hostage.</p>
<p>Media reports said that security forces had surrounded the area and launched a clearance operation to rescue all passengers. <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported that security forces had rescued 80 hostages held by the terrorists.</p>
<p>Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on March 12 that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419">clearance operation</a>, launched after the train’s unprecedented hijacking in Balochistan, ended with all 33 terrorists being killed.</p></p>

            <p><p>Two terrorists planning to attack the police in Punjab’s Mianwali district were killed during an operation, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) said on Friday.</p>
<p>The CTD regularly carries out operations across the province to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence. Operating under the provincial police department, the Punjab CTD plays a key role in maintaining internal security and countering terrorism within the country.</p>
<p>In a statement today, the law enforcement agency said, “Punjab CTD killed two terrorists during an operation near Kundian in Mianwali.”</p>
<p>It said that the CTD acted on a tip-off after receiving intelligence that the terrorists were planning to attack police and other institutions.</p>
<p>“During the operation, the CTD and terrorists engaged in an exchange of fire, as a result of which two terrorists were killed by their own accomplices, while six of them managed to escape.”</p>
<p>According to the statement, the CTD recovered “explosive materials, two rifles, hand grenades and bullets” from the terrorists.</p>
<p>“The terrorists had completed their plans to target the police and other institutions,” it said.</p>
<p>The CTD spokesperson said that the process of identifying the two terrorists was underway, while a search operation was launched to arrest the terrorists who escaped.</p>
<p>Punjab CTD was “diligently pursuing its goal of a safe Punjab and is committed to uprooting the menace of terrorism”, the statement added.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>The country <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">ranked</a> second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>
<p>Last month, Punjab CTD killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922297/5-terrorists-killed-as-punjab-ctd-foils-major-terror-attack-in-taunsa-sharif">five terrorists</a> and successfully thwarted a terror plot in Taunsa Sharif in a “major counter-terrorism breakthrough”.</p>
<p>In April,  the law enforcement agency foiled major attacks by arresting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904191">10 terrorists</a> belonging to banned organisations during 189 operations in different areas of Punjab.</p></p>
