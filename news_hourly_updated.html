                <h2>ECP disqualifies 3 PTI lawmakers following their convictions</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday notified the disqualification of three PTI lawmakers over their convictions in various cases, according to documents available with <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>Last week, a Lahore anti-terrorism court acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi while <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925887">sentencing</a> Dr Yasmin Rashid, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry and others to 10 years in prison over a May 9 riots case related to violence on Sherpao Bridge.</p>
<p>According to the notifications, Chaudhry, member of the National Assembly (MNA) Mohammad Ahmed Chatta and member of the Provincial Assembly  (MPA) of Punjab Ahmad Khan were disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution (a person shall be disqualified from being elected [if] ‚Ä¶ he has been, on conviction for any offence involving moral turpitude, senteced to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years).</p>
<p>The first notification acknowledged Chaudhry‚Äôs conviction in the case ‚ÄòThe State vs Dr Yasmin Rashid, etc‚Äô, reading: ‚ÄúAs a consequence, Senator Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhry, has become disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan for being member of [the] Senate.</p>
<p>‚ÄúResultantly, Notification No.F.3(2)/2021-Cord. dated 10th March, 2021 to the extent of Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhary, as Senator, is hereby recalled with immediate effect,‚Äù the notice added, referring to the document notifying Chaudhry‚Äôs seat.</p>
<p>The second notice also acknowledged Chatta and Khan‚Äôs 10-year sentences on July 22, but in the case ‚ÄòThe State vs Zafarullah Khan and others‚Äô.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs a consequence, Mohammad Ahmed Chattha, MNA from NA-66 Wazirabad and Ahmad Khan, MPA, Provincial Assembly Punjab from PP-87 Mianwali-Ill have become disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution ‚Ä¶ for being members of National Assembly and Provincial Assembly of Punjab respectively,‚Äù the ECP notification read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúResultantly, notification No.F.2(5)/2024-Cord(1) dated 16th February 2024 to the extent of Mohammad Ahmed Chattha and notification No. F.2(6)/2024-Cord dated 17th February, 2024 to the extent of Ahmad Khan as returned candidates, are hereby recalled with immediate effect.‚Äù</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ah¬≠¬≠med Khan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921937">filed</a> a reference with the ECP against 26 PTI legislators over ‚Äòunparliamentary conduct‚Äô during the assembly‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920928">session</a> on June 27.</p>
<p>The disqualification reference was moved against the same lawmakers who were suspended for disrupting Chief Mi¬≠¬≠nister Maryam Nawaz‚Äôs speech and causing chaos in the house.</p>
<p>However, the speaker formally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925367">rejected</a> the petitions following successful negotiations between the government and the opposition.</p>
<p>In 2023, PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1769083">disqualified</a> for five years following his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">conviction</a> in the Toshakhana case.</p>
<p>In a notification, the ECP cited a court order and declared Imran disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution read with Section 232 of the Elections Act, 2017.</p></p>

            </a>
            <p><p>The Punjab Assembly session on Monday was thrown into chaos when two brawls erupted between lawmakers, leading to the suspension of a Member of the Provincial Assembly (MPA), according to a <em>Dawn.com</em> correspondent present at the scene.</p>
<p>Earlier today, opposition member Khalid Nisar Dogar struck ruling PML-N‚Äôs Hasan Riaz during the session, before the two were separated by other lawmakers. Footage of the incident has since gone viral.</p>

<p>Acting speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar called the altercation ‚Äúhighly inappropriate‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to the correspondent, the session was adjourned until 2pm on Tuesday by Channar, who summoned government and opposition MPAs to his chambers. He suspended Dogar for 15 sessions under Rule 210 (power to order withdrawal of members or suspend sitting) of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of Punjab, 1997.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters following the fracas, Riaz called it ‚Äúa dark day‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was addressing the speaker, but an opposition lawmaker was hurling insults at me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen I saw him, he came and attacked me. These people have no control over themselves; they‚Äôve been the same since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9</a> [riots in 2023].‚Äù</p>
<p>Another altercation later erupted in the assembly‚Äôs press hall, where a government MPA‚Äôs staff members reportedly hurled insults at opposition lawmakers.</p>
<p>As a result, opposition MPAs Sardar Mohammad Ali Khan and Muhammad Ejaz Shafi also hurled abuse as both sides came face-to-face again. However, security personnel arrived at the press hall and separated both groups of lawmakers.</p>
<p>Video footage recorded in the press hall shows Khan and Shafi claiming that two people came and hurled abuse at their fellow lawmakers before leaving the press hall.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThey insulted our MPA,‚Äù Khan emphasised. ‚ÄúYou all witnessed that two miscreants abused an honourable member. If you do not raise your voices, this will happen to you too.‚Äù</p>
<p>This is not the first time that unruly behaviour has been seen in the Punjab Assembly.</p>
<p>In June, Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan ordered the suspension of 26 opposition MPAs for 15 sittings after their protests disrupted the proceedings as Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif was presenting the budget.</p>
<p>According to an order issued by Malik on June 27, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920792">suspended</a> MPAs ‚Äúbecame disorderly, beyond all parliamentary reasoning and practices‚Äù, including tearing the agenda papers and hurling torn pieces towards the treasury benches as well as using ‚Äúoffensive, abusive, and unparliamentary language and slogans‚Äù.</p>
<p>The order was issued under Rule 210 of the Punjab Assembly Rules of Procedure, 1997.</p></p>
