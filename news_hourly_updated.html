<p>After months of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917469/fact-check-trump-netanyahu-viral-comments-about-pakistan-on-iran-israel-clash-are-fake">attacking</a> Gaza ‚Äî flattening homes, targeting hospitals, and starving a besieged population ‚Äî Israel expanded its assault by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">launching</a> wide-scale air strikes against Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences on June 13, killing top commanders, scientists and civilians. A day earlier, President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">said</a> US air strikes  ‚Äútotally obliterated‚Äù Iran‚Äôs main nuclear sites, as Washington joined <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919362/we-will-end-this-war-iran-warns-gambler-trump">Israel‚Äôs war</a> with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.</p>
<p>The strikes on Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities, which came four days after Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917868">meeting</a> with Trump and a day after the government said it decided to formally recommend Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize for his role during the recent conflict with India, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919259/pakistan-backed-security-council-resolution-seeks-immediate-de-escalation">condemned</a> by Pakistan. A meeting of the NSC,  the highest forum for security deliberations comprising the civil and military top brass, was subsequently convened.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif chaired the meeting, with Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir also attending the important moot, and reviewed the evolving regional situation following the Israeli aggression against Iran.</p>

<p>Sources in the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office had told <em>Dawn</em> that Field Marshal Munir would brief the committee on the details of his meeting with Trump.</p>
<p>A press release from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office said: ‚ÄúThe committee strongly condemned Israel‚Äôs acts of aggression and expressed regret that these military attacks coincided with a constructive negotiation process between Iran and the US. These reckless actions have escalated tensions, threatening to ignite a wider conflict and diminishing the opportunities for dialogue and diplomacy. The NSC reaffirmed Iran‚Äôs right to self-defence as enshrined in the UN Charter.‚Äù</p>
<p>The committee members also conveyed their condolences to the Iranian government and people on the loss of innocent lives and offered prayers for the recovery of those injured.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile reiterating Pakistan‚Äôs stated position, the NSC expressed grave concern over the potential for further escalation after the attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan on June 22 which violated the resolutions of the International Atomic Energy Agency, relevant international law and the UN Charter.‚Äù</p>
<p>The committee members also reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs close engagement with relevant parties in the situation and endorsed the government‚Äôs readiness to continue efforts and initiatives aimed at promoting regional peace and stability.</p>
<p>The NSC called on all relevant parties to resolve the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy in line with the UN Charter, underscoring the need to adhere to international human rights and humanitarian laws.</p>

<p>The US president had stepped up his rhetoric against Iran since Israel first struck the country, repeating his insistence that it could never have a nuclear weapon. Tehran has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a> the claim, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p>
<p>Condemning the US attacks as a violation of international law, Iran said it was ‚Äúresolved to defend Iran‚Äôs territory, sovereignty, security and people by all force‚Äù. It also responded with a volley of missiles at Israel that wounded scores of people in Tel Aviv.</p></p>

                <h2>Bangladesh probe into Hasina-era abuses, warns ‚Äòimpunity‚Äô remains</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A Bangladesh government-appointed commission investigating hundreds of disappearances by the security forces under ousted premier Sheikh Hasina on Monday warned that the same ‚Äúculture of impunity‚Äù continues.</p>
<p>The Commission of Inquiry into Enforced Disappearances is probing abuses during the rule of Hasina, whose government was accused of widespread human rights abuses.</p>
<p>That includes the extrajudicial killing of hundreds of political opponents and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886780">unlawful abduction</a> and disappearance of hundreds more.</p>
<p>The commission was established by interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, 84, who is facing intense political pressure as parties jostle for power ahead of elections expected early next year.</p>
<p>Bangladesh has a long history of military <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/689395/bangladesh-coup-plot-foiled-army">coups</a> and the army retains a powerful role.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúEnforced disappearances in Bangladesh were not isolated acts of wrongdoing, but the result of a politicised institutional machinery that condoned, normalised, and often rewarded such crimes,‚Äù the commission said, in a section of a report released by the interim government on Monday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlarmingly, this culture of impunity continues even after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245">regime change</a> on August 5, 2024‚Äù.</p>
<p>The commission has verified more than 250 cases of enforced disappearances spanning the 15 years that Hasina‚Äôs Awami League was in power.</p>
<p>Commission chief Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury said earlier this month that responsibility lay with individual officers, who were ‚Äúinvolved in conducting enforced disappearances‚Äù, but not the armed forces as an institution.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/06/16/bangladesh-extend-the-mandate-of-the-commission-of-inquiry-on-enforced" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joint statement</a> by rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, called on the security forces to ‚Äúfully cooperate with the commission by guaranteeing unfettered and ongoing access to all detention centres ‚Ä¶ and providing free access to records regarding those seized or detained‚Äù.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#hasina-era-ex-election-chief-detained" id="hasina-era-ex-election-chief-detained" title="Permalink"></a>Hasina era ex-election chief detained</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, A Bangladesh court on Monday remanded in custody the former elections chief for his alleged role in rigging the vote in favour of Hasina.</p>
<p>KM Nurul Huda, 77, was ordered to be detained for four days while questioning continues, a day after a mob, who smashed into his home and assaulted him, eventually handed him over to the police.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the powerful Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) filed a case against Huda and other former election commissioners it accuses of rigging past polls in favour of Hasina.</p>
<p>Hours after the case was filed, a mob stormed Huda‚Äôs home in the capital, Dhaka and dragged him onto the street. They put a garland of shoes around his neck and beat him up before handing him over to the police.</p>
<p>The interim government condemned the incident and urged people not to take the law into their own hands.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSwooping on an accused and physically assaulting him is illegal, contrary to the rule of law, and a criminal offence,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>Interim leader Muhammad Yunus has said elections will be held in early April 2026.</p>
<p>Police put a helmet on Huda while taking him to the court for his protection.
Human rights organisations also condemned the attack on Huda.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was a complete violation of ‚Ä¶ the rule of law,‚Äù Abu Ahmed Faijul Kabir from the rights group Ain O Salish Kendra said in a statement.</p>
<p>Hasina, 77, remains in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856408">self-imposed exile</a> in India, where she fled after she was ousted last year.</p>
<p>She has defied orders to return to Dhaka to face charges amounting to crimes against humanity. Her trial in absentia continues.</p></p>
