                <h2>Two suspected terrorists killed in shootout with Bannu police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Two suspected terrorists were shot dead after an exchange or fire with police and Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) personnel in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs  Bannu district, a police officer said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Police and CTD conducted a joint operation against the criminals in Domel tehsil of Bannu, leading to an exchange of fire from both sides for over 20 minutes, a statement by Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúResultantly, two terrorists were shot dead, while their accomplices managed to escape after taking advantage of darkness and nearby bushes,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>The suspects were identified as Hussain Ahmed, and Inaam alias Tooru, resident of Haider Khel, North Waziristan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe slain terrorists were involved in several major attacks and IED blasts,‚Äù the police officer added.</p>
<p>The police recovered two AK-47 rifles, four hand grenades, six magazines, 150 bullets, and two mobile phones on the suspected terrorists.</p>
<p>The alleged terrorist Inaam was wanted by the police and CTD in five different cases for attacking and killing police officers, while Hussain Ahmed was wanted in three different terrorist incidents.</p>
<p>RPO Sajid said the Bannu police and CTD had averted a possible major terrorist attack due to timely action. He said an operation has been intensified to arrest the escaped suspects.</p>
<p>He vowed that CTD and police are determined to establish law and order in the area and completely eradicate terrorism.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, several suspects were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917310">arrested</a> and a cache of heavy weapons seized during a joint search and strike operation carried out by the police, counter terrorism department, and the army in Bannu.</p></p>

                <h2>Iran-linked hackers threaten to release Trump aides‚Äô emails</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Iran-linked hackers have threatened to disclose more emails stolen from US President Donald Trump‚Äôs circle, after distributing a prior batch to the media ahead of the 2024 US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870600">election</a>.</p>
<p>In online chats with <em>Reuters</em> on Sunday and Monday, the hackers, who go by the pseudonym Robert, said they had roughly 100 gigabytes of emails from the accounts of White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Trump lawyer Lindsey Halligan, Trump adviser Roger Stone and porn star-turned-Trump antagonist Stormy Daniels.</p>
<p>Robert raised the possibility of selling the material but otherwise did not provide details of their plans. The hackers did not describe the content of the emails.</p>
<p>US Attorney General Pam Bondi described the intrusion as ‚Äúan unconscionable cyber-attack‚Äù.</p>
<p>The White House and the FBI responded with a statement from FBI Director Kash Patel, who said: ‚ÄúAnyone associated with any kind of breach of national security will be fully investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis so-called cyber ‚Äòattack‚Äô is nothing more than digital propaganda, and the targets are no coincidence. This is a calculated smear campaign meant to damage President Trump and discredit honorable public servants who serve our country with distinction,‚Äù cyberdefense agency CISA said in a post on X.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--twitter  "><span>

<p>Halligan, Stone and a representative for Daniels did not respond to requests for comment. Iran‚Äôs mission to the United Nations did not return a message seeking comment. Tehran has in the past denied committing cyberespionage.</p>
<p>Robert materialised in the final months of the 2024 presidential campaign, when they claimed to have breached the email accounts of several Trump allies, including Wiles.</p>
<p>The hackers then distributed emails to journalists.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> previously authenticated some of the leaked material, including an email that appeared to document a financial arrangement between Trump and lawyers representing former presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr ‚Äî now Trump‚Äôs health secretary.</p>
<p>Other material included Trump campaign communication about Republican office-seekers and discussion of settlement negotiations with Daniels.</p>
<p>Although the leaked documents did garner some coverage last year, they did not fundamentally alter the presidential race, which Trump won.</p>
<p>The US Justice Department in a September 2024 indictment alleged that Iran‚Äôs Revolutionary Guards ran the Robert hacking operation. In conversations with Reuters, the hackers declined to address the allegation.</p>
<p>After Trump‚Äôs election, Robert told <em>Reuters</em> that no more leaks were planned. As recently as May, the hackers told <em>Reuters</em>, ‚ÄúI am retired, man.‚Äù But the group resumed communication after this month‚Äôs 12-day air war between Israel and Iran, which was capped by U.S. bombing of Iran‚Äôs nuclear sites.</p>
<p>In messages this week, Robert said they were organising a sale of stolen emails and wanted <em>Reuters</em> to ‚Äúbroadcast this matter‚Äù.</p>
<p>American Enterprise Institute scholar Frederick Kagan, who has written about Iranian cyberespionage, said Tehran suffered serious damage in the conflict and its spies were likely trying to retaliate in ways that did not draw more US or Israeli action.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA default explanation is that everyone‚Äôs been ordered to use all the asymmetric stuff that they can that‚Äôs not likely to trigger a resumption of major Israeli/US military activity,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLeaking a bunch more emails is not likely to do that.‚Äù</p>
<p>Despite worries that Tehran could unleash digital havoc, Iran‚Äôs hackers took a low profile during the conflict. US cyber officials warned on Monday that American companies and critical infrastructure operators might still be in Tehran‚Äôs crosshairs.</p></p>
