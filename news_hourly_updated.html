                <h2>White House says no Trump visit scheduled to Pakistan ‚Äòat this time‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The White House on Thursday said that no visit of United States President Donald Trump was scheduled to Pakistan ‚Äúat this time‚Äù after widespread reports of a trip.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, some local television news channels reported, citing sources, that Trump was expected to visit Pakistan in September. The news channels said that Trump would also visit India after arriving in Islamabad in September. The channels later withdrew their reports.</p>
<p>The White House dismissed the rumours. ‚ÄúA trip to Pakistan has not been scheduled at this time,‚Äù a White House official said.</p>
<p>Talking to <em>Dawn.com</em> on the reported visit earlier, Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said: ‚ÄúWe have no information about this matter.‚Äù</p>
<p>Similarly, a US embassy spokesperson in Islamabad told <em>Reuters</em>, ‚ÄúWe have nothing to announce,‚Äù and said that the White House might be able to provide confirmation on the president‚Äôs schedule.</p>
<p>George W Bush was the last US president to visit Pakistan in 2006.</p>

<p>US-Pakistan relations saw a major boost when Trump hosted Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House last month in an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093">unprecedented meeting</a>.</p>
<p>India is due to host the summit of the so-called Quad countries this year, but dates for the meeting have not been announced yet.</p>
<p>The Quad grouping includes the US, India, Australia and Japan and is focused on countering China‚Äôs rise in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Britain‚Äôs King Charles will host Trump from September 17 to 19 for his unprecedented second state visit to Britain, Buckingham Palace said on Monday.</p></p>
