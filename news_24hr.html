<p>PESHAWAR / ISLAM­ABAD: At least 11 more people were killed due to heavy monsoon rainfall in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) on Tuesday as the national death toll surged to 234 since late June, according to the National Disaster Mana­gement Authority (NDMA).</p>
<p>Heavy rains triggered flash floods in several districts of KP and Gilgit-Baltistan, damaging homes and increasing water levels in rivers and streams, prompting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to instruct NDMA to coordinate with provincial governments and relevant departments for immediate relief to the affected people.</p>
<p>According to the Prov­incial Disaster Management Auth­­ority (PDMA), six deaths, including four children, were reported from Swat, while two deaths were reported from Bajaur and each from Buner and Upper Kohistan.</p>

<p>Two fatalities have been reported in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, involving one man and one child. In Islamabad, one child was killed due to heavy rain and flooding.</p>
<p><strong>Glof, flood forecast</strong></p>
<p>In Punjab, houses and standing crops in hundreds of villages have been inundated because of low-to-medium level flooding in various rivers.</p>
<p>The deluge in Ravi, Sutlej, Chenab and Indus rivers forced evacuations and displaced hundreds of people in riverine areas of Muzaffargarh, Dera Ghazi Khan and Rahim Yar Khan.</p>
<p>Over 20 villages in Jhang district have been inundated due to the rising water levels in the Jhelum River. The Sutlej river has seen low-level flooding at Sulemanki, while there are concerns about the potential releases of water from Indian dams on the Beas and Sutlej rivers.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued a fresh alert for glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p>
<p>Separately, KP PDMA has also issued a Glof alert for Chitral Upper, Chitral Lower, Dir Upper, Swat and Kohistan Upper.</p>
<p>A PMD advisory issued on Tuesday said the ongoing rainfall spell is likely to continue and can affect KP and GB during the week.</p>
<p>The prevailing weather conditions will increase the risk of Glofs, flash floods and landslides in vulnerable regions of GB and KP.</p>
<p>The Met Office has advised local authorities to remain alert and take necessary measures to protect human lives and property.</p>
<p>The NDMA has warned of landslides in northern regions in view of the forecast monsoon rains.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925931/many-pti-bigwigs-jailed-for-may-9-violence' target='_blank'><strong>Many PTI bigwigs jailed for May 9 violence</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Yasmin Rashid, Omer Cheema, opposition leader of Punjab Assembly among those handed 10-year jail term; convicted leaders face disqualification under Article 63(1)(g)<br />
• Shah Mehmood Qureshi among six acquitted in Sherpao Bridge case<br />
• PTI leadership vows to move high court against ‘unjust’ decisions<br />
• Suspended PTI MPAs reinstated by acting Punjab Assembly speaker</p>
<p>LAHORE: Several PTI leaders were handed down decade-long sentences by two anti-terrorism courts in Lahore and Sargodha in connection with cases registered in the aftermath of the May 9, 2023, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">violence</a> that had engulfed the country following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">arrest</a> of former prime minister Imran Khan in a corruption case.</p>
<p>In Lahore, ATC Judge Arshad Javed announced the decision in Kot Lakhpat Jail around 9:30pm in the presence of the incarcerated PTI leaders, who were implicated in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925804/atc-hears-final-arguments-in-sherpao-bridge-violence-case">Sherpao Bridge case.</a></p>
<p>The court awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment to Dr Yasmin Rashid, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema, and former provincial minister Mian Mehmoodur Rashid. Besides four senior leaders of the PTI, the judge sentenced as many accused to 10-year rigorous imprisonment, including Afzaal Azeem Pahat, Ali Hassan, Khalid Qayum and Riaz Hussain.</p>
<p>The court, however, acquitted PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi. This is the first verdict in any of the cases related to the May 9 riots in Lahore. The judge acquitted six accused, including Mr Qureshi, who, as per his defence, was in Karachi on the day of the alleged occurrence. PTI activists Hamza Azeem, Aitzaz Rafiq, Rana Tanvir, Iftikhar Ahmad, and Zayas Khan were also acquitted.</p>
<p>In this case, as many as 14 accused were indicted during the trial conducted in the jail for security reasons. The prosecution had submitted the challan (charge-sheet) on Sept 28, 2023.</p>
<p>In its final arguments, the prosecution had argued that the ‘May 9 conspiracy’ was hatched on May 7 at Zaman Park, the residence of Imran Khan.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p><strong>Advocate Burhan Moazzam</strong></p>
<p>Malik, the lead defence counsel, argued that the FIR mentioned 400 accused persons, but only 14 were being put on trial. The lawyer also pointed out that no medical certificate existed to prove that any person was injured on May 9. He said the prosecution failed to establish the presence of the PTI leaders at the place of alleged occurrence.</p>
<p>About Mr Qureshi, he said the former foreign minister was in Karachi on May 9, 2023. The Sarwar Road police registered the FIR, claiming that the accused delivered provocative speeches and incited rioting, attacks and public disorder at Sherpao Bridge during the widespread violent protests of May 9.</p>
<p><strong>Sargodha ATC</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Sargodha ATC awarded ten-year rigorous imprisonment each to dozens of PTI leaders, including Leader of the Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Ahmed Khan Bhachar, in another May 9 riots case registered at the Musakhel police station.</p>
<p>ATC Judge Naeem Sheikh convicted as many as 32 accused, including sitting MNA Ahmad Chattha and former MNA Rana Bilal Ijaz. In this case, over 70 accused persons, including National Assembly Opposition Leader Omar Ayub Khan, had been declared proclaimed offenders.</p>
<p>Over a dozen accused were granted exemption from personal appearance during the trial proceedings. The prosecution presented testimonies of 50 witnesses to prove charges of attacks, vandalism, and incitement to violence against the accused.</p>
<p>The PTI parliamentarians convicted in May 9 cases would face automatic disqualification under Article63(1)(g) of the Constitution, which bars members convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude or corrupt practices.</p>
<p><strong>‘Unlawful, unjust’</strong></p>
<p>Commenting on the conviction, Mr Ayub said the decision by the Sargodha court was unlawful. In a statement on his X account, he said the same prosecution witnesses were declared untrustworthy by the previous trial judge. He said the PTI leaders had been convicted unjustly. He said the PTI leaders will challenge the conviction before the higher courts.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Mr Bhachar also announced he would challenge the ATC verdict in the Lahore High Court. “Once the written verdict is received, I will approach the Lahore High Court,” he added.</p>
<p><strong>Suspended PTI MPAs reinstated</strong></p>
<p>Separately, Punjab Assembly acting Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar on Tuesday reinstated 26 opposition PTI members who had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920792">suspended</a> for 15 sittings for disrupting Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920664">speech</a> on June 27.</p>
<p>During the session, Punjab Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman addressed the house and conveyed Chief Minister Maryam’s desire for the return of the suspended members. “These representatives have been elected by the people and have come to the assembly,” the minister said, adding, “I request the speaker to allow them back into the house so they can represent their constituencies.”</p>
<p>He emphasised the importance of the opposition’s presence, remarking, “The assembly lacks vibrancy without the opposition. The reinstatement of the 26 suspended members will enable them to represent their constituencies effectively. Frankly, I don’t enjoy the proceedings as much without the opposition.”</p>
<p>Earlier, Speaker Malik Muhammad Khan had rejected references against the 26 opposition MPAs seeking their disqualification on Saturday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Punjab Assembly also unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the killing of nine bus passengers from Punjab while they were travelling in Balochistan on July 10.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925927/india-set-to-retire-its-fleet-of-mig-21s' target='_blank'><strong>India set to retire its fleet of MiG-21s</strong></a>
            <p><p>NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force (IAF) will retire its remaining fleet of Russian MiG-21s, considered the IAF’s workhorse that showed its vulnerability when Pakistan shot down one of them and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1466347/2-indian-aircraft-violating-pakistani-airspace-shot-down-pilot-arrested">captured</a> its pilot in a Feb 2019 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1536224">showdown.</a></p>
<p>According to the <em>Indian Express</em>, the fleet is scheduled to be retired in Septe­mber after serving the IAF for six decades. Inducted in 1963, at least four MiG-21 squadrons were number-plated or retired from service between 2017 and 2024, the newspaper said, quoting unnamed sources in the military.</p>
<p>Its sources said the IAF is set to retire the remaining Russian-origin MiG-21 fleet in a ceremonial decom­m­issioning at Chan­digarh airbase on Sept 19.</p>
<p>Two squadrons of MiG-21 Bisons are currently active.</p>
<p>India procured more than 700 MiG-21 aircraft of different variants, such as the Type-77, Type-96, BIS and the Bison, since the aircraft’s induction in the IAF in 1963.</p>
<p>The phasing out of the aging MiG-21 fleet was originally scheduled to be concluded by 2022, but was held up due to a delay in the planned induction of other fighter jets, including the indig­enous Light Combat Aircraft Tejas, which are set to replace the MiG-21 squadrons.</p>
<p><strong>Four squadrons phased out</strong></p>
<p>Between 2017 and 2024, at least four MiG-21 squadrons were phased out. India has a sanctioned fighter squadron strength of 42, but has 31 active squadrons.</p>
<p>The phasing out of the MiG-21 fleet will further bring down the IAF’s active fighter squadrons.</p>
<p>The MiG-21 Bison, which comprises the last two squadrons to be retired, is one of India’s six fighter jets.</p>
<p>The single engine, single-seater multi-role fighter/ground attack aircraft has been a key fighter jet with the IAF. The Bison is the latest upgrade of the MiG-21 jets.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Over 100 MiG-21s of the IAF have been upgraded to Bison over the last three decades.</p>
<p>The MiG-21 Bison upgrades included avionics and communication systems, electronics, multi-function display cockpits, the Kopyo light-weight multi-mode radar, radio sets, electronic warfare suite, inertial navigation system/GPS, a helmet-mounted display and a better windshield, among others. However, the engine performance and load carrying capacity of the jet could not be enhanced as part of the upgrades, with its airframe being the major limitation, the Express said.</p>
<p>With a maximum speed of 2,230 kilometres per hour, the jet carries one 23mm twin-barrel cannon with four R-60 close combat missiles. Initially developed as an interceptor, the supersonic jet was eventually upgraded to perform as a multi-role combat aircraft, including ground attacks.</p>
<p>Despite its significant role in all wars and conflicts fought by India, the MiG-21 jets had earned a mixed reputation due to several crashes, although it could have happened due to a multitude of reasons.</p>
<p>Some estimates say that India lost over 400 MiG-21 jets, including its variants and trainer versions, since its induction, and the crashes killed over 100 pilots and some civilians.</p>
<p>A MiG-21 fighter jet of the IAF <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751591">crashed</a> near Rajasthan’s Suratgarh in May 2023 while it was on a routine operational training sortie, killing three civilians. In July 2022, a MiG-21 trainer Type 69 aircraft crashed, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1702140">killing</a> Wing Commander M. Rana and Flight Lieutenant Adivitiya Bal.</p>
