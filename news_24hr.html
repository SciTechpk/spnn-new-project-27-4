            <p><p>At least six people died and seven were injured after a five-storey building collapsed in Karachi’s Lyari area on Friday, hospital officials said.</p>
<p>Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told <em>Dawn.com</em> that a woman’s body has been brought to the Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK), raising the death toll to six.</p>
<p>Four men, two women and a teenage girl were injured, according to a list of patients seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, issued earlier today by CHK’s Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Institute of Trauma (SMBBIT).</p>
<p>However, there were conflicting death tolls reported.</p>
<p>Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, citing “reliable reports”, said seven people had lost their lives while eight others were rescued. Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, an official leading the operations, also confirmed seven deaths and eight people injured to <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122, in a statement, said eight people had died in the incident, including four men, three women and a child.</p>

<p>Today’s incident comes days after a portion of a building <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921188/no-casualties-reported-as-22-rescued-from-partially-collapsed-building-in-karachis-kharadar">collapsed</a> in the city’s Kharadar area. However, no casualties or injuries were reported.</p>
<p>The Public Account Committee of the Sindh Assembly had directed the provincial government in December to take urgent steps to evacuate over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879565">570 buildings</a> declared “dangerous” by authorities across Karachi.</p>
<p>Rescue efforts were underway at the building situated on Fida Hussain Shaikha Road in Lyari’s Baghdadi neighbourhood, according to a statement from the Baghdadi police.</p>
<p>Pakistan Rangers, in a statement, said its personnel were also assisting in the rescue operations and “engaged in rescuing individuals trapped under the rubble”.</p>
<p>The heavy rescue machinery struggled to access the narrow alleys, and police baton-charged residents to clear the way, <em>AFP</em> reported.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters at the site of the incident, Wahab said: “According to the reliable reports so far, seven people have [lost their lives], whose bodies have been taken to the hospital, and we have succeeded in saving eight people.”</p>
<p>The mayor said the government needed to “take action”, noting that there were around 434 buildings in the Old City area that had been declared “dangerous” by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA). A statement by the authority put the number of such buildings across Karachi at 588.</p>
<p>“We have two options: to convince people to move out or force them to evacuate,” Wahab said, adding that any government tries not to take any forced action but to convince people.</p>
<p>“This loss of lives today shows that when the state or the government tells you anything, you should follow it.”</p>
<p>The mayor requested the inhabitants of such dilapidated buildings to evacuate as soon as possible to prevent any unpleasant incident and loss of life or property.</p>

<p>The casualties included Fatima Babu and Hoor Bai — both aged 55 years — 21-year-old Prantic Arsi, 32-year-old Prem and 35-year-old Waseem Babu, according to the list issued by SMBBIT.</p>
<p>The injured were listed as 17-year-old Kishna Jumna Das, 25-year-old Rashid Aziz, 29-year-old Mujeeb Ali, 30-year-old Santia Chaitan and Chanda Jumma Lal, 45-year-old Ghulam Hussain, and 50-year-old Yousaf Subhan.</p>
<p>Five of the wounded had “minor injuries”, SMBBIT Executive Director Dr Muhammad Sabir Memon told <em>Dawn.com</em> earlier today.</p>
<p>Saad Edhi of the Edhi Foundation described the structure to <em>AFP</em> as a “worn-out building”. Police official Arif Aziz told <em>AFP</em> that up to 100 people had been living in the building.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the SBCA said it had declared the plot as dangerous through its Technical Committee for Dangerous Buildings after a thorough inspection conducted in October 2022.</p>
<p>It said it had received a complaint from the Sindh Human Rights Commission on July 22, 2022, and the authority had thereafter promptly issued the first ejectment notice on June 2, 2023, directing the residents and occupants to vacate the premises.</p>
<p>It said a second notice was issued on February 28, 2024, followed by a third with a three-day final warning and lastly a fourth notice addressed to the managing director of K-Electric, Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) on June 25, 2024, instructing them to disconnect utility services.</p>
<p>The SBCA added that an urgent reminder for ejectment was issued on June 2 with copies sent to the South deputy and assistant commissioners and the Kalari station house officer, requesting their intervention to evacuate the premises and prevent any potential incident.</p>
<p>“On June 29, 2025, the SBCA director also reported that residents were warned via megaphones to evacuate the building immediately.</p>
<p>“Regrettably, the residents were reluctant to vacate the building unless alternate accommodation was provided. Furthermore, the utility agencies, K-Electric, SSGC, and KWSB, did not respond or disconnect services in a timely manner, nor did the district administration paid attention and responded by our issued ejectment notices.</p>
<p>“It is important to note that the monsoon season is ongoing, increasing the risk associated with dangerous structures. According to SBCA records, 588 buildings have been declared dangerous throughout Karachi with 107 such buildings in Lyari alone. The SBCA has repeatedly advertised these threats through print and electronic media.”</p>
<p>It also pointed out that during his tenure, former Sindh chief secretary Sohail Rajput had instructed then-Karachi commissioner Saleem Rajput to take efforts to vacate the buildings declared dangerous by the SBCA Technical Committee. It added that the matter was still pending.</p>

<p>All six family members of 70-year-old Jumho Maheshwari were at his flat on the first floor when he left for work early in the morning.</p>
<p>“Nothing is left for me now — my family is all trapped and all I can do is pray for their safe recovery,” he told <em>AFP</em>.</p>

<p>Another resident, Maya Sham Jee, said her brother’s family was also trapped under the rubble.</p>
<p>“It’s a tragedy for us. The world has been changed for our family,” she told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>“We are helpless and just looking at the rescue workers to bring our loved ones back safely.”</p>
<p>Shankar Kamho, aged 30, a resident of the building who was out at the time, said around 20 families were living inside.</p>
<p>“I got a call from my wife saying the building was cracking and I told her to get out immediately,” he told <em>AFP</em> at the scene.</p>
<p>“She went to warn the neighbours, but one woman told her ‘this building will stand for at least 10 more years’. Still, my wife took our daughter and left. About 20 minutes later, the building collapsed.”</p>

<p>Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/sindhinfodepart/status/1941112397894234372" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> a high-level committee has been formed that will submit a report on the incident within three days.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters at the site of the incident, he lamented that residents did not evacuate the building despite being served notices previously due to the unsafe conditions of the run-down structure.</p>
<p>“Not one but many notices were given to them (residents) to evacuate the building in the past four to six years. But I can also understand the citizens’ struggle.</p>
<p>“[…] On the one hand is your home in which you are residing, [but] on the other hand is your life,” Ghani added, urging residents of other dilapidated structures to evacuate to avoid any disaster.</p>

<p>“If we forcibly make them evacuate, then also a humanitarian aspect comes forward, and we have to become a target of criticism for it,” the minister stressed.</p>
<p>Ghani said he had been told that the building was built in 1974. “There is an entire mafia that constructs these illegal buildings in the city; we have taken strict action against them and filed FIRs,” he said, urging citizens not to buy or rent such buildings to “end the demand”.</p>
<p>Taking notice of the incident in a statement, Ghani ordered the top officials of the relevant authorities, including the SBCA, to reach the site of the incident to monitor the rescue efforts.</p>
<p>“A report on the causes of the building collapse and all its reasons should be submitted immediately,” he said in the statement issued by his media consultant, Zubair Memon.</p>
<p>“All obstacles around the building should be removed to speed up the rescue operation,” Ghani added.</p>
<p>Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.</p>
<p>But Karachi, home to more than 20m, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.</p>

<p>Sindh Rescue 1122 Director General (DG) Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, in a statement, said the service’s Central Command and Control centre received an alert of the incident at 10:53am.</p>
<p>“As soon as the alert was received, the Urban Search and Rescue team, along with a disaster-response vehicle (DRV), immediately reached the site of the incident,” the Rescue 1122 DG asserted.</p>
<p>He detailed that over 100 rescue personnel, five DRVs, two snorkels and multiple ambulances were present at the building’s location. Cranes and lifters have also been dispatched to the site, DG Shaikh added.</p>
<p>He explained that there were hindrances during the rescue operation due to the “unruly crowd, various road blockades and mobile network [issues]”.</p>

<p>Sindh Assembly Syed Awais Qadir Shah, in a statement, highlighted that immediate action must be taken to identify dilapidated buildings and ensure public safety.</p>
<p>Sardar Abdulrahim, information secretary of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), said that further loss of lives could have been avoided if the rescue machinery had reached the site on time.</p>
<p>“A fair of illegal buildings has been set up in the city due to the [Sindh] government’s incompetence,” the GDA leader said.</p>
<p>He demanded that the families of the injured and wounded be provided with financial assistance, that alternate accommodation be arranged for the affected people, and that a case be filed against those responsible for the loss of precious lives.</p>

            <p><p>The Karachi Police on Friday said they had arrested the primary suspect allegedly involved in the gang-rape of a girl in Ittehad Town.</p>
<p>In a statement issued today, Keamari Senior Superintendent of Police Captain (retired) Faizan Ali said that the Ittehad Town Police had registered the gang-rape case a day ago.</p>
<p>He said the incident had occurred on July 1 when the detained suspect had forcibly taken away the victim on his bike to his <em>dera</em> (sitting place) in Ittehad Town, where he gang-raped her along with his friends.</p>
<p>“The rape survivor managed to escape from the place at night and reached the home of her maternal uncle and later on informed the police about the incident,” he said, adding that her medical examination was carried out at the Civil Hospital Karachi and a case was subsequently registered.</p>
<p>“The main suspect was arrested within hours after the registration of the case, while efforts are underway to arrest other suspects.</p>
<p>“Such beasts are cancer for the society and they will be taken to task,” the SSP vowed.</p>
<p>Despite the presence of laws such as Sections 375-A and 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which prescribe life imprisonment or death for gang rape and up to 25 years for rape, sexual violence against women remains pervasive.</p>
<p>In May this year,  a student was found murdered in a seminary in the Gadap area and an autopsy revealed that he was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911090">raped before being killed</a>.</p>
<p>In February, a sessions court sentenced a man to 10 years in prison for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893037">raping a minor boy</a> in a Lyari area.</p>
<p>According to a report by the Sustainable Social Development Organisation (SSDO), <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894972">conviction rates</a> remain dismally low, around 0.5 per cent nationwide in 2024 and under 5pc in other studies.</p>
<p>More than 500 women and underage girls were sexually assaulted in Karachi alone during the year 2023, which also saw 4,042 cases of physical assault on them, a police surgeon had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802215#:~:text=522%20women%20sexually%20assaulted">told</a> <em>Dawn.com</em></p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922098/finance-ministry-notifies-10pc-pay-raise-for-govt-emloyees' target='_blank'><strong>Finance ministry notifies 10pc pay raise for govt emloyees</strong></a>
            <p><p>The finance ministry on Friday issued notifications for a 10 per cent increase in the salaries of federal government employees, as well as granting Disparity Reduction Allowance (DRA) worth 30pc of basic pay, according to documents seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>The pay hike was announced as part of the budget for the coming fiscal year, where the salaries of federal employees from Grade 1 to 22 would be raised by 10pc and retired government servants would be eligible for a 7pc pension increase.</p>
<p>According to one of the notifications, dated July 4, basic pay to armed forces personnel, civil armed forces, and civil employees of the federal government are subject to the pay raise.</p>
<p>The notification read that the pay would be “subject to income tax; admissible during leave and entire period of LPR except during extraordinary leave; will not be treated as part of emoluments for the purpose of calculation of pension/gratuity and recovery of house rent.”</p>
<p>It further said that the pay would “not be admissible to the employees during the tenure of their posting/deputation abroad; and will be admissible to the employees on their repatriation from posting/deputation abroad at the rate and amount which would have been admissible to them had they not been posted abroad”.</p>
<p>A separate notification, also dated July 4, read that federal government employees from Grades 1-22 could draw on DRA at 30pc of basic pay. The grant applies to those employees already drawing on DRA.</p>
<p>“For those employees who have been appointed on or after July 1, 2022, this allowance will be admissible on the basis of the relevant initial Basic Pay Scale of 2017,” the notification stated.</p>
<p>Last month, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916120">approved</a> an over fivefold increase in the salaries of the Senate chairman and National Assembly speaker, taking it to Rs1.3 million a month.</p>
<p>A May 29 notification revealed that the Senate chairman and NA speaker’s salaries have been raised from Rs205,000 to Rs1.3m, besides 50pc of the revised salary (Rs650,000) as the sumptuary allowance.</p>
<p>The hike, with a retrospective effect, was effective in January 2025.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in May, President Asif Ali Zardari <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908400">promulgated</a> an ordinance to increase the salaries of federal ministers and ministers of state to match those of National Assembly members (MNAs).</p>
<p>The National Assembly’s Finance Committee, headed by NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, approved the proposed increase of the monthly salary of each MNA and senator to Rs519,000. Previously, lawmakers received a monthly salary of Rs180,000.</p>
<p>“The federal ministers and ministers of state shall receive a monthly salary equivalent to the salary of a member of the National Assembly,” read the ordinance.</p></p>
