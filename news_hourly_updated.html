<p>The diplomatic support voiced by Turkiye and Azerbaijan stoked anger in India as people <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cancelled their holidays</a> in popular resorts in the two countries.</p>
<p>The moves <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911469">intensified</a> as Adani group-operated Mumbai and Ahmedabad airports ended the ground handling concession agreements with √áelebi, an Istanbul-headquartered airport.</p>

                <h2>Nine terrorists killed in separate operations across KP: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Security forces killed nine terrorists ‚Äúsponsored‚Äù by India during a series of operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday, according to the military‚Äôs media wing.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), nine ‚ÄúIndian-sponsored <em>khawarij</em>‚Äù were killed in three separate engagements.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAn intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted by the security forces in Dera Ismail Khan district, on [the] reported presence of Indian sponsored <em>khwarij</em>,‚Äù the military‚Äôs media wing said, using the term designating terrorists affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.</p>
<p>During the engagement, security forces ‚Äúeffectively engaged the <em>khawarij</em> location and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian-sponsored <em>khawarij</em> were sent to hell‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to the statement, another IBO was conducted in Tank District and two more Indian-sponsored <em>khawarij</em> were ‚Äúsent to hell‚Äù by the security forces.</p>
<p>In the third operation in Khyber district‚Äôs Bagh area, ‚Äúown troops successfully neutralised three more Indian-sponsored khawarij‚Äù, the ISPR said.</p>
<p>The statement added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the dead terrorists, who were involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other <em>kharji</em> found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country,‚Äù the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari both expressed appreciation for the security forces following the operations, <em>The Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDue to [the] professional expertise of Pakistan‚Äôs armed forces, [the] eradication of terrorists and terrorism was underway at great pace,‚Äù <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-pays-tribute-to-security-forces-for-eliminating-nine-khawarij/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PM Shehbaz</a> was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Vowing to foil the designs of terrorists, he said, ‚ÄúJustice will be meted out to the terrorists patronised by India for causing damage to the life and property of the citizens.‚Äù</p>
<p>The PM added that the government and security forces were ‚Äúdetermined to completely wipe out terrorism from the country‚Äù.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/president-appreciates-security-forces-for-killing-khawarij/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">President Zardari</a> praised security forces for killing the nine terrorists and said that operations against will continue until the complete elimination of terrorism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe successful operations of the security forces against the Indian-supported terrorists was commendable,‚Äù the president was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúOur determination to root out terrorist elements and defend the country is unwavering.‚Äù</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005">12 terrorists</a> belonging to ‚ÄúIndian proxy‚Äù outfits were killed by security forces while two personnel were martyred in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the ISPR had said on Monday.</p>
<p>It added that intelligence-based operations (IBOs) were conducted on Saturday and Sunday against the TTP in KP and the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Front in Balochistan.</p>
<p>An IBO was conducted in Lakki Marwat district during which troops engaged the enemy at its location and sent ‚Äúfive Indian sponsored‚Äù terrorists to ‚Äúhell‚Äù, it said. In a second IBO in the Bannu district, two ‚ÄúIndian-sponsored‚Äù terrorists were ‚Äúsuccessfully neutralised‚Äù by the security forces.</p>
<p>It further said that terrorists ambushed a security forces convoy in another incident in North Waziristan district‚Äôs general area of Mir Ali, adding that two ‚ÄúIndian sponsored‚Äù terrorists were ‚Äúsent to hell‚Äù after the effective response of troops.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, during the intense fire exchange, two brave sons of the soil, Sepoy Farhad Ali Turi (age: 29 years, resident of Kurram district) and Lance Naik Sabir Afridi (age: 32 years, resident of Kohat district) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced martyrdom.‚Äù</p>
<p>Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">accused</a> India of activating its ‚Äúassets‚Äù to inte¬≠nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting ‚Äúirr¬≠e¬≠futable evidence‚Äù of Ind¬≠ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind¬≠ian military personnel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPost-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the <em>Fitnah-al-Khawarij</em> and the independent terrorist cells ‚Ä¶ to increase their activity,‚Äù he had said, using the state-designated term for the banned TTP.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
