                <h2>Pak-India DGMOs discuss ceasefire in 1st round of talks</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan’s Director General Military Operations (DGMO) Major General Kashif Abdullah and his Indian counterpart Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai on Monday held the first round of talks via hotline after the recent ceasefire between the two countries in the wake of a military conflict.</p>
<p>Saturday’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910113/world-community-hails-ceasefire-decision-between-pakistan-and-india">ceasefire</a>, announced by US President Donald Trump, followed four days of intense exchanges of fire as the nuclear-armed neighbours targeted each other’s military installations with missiles and drones, killing dozens of civilians.</p>
<p>Confirming the talks to <em>Dawn.com</em>, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said the next round would take place in the next 48 hours. A ceasefire till then, he said, was “quite standard”.</p>
<p>State media outlets <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/12-05-2025/first-round-of-talks-between-pakistan-india-dgmos-concluded" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> and <em>PTV News</em> confirmed the talks as well.</p>

<p><em>Reuters</em> also reported that the Indian army confirmed that the DGMOs spoke by phone today.</p>
<p>“Issues related to continuing the commitment that both sides must not fire a single shot or initiate any aggressive and inimical action against each other were discussed,” the Indian army said.</p>
<p>“It was also agreed that both sides consider immediate measures to ensure troop reduction from the borders and forward areas,” it added.</p>

<p>The escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours began following the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">attack</a> in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">killed</a> 26 people. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack%20were%20brought%20out">cross-border linkages</a>” of the att­a­­­c­kers.</p>
<p>Pakistan firmly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">rejected</a> the claim and called for a neutral probe. Following the allegations, India launched a series of strikes on Pakistan on the night of May 6 and 7, resulting in civilian casualties.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#hotline-message" id="hotline-message" title="Permalink"></a>Hotline message</h2>
<p>India’s military sent a “hotline” message to Pakistan on Sunday about alleged ceasefire violations the previous day, flagging New Delhi’s intent to respond to further such incidents, <em>Reuters</em> reported, citing a top Indian army officer.</p>
<p>However, the Foreign Office and the Pakistan military’s spokesperson rubbished the allegations.</p>
<p>“In spite of some minor damage, all our military bases and systems continue to remain fully operational,” India’s director general of air operations, Air Marshal AK Bharti, claimed in a media briefing today.</p>
<p>India also reopened 32 airports it had shut during the clashes, with the Airports Authority of India saying in a statement they were available for civil operations. Some schools remained closed.</p>
<p>Pakistan had reopened its airspace on Saturday.</p>
<p>Visitors were kept out of an airport in the border city of Amritsar shortly after the announcement, a <em>Reuters</em> witness said.</p></p>

                <h2>Conflict with India won’t have large fiscal impact: finance minister</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">military escalation</a> with arch-rival India won’t have a large fiscal impact on Pakistan and can be managed within the current fiscal space, with no need for a new economic assessment, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said in an interview with <em>Reuters</em> on Monday.</p>
<p>Trade talks with the United States — which had played a key role mediating a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> between the two countries — would likely have progressed in “short order” and that Pakistan could import more high-quality cotton, more soy beans and was also exploring other asset classes, including hydrocarbons, Aurangzeb said in the online interview.</p>
<p>Regarding the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910253">conflict</a>, Aurangzeb described it as a “short duration escalation” with minimal fiscal impact, stating it can be “accommodated within the fiscal space which is available to the government of Pakistan”.</p>
<p>When questioned about potential increased military spending in the upcoming budget, Aurangzeb deferred comment, saying it was premature to discuss specific plans. However, he said: “Whatever we need to do in terms of ensuring that our defence requirements are met will be met.”</p>
<p>Aurangzeb said he expects the Indus Water Treaty, which India unilaterally suspended, to be reinstated and rolled back to where it was.</p>
<p>He said there is not going to be any immediate impact from India’s suspension and Pakistan does not “even want to consider any scenario which does not take into account the reinstatement of this treaty”.</p>
<p>Earlier today, President Donald Trump said the US was ready to help India and Pakistan after a ceasefire agreement, claiming trade was a big reason they “stopped fighting”.</p>
<p>Pakistan faces a 29 per cent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901838/economists-see-hurdles-and-opportunities-for-pakistan-as-us-imposes-29pc-tariff-on-country">tariff</a> on exports to the US due to an approximate $3 billion trade surplus, but this is currently under a 90-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903146">pause</a> announced in April.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">approved</a> a $1bn loan disbursement to Pakistan as part of a larger $7bn <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845536">bailout agreement</a>.</p>
<p>“Islamabad will receive the tranche disbursement on Tuesday,” Aurangzeb said.</p>
<p>The IMF executive board also approved a fresh $1.4bn loan to Pakistan under its climate resilience facility.</p>
<p>The federal budget for the next fiscal year, starting July, will be finalised within the next three to four weeks, with scheduled budget talks with the IMF to take place from May 14-23, he said.</p>
<p>Tensions between India and Pakistan began mounting after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">April 22 attack</a> in Indian-occupied Kashmir that killed 26 people, sparking the worst clashes between the nuclear-armed neighbours in more than two decades.</p>
<p>On Saturday, a ceasefire in the region was announced by Trump, following four days of fighting and diplomacy and pressure from Washington.</p></p>
