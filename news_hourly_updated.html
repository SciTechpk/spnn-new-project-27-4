                <h2>Govt eyes Panda bonds as Dubai Islamic Bank closes $1bn loan deal</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: In a renewed push to diversify funding sources and tap into China’s vast capital market, a Ministry of Finance team is holding high-level meetings in Beijing this week to attract investment for Pakistan’s debut Panda Bond issuance.</p>
<p>The outreach comes as Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB) has successfully arranged a $1bn syndicated loan for Pakistan, partially backed by the Asian Development Bank — the first such guarantee-based facility for the country.</p>
<p>Khurram Schehzad, adviser to the finance minister, said in a post on X on Wednesday that the MoF team had engaged in technical discussions with prospective investors, underwriters, guarantors, a Chinese rating agency, and legal advisers. The meetings, which began on July 7, will continue until July 11 as part of a non-deal roadshow (NDR) ahead of Pakistan’s debut Panda Bond issue.</p>
<p>Mr Schehzad noted that the roadshow had attracted encouraging initial interest, reflecting investor confidence in Pakistan’s reform trajectory and its improving credibility in international markets. He added that the visit underscores the government’s commitment to proactive investor engagement and its strategy to broaden access to China’s deep and diversified onshore capital market.</p>

<p>In a separate development, Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB) has finalised a $1bn syndicated loan for Pakistan in partnership with a consortium of regional and international financial institutions, according to an official statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The five-year facility is partially guaranteed by a Policy-Based Guarantee (PBG) from the Asian Development Bank, marking the first transaction of its kind undertaken by the ADB for Pakistan.</p>

                <h2>Actor Humaira Asghar may have died months ago: Karachi police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: Model and actor Humaira Asghar Ali, whose partially decomposed body was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922857/actor-and-model-humaira-asghar-ali-found-dead-in-karachis-dha">found</a> a day earlier in her rented DHA apartment, may have died several months ago, police said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old actor was found dead when police, accompanied by a bailiff, broke open the door of her fourth-floor apartment in Ittehad Commercial, Phase VI.</p>
<p>DIG-South Syed Asad Raza told <em>Dawn</em> that police surgeon Summaiya Syed along with SSP-South Mahzoor Ali visited her flat and they suspected that she might have died around six months ago.</p>
<p>Elaborating, he said that the date of expiry of the bread and packaged milk kept in the refrigerator was September 2024.</p>
<p>Similarly, two SIMs in her cell phone were dead /inactive since September 2024 as per the call data record obtained by investigators. Besides, he said that power supply to her flat was disconnected in October 2024 reportedly by the KE ostensibly over non-payment of dues.</p>
<p>The police said the adjacent flat was empty during the period in which she was believed to have died.</p>
<p><strong>Family refuses to take body</strong></p>
<p>The DIG said that her family lived in Lahore and when the police approached them they, particularly her father, refused to take the body for burial.</p>
<p>Later, he said, the deceased’s brother-in-law approached the police and he was expected to arrive here on Thursday (today) to meet with the police.</p>
<p>As people learned that her father refused to take the body, prominent showbiz personalities approached the police, expressing their willingness to perform the last rites and arrange the burial, the DIG said.</p>
<p>“We shall hand them the body in case the family refuses,” he added.</p>
<p>He said that the cause of the death could be ascertained only after receiving chemical examiner’s report.</p>
