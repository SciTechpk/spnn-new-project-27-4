            <p><p>Pakistan‚Äôs Director General Military Operations (DGMO) Major General Kashif Abdullah and his Indian counterpart Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai held the first round of talks via hotline after the recent ceasefire between the two countries in the wake of a military conflict.</p>
<p>Saturday‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910113/world-community-hails-ceasefire-decision-between-pakistan-and-india">ceasefire</a>, announced by US President Donald Trump, followed four days of intense exchanges of fire as the nuclear-armed neighbours targeted each other‚Äôs military installations with missiles and drones, killing dozens of civilians.</p>
<p>Confirming the talks to <em>Dawn.com</em>, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said the next round would take place in the next 48 hours. A ceasefire till then, he said, was ‚Äúquite standard‚Äù.</p>

<p>India‚Äôs military sent a ‚Äúhotline‚Äù message to Pakistan on Sunday about alleged ceasefire violations the previous day, flagging New Delhi‚Äôs intent to respond to further such incidents, <em>Reuters</em> reported, citing a top Indian army officer.</p>

<p>Pakistan had reopened its airspace on Saturday.</p>
<p>Visitors were kept out of an airport in the border city of Amritsar shortly after the announcement, a <em>Reuters</em> witness said.</p></p>

                <h2>As Trump heads to the Gulf, Israel asks where the US stands</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Israeli officials have put a brave face on President Donald Trump bypassing them on a Middle East trip this week, but his decision to do so is the latest to sow doubt in Israel about where the United States stands in Washington‚Äôs priorities.</p>
<p>On Sunday, a few days after announcing plans for an expanded military operation in Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs office said it had been informed by the US of an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1910452">agreement</a> to release American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, after talks between Washington and Hamas that did not include Israel.</p>
<p>Trump, who will be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906046/trump-to-visit-s-arabia-uae-next-month">visiting</a> Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, also caused consternation in Israel last week by abruptly announcing the US would stop bombing Houthis in Yemen, days after a Houthi missile hit near Israel‚Äôs main airport.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe message to the region was clear: Israel is no longer a top US priority,‚Äù wrote Itamar Eichner, diplomatic correspondent for Israeli <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1qvel9gee" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news outlets</a> <em>Ynet</em>, echoing media commentators across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>One Israeli official said Trump‚Äôs announcement on the Houthis was ‚Äúkind of an embarrassment‚Äù and that the president acts ‚Äúfor good and for bad‚Äù.</p>
<p>Israel has been talking to the US about the post-conflict future of Gaza, and officials say relations at the official level remain strong, but some officials acknowledge being blindsided by Trump‚Äôs decision-making.</p>
<p>One senior official in Netanyahu‚Äôs circle, who declined to be identified by name, said there was ‚Äúchaos‚Äù in the Trump administration, with everything dependent on what the president decided at any given moment.</p>
<p>Sometimes that helped Israel, and sometimes it did not, the official said.</p>
<p>The decision on the Houthis, which was not discussed with Israel beforehand, compounded Israeli unease at US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910345">talks</a> with Iran over Tehran‚Äôs nuclear programme, which could blunt any Israeli threat of military action against its arch-enemy.</p>
<p>Israel faced further alarm after <em>Reuters</em> reported that the US was no longer demanding Saudi Arabia normalise ties with Israel as a condition for progress on civil nuclear cooperation talks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe coordinate. It doesn‚Äôt mean you must fully agree 100 per cent on every issue,‚Äù Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on Sunday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe US is a sovereign state. Israel is a sovereign state. But I believe we have a very, very big common ground of positions with this administration, more than in the past.‚Äù</p>
<p>In March, Trump‚Äôs hostage negotiator, Adam Boehler, held what Hamas described as ‚Äúvery helpful‚Äù meetings with the Palestinian fighter group that bypassed Israel and focused on releasing Alexander.</p>
<p>Last week, US Ambassador Mike Huckabee denied that Trump was distancing himself from Israel. He said the relationship was often described as ironclad and ‚Äúthat word is still operative‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe president has been consistent in his support and his partnership, and I have no reason to believe that that won‚Äôt continue,‚Äù he said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#chaos" id="chaos" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòChaos‚Äô</h2>
<p>Netanyahu and his government faced criticism today even as Israelis looked forward to Alexander‚Äôs release, with a growing perception in the public that the two allies had differing priorities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just no leadership now,‚Äù said Tel Aviv pensioner Jack Gottlieb.</p>
<p>There was ‚Äúno question‚Äù the deal happened behind Netanyahu‚Äôs back or that the US and Israeli agendas currently differed, he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRight now, it‚Äôs every man for himself,‚Äù Gottlieb said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu had little choice but to accept the decision on the Houthis, who signalled they would not stop trying to hit Israel by firing another missile a few days later.</p>
<p>Israel has relied on US military and diplomatic support since its creation as an independent state in 1948. Any weakening of US interest, as Israel faces international pressure over the Gaza bombardment, would be a severe blow.</p>
<p>The decision to drop the demand for a normalisation deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel, to get past Riyadh‚Äôs insistence that Israel agree to moves towards a settlement with the Palestinians, underlined how damaging the issue has been for Israel internationally.</p>
<p>Adding Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which both normalised relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords signed during Trump‚Äôs first term, has been a major goal for Netanyahu but is now seemingly delayed indefinitely.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs predecessor, Joe Biden, faced bitter criticism from Israeli hardliners after stopping exports of some heavy munitions used in Gaza and imposing sanctions on violent Israeli West Bank settlers.</p>
<p>By contrast, Trump, in his first term, defied world opinion by moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, which Israel regards as its capital, and recognised Israel‚Äôs annexation of the Golan Heights, which it seized in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>Israeli officials have said previously that they were aware there were risks for Israel in a president as unpredictable as Trump and one who has shown no compunction in turning on historic US allies.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut we don‚Äôt have a choice,‚Äù said one.</p></p>
