            <p><p><strong>• Pakistan condemns attack on nuclear facilities<br />
• Premier holds call with Iranian president; call US action ‘violation of international law’<br />
• Iranian envoy hints at retaliatory strikes on American bases</strong></p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: An emergency meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) will be held today (Monday) to discuss the regional situation after the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842/trump-says-irans-key-nuclear-facilities-obliterated-by-us-airstrikes">airstrike on three nuclear facilities</a> in Iran.</p>
<p>The NSC, chaired by the prime minister and comprising the top brass of both civil and military leadership, is the highest forum for security deliberations.</p>
<p>Sources in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) told <em>Dawn</em> that the NSC meeting will be held on Monday evening. Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir will also attend the meeting.</p>
<p>The field marshal, who recently returned from a trip to the US, will brief the committee on the details of his meeting with US President Donald Trump.</p>
<p><strong>Pakistan condemns strikes</strong></p>
<p>The US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, which came four days after COAS Munir’s meeting with Trump, have been condemned by Pakistan.</p>
<p>In a phone call with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Prime Minister Shehbaz condemned the US attack and Israeli aggression.</p>
<p>“The prime minister conveyed Pakistan’s condemnation of the US attacks, which followed Israel’s unprovoked and unjustified aggression over the past eight days,” said an official press release issued by the PMO.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The PM reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering solidarity with the people and government of Iran and expressed condolences on the loss of lives.</p>
<p>He expressed concerns that the US struck facilities that were under the protection of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
<p>“These attacks constituted a serious violation of international law and the IAEA statute,” he added.</p>
<p>While noting Iran’s right to self-defence, as enshrined under Article 51 of the UN Charter, Prime Minister Shehbaz stressed the need for swift dialogues and called diplomacy “the only viable path forward”. He also called for urgent collective efforts to de-escalate the situation, and said Pakistan was ready to play a constructive role in this regard. According to the PMO, President Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan’s support of Iran.</p>
<p>He thanked the prime minister and people of Pakistan for standing in solidarity with Iran.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, the Foreign Office also condemned the US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>“We are gravely concerned at the possible further escalation of tensions in the region,” the Foreign Office spokesman said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The attacks “violate all norms of international law,” the spokesperson said, adding Iran has the right to defend itself under the UN Charter.</p>
<p>“Any further escalation of tensions will have severely damaging implications for the region and beyond.”</p>
<p>The FO urged all parties to “adhere to international law” and hold dialogues to resolve the crises.</p>
<p><strong>‘Iran can hit US bases’</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Dr Reza Amiri Moghadam has said his country could target US facilities and interests in the region.</p>
<p>While addressing a press conference here at the National Press Club on Sunday, Mr Moghadam said the US has a “presence in the region” and that Iran “will see that where we hit the US”.</p>
<p>Responding to a question about US bases in the region, the ambassador said it was shameful that the US has military facilities in Muslim states.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>However, he added that Iran “does not want to bring any other Islamic state into this war”.</p>
<p>Asked about the damages during the US airstrike on Iran’s nuclear sites, he said Iran has the capability to make a nuclear arsenal but the country was using the technology for energy and medical purposes.</p>
<p>“Our nuclear technology is not a physical thing but it’s in the minds of our nuclear scientists, so therefore the US strikes have not made any significant harm to our nuclear programme,” he added.</p>
<p>He also appreciated Pakistan’s support for Iran during the conflict.</p>
<p><strong>President worried</strong></p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari also expressed concern over the escalating tensions in the Middle East.</p>
<p>In a statement on Sunday, the president urged all parties involved in the conflict to exercise maximum restraint and to choose the path of peace , dialogue and diplomacy to ensure enduring peace and stability in the region.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>President Zardari also called upon the international community to play its part in de-escalating the crisis in the interest of regional stability as well as the well-being of its people.</p>

            <p><p>PAKISTAN and India are closer to war than ever before despite a fragile ceasefire, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has warned, calling the situation in the region “incredibly perilous” and the threshold for full-scale conflict “dangerously low”.</p>
<p>Mr Bhutto-Zardari, also a former foreign minister, said that on the final day of last month’s deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">clashes</a>, India deployed a dual-use cruise missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, forcing Pakistan to make a split-second decision on whether it was under nuclear attack.</p>
<p>“In that atmosphere you’ve got only a few seconds to decide looking at an image: is this missile going to be used within the nuclear connotation or not? And in those split seconds, decisions are made,” he <a class="link--external" href="https://www.thetimes.com/world/asia/article/pakistan-india-missile-nuclear-x0z9jw3x8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>The Sunday Times</em> during a visit to London.</p>
<p>“We’ve achieved a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>, but we haven’t achieved peace. And that’s problematic because following this recent conflict, we have lowered the threshold for full-blown military conflict to the lowest it has ever been, to what I believe are dangerously low levels,” he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s warning came as the United States <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842/trump-says-irans-key-nuclear-facilities-obliterated-by-us-airstrikes">entered</a> Israel’s war with Iran while managing another potential conflict in South Asia.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, Mr Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093">hosted</a> Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir for a closed-door lunch at the White House — the first time a US president has hosted a Pakistani military chief who was not also head of state.</p>
<p>“The reason I had him (COAS) here was that I wanted to thank him for not going into the war [with India],” said Mr Trump. “And I want to thank PM [Narendra] Modi as well, who just left a few days ago.”</p>
<p>Pakistan has said that although outright war between the two nuclear-armed rivals was narrowly averted by US intervention last month — after the deadliest fighting in decades — the conflict is far from resolved.</p>
<p>The PPP chairman arrived in London at the head of a nine-member parliamentary delegation sent by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to “pitch for peace” and push for international talks to resolve the Kashmir dispute.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan agreed to the ceasefire because it was promised such a summit, which has yet to take place.</p>
<p>“At a time where the Pakistani army believes that we had a military upper hand in the conflict, we agreed to a ceasefire because we believed there was a commitment from the United States that we’d go on to have a dialogue in a neutral location on all friction points,” he said.</p>
<p>“Now that isn’t happening. We don’t want the international community to get a false sense of ease as a result of the ceasefire. There’s still a very real threat,” he added.</p>
<p>Mr Bhutto-Zardari also insisted Pakistan had no role in the Pahalgam attack, which was initially claimed — then retracted — by a little-known group, the Resistance Front, which India claims is linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba. “To this day, they [the Indian government] haven’t provided the Indian public, their allies, or us, or the media, with names of the individuals involved in this attack,” he said.</p>
<p>He admitted Pakistan has “a credibility problem” but argued things have changed. “This credibility and perception problem is rooted in deep biases, tainted by Islamophobia, and obfuscates our actual effort to combat terrorism,” he said.</p>
<p>He also accused the West of worsening Pakistan’s security situation by abandoning Afghanistan and “leaving a vacuum” there.</p>
<p>“The rest of the world may have moved on from Afghanistan and exited Kabul, but we’re fighting terrorism from there,” he said. “The single largest number of terrorist attacks anywhere in the world is in Pakistan.”</p>

            <p><p>NEW YORK: A US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842/trump-says-irans-key-nuclear-facilities-obliterated-by-us-airstrikes">attack</a> on Iranian nuclear sites could push oil prices even higher and trigger a knee-jerk rush to safety, investors said, as they assessed how the latest escalation of tensions would ripple through the global economy.</p>
<p>The reaction in Middle East stock markets, which trade on Sunday, suggested investors were assuming a benign outcome, even as Iran intensified its missile attacks on Israel in response to the sudden, deep US involvement in the conflict.</p>
<p>Investors said they expected US involvement would cause a stock market selloff and a possible bid for the dollar and other safe-haven assets when major markets reopen, but also said much uncertainty remained.</p>
<p>“I think the markets are going to be initially alarmed, and I think oil will open higher,” said Mark Spindel, chief investment officer at Potomac River Capital.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Economists warn dramatic rise in oil prices may damage global economy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“We don’t have any damage assessment and that will take some time. Even though (Trump) has described this as ‘done’, we’re engaged,” Spindel said.</p>
<p>“I think the uncertainty is going to blanket the markets, as now Americans everywhere are going to be exposed. It’s going to raise uncertainty and volatility, particularly in oil,” he added.</p>
<p>One indicator of how markets will react in the coming week was the price of ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency and a gauge of retail investor sentiment. Ether was down 8.5 per cent on Sunday, taking losses since the first Israeli strikes on Iran on June 13 to 13pc.</p>
<p>Most Gulf stock markets, however, seemed unconcerned by the early morning attacks, with the main indexes in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait up slightly or flat. Israel’s Tel Aviv main index was at an all-time high.</p>
<p><strong>Oil prices, inflation</strong></p>
<p>A key concern for markets centres around the potential impact of Middle East developments on oil prices and thus on inflation. Rising inflation could dampen consumer confidence and lessen the chance of near-term interest rate cuts.</p>
<p>Saul Kavonic, a senior energy analyst at equity research firm MST Marquee in Sydney, said Iran could respond by targeting American interests in the Middle East, including Gulf oil infrastructure in places such as Iraq or harassing ship passages through the Strait of Hormuz.</p>
<p>The Strait of Hormuz lies between Oman and Iran and is the primary export route for oil producers such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq and Kuwait.</p>
<p>“Much depends on how Iran responds in the coming hours and days, but this could set us on a path towards $100 oil if Iran responds as they have previously threatened to,” Kavonic said.</p>
<p>While global benchmark Brent crude futures have risen as much as 18pc since June 10, hitting a near five-month high of $79.04 on Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 has been little changed, following an initial drop when Israel launched its attacks on Iran on June 13.</p>

Many Zambians have raised the issue of this looting for years, but have met coordinated resistance. Consequently, Zambia’s treasury loses billions of dollars in revenue. These losses are driven by well-known multinationals working in concert with certain insiders close&nbsp;to the Zambian state.</p><p>Your editorial also says: “The US decision to cut $50m a year in aid to Zambia … is dreadful, and the reason given, corruption, rings hollow.” Alas, I disagree and wish to place this in context.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/ordinary-zambians-lose-out-twice-to-global-looting-and-local-corruption">Continue reading...</a></p>
