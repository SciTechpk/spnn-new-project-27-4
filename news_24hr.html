            <p><p><strong>• OMCs, refineries, dealers to benefit from additional Rs75bn
• Petroleum division mulls GST on oil products</strong></p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: For a third time in two months, the government is considering imposing additional costs — this time at the rate of Rs4.12 per litre — on the prices of petroleum products, a move that may deprive consumers of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910906">potential relief</a> in prices due to be announced for the next fortnight today (Thursday).</p>
<p>This has been proposed by the petroleum division to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet. The impact of Rs4.12 per unit works out to be around Rs75 billion on an annual basis to be paid to oil marketing companies (OMCs), refineries and retail dealers to meet their demands.</p>
<p>On top of this, the petroleum division has also recommended imposition of general sales tax on petroleum products at the rate of Rs3-5 per litre from July 1, through the finance bill 2025-26.</p>
<p>Without these proposed measures, the prices of petrol and diesel were estimated to decline by about Rs3.5 and Rs7 per litre, respectively, for the next fortnight starting May 15, owing to decline in the international market and a slight ease in import premium on petrol. Over the last two months, the government has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904539/fuel-price-relief-denied-as-govt-raises-levy-to-rs80">disallowed</a> about Rs18 per litre potential reduction in petroleum prices to discourage rise in petroleum consumption.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>This was done through increase in petroleum levy, including through a special presidential ordinance, to divert funds for higher subsidy on electricity rates and construction of highways and motorways in Balochistan and Sindh.</p>
<p>According to a summary sent to the ECC, the petroleum division has proposed a Rs1.87 per litre allowance through changes in the pool of inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM) to satisfy OMCs and refineries with an estimated financial impact of Rs34bn. In addition, the division has proposed an increase in sale margins to the OMCs at the rate of Rs1.13 and Rs1.12 per litre for petroleum dealers from their existing rates of about Rs8 and Rs8.64 per litre.</p>
<p>On the annual basis, the additional financial impact of the increase in margins is estimated to be more than Rs40bn depending on sales volume.</p>
<p>The division argued that petroleum products (petrol, high speed diesel, kerosene and light diesel oil) had been classified as “exempted” under Finance Act 2024-25. Resultantly, the input sales tax became cost of refineries and OMCs (Rs34bn for FY2024-25) which could not be recovered through the product prices as the petroleum products rates were regulated by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).</p>
<p>Strangely, the division claimed that petroleum prices were “being fixed by Ogra under GoP Policy”. It is, however, a matter of record that actually calculations made by Ogra are forwarded by the division to the ministry of finance which itself moves a summary to the prime minister for approval every fortnight.</p>
<p>The major price cuts are then anno­unced by the prime minister himself or his office, otherwise price revisions are announced by the ministry of finance.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The petroleum division also said a draft proposal to levy 3-5pc sales tax on petrol and HSD was developed in consultation with the oil industry, finance ministry and Federal Board of Revenue which could “not be implemented due to non-agreement with IMF to allow these products be taxed at reduced rates of GST”.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the petrol and diesel price increase due to standard rate of 18pc GST would be around Rs45 per litre, which was not desirable. Any amendment to the sales tax rate will require consultation with IMF and parliament’s approval.</p>
<p><strong>Supply chain</strong></p>
<p>Besides the sales tax issue, OMCs and dealers have requested for enhancement of their margins on petrol and HSD. Ogra has recommended an increase of OMCs and petroleum dealers’ margin by Rs1.13 and Rs1.40/litre, respectively, to ensure sustainability of the supply chain.</p>
<p>However, with partial amendment the summary proposed Rs1.13 per litre additional benefit to OMCs and Rs1.12 per litre to dealers. It said that since petroleum products were exempted from sales tax during current financial year, the refineries and OMCs’ unadjusted sales tax during July 2024-June 2025 on these products may be compensated through IFEM (estimated at Rs34bn).</p>
<p>“For FY2025-26, 3-5pc sales tax on these products may be imposed through Finance Act. However, in case the products remain exempted from sales tax in the FY 2025-26, the unadjusted sales tax may continue to be compensated through IFEM as a fallback option to keep the oil supply chain sustainable,” the petroleum division insisted.</p>

            <p><p>The first of 180 Pakistani Hajj flights scheduled to fly to Saudi Arabia’s Jeddah — part of the Road to Makkah Initiative — arrived at the King Abdul Aziz International Airport from Islamabad carrying 310 Haj pilgrims, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported today.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1492274">Launched</a> in 2019 at the Islamabad airport and later extended to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1833103">Karachi</a>, the Road to Makkah initiative offers an exemption to Haj pilgrims from the immigration process at Saudi airports by clearing them at their respective airports in Pakistan by Saudi immigration officials before boarding their flights.</p>
<p>Marking the second phase of the initiative, the passengers were received at the airport by Minister of Religious Affairs &amp; Interfaith Harmony Sardar Muhammad Yousaf, Consul General of Pakistan in Jeddah Khalid Majid, DG Hajj Abdul Wahab Soomro and the senior officers of the Consulate General of Pakistan. The pilgrims were presented bouqets by the receiving party.</p>
<p>This year, an estimated 50,500 Haj pilgrims will travel to Saudi Arabia under the initiative, with 28,000 departing from Islamabad and 22,500 from Karachi throughout 180 flights, out of which 100 will depart from Islamabad and 80 from Karachi.</p>
<p>Housing and other essential facilities have been arranged for all the pilgrims, including service personnel such as medical staff and officials from the Ministry of Religious Affairs, to facilitate the Haj pilgrims.</p>
<p>In April, a Saudi immigration team <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906978/saudi-immigration-team-to-process-haj-pilgrims-at-karachi-islamabad-airports">arrived</a> in the country to process Pakistani Haj pilgrims at Jinnah International Airport and Islamabad International Airport.</p>
<p>In 2025, Pakistan’s Haj quota was set at 179,210, with half of the quota meant to be managed by private Haj operators. However, only 23,000 people were able to go under private operators.</p>
<p>Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870331">Haj quotas</a> from Saudi Arabia.</p></p>

            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Saudi Arabia has deported a total of 5,033 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905327">Pakistani beggars</a> whereas another 369 individuals have been apprehended for begging in five other countries in the last 16 months.</p>
<p>This information was placed before the National Assembly by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Wednesday in a written reply to a question asked by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) MNA Sehar Kamran.</p>
<p>The official data provided by the minister shows that a total of 5,402 Pakistanis have been deported from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since January 2024. As many as 4,850 Pakistani nationals faced deportation from these countries in the year 2024 whereas 552 have returned to Pakistan this year.</p>
<p>The questioner has sought data of the last three years, but the minister provided details of the period starting from January 2024.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Another 369 individuals caught begging in five other countries; nearly 52pc deportees belong to Sindh; Pakistan has expelled over one million illegal Afghans</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Interestingly, the province-wise break-up of the data shows that most of those deported from these countries belong to Sindh province. A total of 2,795 people from the province are among those deported from these countries on begging charges whereas the number of such people belonging to Punjab stands at 1,437.</p>
<p>According to statistics, as many as 1,002 people from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 125 from Balochistan, 33 from Azad Kashmir and 10 from Islamabad are among those deported from the six countries.</p>
<p>After Saudi Arabia, the highest number of 247 Pakistanis has been repatriated from Iraq. The UAE, which raised the issue with the Pakistan government more vigorously and imposed strict restrictions on visas for the Pakistani nationals, has so far deported 58 such individuals during this period.</p>
<p><strong>Afghan Refugees</strong></p>
<p>In response to another question asked by Anjum Aqeel Khan of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), the interior minister informed the National Assembly that over one million “illegal Afghans”, including those possessing Afghan Citizen Card (ACC), had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906595">repatriated</a> since November 2023 under the Illegal Foreigner’s Repatriation Plan (IFRP).</p>
<p>“The IFRP has been approved by the federal government. Every sovereign state retains the right to deport illegal foreigners in order to safeguard its borders and national security.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are no international legal implications for Pakistan, as it is not a signatory to the 1951 UNHCR Refugee Convention or its 1967 Protocol with respect to Afghan repatriation,“ says the minister in his written reply. He said Pakistan did not intend to extend the duration of ACC holders for further period.</p>
<p>He further said that 1.377 million Afghan refugees, holding POR (Proof of Registration) had been repatriated to Afghanistan through the UNHCR repatriation programme since 2007.</p>
<p>He said there were 813,146 Afghans with ACC and 1.304m POR holders in Pakistan at present.</p>
