            <p><p>Yaum-i-Ashura processions commenced across the country on Sunday amid tight security, police said.</p>
<p>Yaum-i-Ashura is observed every year on Muharram 10 with solemnity to pay homage to Imam Husain — the grandson of Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) — and other martyrs of Karbala.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Karachi Traffic Police issued a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921828">traffic plan</a> for Muharram 8 to 10, outlining the procession routes as well as alternative traffic flows.</p>
<p>Stringent security measures are being taken across the country, such as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920725/army-to-be-deployed-across-country-for-security-during-muharram">army deployment</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919931">crackdown</a> on sectarian content and hate mongers, ahead of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920308">Ashura</a> (Muharram 10), being observed today.</p>
<p>In Karachi, the Ashura majlis commenced at Nishtar Park at around 8:30am, according to an alert from the police. “The number of participants is approximately 3500 to 4000 and it is being led by Shahenshah Hussain Naqvi.”</p>
<p>Traffic has been closed from main Numaish to MA Jinnah Road up to Kharadar  Husseinia Irania Imam Bargah, with the exception of Bab-e-Urdu Chowk, Karachi traffic police said in a post on X.</p>

<p>A total of 7,004 police personnel are present for surveillance and security for the main procession.</p>
<p>Additionally, 733 NGOs, as well as senior officers of Karachi Police, and 6,271 head constables and constables are performing duty today. Expert police snipers have also been deployed alongside the main procession.</p>
<p>“Traffic police officers and personnel have been deployed to maintain traffic flow on the main procession routes and crossings, including alternative traffic routes arranged for the 10th Muharram procession, so as to keep the traffic flowing by keeping the public safe from any inconvenience,” said a statement from the office of Karachi’s additional inspector general of police.</p>
<p>“Karachi Police is providing complete security to the mourners participating in the 10th Muharram processions.”</p>
<p>The statement urged the public to keep an eye on their surroundings and immediately inform the police on Madadgar 15 of any suspicious or unusual situation.</p>
<p>In Multan, 225 majlis and 283 processions have commenced across the city, according to commissioner Aamir Kareem Khan. More than 5,000 police personnel are providing security, and 12 vigilance teams have also been formed for monitoring.</p>
<p>The processions are expected to conclude at Haram Gate, where mourners will offer <em>asr</em> prayers.</p>
<p>“Special reserves are in place to deal with any kind of emergency that may arise,” said a statement from the Multan police. “In addition to rooftop duty, police personnel in white uniforms are also present on procession routes for surveillance.”</p>
<p>CCTV cameras have been installed at more than 180 places across Multan and are strictly monitoring the processions and gatherings , according to Deputy Commissioner Wasim Hamid Sindhu.</p>
<p>“Law and order across the province is being monitored from the central control room of the Home Department,” Multan City Police Officer (CPO) Sadiq Ali Dogar said.</p>
<p>Punjab Emergency Service Rescue 1122 put in place several measures, including 600 rescue personnel, 15 fire tenders, 30 ambulances, 93 motorbike ambulances, and two special vehicles deployed in Multan’s Shujaabad tehsil and Jalalpur Pirwala.</p>
<p>Similar arrangements have been made across Punjab on the instructions of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, with more than 12,000 rescuers deployed for Ashura and routine rescue operations, according to Emergency Services Secretary Dr Rizwan Naseer.</p>
<p>“Across Punjab, 815 ambulances, 2,166 motorbikes, and 316 fire and rescue emergency vehicles have been deployed,” he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Lahore, 55 emergency ambulances, 300 rescue motorbikes, 44 fire and rescue and specialised emergency vehicles have been deployed, as well as 1,350 rescuers deployed.</p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid rich tribute to the sacrifice of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) and his companions, saying that Ashura gives us a message of sacrifice, truthfulness, sincere determination, and standing up for the truth.</p>
<p>In their separate messages on Yaum-i-Ashura, they urged the nation to uphold the values and principles of fortitude and courage demonstrated by the martyrs of Karbala and to exhibit perseverance in the face of trials, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>President Zardari said that Karbala is a symbol of an eternal struggle against falsehood. “This day is not only an unparalleled story of sacrifice, loyalty, and patience but also a bright lamp that shows the path of truth and righteousness in the darkness of every era.”</p>
<p>In his message, PM Shehbaz said: “Karbala teaches us that although the path of truth is difficult, it is the path that leads to the pleasure of Allah Almighty and the satisfaction of hearts and eternal prosperity.”</p>
<p>He said the message of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) is not limited to his time but is a universal message, which even today convinces us that a Muslim stands for the truth, supports the oppressed, and advocates justice in all circumstances.</p></p>

            <p><p>Calling himself a “simple Buddhist monk” who usually didn’t celebrate birthdays, the Dalai Lama marked his 90th on Sunday by praying for peace after China insisted it would have the final say on who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921752/dalai-lama-confirms-he-will-have-a-successor-after-his-death">succeeded</a> the Tibetan spiritual leader.</p>
<p>Chanting of red-robed monks and nuns rang out from Himalayan hilltop forested temples in India, home to the Dalai Lama since he and thousands of other Tibetans fled Chinese troops who crushed an uprising in their capital Lhasa in 1959.</p>
<p>“I am just a simple Buddhist monk; I don’t normally engage in birthday celebrations,” the Dalai Lama said in a message, thanking those marking it with him for using the opportunity “to cultivate peace of mind and compassion”.</p>
<p>Dressed in traditional robes and a flowing yellow wrap, he walked with the aid of two monks while flashing his trademark beaming smile to thousands of followers.</p>

<p>Beijing condemns the Nobel Peace Prize winner — who has led a lifelong campaign for greater autonomy for Tibet, a vast high-altitude plateau — as a rebel and separatist.</p>
<p>Alongside the celebrations, however, is the worry for Tibetans in exile that China will name its successor to bolster control over the territory it poured troops into in 1950 and has ruled ever since.</p>
<p>That raises the likelihood of rival challengers to the post; one by self-declared atheist Beijing, the other by the Dalai Lama’s office based in neighbouring India, a regional rival of China.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#good-heart" id="good-heart" title="Permalink"></a>‘Good heart’</h2>
<p>The celebrations on Sunday are the culmination of days of long-life prayers for Tenzin Gyatso, who followers believe is the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, a man whose moral teachings and idiosyncratic humour have made him one of the world’s most popular religious leaders.</p>
<p>“While it is important to work for material development, it is vital to focus on achieving peace of mind through cultivating a good heart and by being compassionate, not just toward near and dear ones, but toward everyone,” he said in his birthday message.</p>
<p>“Through this, you will contribute to making the world a better place.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The celebrations also included his key announcement that, after being inundated with messages of support from fellow Tibetans both inside and in exile, the spiritual institution would continue after his death.</p>
<p>He said he had received appeals from followers from across the Himalayan region, Mongolia and parts of Russia and China.</p>
<p>The seemingly esoteric matters of reincarnation have real-world political consequences, with Tibetans fearing his death will mark a major setback in his push for more autonomy for the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama said his India-based office alone would “exclusively” identify that successor — prompting a swift and sharp reply from China that the reincarnation “must be approved by the central government” in Beijing.</p>
<p>China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921605#:~:text=China-,said,-on%20Wednesday%20that">said</a> the succession would be carried out “by drawing lots from a golden urn”, foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>That urn is held by Beijing, and the Dalai Lama has warned that, when used dishonestly, it lacks “any spiritual quality”.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered effusive birthday greetings on Sunday, calling the Dalai Lama an “enduring symbol of love”.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said in a statement that Washington was “committed to promoting respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of Tibetans”.</p>
<p>Among the crowds attending the celebrations was Hollywood star Richard Gere, a longtime backer of the Tibetans in exile, who on Sunday said the Dalai Lama “totally embodies selflessness, complete love and compassion and wisdom”.</p>

<p>Messages of support were also given by former US presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush, as well as Barack Obama, who said the Dalai Lama had shown what it means to “speak up for freedom and dignity”.</p>
<p>The ceremony ended with the Dalai Lama eating a slice of cake and thousands singing “happy birthday”.</p>
<p>No details have been released for the future succession.</p>
<p>All so far have been men or boys, often identified as toddlers and taking up the role only as teenagers.</p>
<p>The current Dalai Lama, himself identified in 1937, has said that if there is a successor it will come from the “free world” outside China’s control.</p>
<p>In a speech to followers on Sunday, the Dalai Lama said his practice of Buddhism meant he had dedicated his life towards seeking compassion.</p>
<p>“I’m now 90 and… when I reflect on my life, I see that I have not wasted my life at all”, he said, speaking in Tibetan.</p>
<p>“I would not have regrets at the time of my death; rather I would be able to die very peacefully.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Elon Musk, an ex-ally of US President Donald Trump, said on Saturday he had launched a new political party in the United States to challenge what the tech billionaire described as the country’s “one-party system.”</p>
<p>The world’s richest person — and Trump’s biggest political donor in the 2024 election — had a bitter <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915756">falling out</a> with the president after leading the Republican’s effort to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891574">slash</a> spending and cut federal jobs as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).</p>
<p>Musk has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921560/trump-musk-revive-feud-over-big-beautiful-tax-cut-bill">clashed</a> with Trump over the president’s massive domestic spending <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922374">plan</a>, saying it would explode the US debt, and vowed to do everything in his power to defeat lawmakers who voted for it.</p>
<p>Now he has created the so-called America Party, his own political framework, through which to try and achieve that.</p>
<p>“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste &amp; graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” the SpaceX and Tesla boss posted on X, the social media platform that he owns.</p>
<p>“Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#laser-focus-on-vulnerable-lawmakers" id="laser-focus-on-vulnerable-lawmakers" title="Permalink"></a>‘Laser-focus’ on vulnerable lawmakers</h2>
<p>It is not clear how much impact the new party would have on the 2026 mid-term elections, or on the presidential vote two years after that.</p>
<p>The Trump-Musk feud reignited in dramatic fashion late last month as Trump pushed Republicans in Congress to ram through his massive domestic agenda in the form of the One Big Beautiful Bill.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Musk expressed fierce opposition to the legislation and ruthlessly attacked its Republican backers for supporting “debt slavery.”</p>
<p>He vowed to launch a new political party to challenge lawmakers who campaigned on reduced federal spending only to vote for the bill, which experts say will pile an extra $3.4 trillion over a decade onto the US deficit.</p>
<p>“They will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth,” Musk said earlier this week.</p>
<p>After Musk heavily criticised the flagship spending bill — which eventually passed Congress and was signed into law — Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921414">threatened</a> to deport the tech tycoon and strip federal funds from his businesses.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to take a look,” the president told reporters when asked if he would consider deporting Musk, who was born in South Africa and has held US citizenship since 2002.</p>
<p>On Friday, after posting the poll, Musk laid out a possible political battle plan to pick off vulnerable House and Senate seats and become “the deciding vote” on key legislation.</p>
<p>“One way to execute on this would be to laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts,” Musk posted on X.</p>
<p>All 435 US House seats are up for grabs every two years, while about one third of the Senate’s 100 members, who serve six-year terms, are elected every two years.</p>
<p>Some observers were quick to point out how third-party campaigns have historically split the vote — as businessman Ross Perot’s independent presidential run in 1992 did when it helped doom George H.W. Bush’s re-election bid, resulting in Democrat Bill Clinton’s victory.</p>
<p>“You are pulling a Ross Perot, and I don’t like it,” one X user wrote to Musk.</p></p>
