            <p><p>China acknowledged Pakistan’s role in regional peace during a meeting with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, the military’s media affairs wing said on Friday.</p>
<p>Pakistan and China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/china-says-it-backs-pakistan-in-defending-sovereignty">share</a> a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation, and regional connectivity.</p>
<p>Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors, including trade, energy, infrastructure, and defence collaboration, with initiatives like the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879166">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.</p>
<p>During his official visit to the People’s Republic of China, the army chief held meetings with senior Chinese political and military leadership in Beijing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Chinese military leadership reiterated full confidence in the strength of the bilateral defence partnership and acknowledged Pakistan’s pivotal role in promoting regional peace,” it said.</p>
<p>COAS Munir called on Chinese Vice President Han Zheng and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the statement read.</p>
<p>“Discussions focused on the evolving regional and global political landscape, connectivity initiatives under the CPEC, and the need for coordinated responses to shared geopolitical challenges,” it added.</p>
<p>“Both sides expressed satisfaction over the depth of bilateral engagement and reiterated their shared commitment to sovereign equality, multilateral cooperation, and long-term regional stability.”</p>
<p>The statement continued that the “Chinese leadership lauded the Pakistan Armed Forces as a cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor to peace in South Asia”.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The military engagement between both sides included “comprehensive exchanges on defence and security cooperation, including counterterrorism collaboration, joint training, defence modernisation, and enhanced institutional linkages”, ISPR said.</p>
<p>“Emphasis was placed on improving operational interoperability and strategic coordination to confront hybrid and transnational threats,” it added.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir held meetings with various Chinese military leaders, the statement read, adding, “Upon arrival at the  People’s Liberation Army Headquarters, the COAS was presented with a guard of honour, symbolising the longstanding camaraderie between the two armed forces.”</p>
<p>The COAS appreciated China’s “consistent support” and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to “further expanding military-to-military cooperation across all domains”, the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>The statement said that the visit “reflects the growing depth of politico-military ties between the two brotherly nations and underscores their shared resolve to advance regional security through sustained high-level dialogue and engagements”.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926296/pakistan-signs-maritime-mou-with-chinese-shipping-giant-to-boost-collaboration">signed</a> a memorandum of understanding with Chinese shipping giant, Shandong Xinxu Group, in a move that is set to bring about a “major transformation” in the shipping sector.</p>
<p>Last week, Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar met with Chinese foreign minister, where both sides <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924658">reaffirmed</a> their commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation and promoting regional peace, stability and development.</p></p>

            <p><p>At least nine people have died as floods and landslides triggered by heavy rain continue to wreak havoc on Gilgit Baltistan, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as the region experienced cloudburst-induced floods that claimed lives and damaged infrastructure. On Monday, floods triggered by heavy rain <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> through GB’s Babusar area in Diamer district and Naran, leaving many stranded. Subsequently, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/pmd-issues-glof-alert-for-gb-kp-as-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-from-diamer-amid-floods">issued</a> a landslide alert for the northern areas of the country.</p>
<p>GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq, in a statement, confirmed that nine people have lost their lives in the floods and landslides across the region — including two women and two children — while the search for people swept away by the flood is still underway.</p>
<p>In his statement, he estimated that the “number of people swept away by floodwater could be around 12-14.” On the other hand, more than a dozen people were reported to be injured in the floods.</p>
<p>“Over 300 stranded tourists have been rescued so far,” he said, adding that rescue operations have been challenging as floods and landslides continue to ravage parts of the region.</p>
<p>Detailing the property damage caused by floods and landslides, he stated, “In total, more than 500 houses have been destroyed due to the floods and about 12 kilometres of roads have been destroyed as well.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>He went on to say: “A total of 27 bridges and 22 vehicles were also destroyed by the floodwaters across the region, along with countless shops, cattle sheds and logs of timber.”</p>
<p>Both the Pakistan Army and GB scouts played an active role in the rescue and search operation, he said.</p>
<p>“Efforts are also underway to provide water and electricity to thousands of people who are now deprived of these facilities as a result of damage to the water supply and electricity grids,” Faraq said in his statement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a search operation was underway to find the body of 17-year-old Arman, who was swept away while crossing a nullah in Gujar Khan on Wednesday, a Rescue 1122 official said on Friday.</p>
<p>“Rescue divers have combed through an area 12 km from the site of the accident without any success”, District Emergency Officer Rescue 1122 Rawalpindi Sibghatullah said in a statement.</p>
<p>“The heirs of the victim have expressed their satisfaction over the rescue efforts,” he added.</p>
<p>On Thursday, residents of the housing society where the teenager lived blocked Rawalpindi’s Grand Trunk Road after the rescue teams could not recover the body.</p>
<p>The boy was walking on a small passage when high-speed torrents swept him away in deep waters.</p>
<p>Two of his relatives jumped into the water to rescue him, but they told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the water was moving at high speed and the boy could not be saved.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926508/gujar-khan-police-arrest-head-constable-for-allegedly-filming-women-in-hospital-toilets' target='_blank'><strong>Gujar Khan police arrest head constable for allegedly filming women in hospital toilets</strong></a>
            <p><p>Gujar Khan police have arrested a head constable for allegedly recording women in the toilets of the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital and have begun an investigation, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, Assistant Superintendent of Police Syed Daniyal said, “The police received a complaint from a resident who said that the suspect — a serving head constable posted in Lahore office of Punjab Police — was allegedly involved in filming women while they were using the toilets in the hospital’s wards.”</p>
<p>The police arrested the suspect from the hospital and also recovered his cell phone, he said.</p>
<p>“It was during a preliminary investigation that police discovered that the suspect was a serving officer.”</p>
<p>Police said that several compromised videos of women using the toilets had been found on his cell phone, which have been sent for forensic verification.</p>
<p>Gujar Khan Station House Officer Nazeer Ahmed Ghaeba told <em>Dawn.com</em> that police would investigate the case on merit and no favour or leniency would be exhibited.</p>
<p>The police have registered the case under sections 354 (Assault or use of criminal force to a woman and stripping her of her clothes) and 292 (Sale etc of obscene books, etc) of the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/1860/actXLVof1860.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pakistan Penal Code</a>.</p>
<p>When approached for comment, Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Medical Superintendent (MS) Dr Sarmad Kiyani said there were no cameras in the hospital’s restrooms.</p>
<p>“The only cameras in the hospital are in the corridors, not in the toilets. We don’t know what kinds of videos they found on his phone. It’s up to the police to investigate the matter,” he said.</p>
<p>ASP Daniyal also told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the suspect had previously been booked for sexual assault, but the case was later dismissed.</p>
<p>According to the first information report (FIR) of the 2020 case, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, the suspect had allegedly sexually assaulted a widow and was booked under Section 452 (House-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) and Section 345 (Assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the PPC.</p>
<p>However, he had reconciled with the victim, so the case was withdrawn and he was reinstated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, residents have urged Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to take serious notice of such incidents in government hospitals.</p>
<p>In March, Swabi police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897090/tiktoker-held-for-filming-women-while-shopping">arrested</a> a TikToker for making videos and photos of women and girls while they were shopping and uploading them to his account.</p>
<p>A similar incident occurred in Khanewal in December, where a suspect  allegedly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1882062">filmed</a> women customers in the changing rooms of a garment retailer in Khanewal with his mobile phone. He was later sent on judicial remand.</p>
<p>Last June, police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1837384">lodged a case</a> against the owners and staff of a private girls’ hostel in Lahore’s Johar Town for recording videos of the residents through hidden cameras installed in washrooms, causing apprehensions that these clips may be sold and used on the ‘dark web’ or social media.</p></p>
