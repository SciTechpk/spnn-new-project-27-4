            <p><p>The finance ministry on Monday projected consumer inflation for July to remain in a range of 3.5-4.5 per cent, citing stable prices and improved supply conditions, as price pressures ease further after the previous fiscal year’s sharp decline.</p>
<p>Inflation stood at 3.2pc in June, the ministry said in its monthly economic report, while average inflation for the fiscal year ending June 30 dropped to 4.49pc, a nine-year low, from 23.4pc the year before. The country’s fiscal year begins on July 1.</p>
<p>The ministry said the economy is expected to sustain its recovery in the early months of fiscal year 2026, underpinned by an improved macroeconomic backdrop and growing investor confidence.</p>
<p>Large-scale manufacturing likely maintained momentum in June, supported by rising private sector credit offtake and expanding production activity, the report said. The rebound is expected to lift imports of raw materials and intermediate goods, while aiding value-added exports, it added.</p>
<p>Strengthening domestic demand, a stable exchange rate, and steady global commodity prices were also likely to boost exports, remittances and imports in July, reinforcing external sector stability, the ministry said.</p>
<p>According to the report, the automobile sector exhibited strong performance during Jul-Jun FY2025, supported by substantial increases in the production of cars (40pc), trucks &amp; buses (96.8pc), and sports utility vehicles &amp; pick-ups (74.6pc).</p>
<p>Cement dispatches stood at 46.2 million tonnes during FY2025, marking a 2.1pc increase over the previous year; however, domestic cement sales declined by 3.1pc to 37 million tonnes, while exports rose significantly by 29.5pc to 9.2 million tonnes.</p>
<p>However, it warned that recent heavy rains could pose risks to agricultural output and supply chains, potentially impacting the inflation outlook in the coming months.</p>
<p>Since June  26, rain‑ and flood‑related incidents have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930">killed</a> at least 266 people and injured more than 630 nationwide, according to the National Disaster Management Authority, adding that 1,557 houses had been destroyed.</p>
<p>Last week, the Asian Deve­lopment Bank (ADB) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926217">projected</a> Pakistan’s economy to grow at a steady pace of 3pc in FY26, even as it lowered growth forecasts for the broader Asian region amid global trade uncertainty.</p></p>

            <p><p>The German Consulate General in Karachi on Monday announced on social media that it will be closed for services to non-EU citizens “until further notice”.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, all services for non-EU citizens have been suspended, including visa appointments.</p>
<p>“All confirmed visa appointments for non-EU citizens for an undisclosed time are cancelled and will not be rescheduled,” the notice read. “Applicants will need to register again via our appointment system.”</p>

            <p><p>The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) on Monday criticised the federal government’s move to ban Pakistani piligims from travelling to Iran and Iraq by road.</p>
<p>Pilgrims <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855955">visit</a> Iraq to attend the chehlum commemoration — also known as Arbaeen (40 in Arabic) — to mark the 40th day of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922472/ashura-processions-in-major-cities-of-country-conclude-peacefully">mourning</a> for the martyrdom of Imam Husain, the grandson of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</p>
<p>A day earlier, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that <em>zaireen</em> (pilgrims) will be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926929">barred</a> from travelling by road to Iran and Iraq for the Arbaeen pilgrimage due to public and national security.</p>
<p>PPP leader Hassan Murtaza issued a statement today, saying: “The federal and provincial governments should ensure the safety of pilgrims with the help of security agencies.”</p>
<p>The state was responsible for the security of travellers, he added.</p>
<p>He criticised the ban, stating that it will severely affect the common man. “Why can’t a common man, who pays taxes to the state, travel by land?” he said.</p>
<p>The PPP leader said that pilgrimages were being removed from the reach of the poor.</p>
<p>“The Arbaeen pilgrims save up each penny to go on pilgrimage with their family. Visitors prefer travelling by road because it costs less money,” he added.</p>
<p>Iraq’s Karbala, where Imam Hussein and his brother Abbas are buried in two enormous mausoleums facing each other, is the centre of the Shia world during this time. More than <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854804/millions-of-pilgrims-rally-for-arbaeen">21 million</a> devotees took part in the pilgrimage last year.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Pakistan is set to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922178">introduce</a> a new travel management system from Jan 1, 2026, under which pilgrims will only be allowed to undertake the journey under registered organisers.</p>
<p>Under the new measures, the traditional Salar System will be abolished and replaced with a Zaireen Group Organisers model. Alongside weekly flights to Iran being increased from six to 15, 107 additional special flights will also be arranged for pilgrims heading to Iraq.</p>
<p>After the PM-interior minister’s meeting a day earlier, Pakistan International Airlines <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926929#:~:text=PIA%20announces%20special%20flights%20for%20pilgrims">announced</a> that it will start special flights for Iraq to accommodate <em>zaireen</em> from Aug 8 to 11.</p>
<p>Reacting sharply to the move, the Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927007">rejec­ted</a> the ban on Sunday, calling it unacceptable, unjustified and unconstitutional.</p></p>
