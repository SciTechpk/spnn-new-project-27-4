            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday expressed his willingness to talk with India to resolve ongoing disputes between the two countries, including the Kashmir issue and water security, during his visit to Iran.</p>
<p>The PM is currently on a four-nation tour to friendly countries, where he will express his gratitude for supporting Pakistan during the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military escalation</a> with India.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, PM Shehbaz was received Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian at Saadabad Palace in the Iranian capital, where he received a guard of honour.</p>

<p>Addressing a joint press conference with Iranian President Masood Pezeshkian, PM Shehbaz said that the two countries’ delegations had a “very productive and useful meeting … which covered all areas of our mutual interests and cooperation”.</p>
<p>“There was total agreement that our two brotherly and neighbourly countries must enhance our cooperation in the field of trade, investments, commerce, in fact, every walk of life,” he said.</p>
<p>The prime minister said that he thanked Pezeshkian for his support during the military conflict with India and emphasised that both nations have deep-rooted cultural ties and historical relations, adding that they decided to turn these relations into a “very productive cooperation in various fields of life”.</p>
<p>“My dear brother, I dearly appreciate your sense of concern and brotherly feelings for the people of Pakistan and your ardent desire that this crisis comes to a grinding halt before it, God forbid, escalates,” Shehbaz said, addressing the Iranian president.</p>

<p>The PM also lauded Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi for visiting Pakistan during the military escalation, calling him an “outstanding diplomat” and stating that they had a “heart to heart discussion”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan came out of this conflict victorious … through our brave actions by our outstanding armed forces,” Shehbaz said.</p>
<p>“We wanted peace, we want peace and we will work for peace in the region through talks on the table and resolve our outstanding issues, including the Kashmir problem, according to the resolutions passed by the [United Nations] Security Council … and even by Indian Lok Sabha (parliament) back in 1954,” he added, speaking about when then-prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru committed to a plebiscite in the disputed territory.</p>

<p>The Elysee had been hoping that the visit to Vietnam would showcase France’s reach into the Indo-Pacific, but it has been shadowed by the incident which occurred as the doors of the presidential plane swung open after landing in Hanoi Sunday.</p>

<p>This is the third time this month that Macron has been the subject of viral video footage at a time when France says it is being targeted by repeated disinformation attacks as Russia steps up attacks on Ukraine.</p>
<p>It was falsely claimed that Macron <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910692/uproar-in-france-after-social-media-claims-macron-takes-cocaine">took cocaine</a> on a trip to Kyiv alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and images also emerged purporting to show Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan dominate the French leader in a handshake.</p>
<p>Brigitte sticks out both her hands and gives her husband’s face a shove, according to footage shot by <em>The Associated Press</em> news agency.</p>
<p>The French president appears startled but quickly recovers and turns to wave through the open door. But with most of her body hidden by the aircraft, it is impossible to see his wife’s facial expression or body language.</p>
<p>“My wife and I were squabbling, we were rather joking, and I was taken by surprise,” he said. Now it’s “become a kind of planetary catastrophe, and some are even coming up with theories,” Macron told reporters.</p>

<p>Macron testily referred to the other incidents, including the images shot on a train to Kyiv where some accounts falsely claimed he shared cocaine with Merz and Starmer.</p>
<p>But the object Macron removed from the table when the media entered was a tissue. Erdogan, meanwhile, was filmed holding the president’s finger at a summit.</p>
<p>“For three weeks … there are people who have watched videos and think I shared a bag of cocaine, that I had a fight with the Turkish president, and that now I’m having a domestic dispute with my wife,” said Macron. “None of these are true. Everyone needs to calm down.”</p>
<p>After the incident in Hanoi, the couple proceeded down the staircase for the official welcome by Vietnamese officials, though Brigitte Macron did not take her husband’s arm when he offered it.</p>
<p>The video circulated rapidly online, promoted particularly by accounts that are habitually hostile to the French leader.</p>
<p>Macron’s office initially denied the authenticity of the images, before they were confirmed as genuine. A close associate of the president later described the incident as a couple’s harmless “squabble”.</p>

<p>Referring to the past incidents, Macron said: “In these three videos, I took a tissue, shook someone’s hand and just joked with my wife, as we do quite often. Nothing more.</p>
<p>“We have loads of accounts, anonymous or not, whose frustrations are going to their heads, including news commentators who said this morning that I have the diplomacy of a beaten man,” he added.</p>
<p>He emphasised that all three videos were “completely authentic”, but the meanings attached to them were not.</p>
<p>Vietnam is the first stop on Macron’s almost week-long tour of Southeast Asia where he will pitch France as a reliable alternative to the United States and China. He will also visit Indonesia and Singapore.</p>
<p>The relationship between Macron, 47, and his 72-year-old wife has long been a subject of fascination at home and abroad.</p>
<p>She was a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1330096">drama teacher</a> and he a pupil when they met at a private school in their hometown of Amiens in northeast France. A mother of three children, Brigitte divorced her husband and began a relationship with Macron while he was in his late teens.</p>
<p>A high-profile first lady, she has taken legal action to counter false claims on social media about her gender.</p></p>
