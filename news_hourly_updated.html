                <h2>US State Department designates BLA, Majeed Brigade as foreign terrorist organisations</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The US State Department on Monday added the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and its alias, the Majeed Brigade, to its Foreign Terrorist Organisation list, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/08/terrorist-designation-of-the-majeed-brigade/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349">proscribed</a> the Majeed Brigade, which is the BLA‚Äôs dedicated suicide squad. The BLA itself was proscribed in 2006, according to the National Counter-Terrorism Authority‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://nacta.gov.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/proscribed-organizations-06-oct-2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">list of proscribed organisations</a>.</p>
<p>Pakistan has previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925093/pakistan-seeks-listing-of-majeed-brigade-as-terror-group">requested</a> that the Majeed Brigade be listed as an international terrorist organisation. In 2019, the State Department <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1491717">labelled</a> the BLA as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT), making it a crime for anyone in the US to assist the militants, but did not designate the Majeed Brigade at that time.</p>
<p><a class="link--external" href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FTO designations</a> are made by the Secretary of State, following section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and ‚Äúare an effective means of curtailing support for terrorist activities and pressuring groups to get out of the terrorism business‚Äù. SDGT designations, meanwhile, target individuals and groups under <a class="link--external" href="https://www.state.gov/executive-order-13224/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Executive Order 13224</a>, even if they are not part of a formally recognised organisation.</p>
<p>According to today‚Äôs press release, the Department added the BLA to the FTO list, while adding the Majeed Brigade as an alias to the BLA‚Äôs previous SDGT designation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBLA was designated as an SDGT in 2019 following several terrorist attacks.‚ÄØ Since 2019, BLA has claimed responsibility for additional attacks, including by the Majeed Brigade,‚Äù the press release read.‚ÄØ</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúIn 2024, BLA claimed it had committed suicide attacks near the airport in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1863448">Karachi</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1822759">Gwadar Port Authority Complex</a>.‚ÄØ In 2025, BLA claimed responsibility for the March hijacking of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419">Jaffar Express train</a> travelling from Quetta to Peshawar, killing 31 civilians and security personnel and holding hostage over 300 train passengers.‚Äù‚ÄØ‚ÄØ</p>
<p>The State Department said that the designation demonstrated US President Donald Trump‚Äôs commitment to counter-terrorism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTerrorist designations play a critical role in our fight against this scourge and are an effective way to curtail support for terrorist activities,‚Äù the press release stated.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs actions are taken pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, and Executive Order 13224, as amended.‚Äù‚ÄØ</p>

<p>Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti welcomed the State Department‚Äôs designation in a post on X, lauding the federal government and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir for presenting Islamabad‚Äôs case to Washington.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe welcome the US decision to designate BLA and its alias Majeed Brigade as terrorist outfits,‚Äù Bugti wrote. ‚ÄúThese groups have long shed innocent blood under the false cover of ethnicity and rights.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTerrorism is terrorism; no cause justifies killing civilians. The world must unite to end this menace.‚Äù</p>

<p>Talking to <em>Geo News</em>, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry termed the development a fruit of Pakistan‚Äôs successful diplomacy and a ‚Äúgreat win‚Äù for the country. He said the groups were ‚Äúproxies‚Äù of India that were sponsored by the neighbouring country and others.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe day is not far when their sponsors will also be on the list of terrorists. This will not only strengthen Pakistan against fighting terrorist organisations, but the stronger Pakistan is against terrorism, the safer the world will be from terrorists,‚Äù he said</p>
<p>Chaudhry said the development showed the world stood with Pakistan‚Äôs stance and the country in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are winning this fight every day and such uplifting news and successes will quickly bring this fight to its logical end.‚Äù</p>
<p>The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912830">intensity</a> of their attacks. The outlawed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897969">BLA</a>, in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.</p>
<p>In April, Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">accused</a> India of activating its ‚Äúassets‚Äù to inte¬≠nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting ‚Äúirr¬≠e¬≠futable evidence‚Äù of Ind¬≠ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind¬≠ian military personnel, particularly in Balochistan.</p>
<p>Last month, the Foreign Office (FO) reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs stance against terrorism, saying that the country has ‚Äúeffectively and comprehensively dismantled‚Äù terrorist outfits.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan condemns terrorism in all forms and manifestations; zero tolerance, and international cooperation against terrorism are cornerstones of our policy,‚Äù the FO said in a statement.</p>
<p>The FO‚Äôs statement came in the wake of the State Department <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925022/fo-says-pakistan-has-dismantled-terrorist-outfits-amid-us-designation-of-group-blamed-for-pahalgam-attack">designating</a> The Resistance Front ‚Äî the little-known group responsible for the Pahalgam attack on April 22 ‚Äî as an FTO and a ‚Äúfront and proxy‚Äù of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).</p>
<p>The Pahalgam attack ‚Äî which resulted in the deaths of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a> ‚Äî sparked a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military confrontation</a> between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan as New Delhi blamed it on Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral investigation</a>.</p>
<p>The BLA‚Äôs designation comes as relations between Islamabad and Washington are improving.</p>
<p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir completed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929938">visit</a> to the US on Sunday, terming the trip ‚Äî the second in just one-and-a-half months ‚Äî a ‚Äúnew dimension‚Äù in ties between both nations.</p>
<p>The COAS engaged in high-level interactions with senior political and military leadership, as well as members of the Pakistani diaspora, the military‚Äôs media wing said.</p>
<p>He also visited the US in June on a five-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917414">official visit</a>, where he met with Trump over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">luncheon</a>, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.</p>
<p>Also in June, United States Central Command (Centcom) chief Army General Michael Kurilla praised Pakistan as a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524/us-centcom-chief-lauds-phenomal-partner-pakistan-in-counter-terrorism-efforts">phenomenal partner</a> in the world of counter-terrorism‚Äù, citing the nation‚Äôs struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K).</p>

            <p><p>The federal government on Monday welcomed the decision by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague to issue an ‚ÄúAward on Issues of General Interpretation of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT)‚Äù in the Indus Waters case, stating that India must generally ‚Äúlet flow‚Äù the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúunrestricted use‚Äù.</p>
<p>India in April held the <a class="link--external" href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTs/Volume%20419/volume-419-I-6032-English.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IWT</a> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">in abeyance</a> following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam that killed 26 ‚Äî an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">termed</a> any attempt to suspend its water share an ‚Äúact of war‚Äù, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907454">considering</a> court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920611/pakistan-hails-hague-courts-supplemental-award-in-indus-waters-case-says-india-cant-sideline-arbitration-process">supplemental award</a> by the PCA in June held that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.

<p>‚ÄúThis arbitration concerns the interpretation and application of the IWT to certain design elements of the run-of-river hydro-electric plants that India is permitted by the treaty to construct on the tributaries of the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab Rivers.‚Äù</p>
<p>Regarding the overall approach to Article 3 (provisions regarding western rivers) of the IWT, the award said: ‚ÄúThe general rule is that India shall ‚Äòlet flow‚Äô the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan‚Äôs unrestricted use.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere are certain specified exceptions to this rule, including in relation to the generation of hydroelectric power, but these exceptions must be strictly construed: the design and operation of run-of-river hydroelectric plants must hew strictly to the requirements in the treaty, rather than to
what India might consider an ‚Äòideal‚Äô or ‚Äòbest practices‚Äô approach.‚Äù</p>
<p>It further noted that questions relating to the balance between the parties‚Äô respective rights and obligations in this regard were to be identified and addressed through the treaty‚Äôs procedures for notification, objection and dispute resolution in furtherance of the treaty‚Äôs objective and its obligations of mutual cooperation.</p>

<p>The PCA said that to date, India had not participated in the arbitration proceedings and had repeatedly objected to the court‚Äôs competence of the court, adding that it had addressed the issue on various counts before.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThroughout these proceedings, the court has ensured that India is fully informed in respect of the
proceedings and that the opportunity to participate remains open to it. Notwithstanding this, the court
has endeavoured to ascertain, understand, and consider India‚Äôs views, drawing on available materials,
including the records of the commission, correspondence between the parties, and/or submissions by
India in previous dispute resolution proceedings under the treaty,‚Äù the PCA said.</p>
<p>It added that it had also taken steps to test the accuracy of Pakistan‚Äôs claims, including by requesting further written submissions from Pakistan, by questioning Pakistan both before and during the hearing on the merits, by requesting that Pakistan produce historical evidence concerning the operation of the IWT and the Permanent Indus Commission, and by considering publicly available materials and jurisprudence not presented by Pakistan.</p>
<p>The PCA explained that the Aug 8 award addressed questions concerning the treaty‚Äôs overall interpretation and application, including in relation to Article 3 and Paragraph 8 of Annexure D (which concerns new run-of-river hydro-electric plants that India may construct on the western rivers).</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe award also addresses a related question on the legal effect of decisions issued by dispute resolution bodies under the treaty (namely, courts of arbitration and neutral experts),‚Äù the PCA press release said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe award is binding on the parties and without appeal,‚Äù the press release stated.</p>
<p>A statement from the Foreign Office (FO) said Pakistan welcomed the award.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe award carries special significance in the wake of India‚Äôs recent announcement to hold the IWT in abeyance, and its earlier decision to boycott the proceedings of the Court of Arbitration. It is an endorsement of Pakistan‚Äôs historical stance on the afore-stated issues.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan remains committed to full implementation of the IWT. It also expects India to immediately resume the normal functioning of the treaty and faithfully implement the award announced by the Court of Arbitration.‚Äù</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com:443/feeds/home#awards-details" id="awards-details" title="Permalink"></a>Award‚Äôs details</h2>
<p>Among its 10 findings, the court said the awards of a court of arbitration were final, binding on the parties and had a controlling legal effect on subsequent neutral experts, subsequent courts of arbitration and the court that issued the award.</p>
<p>Further, it pointed out that to the extent that a court of arbitration and a neutral expert were operating at the same time on related matters, it was incumbent on both to pay attention to decisions of the other that had a binding or otherwise controlling effect.</p>
<p>The court said that the decisions of a neutral expert on matters within their competence were ‚Äúfinal and binding‚Äù on the parties and any court of arbitration, in respect of the particular matter on which the decision was made.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDue to the vulnerability of Pakistan as the downstream riparian of a critical but shared nature resource, and the potential for serious conflict between India and Pakistan in this regard, the object and purpose of the treaty, as it relates to the western rivers, is to delimit the two states‚Äô respective rights and obligations, in conjunction with mutual cooperation and effective dispute resolution procedures for whenever questions as to the interpretation and application of these rights and obligations arise,‚Äù the court reiterated about the treaty‚Äôs objectives and aims.</p>
<p>The award said Paragraphs 8(d), 8(e), and 8(f) of Annexure D, on low-level outlets, gated spillways, and intakes for the turbines respectively, contained specific directions about their existence, size and/or location (addressed below), which might depart from engineering best practices that sought to maximise efficiency or power output.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese limitations were of central significance in the treaty negotiations for addressing Pakistan‚Äôs
concerns as to India‚Äôs ability to release virtually all the water in dam reservoirs, along with
sediment, and to withhold a large volume of water when refilling the reservoirs,‚Äù the court said.</p>
<p>On maximum pondage, the award said that the pondage required for firm power was
to be calculated based on the water accumulated over a seven-day period at the minimum mean
discharge (a historically low flow rate), taking into account the daily and weekly downstream
release requirements set out in Paragraph 15 of Annexure D and a ‚Äúrealistic, well-founded, and
defensible projection of the plant‚Äôs installed capacity and anticipated load‚Äù.</p>
<p>It noted that maximum pondage should not be ‚Äúmore than twice this amount‚Äù.</p>
<p>The court further said that when designing a run-of-river plant, India was only entitled to freeboard the vertical distance in the dam wall from the full supply level to the top of the dam of a height necessary to address the safety of the dam as a whole from overtopping, with reference to internationally recognised standards.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor each of the components of dam design indicated above, the parties must cooperate from an early stage of planning by India for a new hydro-electric plant on the western rivers, such that India‚Äôs designs can be modified as necessary in light of valid concerns raised by Pakistan in relation to these components. Ultimately, India bears the burden of establishing that its designs are treaty-compliant,‚Äù the award‚Äôs findings concluded.</p>
<p>However, the award clarified that the court did not address the application of its findings to the specific circumstances of the Kishenganga Hydro-Electric Plant or Ratle Hydro-Electric Plant ‚Äî the two Indian
projects presented in Pakistan‚Äôs arbitration request.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe court remains seized of issues raised in the request for arbitration and not yet decided, and will determine the next steps in the proceedings after seeking the views of the parties,‚Äù it said.</p></p>
