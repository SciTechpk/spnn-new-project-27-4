            <p><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept its policy rate unchanged on Wednesday at 11 per cent.</p>
<p>The central bank’s policy rate, after being slashed by 1,000bps from 22pc since June 2024 in seven intervals, was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908601">cut to 11pc</a> in May. The bank had kept the rate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917488">unchanged</a> on June 16 as well.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927245">Pakistan Business Forum</a> (PBF) had claimed that both interest and exchange rates were being kept artificially high without economic justification, and appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to ensure a correction to support growth and stability.</p>
<p>The PBF also criticised the current interest rate of 11pc, calling it unjustifiable given that the Consumer Price Index-based inflation had dropped to 4pc. It urged the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to reduce the policy rate to at least 9pc in its upcoming monetary policy announcement scheduled for July 30.</p>

            <p><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has opposed the newly launched <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927454/curfew-imposed-as-forces-launch-operation-sarbakaf-in-bajaur">military operation</a> in Bajaur unless it is taken into confidence by the Centre and has vowed to lift a three-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927438/curfew-imposed-as-3-day-operation-against-militants-begins-in-bajaur-official">curfew</a> imposed in the district’s 16 areas yesterday.</p>
<p>Security forces backed by gunship helicopters and artillery launched ‘Operation Sarbakaf’ against terrorists in the Lowi Mamund tehsil on Tuesday. Tribal elders in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1842401">Bajaur</a> and some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925049">other</a> KP districts have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1119721">long opposed</a> any military operation, citing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892832">concerns</a> over displacement.</p>
<p>Although not confirmed officially by security forces, sources said that at least four terrorists were killed, around 12 were wounded, and about 10 were captured alive in different areas of the Lowi Mamund tehsil. Locals also claimed that a child was among two civilians who died, and eight others, including two minors and a woman, were wounded in clashes between security forces and terrorists.</p>
<p>Chairing a PTI parliamentary party meeting in Peshawar late last night, Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur said: “We are not in favour of any military operation without the provincial government being taken into confidence.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He lamented that the “relationship of confidence between our army and our public” was eroding due to the “martyred civilians and collateral damage in Bajaur”, adding that the lack of trust was failing the country’s fight against terrorism.</p>
<p>The meeting vowed that the recent curfew in parts of Bajaur would be revoked today. However, an official announcement for that is yet to be made.</p>
<p>It was decided that further course of action regarding an operation would be announced after the matter was debated in the KP Assembly.</p>
<p>“We are standing with our public. We will go to every extent for our public,” CM Gandapur vowed. “We cannot ruin our soil for those decisions that are imposed on us without our consultation.”</p>
<p>The meeting made several decisions regarding the ongoing security situation and its future actions to address the concerns raised by the people.</p>
<p>CM Gandapur ordered all deputy commissioners not to impose any curfew without permission from the KP home department, regardless of “any kind of situation”. He also decided to transfer the powers of imposing Section 144, under which a curfew is put in place, to the department.</p>

<p>The PTI meeting further decided to revoke the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1505809">KP Actions (in aid of civil power) Ordinance 2019</a>, with legislation for that expected to be introduced in Friday’s KP Assembly session.</p>
<p>The ordinance provided legal cover to several detention centres set up during military operations — similar to two <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/643667/new-regulations-give-legal-cover-to-detentions-in-tribal-areas">2011 regulations</a> imposed in the tribal areas.</p>
<p>The gathering also approved the decisions taken at a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926456/gandapur-rails-against-good-taliban-bad-taliban-distinction">multi-party conference</a> (MPC) held last week, wherein Gandapur opposed a renewed military offensive to eradicate militancy in the region and vowed to take action against all armed outfits.</p>
<p>Further, the KP CM said he would meet with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir to discuss the province’s law and order situation.</p>
<p>Speaking on a series of jirgas <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927149/kp-govt-says-cm-in-contact-with-administration-over-tirah-shooting#:~:text=would%20be%20organised%2015%20days%20after%20that%20to%20devise%20a%20strategy%20to%20implement%20the%20MPC%E2%80%99s%20declaration">planned</a> in the upcoming week, the chief minister said: “In the next 10 days, we will hold multiple jirgas, each of two districts, after which a grand jirga of all stakeholders in terrorism-ridden areas will be convened.</p>
<p>“In view of the decisions made in the jirgas, policies will be re-evaluated,” he said, adding that the government will convey the reassessment to “those responsible for protecting the borders”.</p>
<p>The KP CM claimed that soldiers who sacrificed their lives were “not rewarded properly due to wrong policies”. “We have repeatedly said to review these policies.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, PTI MPA Anwar Zeb Khan said protesters were gathering at Bajaur’s Umary Chowk to demonstrate against the “unannounced operation”.</p>
<p>Pictures shared by him of the purported protest showed hundreds of men gathered on a street.</p>

<p>The gathering follows yesterday’s protest by residents of War Mamund tehsil against the operation, where they demanded that authorities ensure the safety of civilians during the operation.</p>
<p>Besides Zeb, MPAs Dr Hamidur Rehman and Mohammad Nisar Khan; former MNA Gul Zafar Khan; and MNA Mubarakzeb Khan, the prime minister’s special assistant on tribal districts, have condemned the operation and the curfew in the area.</p>
<p>Former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan also expressed concerns over the operation’s launch and urged authorities to stop it immediately.</p>

<p>The Awami National Party also condemned the military action, with party chief Senator Aimal Wali Khan and provincial president Mian Iftikhar Hussain questioning its legality. They noted that according to Article 245 of the Constitution, approval of the provincial government was required for military operations.</p>

<p>The chief minister also presided over a separate meeting to review the law and order situation in the wake of the Bajaur operation.</p>
<p>CM Gandapur was briefed on the situation by the relevant officials, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KPChiefMinister/status/1950272557401456763" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from his office.

<p>Compensation of Rs2.5m was also announced for those injured during the “incident”.</p>
<p>The KP chief secretary and Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed were among various officials present during the meeting.</p>

<p>The reported incident comes just days after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927004">seven protesters</a> were shot dead and 16 others were injured in Khyber district’s Tirah Valley.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had condemned the “firing on peaceful citizens by <em>khawarij</em>” — a term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). However, according to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927004#:~:text=Security%20personnel%20guar%C2%ADding%20the%20installation%20reportedly%20opened%20fire%20to%20control%20the%20crowd%2C%20according%20to%20sources.">sources</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926949#:~:text=some%20of%20the%20protesters%20alleged%20that%20the%20forces%20at%20the%20gates%20fired%20at%20them">protesters</a>, security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly had opened fire to control the crowd.</p>

            <p><p>A magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck off Russia’s Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula on Wednesday, the strongest in the region since 1952, damaging buildings and generating a tsunami of up to 4 metres (13ft) that prompted warnings and evacuations in Hawaii, Japan and across the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Several people were injured in the remote Russian region, while much of Japan’s eastern seaboard — devastated by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in 2011 — was ordered to evacuate as Tsunami waves hit the Pacific coast of the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hawaii recorded tsunami waves measuring up to 5ft, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre. However, no waves of consequence have hit Hawaii yet.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>What we know so far:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>8.8-magnitude quake hit Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula at 8:24am local time (4am PKT)</li>
<li>Several people injured, no casualties reported</li>
<li>Tsunami warnings issued in Japan, Mexico, Hawaii, Ecuador, China, Chile, Costa Rica</li>
<li>Tsunami waves up to 5.7ft hit Japan, Hawaii, California; 10-13ft recorded in parts of Kamchatka</li>
<li>Russian mayor says ‘everyone’ on tsunami-hit islands evacuated</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>The magnitude 8.8 quake struck at 8:24 am (4am PKT) off Petropavlovsk on Russia’s remote Kamchatka peninsula and was one of the 10 biggest recorded, according to the US Geological Survey.</p>
<p>The USGS said the earthquake was shallow at a depth of 19.3 km, and was centred 119 km east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a city of 165,000.</p>
<p>The epicentre of the earthquake is roughly the same as the massive 9.0 temblor in 1952, which resulted in a destructive, Pacific-wide tsunami, according to the USGS.</p>

<p>“Today’s earthquake was serious and the strongest in decades of tremors,” Kamchatka Governor Vladimir Solodov said in a video posted on the Telegram messaging app.</p>
<p>A tsunami with a height of 3-4 metres (10-13 ft) was recorded in parts of Kamchatka, said Sergei Lebedev, regional minister for emergency situations, urging people to move away from the shoreline.</p>
<p>Russian authorities said a tsunami hit and flooded the port town of Severo-Kurilsk, while local media said one wave of between three and four metres high was recorded in the Elizovsky district of Kamchatka.</p>
<p>“The strongest earthquake since 1952 has just occurred in the Kamchatka seismic zone … Given the scale of the event, strong aftershocks with a magnitude of up to 7.5 should be expected,” Kamchatka’s geophysical service said on Telegram.</p>
<p>Thirty additional tremors were recorded following the main earthquake off the Kamchatka Peninsula, a regional branch of the Geophysical Service of the Russian Academy of Sciences said.</p>
<p>In December 2004, a 9.1 magnitude earthquake struck off the Indonesian island of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that killed around 220,000 people in 11 nations.</p>
<p>Several people sought medical assistance following the quake, Oleg Melnikov, regional health minister, told Russia’s <em>TASS</em> state news agency.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, there are some people injured during the seismic event. Some were hurt while running outside, and one patient jumped out of a window. A woman was also injured inside the new airport terminal,” Melnikov said.</p>
<p>“All patients are currently in satisfactory condition, and no serious injuries have been reported so far.”</p>
<p>While a kindergarten was also damaged, most buildings withstood the quake, and no fatalities had been reported, the ministry added.</p>
<p>Russia’s Ministry for Emergency Services said on Telegram that the port in the Sakhalin town of Severo-Kurilsk and a fish processing plant there were partially flooded by a tsunami. The population has been evacuated.</p>
<p>“Everyone was evacuated. There was enough time, a whole hour. So everyone was evacuated, all the people are in the tsunami safety zone,” Mayor Kuril Islands district Alexander Ovsyannikov said at a crisis meeting with officials.</p>
<p>Authorities in Russia’s far eastern Sakhalin region declared a state of emergency in the northern Kuril Islands.</p>
<p>“A state of emergency has been declared in the North Kuril District, where an earthquake and tsunami occurred today,” the Sakhalin government said in a statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team recorded that the Klyuchevskoy volcano —  a highly active volcano in the region — ejected ash to a height of up to 3 km (1.8 miles) above sea level as a result of the quake, <em>Al Jazeera</em> reported.</p>
<p>“The volcano is continuing to erupt explosively at the summit. Ash emissions at altitudes up to 8km [4.9 miles] above sea level may occur at any time,” said KVERT in a statement.</p>
<p>KVERT has assigned an orange colour code for aviation hazards to the volcano, which indicates an increased likelihood of eruption.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#japan-records-tsunami-waves" id="japan-records-tsunami-waves" title="Permalink"></a>Japan records tsunami waves</h2>
<p>The whole Pacific coast of Japan has reported tsunami waves, <em>Al Jazeera</em> reported, citing Japanese broadcaster <em>NHK World.</em></p>
<p>Waves as high as 60cm (1.9ft) were recorded along some parts of the coast, including Kuji Port and Hamanaka town, according to <em>NHK.</em></p>
<p>The size of the waves has grown steadily from 20cm (0.6ft) earlier this morning, and authorities say they could reach as high as 3 metres (9.8ft).</p>
<p>Tsunami warning advisories will be in place across Japan for at least the next 24 hours, the Japanese broadcaster said.</p>
<p>According to Japan’s Meteorological Agency, the country’s Pacific coast has already been hit by four to five rounds of tsunami waves, and has warned that there are no signs of the Tsunami waves receding, <em>Al Jazeera</em> reported.</p>
<p>There is also a chance of powerful and unexpected surges, it added.</p>
<p>Earlier, Japan’s weather agency issued a warning, saying it expected tsunami waves of up to 3 metres (10ft) to reach large coastal areas starting around 1am GMT (6am PKT).</p>
<p>Tsunami alarms sounded in coastal towns across Japan’s Pacific coast with authorities urging people to seek higher ground.</p>
<p>Footage on public broadcaster <em>NHK</em> showed scores of people in the northern island of Hokkaido on the roof of a building, sheltering under tents from the beating sun, as fishing boats left harbours to avoid potential damage from the incoming waves.</p>
<p>“We came here hoping to swim, but once we heard a tsunami warning had been issued, we didn’t go in at all, not even close to the water,” local Tomoyo Fujita, 35, told <em>AFP</em> as she left the area with her young daughter.</p>
<p>Television footage showed several whales washed up on a beach.</p>
<p>Workers evacuated the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant, where a meltdown following the 2011 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/612370">tsunami</a> caused a radioactive disaster, operator TEPCO said.</p>
<p>There were no injuries or damage reported so far, and no irregularities at any nuclear plants, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said.</p>

<p>Tsunami waves were “now impacting Hawaii”, the Centre said in an update.</p>
<p>The US National Weather Service confirmed the reports, according to <em>Al Jazeera.</em></p>
<p>Hawaii Governor Josh Green said so far, no waves of consequence have hit the islands, but all flights in and out of Maui were cancelled, <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>
<p>In light of the tsunami situation, the Department of Transportation in Hawaii announced, in a social media post, the cancellation of all flights to and from Kahului Airport, the main airport in Maui, <em>Al Jazeera</em> reported.</p>

<p>Earlier, the US Tsunami Warning Centres issued a Tsunami Warning — its highest level alert — for the entire US state of Hawaii, with the first waves expected at 7:17pm local time (10:17pm PKT).</p>
<p>“People are also advised to stay away from the beach and not to go to the coast,” the seismology centre said in a warning.</p>
<p>Hawaii ordered evacuations from some coastal areas. “Take Action! Destructive tsunami waves expected,” the Honolulu Department of Emergency Management said on X.</p>

<p>The Hawaii warning urged residents of low-lying areas to either move to higher ground or to the fourth floor of a building.</p>
<p>“Due to a massive earthquake that occurred in the Pacific Ocean, a Tsunami Warning is in effect for those living in Hawaii,” US President Donald Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114939759564715119" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a social media post.</p>
<p>“A Tsunami Watch is in effect for Alaska and the Pacific Coast of the United States. Japan is also in the way. Please visit tsunami.gov/ for the latest information. Stay strong and stay safe!”</p>
<p>Tsunami waves have also hit California on the West Coast, according to the National Weather Service. The weather body said the waves hit the coast at 1:12am local time (1:12pm PKT).</p>

<p>Earlier, Tsunami alerts were pushed to mobile phones in California, according to local <em>AFP</em> reporters.</p>
<p>The US Tsunami Warning System also warned of “hazardous tsunami waves” within the next three hours across the Pacific. According to the seismology centre, waves reaching more than 3 metres were possible along some coasts of Russia and Ecuador, while waves of 1-3 metres were possible in Japan, Hawaii, Costa Rica, French Polynesia, Guam, Chile and the Solomon Islands, it said. Smaller waves were possible along coastlines across much of the Pacific, including the US West Coast.</p>
<p>Waves of up to one metre were possible elsewhere, including Australia, Colombia, Mexico, New Zealand, Tonga and Taiwan.</p>
<p>It described the potential conditions as “hazardous.”</p>
<p>In Mexico, the Navy warned that strong currents are expected at port entrances from Baja California in the northwest to Chiapas in the south of Mexico, <em>AFP</em> reported.</p>
<p>The country has mobilised authorities at all levels of government to keep its population away from Pacific beaches.</p>
<p>Following suit, Peru also issued a statement warning of a possible tsunami.</p>
<p>“After an analysis and evaluation by the National Tsunami Warning Centre, it has been determined that this event generates a tsunami warning for the Peruvian coast,” the Directorate of Hydrography and Navigation of the Peruvian Navy said in a statement, adding that the situation “will be kept under constant surveillance.”</p>
<p>Ecuador officials ordered ‘preventive evacuations’ from Galapagos beaches and the suspension of all maritime activities, <em>AFP</em> reported.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, China’s tsunami warning centre said that waves of between 30 centimetres and one metre were expected to hit parts of the eastern seaboard.</p>
<p>“Based on the latest warning and analysis results, the Tsunami Advisory Centre of the Ministry of National Resources has determined that the earthquake has triggered a tsunami, which is expected to cause damage to certain coastal areas of China,” the advisory centre said.</p>

<p>Kamchatka and Russia’s Far East sit on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a geologically active region that is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</p>
<p>The Russian Academy of Sciences said it was the strongest quake to hit the region since 1952.</p>
<p>“However, due to certain characteristics of the epicentre, the shaking intensity was not as high … as one might expect from such a magnitude,” said Danila Chebrov, director of the Kamchatka Branch of the Geophysical Service, on Telegram.</p>
<p>“Aftershocks are currently ongoing … Their intensity will remain fairly high. However, stronger tremors are not expected in the near future. The situation is under control.”</p></p>
