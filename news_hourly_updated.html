                <h2>PM urges US top diplomat to make India ‚Äòdial down rhetoric, act responsibly‚Äô amid high tension</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif urged United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday to make India understand that it should step back in its rhetoric and exhibit responsibility amid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">intense tensions</a> between the two countries in the wake of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">civilian</a> and military leadership have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">rejected</a> the accusation and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.  Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> and Modi granting ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>‚Äù to his military.</p>
<p>The US has urged restraint and said it was planning talks with both sides to ease the crisis.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>A statement issued from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office later today said the premier received a telephone call from the US Secretary of State
Marco Rubio in the evening during which Shehbaz ‚Äúurged the US to impress upon India to dial down the rhetoric and act responsibly‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTerming India‚Äôs escalatory and provocative behaviour as deeply disappointing and worrisome, the prime minister said that India‚Äôs provocations would only serve to distract Pakistan from its ongoing efforts to defeat terrorism, particularly from militant groups, including ISKP (Islamic State Khorasan Province), TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) and BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army) operating from Afghan soil,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>According to the statement, PM Shehbaz ‚Äúcategorically rejected‚Äù India‚Äôs attempts to link Pakistan to the Pahalgam incident, highlighting his call for a transparent, credible and neutral investigation to bring out the facts.</p>
<p>It said the prime minister shared Pakistan‚Äôs perspective on recent developments in South Asia since the Pahalgam incident with Secretary Rubio.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile condemning terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, the PM underscored Pakistan‚Äôs leading role in the war on terror and its sacrifice of over 90,000 lives and over $152 billion in economic losses,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is most regrettable that India chose to weaponise water, which is a lifeline for 240 million people of Pakistan,‚Äù the premier was quoted as saying, while also stressing that the Indus Waters Treaty had no provision for either side to unilaterally renege from its commitments.</p>
<p>The prime minister added that the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute was the ‚Äúonly way to ensure lasting peace in South Asia‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to the statement, PM Shehbaz highlighted to America‚Äôs top diplomat that Pakistan and the US had worked together closely over the past seven decades and there was much that both sides could cooperate on, including counter-terrorism and enhanced economic cooperation, particularly in the minerals sector.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prime minister also stressed that his government had undertaken major economic reforms over the past year, and consequently, Pakistan was now on the road to economic recovery,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecretary of State Rubio thanked the prime minister for the detailed conversation and emphasised the need for both sides to continue working together for peace and stability in South Asia,‚Äù it concluded.</p>
<p>The US State Department said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/04/secretary-rubios-call-with-pakistani-prime-minister-sharif/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> that Rubio also ‚Äúurged Pakistani officials‚Äô cooperation in investigating this unconscionable attack‚Äù.</p>
<p>Rubio also spoke to Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Wednesday, according to State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Secretary expressed his sorrow for the lives lost in the horrific terrorist attack in Pahalgam, and reaffirmed the United States‚Äô commitment to cooperation with India against terrorism,‚Äù she was quoted as saying in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-rubios-call-with-indian-external-affairs-minister-jaishankar-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>. ‚ÄúHe also encouraged India to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia.‚Äù</p>
<p>Earlier today, the Foreign Office (FO) said US Charg√© d‚ÄôAffaires Natalie Baker called on Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar for talks in which they exchanged views on recent regional developments.</p>
<p>Dar reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to regional peace and security while safeguarding national interests, while Baker conveyed the United States‚Äô desire for de-escalation, saying that the country would stay engaged with both Pakistan and India on the evolving situation.</p>

<p>FM Dar also held a telephone conversation with his Omani counterpart Sayyid Badr bin Hamad bin Hamood Al Busaidi.</p>
<p>Dar briefed him on the current regional situation, including ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs inflammatory propaganda, illegal unilateral actions, and the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty ‚Äî a clear violation of international law‚Äù, the FO said.</p>
<p>The Omani FM underscored the importance of de-escalation, dialogue, and diplomacy to address issues.</p>
<p>FM Dar appreciated Oman‚Äôs efforts for Iran and US talks and conveyed best wishes for their success.</p>
<p>Separately, the Saudi foreign ministry issued a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KSAMOFA/status/1917504350055813608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1917504350055813608%7Ctwgr%5E454bf8c31e9983d3cab2cf0332b7e6a6c7abe37d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arabnews.com%2Fnode%2F2599004%2Fsaudi-arabia" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> expressing concern regarding the escalating tension between Pakistan and India and the continued exchange of fire in the border areas.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe kingdom calls on both countries to reduce tension, avoid escalation, resolve differences through diplomatic means, respect the principles of good neighbourliness and work to achieve stability and peace for the benefit of their peoples and the peoples of the region,‚Äù the statement said.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Indian fighter jets patrolling above occupied Kashmir were forced to flee after the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) scrambled its jets, state media <a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvnews/urdunewsdetail/5442" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p><em><a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvnews/urdunewsdetail/5442" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PTV News</a></em> and <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/30-04-2025/paf-forced-four-indian-fighter-jets-to-flee-following-presence-detected-in-occupied-jammu-kashmir" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em>, citing security sources, said that four Rafale fighter jets of the Indian Air Force (IAF) were spotted conducting ‚Äúpatrolling overnight‚Äù in occupied Kashmir without crossing the Line of Control.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPAF jets promptly detected the presence of these Indian warplanes,‚Äù <em>Radio Pakistan</em> added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs a result of PAF‚Äôs diligent action, the Indian Rafale jets panicked and were forced to flee,‚Äù <em>PTV News</em> reported. The security sources also reaffirmed that the armed forces were ‚Äúfully prepared and vigilant to give a befitting response to any aggression from India‚Äù.</p>
<p>India also shut its airspace to Pakistani airlines today. The ban on Pakistani aircraft will be from April 30 to May 23, according to a Notice to Airmen issued by the Indian government.</p>
<p>The developments come after Information Minister Attaullah Tarar earlier today said ‚Äúcredible intelligence‚Äù reports indicated that India was planning to conduct a military action against Pakistan in the ‚Äúnext 24 to 36 hours‚Äù.</p>
<p>In a televised <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> issued shortly after 2am, Tarar said: ‚ÄúPakistan has credible intelligence that India intends to carry out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.‚Äù</p>
<p>Tarar said Pakistan vehemently rejected ‚ÄúIndian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region‚Äù and it was completely ‚Äúreckless‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan has been the victim of terrorism itself and truly understands the pain of this scourge,‚Äù the minister said, adding: ‚ÄúWe have always condemned it in all its forms and manifestations anywhere in the world.‚Äù</p>
<p>Being a responsible state, Tarar noted, Pakistan ‚Äúopenheartedly offered a credible, transparent and independent investigation‚Äù by a neutral commission of experts to ascertain the truth.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUnfortunately, rather than pursuing the path of reason, India has apparently decided to tread the dangerous path of irrationality and confrontation, which will have catastrophic consequences for the complete region and beyond,‚Äù he stressed.</p>
<p>The information minister said the ‚Äúevasion of credible investigations is in itself sufficient evidence exposing India‚Äôs real motives‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúConsciously making strategic decisions hostage to public sentiments, purposefully trumped up for securing political objectives, is unfortunate and deplorable,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Tarar reiterated that any such military adventurism by India would be responded to assuredly and decisively.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe international community must remain alive to the reality that the onus of [an] escalatory spiral and its ensuing consequences shall squarely lie with India.‚Äù</p>
<p>He reiterated the nation‚Äôs resolve to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan at all costs.</p>
<p>FM Dar has said Pakistan will not strike India but reserves the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907464">right to retaliate</a>. He informed the Senate yesterday that intelligence reports suggest that India was contemplating some form of escalation.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907326/pakistan-shoots-down-indian-quadcopter-violating-airspace-near-loc-state-media">first drone</a> was brought down in the Manawar sector of Bhimber district, where it was reportedly engaged in aerial surveillance when intercepted and destroyed by Pakistani troops.

<p>‚ÄúAccording to security sources, on the night of April 29 and 30, India violated the ceasefire on the LoC. India opened unprovoked fire in the Kayani and Mandal sectors of the LoC,‚Äù <em>PTV</em> reported.</p>
<p>India used small arms in the unprovoked firing incident, the state broadcaster added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecurity sources have confirmed that the Pakistan Army has responded forcefully and given a befitting reply to the Indian Army. The enemy has been silenced with an effective response,‚Äù the report said.</p>
<p>The state broadcaster cited reports of the destruction of several Indian bunkers due to the effective response of the Pakistan Army, adding, ‚ÄúSecurity sources have said that India‚Äôs Chakpatra post has been destroyed‚Äù.</p>

<p>Amid heightened tensions, all Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flights operating from the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.flightradar24.com/airport/kdu/arrivals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Skardu</a> and <a class="link--external" href="https://www.flightradar24.com/airport/gil/arrivals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gilgit</a> airports to Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad ‚Äî and vice versa ‚Äî were cancelled today, according to PIA officials.</p>
<p>However, two Airblue flights destined between Skardu and Islamabad operated as per their schedule, the sources added.</p>
<p>The PIA official noted that the air route between Gilgit-Baltistan and other cities passes ‚Äúnear Indian territories‚Äù. When the passengers reached the airports, they were told that the flights had been cancelled due to security concerns.</p>

<p>Iqra Khan, a flight inquiry officer at Islamabad International Airport (ISB), also told <em>Dawn.com</em> that PIA cancelled its flights today from the federal capital to Gilgit and vice versa, citing ‚Äúairspace security‚Äù as a reason.</p>

<p>Recalling the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1536224">2019 Pulwama-Balakot incidents</a> during his tenure, Imran said, ‚ÄúWe offered to extend all-out cooperation to India but India failed to produce any concrete evidence.</p>

<p>He urged India to act responsibly instead of messing with a region already known as a ‚Äúnuclear flashpoint‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have always emphasised the importance of the Kashmiris‚Äô right to self-determination, as guaranteed by United Nations resolutions,‚Äù Imran stressed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNeedless to say, to win the war against an external enemy, the nation must first be united. It is high time to put a halt to all actions that are further polarising the nation,‚Äù he said, adding that the ‚Äústate‚Äôs excessive focus on political victimisation at this critical time is deepening internal divisions‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIronically, Narendra Modi‚Äôs aggression has united the people of Pakistan in one voice against Indian hostility,‚Äù the ex-premier noted.</p>

<p>India‚Äôs cabinet committee on security (CCS) ‚Äî consisting of Modi and his interior, defence, home and finance ministers ‚Äî is scheduled to meet later today, a government source told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>This would be the second such meeting of the CCS since the attack on April 22. In its first meeting, the committee had decided to take a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">series of measures</a> against Pakistan, including the suspension of the Indus Water Treaty.</p>

                <h2>US economy shrinks, Trump blames Biden</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The US economy unexpectedly contracted in the first three months of the year on an import surge triggered by President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff plans, although he pinned the blame squarely on his predecessor.</p>
<p>The sharp increase in imports was a reflection of businesses and consumers stockpiling foreign goods to get ahead of Trump‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810/trumps-tariffs-stoke-global-trade-war-as-china-eu-hit-back">sweeping trade levies</a>, which went into effect earlier this month.</p>
<p>All three major Wall Street indices fell on the economic news, with the Nasdaq sliding more than 2 per cent before paring some losses, while oil prices extended their losses.</p>
<p>At a cabinet meeting in Washington, Trump insisted the growth downturn was the legacy of former president Joe Biden‚Äôs policies.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Biden, that‚Äôs not Trump,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Striking a more positive tone, he highlighted the ‚Äúwhopping‚Äù 22pc rise in gross domestic investment during the first quarter.</p>
<p>Annual economic growth stayed above 2pc in every year of Biden‚Äôs presidency, reaching 2.8pc in 2024.</p>
<p>The gross domestic product (GDP) of the world‚Äôs largest economy decreased at an annual rate of 0.3pc in the first quarter, after growing 2.4pc in the final months of 2024, according to Wednesday‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first estimate</a> from the US Commerce Department.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>This was sharply below the market consensus estimate of 0.4pc growth, according to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.briefing.com/calendars/economic?Filter=Today" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Briefing.com</a></em>, and marked the first quarterly contraction since 2022.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said in a statement that the contraction was in large part down to an ‚Äúupturn in imports,‚Äù aided by a decline in consumer and government spending.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#a-blaring-warning" id="a-blaring-warning" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòA blaring warning‚Äô</h2>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/new-data-reveals-strong-economic-momentum/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, the White House called GDP a ‚Äúbackward-looking indicator.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no surprise the leftovers of Biden‚Äôs economic disaster have been a drag on economic growth,‚Äù White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. ‚ÄúBut the underlying numbers tell the real story of the strong momentum President Trump is delivering.‚Äù</p>
<p>The GDP figures were published on the 101st day since Trump returned to the White House, along with fresh data showing a slowdown in the US Federal Reserve‚Äôs favoured inflation gauge last month.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs introduction of sweeping tariffs against most countries sparked a selloff in financial markets, sending volatility to levels not seen since the Covid pandemic.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis decline in GDP is a blaring warning to everyone that Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans‚Äô failed MAGA experiment is killing our economy,‚Äù top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said in a statement.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#greater-risk-of-recession" id="greater-risk-of-recession" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòGreater risk of recession‚Äô</h2>
<p>Following the dramatic market movements in early April, the Trump administration announced a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903146">90-day pause</a> to the higher tariffs for dozens of countries to allow for trade talks, while maintaining a baseline 10pc rate for most countries.</p>
<p>But the administration has also added to the tariffs on China, with the level of duties introduced since January now <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903391">totalling</a> 145pc ‚Äî with some sector-specific measures pushing levies even higher.</p>
<p>Beijing has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903545">responded</a> with its own steep, targeted measures against US goods.</p>
<p>At the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump said China was getting ‚Äúhammered‚Äù by the tariffs, and said he still hoped to make a deal with Beijing, whom he referred to as ‚Äúthe leading candidate for the chief ripper-offer‚Äù of America.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMaybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,‚Äù Trump said, arguing that the United States did not need many of the things China produced.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Economists at Wells Fargo wrote in an investor note that the US economy is at a greater risk of recession now than a month ago, ‚Äúbut this 0.3pc contraction in Q1 GDP is not the start of one.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt reflects instead the sudden change in trade policy that culminated in the biggest drag from net exports in data going back more than a half-century.‚Äù</p></p>
