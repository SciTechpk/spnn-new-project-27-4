            <p><p>A magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck off Russia‚Äôs Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula on Wednesday, the strongest in the region since 1952, damaging buildings and generating a tsunami of up to 4 metres (13ft) that prompted warnings and evacuations stretching across the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Several people were injured in the remote Russian region, while much of Japan‚Äôs eastern seaboard ‚Äî devastated by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in 2011 ‚Äî was ordered to evacuate.</p>

<hr />
<p>‚ÄúToday‚Äôs earthquake was serious and the strongest in decades of tremors,‚Äù Kamchatka Governor Vladimir Solodov said in a video posted on the Telegram messaging app.</p>
<p>A tsunami with a height of 3-4 metres (10-13 ft) was recorded in parts of Kamchatka, said Sergei Lebedev, regional minister for emergency situations, urging people to move away from the shoreline.</p>
<p>Russian authorities said a tsunami hit and flooded the port town of Severo-Kurilsk, while local media said one wave of between three and four metres high was recorded in the Elizovsky district of Kamchatka.</p>
<p>The magnitude 8.8 quake struck at 8:24 am (4am PKT) off Petropavlovsk on Russia‚Äôs remote Kamchatka peninsula and was one of the 10 biggest recorded, according to the US Geological Survey.</p>
<p>The USGS said the earthquake was shallow at a depth of 19.3 km, and was centred 119 km east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a city of 165,000.</p>
<p>The epicentre of the earthquake is roughly the same as the massive 9.0 temblor, which resulted in a destructive, Pacific-wide tsunami, according to the USGS.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe strongest earthquake since 1952 has just occurred in the Kamchatka seismic zone ‚Ä¶ Given the scale of the event, strong aftershocks with a magnitude of up to 7.5 should be expected,‚Äù Kamchatka‚Äôs geophysical service said on Telegram.</p>
<p>Thirty additional tremors were recorded following the main earthquake off the Kamchatka Peninsula, a regional branch of the Geophysical Service of the Russian Academy of Sciences said.</p>
<p>Several people sought medical assistance following the quake, Oleg Melnikov, regional health minister, told Russia‚Äôs <em>TASS</em> state news agency.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUnfortunately, there are some people injured during the seismic event. Some were hurt while running outside, and one patient jumped out of a window. A woman was also injured inside the new airport terminal,‚Äù Melnikov said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll patients are currently in satisfactory condition, and no serious injuries have been reported so far.‚Äù</p>
<p>While a kindergarten was also damaged, most buildings withstood the quake, and no fatalities had been reported, the ministry added.</p>
<p>Russia‚Äôs Ministry for Emergency Services said on Telegram that the port in the Sakhalin town of Severo-Kurilsk and a fish processing plant there were partially flooded by a tsunami. The population has been evacuated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEveryone was evacuated. There was enough time, a whole hour. So everyone was evacuated, all the people are in the tsunami safety zone,‚Äù Mayor Kuril Islands district Alexander Ovsyannikov said at a crisis meeting with officials.</p>
<p>Authorities in Russia‚Äôs far eastern Sakhalin region declared a state of emergency in the northern Kuril Islands.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA state of emergency has been declared in the North Kuril District, where an earthquake and tsunami occurred today,‚Äù the Sakhalin government said in a statement.</p>

<p>The whole Pacific coast of Japan has reported tsunami waves, <em>Al Jazeera</em> reported, citing Japanese broadcaster <em>NHK World.</em></p>
<p>Waves as high as 60cm (1.9ft) were recorded along some parts of the coast, including Kuji Port and Hamanaka town, according to <em>NHK.</em></p>
<p>The size of the waves has grown steadily from 20cm (0.6ft) earlier this morning, and authorities say they could reach as high as 3 metres (9.8ft).</p>
<p>Tsunami warning advisories will be in place across Japan for at least the next 24 hours, the Japanese broadcaster said.</p>
<p>Earlier, Japan‚Äôs weather agency issued a warning, saying it expected tsunami waves of up to 3 metres (10ft) to reach large coastal areas starting around 1am GMT (6am PKT).</p>
<p>Tsunami alarms sounded in coastal towns across Japan‚Äôs Pacific coast with authorities urging people to seek higher ground.</p>
<p>Footage on public broadcaster <em>NHK</em> showed scores of people in the northern island of Hokkaido on the roof of a building, sheltering under tents from the beating sun, as fishing boats left harbours to avoid potential damage from the incoming waves.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe came here hoping to swim, but once we heard a tsunami warning had been issued, we didn‚Äôt go in at all, not even close to the water,‚Äù local Tomoyo Fujita, 35, told <em>AFP</em> as she left the area with her young daughter.</p>
<p>Television footage showed several whales washed up on a beach.</p>
<p>Workers evacuated the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant, where a meltdown following the 2011 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/612370">tsunami</a> caused a radioactive disaster, operator TEPCO said.</p>
<p>There were no injuries or damage reported so far, and no irregularities at any nuclear plants, Japan Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said.</p>

<p>Waves of up to one metre were possible elsewhere, including Australia, Colombia, Mexico, New Zealand, Tonga and Taiwan.</p>
<p>It described the potential conditions as ‚Äúhazardous.‚Äù</p>

<p>The US Tsunami Warning Centres issued a Tsunami Warning ‚Äî its highest level alert ‚Äî for the entire US state of Hawaii, with the first waves expected at 7:17pm local time (10:17pm PKT).</p>
<p>‚ÄúPeople are also advised to stay away from the beach and not to go to the coast,‚Äù the seismology centre said in a warning.</p>
<p>In Mexico, the Navy warned that strong currents are expected at port entrances from Baja California in the northwest to Chiapas in the south of Mexico, <em>AFP</em> reported.</p>
<p>The country has mobilised authorities at all levels of government to keep its population away from Pacific beaches.</p>
<p>Following suit, Peru also issued a statement warning of a possible tsunami.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter an analysis and evaluation by the National Tsunami Warning Centre, it has been determined that this event generates a tsunami warning for the Peruvian coast,‚Äù the Directorate of Hydrography and Navigation of the Peruvian Navy said in a statement, adding that the situation ‚Äúwill be kept under constant surveillance.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ecuador officials ordered ‚Äòpreventive evacuations‚Äô from Galapagos beaches and the suspension of all maritime activities, <em>AFP</em> reported.</p>

<p>Kamchatka and Russia‚Äôs Far East sit on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a geologically active region that is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</p>
<p>The Russian Academy of Sciences said it was the strongest quake to hit the region since 1952.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, due to certain characteristics of the epicentre, the shaking intensity was not as high ‚Ä¶ as one might expect from such a magnitude,‚Äù said Danila Chebrov, director of the Kamchatka Branch of the Geophysical Service, on Telegram.</p>

                <h2>COAS Munir reaffirms resolve to eradicate terrorism, warns of decisive response to all threats</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshall Asim Munir on Wednesday reaffirmed the military‚Äôs resolve to eradicate the menace of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1925209">terrorism</a> from the country,  underscoring the nation‚Äôs preparedness to respond decisively to any external or internal threats, a statement from the military‚Äôs media wing said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has lately <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906333/3-traffic-cops-injured-in-terrorist-attack-in-kps-lakki-marwat-district-police">seen</a> a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">surge</a> in terrorism across the country, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has also worsened, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419/jaffar-express-hijacking-state-media-reports-190-rescued-2nd-day-of-operation-underway-in-balochistan">attacks</a>. The outlawed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856227">Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA</a>), in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army chief was speaking to a group of stakeholders at the 16th National Workshop in Balochistan.</p>
<p>‚Äú[The] COAS resolutely reaffirmed Pakistan Army‚Äôs unwavering commitment to uproot the menace of terrorism and [the] inevitability of socio-economic uplift of Balochistan for national cohesion and integration,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>Field Marshall Munir also shed light on Pakistan‚Äôs recent military escalation with India, condemning New Delhi‚Äôs ‚Äúblatant sponsorship of terror proxies, characterising them as a failed attempt to target the deep-rooted patriotism of the people of Balochistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>The two countries entered a brief but intense military escalation after India, without evidence, blamed Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a>. On May 6‚Äì7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">missile exchange</a>. A US-brokered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> ended the war.</p>
<p>He elucidated that India, having suffered defeat in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> ‚Äî the period of conflict from April 22 to May 10 ‚Äî had ‚Äúnow escalated its proxy war to advance her nefarious designs.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said New Delhi was using <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> ‚Äî terms the state uses to refer to the TTP and terrorist groups in Balochistan, respectively ‚Äî as ‚Äúpawns of Indian hybrid war against Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe COAS said that these proxies will face a similar fate and humiliation as faced in Marka-i-Haq,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>During his talk, the army chief also emphasised that terrorists knew no bounds of religion, sect, or ethnicity, necessitating a unified national response, stressing the imperative of collective resolve in confronting this menace.</p>
<p>He highlighted the ‚Äúpivotal role of development initiatives in Balochistan, advocating for enhanced inter-agency cooperation and a cohesive national approach to propel provincial progress and national advancement.‚Äù</p>
<p>While reaffirming Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to regional peace, the COAS underscored the nation‚Äôs preparedness to respond decisively to any external or internal threats, protecting national prestige and ensuring the well-being of its citizens, the statement concluded.</p></p>
