            <p><p>Seven bodies have been recovered so far after at least 16 people were reported missing on Friday morning due to flash floods in Swat River following heavy rains, according to rescue officials.</p>
<p>Flash floods prompted by heavy rain in Swat district have engulfed several areas, resulting in the loss of life with reports of dozens stranded, according to an initial report by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Faizi confirmed that seven bodies have been recovered from reports of 16 people gone missing, with three people being rescued.</p>
<p>According to the initial report by KP Rescue 1122, search and rescue operations underway for the remaining bodies in several areas.</p>
<p>Three bodies have been recovered from Ingaroderai. One body was also recovered from Ghalegy, where seven people were stranded and rescue operations are still underway.</p>
<p>More 10 people have drowned at the Bypass Relax Hotel, the report confirmed.</p>
<p>At least 120 Rescue 1122 personnel have been deployed in rescue operations.</p>
<p>“More than 22 people were trapped in the water in Imam Dhirai, who were rescued safely by the team of Rescue Station 33,” the report stated, adding that the search operation of Rescue Station 44 was ongoing.</p>
<p>Seven people are also reported to be trapped in Manyar, with Rescue Stations 44 and 55 working jointly in rescue activities.</p>
<p>One person was trapped at Panjigram village, where a rescue operation was underway.</p>
<p>At least 20 to 30 people have been rescued from Bara Bamakhela, the report said.</p>
<p>“All Rescue 1122 teams are present on site and rescue operations are in full swing,” the report said.</p>
<p>The flood alert has been issued by the Charsadda Deputy Commissioner asking relevant staff to be on high alert following the flooding in Swat.</p>
<p>A notice from the DC’s office said the “discharge at Khwazakela in River Swat has increased to 77,782 cusecs, categorised as a very high flood.”</p>

<p>The KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued a flood alert after water discharge levels at Khwazakhela in Swat River surged to 77,782 cusecs, categorising it as a very high flood situation due to the ongoing heavy rainfall in the region.</p>
<p>In an official communication addressed to the Deputy Commissioners of Peshawar, Charsadda, and Nowshera, the PDMA advised all concerned authorities to take urgent precautionary measures to prevent any loss of life, damage to infrastructure, crops and livestock.</p>
<p>The PDMA directed local administrations to immediately identify vulnerable points and at-risk communities and put in place effective safety and mitigation measures. It emphasised maintaining a heightened state of alert, with constant monitoring of the evolving flood situation to ensure a timely response.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122, Civil Defence, and all other emergency services have been instructed to stay on high alert, particularly in low-lying and high-risk areas.</p>
<p>Communities living along the banks of Kabul River and its tributaries are being sensitised to the expected rise in water levels.</p>
<p>Local authorities have been advised to ensure timely evacuation of at-risk populations in flood-prone areas in accordance with existing evacuation plans, and to ensure the availability of shelter, food, and medical supplies in designated camps.</p>
<p>Farmers and cattle herders have been warned to move their livestock to safer locations away from low-lying riverbanks, while the general public is urged to avoid unnecessary travel or vehicle movement in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>The PDMA also directed concerned departments to remain ready for road clearance operations in case of blockages or waterlogging, and to pre-position emergency equipment at critical locations.</p>
<p>The Provincial Emergency Operations Center (PEOC) at PDMA remains active 24/7 and can be reached via helpline 1700 for any assistance or guidance.</p></p>

            <p><p>As the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench resumed hearing review petitions in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914188">reserved seats case</a>, Justice Salahuddin Panhwar recused himself from the bench following an objection from senior counsel Hamid Khan.</p>
<p>In its July 12, 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">short order</a>, eight out of 13 judges ruled that 39 out of a list of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621#:~:text=the%20verdict%20stated.-,List%20of%2080%20MNAs,-The%20verdict%20listed">80 MNAs</a> were and are the returned candidates of the PTI, setting it to emerge as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845532">single largest party</a> in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>However, the ruling had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1868333">not been implemented</a> by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860119">National Assembly</a>, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had raised some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859716">objections</a>.

<p>An 11-member bench headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan resumed the hearing today.</p>
<p>Initially, a full-strength 13-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin took up the review pleas on May 6. However, Justices Ayesha and Abbasi declared the applications as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908809/two-judges-object-as-sc-accepts-review-pleas-on-reserved-seats-for-hearing">inadmissible</a> and were not part of the subsequent proceedings, with the CB head judge noting they had stepped back voluntarily.</p>
<p>Justice Ayesha had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909890/justice-ayesha-malik-piqued-by-failure-to-upload-dissenting-order">formally complained</a> to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi about her dissenting order not being uploaded to the SC’s website.</p>
<p>In her <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909890/justice-ayesha-malik-piqued-by-failure-to-upload-dissenting-order#:~:text=Justice%20Malik%20while%20rejecting%20the%20review%20petitions%20observed%20that%20the%20ECP%20and%20other%20petitioners%20could%20not%20reargue%20the%20case%20under%20the%20review%20jurisdiction">judgement</a>, she had criticised the ECP for not implementing the earlier order, observing that it would “not only undermine the authority of the Supreme Court but also erode the foundational values of democracy itself”.</p>
<p>The SIC, which allied with the PTI during the 2024 elections and was a party in the reserved seats case, had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911722/sic-seeks-fresh-bench-for-reserved-seats-case-review">requested</a> the bench to put off the hearing until challenges to the 26th Amendment were decided and to include judges who had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908809/two-judges-object-as-sc-accepts-review-pleas-on-reserved-seats-for-hearing#:~:text=are%20not%20part%20of%20the%20CB">heard the original case</a>.</p>
<p>However, the CB <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912745/sc-allows-live-streaming-of-reserved-seats-review-case#:~:text=dismissed%20other%20applications%20seeking">dismissed</a> those pleas, with Justice Aminuddin <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912136/smaller-bench-can-review-cases-after-26th-amendment-scs-justice-aminuddin">observing</a> that review petitions could be heard even by a bench smaller than the original bench after the 26th Amendment.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#the-hearing" id="the-hearing" title="Permalink"></a>The hearing</h2>
<p>Justice Panhwar noted that Hamid Khan, counsel for the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), had yesterday raised an objection to the bench.</p>
<p>“Hamid Khan raised an objection to the inclusion of judges in the bench who came to the Supreme Court after the 26th Amendment in the bench,” Justice Panhwar said, noting that he is one of the judges included in the objection.</p>
<p>“Public trust in the judiciary is essential,” Panhwar stated.</p>
<p>“It is essential that no party has any objection to the bench,” he said. “It is because of these objections that I cannot sit on this bench.”</p>
<p>The judge told Khan that although he was hurt by his remarks — having worked together since 2010 — this was not a personal matter.</p>
<p>Khan said he appreciated Panhwar’s decision.</p>
<p>However, Justice Aminuddin Khan told him that this was not a matter to be appreciated. “This is a result of your conduct,” he said.</p>
<p>“We gave you respect, that’s why we are listening to you, otherwise we were not under any obligation to hear you,” Justice Khan said. “We gave you this opportunity, don’t misuse it.”</p>
<p>Following Justice Panhwar’s recusal, the SIC’s counsel also objected to a 10-memebr bench taking up the hearing.</p>
<p>To this, Justice Mandokhail questioned under which law the counsel was making this argument.</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail added that the 10-member bench will continue hearing cases.</p>
<p>“Giving respect is what gets you respect,” he told Khan. “Whatever respect you have today is because of the Supreme Court.”</p>
<p>“Today we are here, tomorrow we will not be here, you will not be here,” Justice Mandokhail said.</p>
<p>The SIC counsel told Justice Mandokhail not to use the case if he was angry.</p>
<p>Justice Aminuddin interjected here, asking the SIC counsel what objection he had.</p>
<p>“My objection is that a twelve-member bench cannot hear the review of the decision of a thirteen-member bench,” Khan said.</p>
<p>Justice Aminuddin rejected this objection and asked him to proceed with his arguments.</p>
<p>Here, the debate between Khan and the judges became heated.</p>
<p>“The SIC lawyer had given his arguments, you had no right to speak,” Justice Mandokhail said. “We gave you respect.”</p>
<p>The SIC counsel responded saying: “you are not authorised to tell me not to speak.”</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail told Khan that the SIC had appointed Faisal Siddiqui as its lawyer, not him. “You have 10 minutes to make your argument, otherwise sit down.”</p>
<p>Khan said: “You are angry, do not hear the case just now.”</p>
<p>The conversation continued in a confrontational manner, with Justice Mandokhail telling him to sit down if he does not want to present his arguments.</p>
<p>“I know how to do my job, you be careful with your words,” Justice Mandokhail said. “I have skipped my mother’s funeral to be here and you are joking.”</p>
<p>He noted that the bench would not hear anything irrelevant and had already heard enough.</p>
<p>“We consider you a good lawyer, but what you are doing right now is not the work of a good lawyer,” Justice Mandokhail said.</p>
<p>Khan told him he had no right to say such a thing, to which Mandokhail again reminded him he had 10 minutes to present his arguments.</p>
<p>“It’s not as if we don’t know how to be strict.”</p>
<p>The SIC counsel asserted that the Judicial Commission forms a bench, to which Justice Mandokhail asked him under which law he has made this assertion.</p>
<p>“According to Article 191A of the 26th Amendment,” Khan said.</p>
<p>“You are against the 26th Amendment, how are you now referencing it?” Justice Mandokhail quipped.</p>
<p>“This is why I had said to make a decision on the 26th Amendment first,” Khan said.</p>
<p>Khan asked if the SC made the amendment. Justice Mandokhail asked if he, as a senator, had voted against the amendment, which the SIC counsel affirmed.</p>
<p>“You all boycotted it,” Justice Mandokhail said.</p>
<p>“As long as it is like this, either you accept it, or say you don’t and leave the practice of law.”</p>
<p>Justice Aminuddin said the bench would take a break from the hearing till 2pm, with Justice Mandokhail adding that the bench was aiming to pronounce a verdict today.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920561/india-accused-of-illegal-deportations-targeting-muslims' target='_blank'><strong>India accused of illegal deportations targeting Muslims</strong></a>
            <p><p>India has deported without trial to Bangladesh hundreds of people, officials from both sides said, drawing condemnation from activists and lawyers who call the recent expulsions illegal and based on ethnic profiling.</p>
<p>New Delhi says the people deported are undocumented migrants.</p>
<p>The Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has long taken a hardline stance on immigration — particularly those from neighbouring Muslim-majority Bangladesh — with top officials referring to them as “termites” and “infiltrators”.</p>
<p>It has also sparked fear among India’s estimated 200 million Muslims, especially among speakers of Bengali, a widely spoken language in both eastern India and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>“Muslims, particularly from the eastern part of the country, are terrified,” said veteran Indian rights activist Harsh Mander. “You have thrown millions into this existential fear.”</p>
<p>Bangladesh, largely encircled by land by India, has seen relations with New Delhi turn icy since a mass uprising in 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245/bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-has-resigned-interim-govt-to-run-country-army-chief">toppled</a> Dhaka’s government, a former friend of India.</p>
<p>But India also ramped up operations against migrants after a wider security crackdown in the wake of an attack in the west — the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">killing</a> of 26 people, mainly Hindu tourists, in Indian-held Kashmir.</p>
<p>New Delhi blamed that attack on Pakistan, claims Islamabad rejected, with arguments culminating in a four-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">conflict</a> that left more than 70 dead.</p>
<p>Indian authorities launched an unprecedented countrywide security drive that has seen many thousands detained – and many of them eventually pushed across the border to Bangladesh at gunpoint.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#do-not-dare" id="do-not-dare" title="Permalink"></a>‘Do not dare’</h2>
<p>Rahima Begum, from India’s eastern Assam state, said police detained her for several days in late May before taking her to the Bangladesh frontier.</p>
<p>She said she and her family had spent their life in India.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“I have lived all my life here — my parents, my grandparents, they are all from here,” she said. “I don’t know why they would do this to me.”</p>
<p>Indian police took Begum, along with five other people, all Muslims, and forced them into swampland in the dark.</p>
<p>“They showed us a village in the distance and told us to crawl there,” she told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>“They said: ‘Do not dare to stand and walk, or we will shoot you.’”</p>
<p>Bangladeshi locals who found the group then handed them to border police who “thrashed” them and ordered they return to India, Begum said.</p>
<p>“As we approached the border, there was firing from the other side,” said the 50-year-old. “We thought: ‘This is the end. We are all going to die.’”</p>
<p>She survived, and, a week after she was first picked up, she was dropped back home in Assam with a warning to keep quiet.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#ideological-hate-campaign" id="ideological-hate-campaign" title="Permalink"></a>‘Ideological hate campaign’</h2>
<p>Rights activists and lawyers criticised India’s drive as “lawless”.</p>
<p>“You cannot deport people unless there is a country to accept them,” said New Delhi-based civil rights lawyer Sanjay Hegde.</p>
<p>Indian law does not allow for people to be deported without due process, he added.</p>
<p>Bangladesh has said India has pushed more than 1,600 people across its border since May.</p>
<p>Indian media suggests the number could be as high as 2,500.</p>
<p>The Bangladesh Border Guards said it has sent back 100 of those pushed across — because they were Indian citizens.</p>
<p>India has been accused of forcibly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1436786">deporting</a> Muslim Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, with navy ships dropping them off the coast of the war-torn nation.</p>
<p>Many of those targeted in the campaign are low-wage labourers in states governed by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, according to rights activists.</p>
<p>Indian authorities did not respond to questions about the number of people detained and deported.</p>
<p>But Assam state’s chief minister has said that more than 300 people have been deported to Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Separately, Gujarat’s police chief said more than 6,500 people have been rounded up in the western state, home to both Modi and interior minister Amit Shah.</p>
<p>Many of those were reported to be Bengali-speaking Indians and later released.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>“People of Muslim identity who happen to be Bengali speaking are being targeted as part of an ideological hate campaign,” said Mander, the activist.</p>
<p>Nazimuddin Mondal, a 35-year-old mason, said he was picked up by police in the financial hub of Mumbai, flown on a military aircraft to the border state of Tripura and pushed into Bangladesh.</p>
<p>He managed to cross back, and is now back in India’s West Bengal state, where he said he was born.</p>
<p>“The Indian security forces beat us with batons when we insisted we were Indians,” said Mondal, adding he is now scared to even go out to seek work.</p>
<p>“I showed them my government-issued ID, but they just would not listen.”</p></p>
