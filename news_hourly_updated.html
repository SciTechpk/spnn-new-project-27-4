                <h2>Search continues as death toll from Lyari building collapse rises to 18</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Rescue teams pulled more bodies from the rubble of a five-storey <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050">building collapse</a> in Karachi overnight, taking the toll on Saturday to 18 as the recovery operation continued for a second day.</p>
<p>The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, which was further weakened by recent rains, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922231#:~:text=DIG%20South%20Syed%20Asad%20Raza%20told%20Dawn">said</a> Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza.</p>
<p>According to a list issued by police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, 17 bodies were brought to the hospital while one person died during treatment. She said there were nine wounded people since yesterday, out of whom six had been discharged and one had serious injuries.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRescue operation is still underway in Baghdadi, Lyari where the building had collapsed on Friday,‚Äù DIG Raza told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>

<p>Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.</p>
<p>Karachi, home to more than 20 million, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.</p>
<p>There were conflicting reports of the death toll, with Rescue 1122 stating it as 16 and DIG Raza saying that a 17th body was recovered from the rubble.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn one side, debris has been removed up to the ground floor, while on the other side, the rescue team has removed debris up to the third floor,‚Äù the police officer added.</p>
<p>The deceased included nine men, six women and a child, according to a statement by Rescue 1122. Their bodies had been taken to the Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK).</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy daughter is under the rubble,‚Äù 54-year-old Dev Raj told <em>AFP</em> at the scene.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe was my beloved daughter. She was so sensitive but is under the burden of debris. She got married just six months ago.‚Äù</p>
<p>Rescue teams worked throughout the night, and families said that at least eight people were still believed to be trapped as temperatures climbed to 33 degrees Celsius in the morning.</p>
<p>Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, leading the Rescue 1122 efforts at the scene, told <em>AFP</em> that the operation continued through the night ‚Äúwithout interruption‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt may take eight to 12 hours more to complete,‚Äù he said earlier today.</p>
<p>Up to 100 people had been living in the building, senior police officer Arif Aziz told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>The incident came days after a portion of a building <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921188/no-casualties-reported-as-22-rescued-from-partially-collapsed-building-in-karachis-kharadar">collapsed</a> in the city‚Äôs Kharadar area. However, no casualties or injuries were reported.</p>
<p>The Public Account Committee of the Sindh Assembly had directed the provincial government in December to take urgent steps to evacuate over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879565">570 buildings</a> declared ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù by authorities across Karachi.</p>

<p>The Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=SBCA%20says%20issued%20multiple%20prior%20notices%20to%20vacate%20building">said</a> it had declared the plot as dangerous through its Technical Committee for Dangerous Buildings after a thorough inspection conducted in October 2022.</p>
<p>The authority said it had issued three ejectment notices to the residents since then, as well as asked K-Electric, Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) to disconnect utility services.</p>
<p>But Imran Khaskheli, an owner and resident watching the rescue operation on Saturday, denied receiving notices.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDo you think we are out of our senses to stay in an unsafe building with our families?‚Äù he said, speaking to <em>AFP</em>. He said he had seen cracks in the pillars of the building early on Friday morning.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúI knocked on all the doors and asked families to leave immediately,‚Äù Khaskheli said, adding that around 40 families lived in the building but that many did not heed his warning.</p>
<p>More than 50 buildings in the district have been declared unsafe, with six evacuated since yesterday, Karachi (South) Deputy Commissioner Javed Nabi Khoso told <em>AFP</em>.</p>

<p>Sindh Rescue 1122 Director General (DG) Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, in a statement, said yesterday there were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=Rescue%20DG%20lists%20%E2%80%98hinderances%E2%80%99%20in%20operations">hindrances</a> during the rescue operation due to the ‚Äúunruly crowd, various road blockades and mobile network [issues]‚Äù.</p>
<p>Heavy machinery faced difficulty in reaching the site amid the narrow alleys of Lyari, a low-income neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Police even had to baton-charge a crowd that had gathered around the site to make way for machinery, officials added.</p>
<p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah sought a report on the collapse and details of dilapidated buildings from the SBCA.</p>
<p>Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani said a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=Saeed%20Ghani%20stresses%20timely%20evacuation%20of%20unsafe%20buildings">high-level committee</a> has been formed that will submit a report on the incident by Monday. He lamented that residents did not evacuate the building despite being served notices previously.</p>
<p>The minister also ordered the suspension of the related officials at the SBCA.</p>

<p>Sindh Assembly opposition leader and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan MPA Ali Khurshidi blamed the Sindh government for Karachi‚Äôs administrative collapse and the Lyari building tragedy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCall the tanker mafia and you‚Äôll get water in 30 minutes,‚Äù he said during a press conference, pointing out rampant corruption and institutional failure across civic bodies.</p>
<p>Khurshidi said if the provincial administration was to blame and held responsible if it had not passed laws in 17 years to make this a criminal offence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInstead of saying ‚Äòthis should be done,‚Äô you should be admitting, ‚Äòwe should‚Äôve done this, but we failed to.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p>Addressing President Asif Ali Zardari and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, he said: ‚ÄúThis is a question of your and your party‚Äôs credibility.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said the suspensions of officials would not work, insisting that termination and legal consequences were necessary. He condemned the ‚Äúharassment‚Äù of Karachiites through traffic police extortion, pleading for urgent administrative reform, saying the public was fed up.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about point-scoring politics,‚Äù Khurshidi said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing politics so we can solve genuine issues faced by people.‚Äù He concluded by calling on President Zardari and Bilawal to stop issuing mere condemnations and to instead fix the broken system under their party‚Äôs governance.</p>

            <p><p>Karachi‚Äôs central mourning procession of Muharram 9 entered its destination of Hussainiya Iraniyan Imambargah in Kharadar on Saturday and peacefully concluded amid tight security, according to police.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Karachi Traffic Police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921828">issued</a> a traffic plan for Muharram 8 to 10, outlining the procession routes as well as alternative traffic flows.</p>
<p>Stringent security measures are being taken across the country, such as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920725/army-to-be-deployed-across-country-for-security-during-muharram">army deployment</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919931">crackdown</a> on sectarian content and hate mongers, ahead of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920308">Ashura</a> (Muharram 10), which will be observed tomorrow.</p>
<p>In Karachi, the Muharram 9 majlis started at Nishtar Park at 12:15pm, according to an alert from the police. ‚ÄúThe number of participants is approximately 800 to 1000, and it is being led by Shahenshah Hussain Naqvi,‚Äù the alert read.</p>
<p>Another alert at 1:29pm said that the procession had departed the park, while another at 1:54pm read that head of the procession reached Aza Khana Zuhra, while the tail was still at Nishtar Park. A later alert at 2:16pm stated that the procession head had reached Shah Khurasan, with the tail still at the park.</p>
<p>The police said the procession entered its destination of Hussainiya Iraniyan Imambargah in Kharadar at 7:07pm with the tail still at Baghdadi Crossing. The procession concluded around 7:53pm.</p>
<p>Cellular services were also suspended in the areas adjoining the central procession‚Äôs route as well as the smaller procession‚Äôs routes across the city, according to a letter by the Sindh police chief.</p>

<p>According to the Karachi police chief, a total of 7,507 police personnel were deployed to monitor the main procession and its routes and passages.</p>
<p>‚ÄúExpert police snipers have been deployed along the main procession and at the crossings and large contingent of police personnel, including senior officers of Karachi Police‚Äù is active, according to a statement from the additional inspector general of police‚Äôs office.</p>
<p>Traffic police personnel were also deployed to maintain traffic flow along crossings intersecting the main procession routes, as well as the alternative traffic routes arranged for Muharram 9.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, Sindh IG Ghulam Nabi Memon and Senator Waqar Mehdi reviewed security arrangements for the procession at Numaish, Nishtar Park and the Hussainiya Iraniyan Imam Bargah, a statement read.</p>
<p>Lanjar reviewed the security package and received a briefing from the Sindh IG and met the procession organisers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPeace and order in the city is our priority,‚Äù Lanjar was quoted as saying. He also directed the law enforcement agencies to take foolproof security measures, according to the press release.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wahab said, ‚ÄúCleanliness arrangements have been ensured along the procession‚Äôs passageways. Proper lighting arrangements have also been made in the passageways and around them.‚Äù</p>
<p>On Friday, more than 5,500 police personnel were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922052">deployed</a> across Karachi for the security of 8th Muharram processions.</p>
