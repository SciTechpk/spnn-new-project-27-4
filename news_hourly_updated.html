                <h2>KP governor administers oath to opposition MPAs</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Twenty-five MPAs-elect of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa opposition were sworn into office on Sunday after KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi administered their oaths.</p>
<p>The oath-taking issue has risen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1831068">once again</a> after the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925091/ptis-senate-poll-campaign-beset-by-political-wrangling">redistribution</a> of reserved seats in the wake of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920721/ptis-hopes-dashed-as-rivals-set-to-receive-reserved-seats">verdict</a> by the Supreme Court‚Äôs constitutional bench that effectively took away the seats <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">from the PTI</a> and declared other political parties eligible for them.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Kundi delivered a press conference following the swearing-in ceremony, where he highlighted that the government reneged on an agreement it had made with the opposition.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA formula of 6-5 was agreed upon and our opposition candidates withdrew,‚Äù the KP governor said. ‚ÄúAll of them agreed that they will contest five seats ‚Äî two will be contested by the JUI-F, two by the PPP, and the PML-N will for one.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe PTI founder [Imran Khan] then made a decision, and their information secretary said, ‚Äòour Senate candidates are not in our control‚Äô. If your Senate candidates are not in control, then how are the MPAs-elect in your control?‚Äù Kundi asked.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe point is, we had a deal in place, we had an agreement. But their members were not completely on board.‚Äù</p>
<p>The KP governor highlighted that there are between 30 and 35 independent members of the assembly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have spoken with them, and we are hopeful that we can move towards 6-5. As soon as the leader of the opposition briefs us, we will have a strategy ready for tonight and then we will contest tomorrow‚Äôs [Senate] elections,‚Äù Kundi said.</p>
<p>Earlier, the opposition MPAs could not take their oaths on reserved seats due to a lack of quorum in the provincial assembly.</p>
<p>At today‚Äôs assembly session, which had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924631">called</a> by the KP government, the 25 MPAs-elect on reserved seats for women and minorities were expected to be sworn in. The session had assumed importance as the non-administration of oaths could lead to the postponement of Senate polls <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922230">set for tomorrow</a> for 11 seats from the legislature.</p>
<p>The session was scheduled for 9am but began with a delay of two hours and 20 minutes, with KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati presiding over it. As soon as the session started, MPA Sher Ali Afridi of the ruling PTI pointed out a lack of quorum, leading to the session being adjourned till July 24.</p>
<p>Upon Afridi‚Äôs remarks, PML-N‚Äôs Sobia Shahid contended that a lack of quorum could not be pointed out between the recitation of the Holy Quran and the oath-taking. ‚ÄúYou (KP government) have been making a joke out of this province for a year,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>Swati asked her to point out the legal provisions for her argument instead of giving a speech.</p>
<div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0;"></div>
<p>Ahmad Karim Kundi, the PPP‚Äôs parliamentary leader in the KP Assembly, also spoke on the floor of the assembly, backing Shahid. He asserted that the administration of oath was ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù, citing Article 255 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>The speaker also asked Ahmad to state the relevant provisions requiring so and issued a ruling to count the MPAs in attendance, at which it emerged that only 25 lawmakers were present.</p>
<p>Addressing PML-N‚Äôs Dr Ibadullah, Swati said: ‚ÄúOpposition leader <em>sahib</em>, there are 25 members present. The quorum is incomplete; ring the bells.‚Äù</p>
<p>The opposition lawmakers then came to the front of the speaker‚Äôs dais to protest. Swati then adjourned the session, saying: ‚ÄúAs the quorum is incomplete, the sitting is adjourned till 2pm on Thursday, July 24.‚Äù</p>

<p>The ECP had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924686/jui-f-loses-two-ppp-one-seat-in-kp-assembly#:~:text=reserved%20for%20women.-,ECP%20approaches%20PHC,-The%20Peshawar%20High">approached</a> the Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Wednesday, requesting that Chief Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah appoint a person to administer the oath to the notified MPAs-elect under Article 255(2) (oath of office) of the Constitution.</p>
<p>Subsequently, after today‚Äôs session, the PHC registrar issued an order by Justice Shah that accepted the ECP request and nominated Governor Kundi to administer the oaths ‚Äúat the earliest‚Äù.</p>
<p>It stressed that the governor should ensure that the oaths are ‚Äúadministered in the manner prescribed and proper record be maintained in accordance with the official procedure‚Äù. The judge also directed the KP Assembly secretary to facilitate the newly notified MPAs to sign the Roll of the Members.</p>
<p>A notification by the KP Governor‚Äôs secretariat, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, said Kundi would administer the oaths to the MPAs-elect at 6pm today.</p>
<p>The ECP has <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ECP_Pakistan/status/1946879928189755772" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">changed</a> the timing for the Senate elections from 9am to 11am.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, the ECP had issued a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ECP_Pakistan/status/1946877503932338301" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> announcing that Kundi will administer the oaths at 9am tomorrow at Governor House. It ordered KP Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed, the chief secretary and the Federal Constabulary IG to ensure foolproof security arrangements for the ceremony.</p>
<p>Speaking outside the KP Assembly after the session, Ibadullah said he would approach the courts against the delay in the oath-taking, assailing the PTI government.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDo not hand over whatever political space is left to others,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNo one can stop these oaths [‚Ä¶] at which forum will they (PTI) challenge it?‚Äù the PML-N lawmaker said.</p>
<p>Ibadullah stressed that the opposition‚Äôs women and minority members had not had representation in the Senate for one and a half years, since the 2024 general elections.</p>
<p>Terming the PTI ‚Äúpolitically immature‚Äù, he pointed out that it was the PTI government‚Äôs ‚Äúresponsibility‚Äù to ensure a proper quorum, given their majority in the KP Assembly.</p>
<p>Before the assembly session, the PTI held a parliamentary party meeting, in which it decided that none of its MPAs would attend the proceedings, calling the oaths a ‚Äútheft of its right‚Äù.</p>

            <p><p>Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Sunday said that a case had been registered and a suspect had been arrested after a video showing the murder of a couple went viral on social media.</p>
<p>The video shows a group of men leading a couple out of vehicles and into a desert apparently in Balochistan, before gunning them down with pistols and shooting the bodies. Political figures and activists have termed the incident an ‚Äòhonour‚Äô killing.</p>
<p>In a post on X, Bugti addressed the incident, stating that it occurred a few days before Eidul Azha this year and that the victims had been identified.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTaking immediate notice of the viral video of the murder of a woman and a man on all social media, orders were issued to Balochistan Police for action,‚Äù the CM wrote. ‚ÄúA terrorism case has been registered on behalf of the state, and one suspected killer has been arrested; the law will take its course in this heinous matter!‚Äù</p>

<p>Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind spoke at the Karachi Press Club today and said that action was underway to trace and apprehend the suspects.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe two affected families had not filed any report of the incident; however, the state has registered a case,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe tribes and individuals seen in the video have been identified; however, their names are not being disclosed at this stage as part of a strategic approach,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThe data of the people seen in the video has been obtained and those whose faces can be identified are being traced through Nadra [National Database and Registration Authority].</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo far, one person has been arrested, while raids are being conducted to arrest others,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Rind stated that the area shown in the video had been identified, but he did not disclose where it is. He did mention that the incident took place on Eidul Azha.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhether it is the killers or those who possibly held a jirga, strict legal action will be taken against all of them,‚Äù he warned. ‚ÄúAn FIR (first information report) has already been registered based on the facts revealed in the video, and now the investigation will be taken to its logical conclusion.‚Äù</p>
<p>Rind continued: ‚ÄúChief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti has said that such brutal acts are not only intolerable but are also a serious insult to social values and human dignity. He [CM Bugti] has made it clear that those who challenge the rule of law will be dealt with strictly and no one can be allowed to take the law into their own hands.‚Äù</p>
<p>In Pakistan, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849480">‚Äòhonour‚Äô killings</a> continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881836">Data</a> from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‚Äòhonour‚Äô killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‚Äòhonour‚Äô crimes in the country.</p>
<p>The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‚Äòhonour‚Äô.</p>

<p>Various political figures and activists condemned the incident as the video was circulated across social media.</p>
<p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari strongly condemned the video in a statement, calling the suspects ‚Äúbeasts‚Äù and saying that they deserve no concessions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have faith that the criminals involved in this murder will be brought to justice soon,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis murder should be a test case for the Balochistan government, as it is gender terrorism.‚Äù</p>
<p>The PPP chief added that Islam allows women to marry men of their choice and that the Constitution guarantees the protection of this right.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif shared the video in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KhawajaMAsif/status/1946923637686284672" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, with a message for the people of Balochistan.

<p>He continued that the ones responsible for this ‚Äúoppression are your own brothers, not the travellers and labourers from other provinces‚Äù, pointing out the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924597">bus attack</a> in Balochistan‚Äôs Kalat district, which left three people dead and other similar incidents in the recent past.</p>
<p>PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman condemned the incident in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/sherryrehman/status/1946955545946337781" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, labelling it an ‚Äúunforgivable crime‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCrushing the right to marry is a violation of fundamental human rights. Killing in the name of tribal decisions is a despicable act. The cycle of brutality in the name of honour must be stopped,‚Äù she wrote.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBy mercilessly killing the married couple, not only have law and justice been insulted, but the authority of the provincial government has also been challenged,‚Äù Rehman added. ‚ÄúThe chapter of oppression and barbarism under the guise of jirgas must be closed.‚Äù</p>
<p>The senator emphasised that the perpetrators must be brought to justice and that legislation to end ‚Äúoutdated customs‚Äù is indispensable.</p>
<p>Baloch activist Sammi Deen Baloch decried the incident as an ‚Äòhonour‚Äô killing, appealing to Baloch elders to ‚Äúrespect women‚Äôs decisions‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs a woman, this chilling incident is deeply painful and heart-wrenching for me,‚Äù she <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/SammiBaluch/status/1946912084714721567" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X. ‚ÄúKilling any woman in the name of honour is not only a heinous crime but also the worst humiliation of humanity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI appeal to Baloch and Pashtun tribal elders, influential sections of society, and intellectuals to respect women‚Äôs decisions. Today‚Äôs woman is the same woman who is educated, aware, and fully capable of making decisions about her future.‚Äù</p>
<p>She demanded that the incident be investigated in a transparent and comprehensive manner so that the suspects are brought to justice and ‚Äúno one dares to repeat such a barbaric act in the future‚Äù.</p></p>
