            </a>
            <p><p>Lt General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, director general of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), has lauded Iran‚Äôs peace efforts in the recent Pakistan-India conflict and warned of ‚Äúforces‚Äù seeking to create a rift among brotherly countries.</p>
<p>Just two days after India, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">without</a> any evidence, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack">blamed</a> Pakistan over last month‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam, Iran had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">offered to mediate</a> between the two as tensions escalated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan is fully grateful to the international community, and we are especially grateful to brotherly countries, including the Islamic Republic of Iran,‚Äù Gen Chaudhry told <em>IRNA</em> in an <a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85835207/Exclusive-Pakistani-military-spokesperson-Islamabad-appreciates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> published today ‚Äî the first by any Pakistani armed forces‚Äô spokesperson to an Iranian outlet.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe should be aware that there are forces in the region that, with the help of external factors, are seeking to create misunderstanding and confusion among brotherly countries in the region and want to create a rift between friends and brothers,‚Äù the DG ISPR added.</p>

<p>According to <em>IRNA</em>, Lt Gen Chaudhry spoke about the latest developments in South Asia as well as the ‚Äúimportance of regional and international diplomacy to help de-escalate tensions‚Äù. He also ‚Äúfocused‚Äù on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">recent visit</a> of Iran‚Äôs Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to Islamabad, the report added.</p>
<p>During his visit to Islamabad, Araghchi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">met with</a> Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir. He later also made a trip <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909355/irans-foreign-minister-repeats-call-for-restraint-in-india-pakistan-standoff">to New Delhi</a>, reiterating his call for restraint.</p>

<p>The DG ISPR appreciated Tehran‚Äôs efforts and support to help de-escalate tensions in the region.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are pleased with all the efforts of the international community and brotherly countries, especially Iran, which played a role in reducing tensions,‚Äù he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as tensions over the Pahalgam attack continued to build up. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>

<p>The Pakistani army spokesman emphasised that Iran and Pakistan ‚Äúhave very historical and brotherly relations and have always stood by each other in all challenges and trials‚Äù.</p>

<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry highlighted that the two nations were ‚Äúneighbouring and friendly countries that are in contact with each other on many issues and fields‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan is eager and pursues that the borders of the two countries are the borders of peace and friendship, and we look forward to it,‚Äù the DG ISPR told <em>IRNA</em>.</p>
<p>The military‚Äôs spokesperson stressed that Tehran and Islamabad were ‚Äúcooperating together for lasting peace and stability in the region‚Äù.</p>

<p>Separately, the ISPR said President Asif Ali Zardari visited Gujranwala Cantonment today where he lauded the ‚Äúexemplary conduct and professional excellence‚Äù of the military in the successful execution of Marqa-i-Haq, acknowledging their ‚Äúresolute determination and unshakable courage in the face of unprovoked aggression‚Äù.</p>

<p>During his interaction with officers and troops, the president commended their ‚Äúexemplary morale, combat readiness and devotion to duty‚Äù.</p>
<p>The ISPR added that he extended congratulations on the successful culmination of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, and expressed ‚Äúprofound pride in the defenders of the nation, affirming that the people of Pakistan hold their brave soldiers in the highest esteem as the true custodians of national honour and sovereignty‚Äù.</p>

<p>Nawaz also lauded the role of parliament, saying that ‚Äúsetting aside all political differences and speaking with one voice for the sake of national security‚Äù was a welcome and commendable step.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBy reflecting the emotions of 240 million citizens, the people‚Äôs representatives boosted the spirit of the brave armed forces,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He also commended Pakistani media for ‚Äúpresenting the truth before the world and exposing the enemy‚Äôs falsehoods‚Äù.</p>

                <h2>Aleema Khanum and PTI‚Äôs Kanwal Shauzab face off in tense court exchange over leaked video</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>PTI founder Imran Khan‚Äôs sister Aleema Khanum and former party MNA Kanwal Shauzab had a tense exchange in court on Saturday over a video that surfaced of the latter criticising the former.</p>
<p>In the recently surfaced video, Shauzab can be allegedly heard and seen criticising Aleema for disrespecting party office-holders and interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, saying that Imran‚Äôs sister should not dent the party. Shauzab allegedly said she would confront Aleema herself over the issue.</p>
<p>That happened today as Shauzab approached Aleema in the Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court (ATC), saying she wanted to talk to her. However, Imran‚Äôs sister said: ‚ÄúJust leave it. What you said was right. Many other people speak against us. We are now used to such accusations.‚Äù</p>
<p>To this, Shauzab told her that she wanted to speak with her in this regard to which Aleema rebuffed her, saying: ‚ÄúI am not angry with you, [now] go.‚Äù</p>
<p>Shauzab replied: ‚ÄúA specific part of an old video of mine was used against me.‚Äù Aleema subsequently told her that many from the PML-N and other parties also spoke against her. Imran‚Äôs sister thereafter left while ignoring the party member.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah rejected Aleema‚Äôs petition requesting permission to exempt her from court appearances so she could travel abroad.</p>
<p>Talking to the media outside the court, she said she had been visiting the courts for the past week due to ‚Äúnewer and newer cases‚Äù, alleging that they were being filed to impede her travel abroad.</p>
<p>She questioned who was afraid of her and why for going abroad.</p>
<p>Aleema further alleged that there were around 50-60 cases against her for delivering her brother‚Äôs messages to the people.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Islamabad High Court Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910842/ihc-removes-raoof-aleema-from-no-fly-lists">directed the removal</a> of her name from the Provisional National Immigration List and Passport Control List.</p>
<p>Aleema had approached the court to challenge the inclusion of her name in the travel ban lists. The court had allowed her to seek permission to travel abroad by approaching the relevant trial court handling the cases registered against her.</p></p>
