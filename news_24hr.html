            <p><p>Indian fighter jets patrolling above occupied Kashmir were forced to flee after the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) scrambled its jets, state media <em>PTV News</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvnews/urdunewsdetail/5442" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on Wednesday, adding to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">tensions</a> between the two countries in the wake of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>.</p>
<p>India, without offering any evidence, has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">political</a> and military leadership have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">strongly denied</a> any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a> into the incident.</p>
<p>The tensions between the arch-rivals have intensified in the past few days, with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforced its forces</a> and was ready for any incursion by India, while on the other side, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given his military “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>” to act on the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p><em>PTV News</em>, citing security sources, said that four Rafale fighter jets of the Indian Air Force (IAF) were spotted “patrolling” occupied Kashmir without crossing the Line of Control.</p>
<p>“Aircraft of the PAF immediately spotted the Indian fighter jets,” the report added.</p>
<p>“As a result of PAF’s diligent action, the Indian Rafale jets panicked and were forced to flee,” <em>PTV News</em> reported.</p>
<p>The development comes after Information Minister Attaullah Tarar earlier today said “credible intelligence” reports indicated that India was planning to conduct a military action against Pakistan in the “next 24 to 36 hours”.</p>
<p>In a televised <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> issued shortly after 2am, Tarar said: “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends to carry out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.”</p>
<p>He said Pakistan vehemently rejected “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region” and it was completely “reckless”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Pakistan has been the victim of terrorism itself and truly understands the pain of this scourge,” the minister said, adding: “We have always condemned it in all its forms and manifestations anywhere in the world.”</p>
<p>Being a responsible state, Tarar noted, Pakistan “openheartedly offered a credible, transparent and independent investigation” by a neutral commission of experts to ascertain the truth.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, rather than pursuing the path of reason, India has apparently decided to tread the dangerous path of irrationality and confrontation, which will have catastrophic consequences for the complete region and beyond,” he stressed.</p>
<p>The information minister said the “evasion of credible investigations is in itself sufficient evidence exposing India’s real motives”.</p>
<p>“Consciously making strategic decisions hostage to public sentiments, purposefully trumped up for securing political objectives, is unfortunate and deplorable,” he  added.</p>
<p>Tarar reiterated that any such military adventurism by India would be responded to assuredly and decisively.</p>
<p>“The international community must remain alive to the reality that the onus of [an] escalatory spiral and its ensuing consequences shall squarely lie with India.”</p>
<p>He reiterated the nation’s resolve to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan at all costs.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Army shot down <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907495/two-indian-drones-shot-down-near-loc">two Indian quadcopters</a> after they violated the country’s airspace along the Line of Control (LoC) in two separate areas of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), official sources said.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907326/pakistan-shoots-down-indian-quadcopter-violating-airspace-near-loc-state-media">first drone</a> was brought down in the Manawar sector of Bhimber district, where it was reportedly engaged in aerial surveillance when intercepted and destroyed by Pakistani troops. The second unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down in Poonch division’s Satwal sector.</p>
<p>The downing of the drones occurred amid continued exchange of fire along the LoC in Leepa Valley since the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers#:~:text=troops%20exchanged%20fire%20overnight%20across%20the%20Line%20of%20Control%20(LoC)%20in%20Kashmir">night of April 25</a>, breaking a period of relative calm in the region. No casualties were immediately reported.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as concerns over a potential breakdown of peace grew, shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907535/shares-at-psx-slump-on-heightened-pakistan-india-tensions">faced a major fall</a> in intraday trade today.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, and was one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front, said it “unequivocally” denied involvement in the attack, after an initial message that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=The%20Resistance%20Front%E2%80%99%2C%20is%20said%20to%20have%20claimed%20responsibility%20for%20the%20attack.">claimed</a> responsibility.</p>
<p>According to IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Indian <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907326/pakistan-shoots-down-indian-quadcopter-violating-airspace-near-loc#:~:text=Cyberattacks%20on%20ministries%E2%80%99%20websites%20%E2%80%98foiled%E2%80%99">cyberattack attempts</a> on the websites of some ministries have been foiled as well.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar said Pakistan will not strike India but reserves the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907464">right to retaliate</a>. He informed the Senate that intelligence reports suggest that India was contemplating some form of escalation.</p>

<p>The National Cyber Emergency Resp­onse Team (N-Cert) has warned media and content creators against sharing sensitive national security information.</p>
<p>Amid fears of airspace closures due to rising tensions with India, authorities yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion#:~:text=240%20million%20people.-,No%20airport%20closures,-Amid%20fears%20of">refuted rumours</a> of a possible closure of airports.</p>
<p>A senior official at Islamabad International Airport said the airport was fully functional for both domestic and international flights, while an official from the Lahore airport also confirmed that flight operations were running smoothly.</p>

<p>Amid the ongoing situation, the opposition PTI has proposed a multi-party conference with incarcerated former premier Imran Khan in attendance.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ImranKhanPTI/status/1917257395530784969" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> posted on Imran’s X account, which is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859070#:~:text=but%20nobody%20knows%20who%20has%20been%20given%20access%20to%20manage%20the%20%E2%80%98X%E2%80%99%20handle%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20PTI%20leader%20said">handled</a> by a PTI member, quoted the ex-premier as telling his lawyers yesterday: “Peace is our priority but it should not be mistaken as cowardice.”</p>
<p>Recalling the 2019 Pulwama-Balakot incidents during his tenure, Imran said, “We offered to extend all-out cooperation to India but India failed to produce any concrete evidence.</p>
<p>“[…] Instead of introspection and investigation, Modi <em>sarkar</em> is again placing the blame on Pakistan,” the former prime minister added.</p>

<p>A week after the Pahalgam attack, Modi yesterday told the armed forces that they had the “complete <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a> to decide on the mode, targets and timing of our response to the terror attack”, a senior government source who was not authorised to speak to the media told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>The government released video images of a stern-faced Modi holding a closed-door meeting with his army and security chiefs, as well as Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.</p>
<p>Last week, Modi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284#:~:text=dangerous%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20warned.-,Modi%20vows%20to%20pursue%20attackers%20to%20%E2%80%98ends%20of%20the%20Earth%E2%80%99,-Meanwhile%2C%20in%20India">vowed to pursue</a> those who carried out the attack in the tourist hotspot of Pahalgam and those who had supported it.</p>
<p>“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” he said. “We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth”.</p>

<p>Calls have also grown from Indian politicians and others for military action against Pakistan. <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907518/disturbing-escalation">Analysts</a> say they fear bellicose statements will escalate into possible military action.</p>
<p>Amid escalating tensions, friendly countries and global powers have urged India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, advising them to solve the matter through diplomatic engagement.</p>
<p>Last night, US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce announced that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was expected to speak to the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan “as early as today or tomorrow”.</p>
<p>She said the US was reaching out to both parties regarding the Kashmir issue, and is expected to tell both sides not to escalate things any further.</p>
<p>Bruce said that Rubio was also encouraging leaders and foreign ministers from other nations to reach out over the issue.</p>
<p>Following the Pahalgam attack, US President Donald Trump had extended his “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905973/two-dozen-dead-as-tourists-targeted-in-held-kashmir#:~:text=US%20President%20Donald%20Trump%20said%20that%20India%20had%20the%20full%20support%20of%20the%20US.">full support</a>” to India.

            <p><p>Bears took control of the trade floor as shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) declined by more than 2,000 points in intraday trade, which analysts attributed the slump to heightened tensions between the country  and neighbouring India.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index decreased by 1,717.35 points, or 1.5 per cent, to stand at 113,154.83 from the last close of 114,872.18 at 9:53am.</p>
<p>At 10:38am, the index declined by by 2,073.42 points, or 1.8pc, from the last close.</p>
<p>Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, attributed the decline to “news of likely attack in next few days”.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said, “Investors are worried about potential Indian military action against Pakistan, concerns that have intensified following the information minister’s press briefing.”</p>
<p>Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, echoed the same sentiments.</p>
<p>He said that the market was under pressure following the information minister’s “statement last night suggesting that India may take military action within the next 24–36 hours”.</p>
<p>“The market in the short term will most likely follow newsflows of Pakistan-India tensions,” he added.</p>
<p>Sana Tawfik, head of research at Arif Habib Limited, also credited the slump primarily on geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">said</a> that “credible intelligence” reports indicated that India was planning to conduct a military action against Pakistan in the next 24 to 36 hours amid tensions between the two countries after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> in occupied Kashmir last week that New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">blamed</a> on Islamabad, albeit without proof.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, India gave its military “operational freedom” to respond to the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media hours after the development, Tarar said: “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends carrying out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.”</p>
<p>He said Pakistan vehemently rejected “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region”, adding that it was completely “reckless”.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the KSE-100 index had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907349/shares-at-psx-climb-800-points-after-imf-announcement">bounced</a> back on the trading floor after the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907317/imf-board-to-meet-on-may-9-to-discuss-pakistans-programmes">confirmed</a> that the Fund’s Executive Board will meet on May 9 to discuss the country’s staff-level agreement for a new $1.3 billion arrangement under a climate resilience loan programme, along with the first review of Pakistan’s ongoing $7bn bailout programme.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Indian shares were muted as gains in heavyweight HDFC Bank helped offset pressure from tensions with Pakistan, while Bajaj Finance declined despite posting a rise in fourth-quarter profit.</p>
<p>The Nifty 50 was down 0.05pc at 24,324 and the BSE Sensex lost 0.07pc to 80,236.6 as of 10:43am.</p>

<p>“For now, geopolitical tensions (with Pakistan) have overtaken (US) tariffs in investors’ minds,” said Anita Gandhi, founder and head of institutional business at Arihant Capital Markets.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">granted</a> military chiefs freedom to respond to last week’s attack in Pahalgam, <em>Reuters</em> reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Nifty volatility index has risen in five of the six sessions since the attack.</p>
<p>Six of the 13 major sectors declined on Wednesday, while the small- and mid-caps fell 0.6pc and 0.1pc, respectively.</p>
<p>Non-bank lender Bajaj Finance fell 5.4pc, leading losses on the Nifty, despite posting a higher quarterly profit, as brokerages flagged weak pre-provision profit and higher credit costs as negatives.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907544/fire-at-hotel-in-indias-kolkata-kills-15' target='_blank'><strong>Fire at hotel in India’s Kolkata kills 15</strong></a>
            <p><p>A fierce fire ripped through a hotel in the Indian city of Kolkata killing at least 15 people, police said Wednesday, with some clambering out of windows and onto the rooftop to escape.</p>
<p>Several people were rescued from rooms and roof of the budget hotel, Kolkata police chief Manoj Verma told <em>AFP</em>, after the fire broke out on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>“The death toll has risen to 15, including two children and a woman,” said Verma, adding an investigation had been launched to find out what triggered the blaze.
“The hotel turned into a gas chamber and it appears that many people suffocated to death.”</p>
<p>The Rituraj Hotel, which had 88 guests when the fire broke out, is located in a congested business district of central Kolkata. About a dozen people suffered burn injuries and were undergoing treatment.</p>
<p>Building fires are common in India due to a lack of firefighting equipment and a routine disregard for safety regulations.
Last year, six people were killed in a fire at a hotel in Patna in the eastern state of Bihar.</p>
<p>The <em>Press Trust of India</em> news agency, which filmed images of soaring flames from the Kolkata building, reported that “several people were seen trying to escape through the windows and narrow ledges of the building”.</p>
<p>Kolkata’s <em>The Telegraph</em> newspaper reported that at least one person died when he “jumped off the terrace trying to escape” the fire.</p>
<p>Verma said the fire had been tackled and that “cooling operations are underway”.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences to the families of those killed. “May the injured recover soon,” his office said in a statement.</p>
<p>Kolkata, a bustling metropolis of more than 15 million people, is the capital of West Bengal state, which is governed by the opposition Trinamool Congress party.</p></p>
