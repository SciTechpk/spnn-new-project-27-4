            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920139/trump-praises-coas-again-for-averting-nuclear-war' target='_blank'><strong>Trump praises COAS again for averting nuclear war</strong></a>
            <p><p>WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday once again <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917868">credited</a> Field Marshal Asim Munir for helping prevent a nuclear <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">conflict</a> with India, adding that he persuaded both sides to back down by linking peace to trade.</p>
<p>Explaining how he helped defuse tensions across the globe — from Ukr­­aine to Serbia — Trump said “the most impo­r­­tant” of these conflicts was last month’s war scare between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>“And that was not whether or not they may someday have nukes, like we are talking about the Middle East, like we are talking about with Israel and Iran. This is — they have nuclear weapons,” President Trump said at his news conference in The Hague, at the conclusion of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920050/nato-summit-commits-to-higher-spending-and-collective-defence">Nato summit.</a></p>
<p>Referring to recent tensions between the two South Asian neighbours, Trump said, “I ended that with a series of phone calls on trade. I said, ‘Look, if you are going to be fighting each other…’ It was getting very bad — you know how bad that last attack was. It was very bad. If you are really going to go fighting with each other, we are not going to do any trade.’ They said, ‘No, no. No, you have to do a trade deal’.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He described a conversation with Pakistan’s army chief and praised him in personal terms: “In fact, I had the general — he was really very impressive — the general from Pakistan was in my office last week. You know Prime Minister Modi is a great friend of mine. He is a great gentleman. He is a great man. And I got them to reason. I said, ‘We are not doing any trade deal if you are going to be fighting. And if you are going to be fighting each other, we are not doing any trade deal’.”</p>
<p>Trump concluded, “And you know what? They said, ‘No, I want to do a trade deal.’ And we stopped the nuclear war.”</p>
<p>The remarks highlighted the key role played by Field Marshal Munir in easing regional tensions.</p>
<p>Although Trump did not name the general directly in his public remarks, he had earlier described Munir as “an exceptional human being and an inspiring personality.”</p>
<p>These statements stand in contrast to India’s official position, which maintains that New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1560322">acted</a> independently during the May crisis and that Washington did not mediate. Trump’s remarks support Pakistan’s view that quiet US diplomacy — and direct intervention from the White House — helped calm tensions.</p>
<p>In broader comments during the Nato summit, Trump also said, “The Pakistanis know Iran very well, better than most. But they are not happy.” While brief, the comment underscored Washington’s view of Pakistan as a key regional player, especially as the US explores reopening talks with Tehran.</p>
<p>Trump indicated negotiations with Iran could resume “as early as next week.”</p>

<p>GILGIT: NDMA’s Nat­ional Emergencies Ope­ration Centre (NEOC) on Wednesday issued a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (Glof) alert for northern areas, including Gilgit-Baltistan, citing a dangerous combination of persistent high temperatures, intensified monsoon currents and a prevailing westerly wave.</p>
<p>The alert comes as current heatwaves intensify glacier melting across the region, leading to increased water levels and flash floods creating disasters in downstream areas.</p>
<p>A flash flood triggered on Wednesday by a melting glacier occurred in the Burundubar stream, which flows into the famous tourist point Attabad Lake, according to Rescue 1122.</p>
<p>The floodwater blocked access to the Luxus hotel, entering its premises where “a large number of national and foreign tourists were present”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>160 evacuated by boat after flash flooding near Attabad Lake</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More than 160 tourists and hotel staff were evacuated by boat.</p>
<p>The flood also damaged trees and land, creating “panic among stranded tourists cut off from land link”.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, rising temperatures triggered flooding in Barga nallah in Skardu, where water “once again entered homes and crops, causing widespread destruction,” police said.</p>
<p>GB Environmental Pro­tection Agency’s (GBEPA) Director Khadim Hussain told Dawn that the frequency of melting glacier disasters “intensified in recent years”.</p>
<p>Mr Hussain attributed this to global climate cha­nge and localised factors.</p>
<p>“In old times, snowfall received the mountains in November to December, that was converting into ice, now snowfall in February and March, that couldn’t convert into ice, with heatwaves, the snow melting in speed that causes flooding,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that “localised factors including def­orestation, unplanned con­­struction, and tourism influx,” along with incr­e­ased population and certain energy practices, contribute to accelerated glacier melt.</p>
<p>Another environmental expert told <em>Dawn</em> that many in GB live “in downstream areas of nallahs and rivers and near glaciers,” and when floods hit, “they have no time to save themselves.”</p>
<p>The expert highlighted the broader consequences, saying, “The GB glaciers produce 80pc of Pakistan’s agricultural water. This isn’t just a GB issue — it affects the whole country.”</p>
<p>Concerns were also raised that the GB government “has shown little priority in creating awareness or reducing the risks of climate change and disasters.”</p>

            <p><p><strong>• NA set to pass federal budget today with amendments<br />
• Omar Ayub labels budget ‘dead on arrival’, slams inflation claims<br />
• Rs4.8tr in grants approved for four ministries<br />
• Finance minister claims macroeconomic stability restored</strong></p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) came under fire in the National Assembly on Wednesday over allegations of collusion with smugglers and tax evaders, as the House paved the way for the federal budget’s passage today (Thursday).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292/budget-fy26-pakistan-targets-42pc-growth-slashes-overall-spending">budget</a>, presented on June 10, is now set to pass with previously agreed-upon amendments.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the National Asse­m­bly completed the process of approving demands for grants to cover the ex­­­pe­n­ses of various ministries and divisions.</p>
<p>It approved 31 demands for grants totalling Rs4.814 trillion for four ministries and divisions —Finance and Revenue, Human Rights, Interior, and National Food Security — while rejecting all 430 cut motions submitted by the opposition.</p>
<p>Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub Khan, speaking during the debate on budgetary allocations for the Finance Division, alleged that oil worth Rs550 billion is smuggled from Iran every year.</p>
<p>He wondered how around 200 heavy vehicles manage to cross more than two dozen bridges daily without being intercepted, implying official complicity. Describing the FBR as “one of the most corrupt institutions”, he opposed proposals to grant it arrest powers.</p>
<p>He rejected the budget as “dead on arrival” and dismissed government claims of reducing inflation. He said the purchasing power of the masses continues to shrink and lamented that 44 per cent of citizens had slipped below the poverty line.</p>
<p>He accused the government of sig­ning flawed power purchase agreements with independent power producers (IPPs) between 2013 and 2018, saying capacity payments had soared from Rs450bn in 2018 to Rs 2.2tr.</p>
<p>“This regime is responsible,” he said, adding that 97pc of the fiscal deficit would be financed through bank borrowing, benefiting the owners of four private banks.</p>
<p>JUI-F’s Aliya Kamran voiced alarm over the ballooning national debt, noting it had swelled to Rs76tr by March — more than four times the entire budget. On tax evasion, she said the FBR’s system was weak and lacked ac­­countability. “Tax frauds are made with the help of FBR officials,” she alleged.</p>
<p>PTI’s Usama Ahmad Mela criticised the government’s reliance on indirect taxes, including the imposition of a carbon tax amid rising oil prices, instead of reducing the petroleum levy. He questioned the rationale behind taxing hybrid vehicles if the state was serious about promoting eco-friendly alternatives and demanded the reversal of the decision.</p>
<p>He also condemned the government’s policy of exporting and then re-importing 750,000 tonnes of sugar, saying it had led to a Rs50 per kilogram price hike. “If we continue surrendering to pressure groups and lobbies, we should forget about public relief,” he said.</p>
<p>He warned that allowing the FBR to make unlimited contract-based recruitments and leaving small business owners at its mercy would open floodgates of corruption.</p>
<p>JUI-P’s Shahida Begum criticised the FBR’s inaction in the face of disclosures about public officials owning large, undeclared properties, and opposed proposed powers allowing it to arrest businessmen.</p>
<p>PTI’s Shandana Gulzar challenged government claims of growth in the livestock sector, pointing out that the last livestock census was held in 2006. She accused the government of peddling falsehoods and pursuing anti-people policies, adding: “We are sowing the seeds of revolution in Pakistan.”</p>
<p><strong>‘Macroeconomic stability’</strong></p>
<p>Winding up the discussion on cut motions on demands for grants relating to the Finance and Revenue Division, Finance Minister Muham­mad Aurangzeb claimed that macroeconomic stability had been restored.</p>
<p>He cited improvements in economic indicators, including a stable curren­cy, increased foreign reserves sufficient to cover two and a half months of imp­orts, and reduced inflation and policy rates. “These are hard facts, independently validated by rating agencies,” he said. He said investor, business and consumer confidence had improved over the past four to five months, citing a Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey indicating the highest consumer confidence since 2022.</p>
<p>On FBR corruption, he said digitisation was meant to ensure transparency and minimise human involvement, which he called the most effective way to reduce graft.</p>
<p>Concluding debate on cut motions related to the Human Rights Division, Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar highlighted that the National Commission for Human Rights Pakistan had, for the first time, received “A” status from a cluster of global human rights organisations. He said effective legislation had been enacted to protect the rights of women, children, and minorities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry stated that Pakistan’s passports have been upgraded with international security features to prevent forgery. He added that airports and seaports are now integrated with AI systems to ensure that no person can leave the country without a valid visa and the necessary legal documents.</p>
