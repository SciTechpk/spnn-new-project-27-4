<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz said Pakistan came out of the crisis with India as victorious because of the “brave actions of our outstanding armed forces, strongly supported by the people of Pakistan”.</p>
<p>He added, “We want peace and will work for peace in the region thro­ugh talks on the table and resolve our outstanding iss­ues, including the Kash­mir dispute, according to the United Nations Secu­rity Council resolutions, which were acknowledged even by the Indian Lok Sabha when Nehru was the prime minister of India.”</p>
<p>He said Pakistan is ready to talk for the sake of peace on different issues, including water, trade and counterterrorism, “if India is serious”. However, he reaffirmed that if India remained aggressive, Pakistan would defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
<p>The prime minister said he had a productive and useful meeting with the Iranian president, covering all areas of mutual interest and cooperation.</p>

<p>“There was total agreement that the two brotherly neighbouring countries must enhance cooperation in diverse fields, including trade, investment and economy,” he added.</p>
<p>Stressing that Pakistan and Iran had deep-rooted cultural and historical relations, he said, “We have decided to transform these relations into a very productive cooperation in various fields of life.”</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also thanked the Iranian president for calling him and showing his concern on the evolving situation in the subcontinent a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>“I deeply appreciate your concern and brotherly feelings for the people of Pakistan and your ardent desire that this crisis comes to a grinding halt instead of escalating further,” he told the president.</p>
<p><strong>Israeli actions condemned</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz said Pakistan condemned Israeli actions causing untold misery for the people of Gaza, where Israel murdered more than 50,000 Palestinians, and the bloodshed continues.</p>
<p>“It is high time that the international community used its influence to bring a lasting ceasefire in Palestine. Pakistan stands by its brothers and sisters in Iran to promote peace, progress and prosperity,” he said.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan fully supported Iran’s right to have a civilian nuclear programme. He assured that Pakistan would work with Iran on all issues of mutual concern.</p>
<p>The Iranian president stressed that Pakistan and Iran shared a common stance on important regional and international issues on different platforms, including the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).</p>
<p>President Pezeshkian said the two countries should cooperate on making their borders secure from the activities of terrorists and criminal groups.</p>
<p>“Peace and stability in Pakistan are in the interest of Iran. We believe that sustaining security and maintaining friendly and peaceful relations with neighbouring countries is in the interest of the two countries,” he added.</p>
<p>He said Iran welcomed the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, adding that settling issues through dialogue was essential for stability in the region.</p>
<p>“We believe that to ensure security and stability in the region, neighbouring countries should hold dialogue and have positive consultations with each other and the international partners,” he added.</p>
<p>He said the two sides discussed issues facing the Islamic world and the top priority was the issue of Palestine.</p>
<p>“As always, we support the cause of Palestine and condemn the atrocities carried out by Israel,” he added.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to Prime Minister Tariq Fatimi accompanied the prime minister.</p>

                <h2>Nepali Sherpa scales Mount Everest for a record 31st time</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Nepali Sherpa guide <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1122089/newspaper/column">Kami Rita</a> scaled Mount Everest for the 31st time on Tuesday, breaking the record he set last year.</p>
<p>The 55-year-old reached the 8,849-metre (29,032 foot) peak — the highest in the world — by the traditional southeast ridge route while guiding a 22-member Indian army team, officials said, adding that 27 other Sherpas also accompanied the group.</p>
<p>“He is a very passionate climber,” said Pasang Phurba, director of the Seven Summit Treks company for which Kami Rita works, adding that Kami Rita was currently descending to lower camps.</p>
<p>Kami Rita, who uses only his first name, first climbed Everest in 1994 and has done so every year except for three years when authorities <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1626367">closed</a> the mountain to climbers for various reasons.</p>
<p>More than 8,000 people have climbed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1594790">Mount Everest</a> since it was first scaled by New Zealander Sir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/284404">Edmund Hillary</a> and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953.</p>
<p>After Kami Rita, another Sherpa, Pasang Dawa, has ascended Everest the most with 29 climbs. Among non-Sherpa climbers, the record is held by British guide <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1637562">Kenton Cool</a> who has accomplished the feat 19 times, followed by American climbers Dave Hahn and Garrett Madison with 15 times each.</p>
<p>One of the poorest countries in the world, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1386736">Nepal</a> is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest peaks and is heavily reliant on climbing, trekking, and tourism for foreign exchange. Guiding foreign climbers to Everest and other peaks provides crucial family income to many Sherpas.</p>
<p>Authorities have issued 468 permits to climbers for Everest this March-May climbing season, and more than 300 climbers and Sherpas have already scaled the peak, officials said.</p>
<p>Two climbers are known to have died on the mountain this month and there have also been unconfirmed reports of other deaths.</p></p>
