                <h2>Govt hails Hague court‚Äôs award saying India must ‚Äòlet flow‚Äô waters of western rivers for Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äòunrestricted use‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The federal government on Monday welcomed the decision by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague to issue an ‚ÄúAward on Issues of General Interpretation of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT)‚Äù in the Indus Waters case, stating that India must generally ‚Äúlet flow‚Äù the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúunrestricted use‚Äù.</p>
<p>India in April held the IWT <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">in abeyance</a> following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam that killed 26 ‚Äî an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">termed</a> any attempt to suspend its water share an ‚Äúact of war‚Äù, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907454">considering</a> court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920611/pakistan-hails-hague-courts-supplemental-award-in-indus-waters-case-says-india-cant-sideline-arbitration-process">supplemental award</a> by the PCA in June held that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. India, in response, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920611/pakistan-hails-hague-courts-supplemental-award-in-indus-waters-case-says-india-cant-sideline-arbitration-process#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIndia%20has%20never,the%20ministry%20maintained.">did not recognise</a> the court or its decisions.</p>
<p>A press release issued <a class="link--external" href="https://docs.pca-cpa.org/2025/08/a4fbccca-2023-01-20250811-press-release.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">today</a> by the PCA said it rendered an award on Friday in an arbitration initiated by Pakistan against India on August 19, 2016, pursuant to Article IX and Annexure G to the IWT.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis arbitration concerns the interpretation and application of the IWT to certain design elements of the run-of-river hydro-electric plants that India is permitted by the treaty to construct on the tributaries of the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab Rivers.‚Äù</p>
<p>Regarding the overall approach to Article 3 (provisions regarding western rivers) of the IWT, the award said: ‚ÄúThe general rule is that India shall ‚Äòlet flow‚Äô the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan‚Äôs unrestricted use.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere are certain specified exceptions to this rule, including in relation to the generation of hydroelectric power, but these exceptions must be strictly construed: the design and operation of run-of-river hydroelectric plants must hew strictly to the requirements in the treaty, rather than to
what India might consider an ‚Äòideal‚Äô or ‚Äòbest practices‚Äô approach.‚Äù</p>
<p>It further noted that questions relating to the balance between the parties‚Äô respective rights and obligations in this regard were to be identified and addressed through the treaty‚Äôs procedures for notification, objection and dispute resolution in furtherance of the treaty‚Äôs objective and its obligations of mutual cooperation.</p>

<p>The PCA said that to date, India had not participated in the arbitration proceedings and had repeatedly objected to the court‚Äôs competence of the court, adding that it had addressed the issue on various counts before.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThroughout these proceedings, the court has ensured that India is fully informed in respect of the
proceedings and that the opportunity to participate remains open to it. Notwithstanding this, the court
has endeavoured to ascertain, understand, and consider India‚Äôs views, drawing on available materials,
including the records of the commission, correspondence between the parties, and/or submissions by
India in previous dispute resolution proceedings under the treaty,‚Äù the PCA said.</p>
<p>It added that it had also taken steps to test the accuracy of Pakistan‚Äôs claims, including by requesting further written submissions from Pakistan, by questioning Pakistan both before and during the hearing on the merits, by requesting that Pakistan produce historical evidence concerning the operation of the IWT and the Permanent Indus Commission, and by considering publicly available materials and jurisprudence not presented by Pakistan.</p>
<p>The PCA explained that the Aug 8 award addressed questions concerning the treaty‚Äôs overall interpretation and application, including in relation to Article 3 and Paragraph 8 of Annexure D (which concerns new run-of-river hydro-electric plants that India may construct on the western rivers).</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe award also addresses a related question on the legal effect of decisions issued by dispute resolution bodies under the treaty (namely, courts of arbitration and neutral experts),‚Äù the PCA press release said.</p>

                <h2>Foreign Office slams India‚Äôs MEA for ‚Äòtwisting‚Äô COAS Asim Munir‚Äôs remarks</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Monday castigated India‚Äôs Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) for ‚Äúdistorting‚Äù and ‚Äútwisting‚Äù remarks made by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir during his recent visit to the United States.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir on Sunday completed his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930030/coas-says-india-wont-be-allowed-to-choke-indus-river">second high-profile trip</a> to the US in less than two months. Like his previous visit, he engaged with both political and military leadership in the host country. In Tampa, Florida, the army chief attended the US Central Command‚Äôs (Centcom) change of command ceremony.</p>
<p>His most closely watched appearance came later at a black-tie dinner hosted by Adnan Asad, Pakistan‚Äôs honorary consul in Tampa. The event was attended by about 150 guests, including Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Ambassador Rizwan Shaikh, embassy officials, and prominent members of the diaspora.</p>
<p>Comments Field Marshal Munir reportedly made at the event were later picked up and, according to the FO, distorted by Indian media outlets. Responding to Indian media reports, the MEA had said earlier today: ‚ÄúOur attention has been drawn to remarks reportedly made by the Pakistani COAS while on a visit to the US. Nuclear sabre-rattling is Pakistan‚Äôs stock-in-trade.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe international community can draw its own conclusions on the irresponsibility inherent in such remarks, which also reinforce the well-held doubts about the integrity of nuclear command and control in a state where the military is hand-in-glove with terrorist groups.‚Äù</p>
<p>The MEA had also said that it was ‚Äúregrettable‚Äù that the alleged remarks were ‚Äúmade from the soil of a friendly third country‚Äù.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>In a terse response to the Indian MEA‚Äôs statement, the FO said: ‚ÄúPakistan strongly rejects the immature remarks made by the Indian MEA earlier today, which is yet another demonstration of their chronic tendency to distorting facts and twisting statements out of context.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Indian narrative of an alleged ‚Äònuclear blackmail‚Äô is a misleading and self-serving construct. Pakistan remains firmly opposed to the use or threat of use of force. India‚Äôs sabre-rattling and warmongering whenever confronted, invite unfounded allegations bereft of rationality.‚Äù</p>
<p>The FO said Pakistan was a responsible nuclear-weapon state with an ‚Äúelaborate command and control structure under full civilian control‚Äù that had always exercised ‚Äúdiscipline and restraint‚Äù while dealing with issues of such importance.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPakistan‚Äôs sustained and credible counterterrorism efforts are internationally acknowledged. Our security forces remain the bulwark against terrorism. The Indian MEA‚Äôs spurious insinuations are irresponsible and without a shred of evidence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe also note with concern a pointless reference to the third countries, in a bid to exert pressure on Pakistan. This not only reflects India‚Äôs lack of diplomatic confidence but also constitutes a futile attempt to unnecessarily involve other countries.‚Äù</p>
<p>The FO said that ‚Äúcontrary to India‚Äôs belligerent and jingoistic approach‚Äù, Pakistan would continue to act as a responsible member of the global community.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, any act of Indian aggression or violation of Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity will be met with an immediate and matching response. The onus of any ensuing escalation will rest squarely with the Indian leadership,‚Äù it warned.</p>
<p>The two countries had entered a brief but intense military escalation after India, without evidence, blamed Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam attack. On May 6‚Äì7, New Delhi launched <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> that killed civilians, and the PAF <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">downed</a> six Indian jets in its response. After tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">strikes</a> on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>Since India‚Äôs short but deadly conflict with Pakistan in May, New Delhi has been unhappy about Trump‚Äôs closeness with Islamabad and has protested, casting a shadow over trade talks. Despite former public displays of bonhomie between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has taken a slightly harder stance against the US in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925193">repeatedly</a> taken credit for the India-Pakistan ceasefire he announced on social media on May 10, but India disputes his claim that it resulted from his intervention and trade threats.  Trump also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044">hosted</a> the army chief at the White House in the weeks following the conflict.</p>
<p>By declaring the Indian economy dead in the water, Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929119">put</a> Modi and his party in a bind. Until recently, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was canvassing support for the US president‚Äôs election. Its supporters were holding special prayers and muttering mystical chants for Trump‚Äôs victory. There was at least one temple created where a sculptured image of Trump was worshipped.</p>
<p>But Trump has ignored the lavish praise and called out India‚Äôs energy imports from Russia and its tariff regime as non-negotiable.</p>
<p>The Indian government said it was trying to figure out a response by consulting all the ‚Äústakeholders‚Äù, a euphemism for angry businesses whose hopes were riding on Modi‚Äôs daring ability to play both sides of the street.</p>
<p>That appears to have hit a dead end as Trump last week <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929119/trump-imposes-additional-25pc-tariff-on-indian-goods-relations-hit-new-low">imposed</a> an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, citing New Delhi‚Äôs continued imports of Russian oil in a move that sharply escalated tensions between the two nations after trade talks reached a deadlock. The new import tax, set to come into place in three weeks, will raise duties on some Indian exports to as high as 50pc ‚Äî among the highest levied on any US trading partner.</p></p>
