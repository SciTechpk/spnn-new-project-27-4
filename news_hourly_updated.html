                <h2>For talks with India, PM sees Saudi Arabia as neutral venue</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Observes things are calming down following contacts between DGMOs; NSA to lead Pakistan side during dialogue<br />
‚Ä¢ Says Nawaz was consulted before army chief‚Äôs elevation to field marshal</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said Saudi Arabia could be the ‚Äúneutral‚Äù venue for much-needed talks between Pakistan and India on critical issues.</p>
<p>The premier also said that he had consulted PML-N President Nawaz Sharif on his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912186/cabinet-approves-coas-gen-asim-munirs-promotion-to-field-marshal">decision</a> to elevate Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir to field marshal.</p>
<p>Talking to a group of TV anchors at the PM House, he said that Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism will be the key points during the dialogue with India.</p>
<p>In response to a question if there was a possibility of a third venue for talks in light of the mediation offered by US President Donald Trump, the premier ruled out the possibility of China as a neutral venue, saying India would never agree to that.</p>
<p>However, a participant told <em>Dawn</em>, the PM expressed the hope that Saudi Arabia could be the third country where both sides could agree to hold the negotiations.</p>
<p>When it was pointed out that India intends to hold dialogue on terrorism while Pakistan wants to focus on Kashmir, the PM reiterated: ‚ÄúKashmir, water, trade and terrorism will be the key points during Pakistan-India talks.‚Äù</p>
<p>Regarding the appointment of COAS Gen Munir as field marshal, PM Shehbaz said: ‚ÄúIt was my own decision to make the army chief a field marshal.‚Äù</p>
<p>Responding to a question that Nawaz Sharif had always remained opposed to giving extension to the army chief‚Äôs term in office, PM Shehbaz said he took his elder brother into confidence before taking any decision and likewise the COAS was made field marshal after consultation with the ruling party president.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI always consult Nawaz Sharif before taking any key decision and that also happened in case of [elevation of] Gen Asim Munir,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>In reply to a question that the PTI-led KP government needs to be supported in its efforts for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005">eradicating</a> terrorism, the prime minister said Centre was already helping the province in this regard as over Rs600 billion had been released to the KP government under the Public Sector Development Programme.</p>
<p>He said that situation between Pakistan and India was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910567">de-escalating</a> after the DGMOs of the two sides made contacts with each other.</p>
<p>He said if talks were held between the two arch rivals, the National Secur¬≠ity Adviser will lead Paki¬≠stan‚Äôs side in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting on housing</strong></p>
<p>Presiding over a meeting on the low-cost housing, the prime minister said that affordable projects would not only make residential units accessible to the common man but would also boost national economy and create jobs.</p>
<p>He said the relevant task force, in collaboration with the ministry of fina¬≠n¬≠ce and banks, should soon submit recommendations for financing low-cost hou¬≠s¬≠ing projects, which should be included in the upcoming budget proposals.</p>
<p>He observed that sustainable growth of economy was closely linked with the development of the construction sector.</p>
<p>Ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Riaz Hussain Pirzada, Ahad Khan Cheema, Muh¬≠a¬≠mmad Aurangzeb, and Ali Pervaiz Malik, the FBR chairman and other senior officials attended the mee¬≠t¬≠ing, the PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.</p>
<p>The meeting was infor¬≠med that the Condominium Act 2025 and amendments to the Foreclosure Law were in their final stages and after their approval it would become easier to obtain loans for the construction and ownership of homes under the low-cost housing schemes.</p>
<p>The task force briefed the meeting on the progress in initiating construction projects, particularly low-cost housing schemes.</p>

                <h2>China makes Taliban regime, Islamabad agree on ties upgrade</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Afghanistan on Wednesday agreed in principle to upgrade their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912365">diplomatic relations</a> by exchanging ambassadors ‚Äî a key step towards normalising ties after years of strained relations between Islamabad and the Taliban administration in Kabul.</p>
<p>The understanding was reached during an informal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910314">trilateral meeting</a> of foreign ministers from Pakistan, China, and Afghanistan in Beijing. The talks were part of Beijing‚Äôs broader effort to ease regional tensions and advance connectivity through its Belt and Road Initiative.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfghanistan and Pakistan expressed clear willingness to elevate diplomatic relations and agreed in principle to exchange ambassadors as soon as possible,‚Äù Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a statement released by China‚Äôs foreign ministry.</p>
<p>‚ÄúChina welcomes this and will continue to provide assistance for the improvement of Afghanistan-Pakistan relations,‚Äù Yi said.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>China, Pakistan agree on CPEC extension to Kabul</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, Pakistan and China noted that there was an agreement on the extension of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Although no country has formally recognised the Taliban regime since its return to power in 2021, several including China, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia maintain ambassadors in Kabul. China and the UAE also host Taliban-appointed ambassadors, while Russia last month <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906189/russia-allows-taliban-to-have-ambassador-in-moscow">agreed</a> to accept a Taliban ambassador in Moscow.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Afghanistan currently only have charg√©s d‚Äôaffaires posted to each other‚Äôs capitals.</p>
<p>Wednesday‚Äôs meeting followed a thaw in Pakistan-Afghanistan ties, which have been marred by deep mistrust, cross-border attacks, and sharp disagreements over the presence of the banned Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants operating from Afghan territory. Islamabad has long accused Kabul of harboring TTP fighters, who were blamed for a 70pc increase in attacks inside Pakistan in 2024.</p>
<p>Recent diplomatic efforts have aimed to turn the tide. In March 2025, Special Envoy for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899846">visited</a> Kabul for the first time in over a year. His mission was followed by a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905251">high-level visit</a> by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on April 19, where both sides pledged to prevent their territories from being used for terrorist activities and agreed on trade facilitation measures.</p>
<p>The trilateral meeting in Beijing further built on this momentum. China, which has strategic interests in regional stability and economic integration, hosted the gathering to help resume the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan trilateral dialogue, which had been paused since 2023.</p>
<p>The key outcomes from the Beijing meeting. besides the agreement on the appointment of ambassadors in each other‚Äôs capitals, included commitments to enhance cooperation in security and counter-terrorism, including joint action against militant groups and external interference; support for extending the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) into Afghanistan; and an understanding to formally resume the trilateral process by convening the sixth China-Afghanistan-Pakistan Foreign Ministers‚Äô Dialogue in Kabul.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDeputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to promoting close, cooperative ties with Afghanistan, especially in trade, transit, health, and connectivity,‚Äù Pakistan‚Äôs Foreign Office said in a statement following the meeting.</p>
<p>China emphasised that all sides must ‚Äúsafeguard their sovereignty, security and national dignity‚Äù and reiterated its support for regional partners pursuing development paths ‚Äúsuited to their national conditions.‚Äù</p>
<p>With Wednesday‚Äôs developments, Pakistan and China appear to be betting that deeper engagement and economic incentives can draw Kabul closer and temper instability in the region.</p>
<p><strong>CPEC extension</strong></p>
<p>Wang Yi noted Chinese and Pakistani support for Afghanistan‚Äôs reconstruction and development, and readiness to expand trade exchanges with Afghanistan. He further said that there was an agreement on ‚Äúthe extension of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to Afghanistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>The same was echoed by FO, which said, ‚ÄúChina and Pakistan reiterated their support for extending the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan under the broader framework of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation.‚Äù</p>
<p>All three sides appeared cautiously optimistic about the progress toward normalised ties between Islamabad and Kabul.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe process of normalisation will not be quick,‚Äù commented a diplomat not authorised to speak publicly, ‚Äúbut the fact that Islamabad and Kabul are talking again at this level and agreeing in principle on ambassadors is a significant development.‚Äù</p>
<p>For Beijing, which has maintained an ambassador in Kabul and recognised a Taliban-appointed envoy last year, the meeting reflects a strategy of ‚Äúmini-multilateralism‚Äù, which is a targeted diplomatic format aimed at tackling specific regional challenges.</p>
<p>The meeting‚Äôs significance is heightened by India‚Äôs recent diplomatic overtures to the Taliban, including a call last week between Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Amir Khan Muttaqi. This comes amid growing Taliban frustration with Pakistan over refugee deportations and border closures.</p>
