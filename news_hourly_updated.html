<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000.

<p>Relations have reached ‚Äúa boiling point‚Äù, Guterres told reporters in New York, adding that they were at their ‚Äúhighest in years‚Äù.</p>
<p>He again condemned the April 22 attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people, calling for those responsible to be brought to justice through ‚Äúcredible and lawful means‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is also essential ‚Äî especially at this critical hour ‚Äî to avoid a military confrontation that could easily spin out of control,‚Äù the secretary-general warned.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNow is the time for maximum restraint and stepping back from the brink.‚Äù</p>
<p>The UN chief also called Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to discuss the prevailing security situation in South Asia, according to a press release from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office.</p>
<p>It added that this was the second telephone conversation between the two leaders within a week.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz appreciated the UN chief‚Äôs continued engagement and outreach efforts and welcomed his call for de-escalation as well as the need to avoid any confrontation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile reiterating his offer of an independent, transparent, neutral and credible investigation, the prime minister expressed his concern that India was yet to provide any evidence, nevertheless, it continued to resort to provocative rhetoric and warmongering,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>The premier reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs determination to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also expressed his serious concern at Indian attempts to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907975">politicise</a> international financial institutions in an attempt to harm Pakistan‚Äôs economic interests.</p>
<p>The UN chief briefed the prime minister on his outreach efforts for peace and stability in the region, and expressed his commitment to remain engaged with all interlocutors on the issue.</p>
<p>Pakistan and India have fought multiple wars and remain bitter foes.</p>
<p>International pressure has been piled on both New Delhi and Islamabad to de-escalate.</p>
<p>No group has claimed responsibility for the attack in Kashmir.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given his military ‚Äúfull operational freedom‚Äù to respond and Islamabad has warned it will hit back against any aggression.</p>
<p>The UN Security Council was due to meet behind closed doors later today at Pakistan‚Äôs request over the crisis.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the National Assembly (NA) unanimously passed a resolution condemning India‚Äôs unlawful and unilateral declaration to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance in blatant violation of the treaty.</p>
<p>The resolution was presented by Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry.</p>
<p>The resolution said that the killing of innocent civilians was contrary to the values upheld by Pakistan, and the NA rejected all ‚Äúfrivolous and baseless attempts‚Äù to link Pakistan with the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>The lawmakers condemned the ‚Äúorchestrated and mala fide campaign‚Äù by the Indian government to malign Pakistan, which ‚Äúfollows a familiar pattern of exploiting the issue of terrorism for a narrow political goal‚Äù.</p>
<p>The resolution warned that Pakistan remained fully capable and prepared to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity against any aggression, including water terrorism or military provocation and any misadventure by India would be met with a firm, swift and decisive response.</p>
<p>The lawmakers emphasised that the people of Pakistan remained committed to peace but would never allow anyone to transgress the country‚Äôs sovereignty, security, and interests.</p>
<p>The resolution demanded that India should be held accountable for its involvement in different acts of terrorism and targeted assassinations on the soil of other countries, including Pakistan, and reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs unwavering moral, political and diplomatic support for and commitment to the Kashmiri people‚Äôs just struggle for the realisation of their inalienable right to self-determination.</p>

<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that the attack was an attempt to ‚Äúdivert attention‚Äù from India‚Äôs internal challenges and its cross-border terrorism.</p>
<p>Addressing the Regional Dialogue 2025 in Islamabad today, organised by the Institute of Regional Studies, Dar said Pakistan believed the Pahalgam attack was part of an effort to ‚Äúdivert attention‚Äù from India‚Äôs internal challenges, adding that it could be ‚Äúself-choreographed‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe believe that what has happened is to divert attention ‚Äî I am talking of Pahalgam ‚Äî from India‚Äôs internal challenges, state-sponsored terrorism, the ongoing human rights violations in the Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir, and to gain narrow domestic political objectives,‚Äù Dar said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget that there are some by-elections coming in the next few months in India,‚Äù he added, referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907658">upcoming polls in Bihar</a> in October.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis brinkmanship carries consequences that extend far beyond India‚Äôs borders,‚Äù the deputy PM warned, calling India‚Äôs actions ‚Äúunilateral, politically-motivated and highly provocative‚Äù.</p>
<p>He noted: ‚ÄúThere appears to be a calculated and premeditated attempt to escalate regional tensions, following a familiar pattern ‚Äî level allegations against Pakistan without evidence, use inflammatory rhetoric, incite war hysteria and use this as a pretext for aggression and unilateral actions.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a reference to the Indian government, Dar stressed that regional and international peace and security could not be ‚Äúsacrificed at the altar of narrow electoral gains‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is a dangerous political game and gamble, putting at stake the lives of millions in the region,‚Äù the foreign minister highlighted. However, he also reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to regional peace: ‚ÄúWe will support all efforts towards de-escalation.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnalysts say this could be another ploy. It might have been self-choreographed,‚Äù echoing Pakistani leaders‚Äô previous statements of the Pahalgam attack being a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906207">false flag operation</a>‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow can an FIR (first information report) be registered in 10 minutes at a police station where you need at least 45 minutes to reach? [‚Ä¶] Come on. Nobody‚Äôs a fool,‚Äù Dar quipped.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInternational dignitaries are talking [to] both sides. Few of them ‚Äî great friends ‚Äî suggested to me, ‚ÄòCan you try and help the perpetrators be caught?‚Äô I said ‚Äòcome on, do you know the distance where it happened and where‚Äôs the Line of Control? 230 kilometres.‚Äù</p>
<p>The deputy PM asserted: ‚ÄúPakistan has exposed India‚Äôs mala fide and they are now on the backfoot. But it takes two to tango. I am telling all these dignitaries that we will show patience and will not be the first ones to attack.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut if anybody makes any mistake and ventures into adventurism, then God knows what situation that will lead to. I hope sense prevails and they should [reflect].‚Äù</p>
<p>He detailed that he has directed Pakistan‚Äôs permanent representative to the United Nations to request a meeting of the UN Security Council.</p>

<p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs share with them the facts and figures and the details and the evidence we showed the other day,‚Äù said Dar, referring to his press briefing with the military‚Äôs spokesperson, where they <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">accused India</a> of activating its ‚Äúassets‚Äù to inte¬≠nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI cannot find the word abeyance in any international treaties‚Äô dictionary. The word suspension is there,‚Äù Dar said, referring to India‚Äôs unilateral <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">suspension</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>.</p>

<p>Noting that the UK enjoyed ‚Äúgood relations‚Äù with both India and Pakistan, PM Shehbaz assured Marriott that Islamabad ‚Äúwould never take any action that could imperil regional peace and security‚Äù.</p>

<p>Zardari conveyed his deep appreciation and gratitude to the Chinese government for its ‚Äúconsistent support, always standing by Pakistan in difficult times‚Äù.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, appearing on <em>Samaa TV</em> programme ‚ÄòNadeem Malik Live‚Äô, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif reiterated that any Indian attack would be met with a ‚Äúbefitting response‚Äù, adding that it would be ‚Äúa level above what they do‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf they attack, which I can‚Äôt define right now, our response will be a step up and will not come down,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>When asked about the possibility of an Indian attack on the LoC, Asif responded that there was anticipation that any Indian attack would be contained to the LoC or Sialkot sector.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOnce war starts, you cannot calibrate or control it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúStarting a war itself is something which is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>‚ÄúModi is fighting a war for his own gains and for votes,‚Äù Asif added. ‚ÄúPolitical compulsions dictate their strategic policy, which is very unfortunate. Votes are more valuable than human lives or international peace.‚Äù</p>

<p>Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar visited the LoC in Azad Jammu and Kashmir with local and foreign media and dismissed India‚Äôs allegations of ‚Äúterrorist hideouts‚Äù there, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/05-05-2025/info-minister-visits-loc-along-with-local-foreign-media" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The visit facilitated by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting was aimed at exposing the ‚Äúfalse and baseless Indian propaganda‚Äù, the report said, pointing out that media representatives were taken to specific locations that India had allegedly ‚Äúlabelled as terrorist hideouts‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBy witnessing the ground situation, hearing from the local population, and observing the environment firsthand, the media got the opportunity to assess the truth behind India‚Äôs claims,‚Äù <em>Radio Pakistan</em> noted.</p>
<p>Among the group of international journalists was <em>CNN</em>‚Äôs International Diplomatic Editor <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/NicRobertsonCNN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nic Robertson</a>.</p>

<p>According to <em>Radio Pakistan</em>, Robertson visited a village where Muhammad Farooq and Muhammad Deen were killed in a ‚Äúfake encounter by the Indian army‚Äù.</p>
<p>The <em>CNN</em> editor interviewed both men‚Äôs bereaved families, who appealed for justice through international media, the report said. No statement by Robertson was found on his social media accounts immediately after the visit.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Tarar said: ‚ÄúIndia is now claiming the presence of training camps in Bela Noor Shah, which is near Pir Chinasi, and that they were used in the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis area is 26 kilometres away from the LoC and the purpose of coming here is to show that Indian propaganda is false, fake, and concocted,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs narrative has failed miserably, and the international media has not picked it up. There are contradictions in India‚Äôs response and they are not able to provide evidence,‚Äù the minister said.</p>
<p>He asserted: ‚ÄúThere are no terrorist camps here. There are beautiful mountains and people [only].‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt resort to any misadventure,‚Äù Tarar warned, adding that Pakistan would give a befitting response to any Indian aggression and would go to any extent to defend its sovereignty.</p>
<p>Echoing Deputy PM Dar‚Äôs statements, Tarar said India uses propaganda to ‚Äúhide its internal failures‚Äù.</p>

<p>According to security sources, Indian troops resorted to unprovoked firing on multiple Pakistani military posts in Nakyal, Khuiratta, Sharda, Kel, Neelum and Haji Pir sectors along the LoC.</p>

                <h2>Asean takes unified stance against sweeping Trump tarrifs</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) has presented a unified stance against ‚Äúescalating trade protectionism‚Äù and an uncertain economic landscape amid global economic upheaval caused by sweeping tariffs of the new Trump administration.</p>
<p>The United States at the start of April <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810">imposed</a> sweeping tariffs on most goods imported to the US, as well as much higher levies on dozens of rivals and allies alike. A week later, US President Donald Trump announced that he would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903146">pause</a> many of his new tariffs for 90 days, even as he raised them further on imports from China.</p>
<p>By mid-April, the White House announced that China faced tariffs of up to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904617">245 per cent</a> due to its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903545">retaliatory tariffs</a> on American goods. Asean had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903538/asean-opts-for-constructive-engagement-over-us-tariffs">decided not to retaliate</a> against the announcement of reciprocal tariffs, choosing instead to engage in constructive and forward-looking discussions to tackle emerging challenges.</p>
<p>Asean issued a <a class="link--external" href="https://asean.org/joint-statement-of-the-28th-asean3-finance-ministers-and-central-bank-governors-meeting/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joint statement</a> on Sunday statement following the 28th ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers‚Äô and Central Bank Governors‚Äô Meeting in Milan where it warned that tariffs would have a major impact on trade and economic stability in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEscalating trade protectionism weighs on global trade, leading to economic fragmentation, affecting trade, investment and capital flows across the region,‚Äù Asean said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNear-term prospects may also be affected by other external risks, including tighter global financial conditions, growth slowdown in major trading partners, and reduced investment flows,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The bloc called for ‚Äúenhanced regional unity and cooperation‚Äù amid growing economic uncertainty and said it would prioritise maintaining resilience while remaining flexible enough to respond to near-term challenges.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn the fiscal front, this means rebuilding policy buffers while continuing to provide well-targeted support to sustain growth while implementing structural reforms,‚Äù the statement read. ‚ÄúWe will also carefully recalibrate monetary policy based on domestic conditions.‚Äù</p>
<p>The bloc reaffirmed its commitment to multilateralism and a ‚Äúrules-based, non-discriminatory, free, fair, open, inclusive, equitable, and transparent multilateral trading system‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe urge international organisations to uphold multilateralism and promote free trade, analyse and monitor the potential impact of trade tensions on the global economy, and support their members in providing policy advice to manage the negative shocks that may arise.‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs tariffs are increasingly clogging up the wheels of a world economy which for decades was greased by predictable and relatively free trade.</p>
<p>Big-name multinationals, right down to niche e-commerce players, last week cut sales targets, warned of job cuts and reviewed their business plans, while major economies revised down growth prospects amid bleak data read-outs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUS tariff policy is a serious negative shock for the world in the near term,‚Äù said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, group chief economist at French bank BNP Paribas.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe US tariffs end-game may be further away and at a higher level than previously thought,‚Äù she said of blanket US tariffs, currently set at a baseline of 10pc.</p></p>
