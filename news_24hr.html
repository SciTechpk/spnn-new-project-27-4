            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925665/senate-elections-arrangement-comes-through-as-pti-wins-6-and-opposition-bags-5-seats-in-kp' target='_blank'><strong>Senate elections: arrangement comes through as PTI wins 6 and opposition bags 5 seats in KP</strong></a>
            <p><p>The seat-adjustment arrangement between the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and opposition arrangement came through in the Senate elections in the province on Monday — with the treasury winning six and the opposition bagging five seats, according to unofficial results.</p>
<p>The treasury and the joint opposition alliance had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925325">agreed</a> on a seat-sharing formula under which six seats would go to the treasury, which has 92 members in the KP Assembly, and five seats to the opposition, which is 53-strong.</p>
<p>On Sunday, it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925557">emerged</a> that what initially shaped up to be a three-way contest — among PTI, PTI “dissidents” and opposition lawmakers — turned out to be almost a two-way match after the size of PTI’s “disgruntled” faction was effectively reduced to just one candidate.</p>
<p>PTI’s Murad Saeed, Faisal Javed, Mirza Afridi and Noorul Haq Qadri were elected as senators on general seats, according to the unofficial results.</p>
<p>Murad Saeed received 26 votes, Mirza Afridi and Faisal Javed both bagged 22, and Noor-ul-Haq Qadri 21.</p>
<p>PTI’s Azam Swati was elected on a technocrat seat with 89 votes. Similarly, PTI’s Rubina Naz became a senator on a women’s seat with 89 votes.</p>
<p>Federal Minister for Gilgit Baltistan and Kashmir Affairs and States and Frontier Regions Amir Muqam’s son Niaz Ahmed reached the upper house by with 18 votes on a general seat.</p>
<p>PPP’s Talha Mehmood bagged a Senate seat with 18 votes. PPP’s Rubina Khalid was elected as a senator on women’s seat with 52 votes.</p>
<p>JUI-F’s Attaul Haq won on a general seat and the party’s Dilawar Khan on a technocrat seat to become members of the upper house with 18 and 54 votes, respectively.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Twenty-five MPAs-elect of the KP opposition were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925431">sworn</a> into office after KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi administered their oaths.</p>
<p>The oath-taking issue has risen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1831068">once again</a> after the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925091/ptis-senate-poll-campaign-beset-by-political-wrangling">redistribution</a> of reserved seats in the wake of a verdict by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench that effectively took away the seats from the PTI and declared other political parties eligible for them.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) finally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922230">announced</a> the schedule for the long-overdue Senate elections in KP, setting July 21 as the polling date.</p>
<p>The much-delayed but suspenseful exercise saw elections on 11 seats — seven general and two each reserved for women, ulema and technocrats.</p>
<p>Currently, the ruling coalition has 54 members in the 96-member Senate — 10 short of the two-thirds majority (64 seats).</p>
<p>A separate election for the seat vacated by Senator Sania Nishtar is scheduled for July 31.</p>
<p>According to an ECP statement, the Senate elections in KP were delayed due to an incomplete electoral college. The schedule was announced two days after 25 reserved seats — originally allocated to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — were redistributed among parties, including PML-N, PPP, JUI-F, PTI-P and ANP.</p>
<p>The elections were earlier postponed in April 2024, exacerbating political uncertainty in the province. Polling for another Senate seat — vacated after the death of Professor Sajid Mir — will also take place on July 21.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925569">by-election</a> on a vacant Senate seat in Punjab was won by PML-N’s Hafiz Abdul Kareem with 243 votes, according to official results from the ECP.</p>
<p>The PML-N had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913415">nominated</a> the emir of the Markazi Jamiat Ahle Hadith, as its candidate for the seat, which fell vacant after the demise of Professor Mir.</p>
<p>The total available votes were 368, with 345 polled votes, of which valid votes were 342, while three were rejected.</p>
<p>In a speech after his victory, Kareem thanked God and mentioned that he was grateful to PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif</p>
<p>“I thank Mian Nawaz Sharif, who always remained loyal to Jamiat Ahle Hadith,” Kareem said.</p>
<p>He added that he was also deeply grateful to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, whom he credited for his victory.</p>
<p>“She left work in the flood-affected areas and cast her vote for me,” Kareem said.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday issued contempt notices to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and other members of the federal cabinet for failing to submit a response in the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui.</p>
<p>Dr Aafia Siddiqui, a neuroscientist and educator, was convicted by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on charges of attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan and has been serving her <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924527">sentence</a> at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Carswell in the US since 2010.</p>
<p>On July 12, the IHC expr­essed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923643">dissatisfaction</a> over the federal government’s failure to submit a report in the case concerning Aafia’s release, health and repatriation, with Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq threatening to “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923643">summon the entire cabinet</a>” if the report is not presented.</p>
<p>Justice Ishaq presided over a hearing for the case today. The judge said in his court order that he had warned the additional attorney general while passing his previous ruling that further inaction on the part of the government would lead to the issuance of a contempt notice.</p>
<p>“The government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924527">filed an appeal</a> before the Supreme Court against my earlier decision permitting amendments to the petition for continuation of this case,” the order read. “For whatever reason, the government’s case had not been taken up by the Supreme Court.”</p>
<p>The judge said that since the government had not responded with the reasons despite being directed to do so, it was in contempt, leaving him with no option but to issue a notice of contempt to the federal government.</p>
<p>“Office is directed to initiate a contempt petition accordingly, in which all the members of the federal government will be respondents. The replies of all the ministers, including the prime minister, shall be filed within two weeks from today,” the order said.</p>
<p>At the outset of his order, the judge said: “Ever since the demolition squad was catapulted into this high court after the 26th Constitutional Amendment, we have seen one heresy after another hurled at the edifice of justice, maiming it repeatedly and bringing it almost to its last breaths. This is yet another instance. The heresy I speak of now is besieging the dispensation of justice by a judge of the high court by the device of the ‘weekly roster’ controlled by the office of the chief justice. It is both heart-rending and amusing at the same time, a blend of paradox that this high court has become.”</p>
<p>Criticising the government’s actions during the current case, he said, “The machinations of the executive appeared elsewhere, in the form of controlling the proceedings of this court through its roster.”</p>
<p>The judge noted that he was supposed to be on leave this week, but was informed that the cause list would not be issued without the leave of the chief justice, to which he submitted an application. He added that he was informed on Saturday that the chief justice did not sign it.</p>
<p>“I was informed on Saturday that the application was duly moved but the file remained on the table of the chief justice, who did not find even 30 seconds to sign it. Whether that was by design or oversight, I cannot say for sure, but given the manner in which the roster of judges has been used as a tool for the desired outcome in specific cases, and given the government’s stiff opposition to do what is right and to stand by the daughter of the nation at the critical juncture of the motion before a US court, I may be forgiven for thinking that it was the former. The correct legal position is that the office cannot use the shoulder of the chief justice in the exercise of administrative powers to obstruct judicial proceedings ordered by a judge in an ongoing case.”</p>
<p>Justice Ishaq called it “yet another instance of the reproachable use of the administrative power to shackle the exercise of independent judicial authority”, stating that the government’s response, with reasons as to why it would not sign the [amicus brief][4] in the case, would likely be delayed until his leave ended.</p>
<p>“However, the imperatives of justice shall not be defeated by such petty means. To the extent I can, I will exercise my judicial authority to the end of upholding the dignity of the high court and the justice it dispenses.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#the-hearing" id="the-hearing" title="Permalink"></a>The hearing</h2>
<p>Lawyer Imran Shafiq appeared in court on behalf of the petitioner, Dr Fowzia Siddiqui. Former senator Mushtaq Ahmed was also present at the court.</p>
<p>Justice Ishaq echoed his discontent with how the hearing had been scheduled for today, despite his being on leave. “Even if a judge wants to, they cannot work during holidays,” he remarked.</p>
<p>“My holidays were supposed to start today. Once again, administrative power has been used for judicial power.”</p>
<p>The judge added that he still heard the case because of its nature and importance.</p>
<p>“The government has filed an appeal against my decision in the Supreme Court,” the judge said.</p>
<p>Shafiq noted that if the government had to take a stay, “they would have formed a new bench by now”.</p>
<p>“We know how the court functions. Your order is there, the case is being heard today,” he added, addressing the judge.</p>
<p>When asked why Shafiq had not filed his case with the Supreme Court, he replied, “Because Justice Mansoor Ali Shah is there.”</p>
<p>“The case will only be filed when the roster of judges changes,” Shafiq added.</p>
<p>“The court has no other option but to issue contempt notices to the federal government,” Justice Ishaq ruled.</p>
<p>He stated that the next hearing of the case would be held on the first working day after he returned from leave.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666/monsoon-rains-in-punjab-to-continue-until-july-25-pdma' target='_blank'><strong>Monsoon rains in Punjab to continue until July 25: PDMA</strong></a>
            <p><p>A spokesperson for the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Monday said that there will be more monsoon rains in the province until July 25, according to a statement.</p>
<p>According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the Malakand and Hazara divisions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the southern parts of Punjab and Sindh, eastern Balochistan and parts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) were expected to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925556">receive</a> rain and thunderstorms with strong winds.</p>
<p>Rain and thunderstorms were forecast for urban centres of Punjab in the south, such as Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur and Dera Ghazi Khan, though overall weather of the province was expected to remain partly cloudy and humid.</p>
<p>According to the PDMA, Punjab will receive a fourth wave of monsoon rains until July 25, which the authority says is “slightly more powerful”.</p>
<p>“Rain has been forecast in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiat, Attock, Chakwal, Mandi Bahauddin, Hafizabad, Gujarat, Jhelum and Gujranwala,” the statement read. “Rain is also expected in Lahore, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Narowal, Toba Tek Singh, Jhang, Sargodha and Mianwali,” its statement read.</p>
<p>“Rain is also predicted in Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar and Multan.”</p>
<p>PDMA Punjab Director General Irfan Ali Kathia announced that due to the heavy rain, there is a high possibility of increased water flow in rivers.</p>
<p>“A flood alert has been issued for rivers and canals in Punjab,” the statement quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>The PDMA warned that there is a possibility of increased flow in the Ravi, Jhelum, Sutlej and Chenab rivers, while stating that water flow in the Indus River was measured at 420,000 cusecs at the Taunsa barrage.</p>
<p>The Flood Forecasting Division showed that by 6pm, water flow at the Taunsa barrage stood at 383,456 cusecs.</p>

        <figcaption class="media__caption  ">A screenshot from the Flood Forecasting Division shows water flows in rivers. — FFD</figcaption>
    </figure></p>
<p>“In the Indus River, there is a low-level flood at Tarbela, Kala Bagh and Chashma,” the PDMA said.</p>
<p>The PDMA DG said that on the instructions of the Punjab chief minister, an alert has been issued to all administrations across the province.</p>
<p>“Deputy commissioners have been instructed to remain in the field, while Section 144 should be imposed along the banks of rivers and canals,” Kathia said, instructing police to increase patrols along waterways.</p>
<p>The DG added: “All relevant departments, including Wasa, Rescue 1122 and district administrations, should be on alert. The drainage of standing water from low-lying areas must be ensured, as must the deployment of machinery and staff at choke points.”</p>
<p>Kathia further ordered that disposal stations be kept functional, while urging people in private housing to ensure adequate drainage. He warned that those unable to ensure drainage would face action.</p>
<p>He also urged the public to take precautionary measures amid heavy rain, such as keeping away from electric pylons and appliances during a storm and to avoid houses made from mud or in dilapidated condition.</p>
<p>So far, 123 people have been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925094">killed</a> and 462 injured since June 25 as the province received record rainfall, triggering urban flooding which inundated residential areas, the PDMA said last week. Of these, 71 deaths were reported in the past two days alone.</p></p>
