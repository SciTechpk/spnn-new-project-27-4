            <p><p>• Heavy rainfall exposes Lahore’s drainage system; city struggles with flooding, power outages<br />
• KKH reopens for traffic but heatwave persists in GB; glacial melting, floods cause severe damage</p>
<p>LAHORE / GILGIT: At least 11 people lost their lives and many others sustained injuries as heavy monsoon rains lashed Lahore, its surrounding districts and some parts of Balochistan on Wednesday. The downpours caused widespread flooding and disrupted daily life in several areas.</p>
<p>In Lahore, the heavy rainfall submerged low-lying areas and major roads, exposing the city’s inadequate drainage infrastructure.</p>
<p>According to data from the Water and Sanitation Agency’s (Wasa) Monsoon Control Room, Lahore received an average of 58.8mm of rain, with some areas like Nishtar Town recording the highest 84mm, followed by Lakshmi Chowk (78mm) and Paniwala Talab (74mm).</p>
<p>The first spell of rain lashed the city from 2:45am to 5:40am, with a second, more intense downpour hitting between 10:45am and 12:11pm.</p>
<p>The heavy showers exposed the weaknesses in Lahore’s drainage system, with key areas such as Jail Road (63mm), Qurtaba Chowk (68mm) and Wasa Head Office in Gulberg (69mm) experiencing severe water accumulation. The rainwater mixed with sewage, creating a public health crisis as residents struggled to navigate flooded streets.</p>

<p>At Yakki Gate, a child was electrocuted by exposed wiring, while multiple Lesco feeders tripped across the city, leaving thousands without electricity for hours.</p>
<p>“We’ve been without power since the morning and the stagnant water is making it impossible to leave our homes,” said Rukhsana Bibi, a resident of Mughalpura, which received 60mm of rain.</p>
<p>Residents of Barki Road also faced immense difficulties in travelling. They complained that no machinery was sent to clear the water from the roads and streets until evening, with the Wasa and district administration focusing efforts on draining water only from “elite” areas.</p>
<p>Despite claims from the Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) about deploying cleaning teams and clearing over 6,000 waste containers, citizens reported minimal improvements on the ground.</p>
<p>“The main roads are still submerged, and no one from the administration is here to help,” said Asif Mahmood, a shopkeeper at Lakshmi Chowk.</p>
<p>The situation was particularly dire in low-lying areas like Farrukhabad (49mm) and Johar Town (39mm), where drainage systems were virtually non-existent.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains also affected several other districts across Punjab in the last 24 hours. Khanewal recorded 51mm, Rawalpindi 42mm, Sahiwal 44mm, Murree 41mm, Okara 30mm, Mandi Bahauddin 27mm, Mangla 24mm, and Toba Tek Singh 13mm.</p>
<p>Other regions like Gujranwala, Bahawalpur, Gujrat, Kasur, Bahawalnagar, Sargodha, Multan and Jhang also experienced downpours.</p>
<p><strong>Deaths and injuries</strong></p>
<p>According to Rescue 1122, nine people lost their lives and many others were injured in rain-related incidents across the province.</p>
<p>Two children died when the roof of their house collapsed due to the rain in Sheikhupura. Rescue teams also retrieved four people trapped under the rubble of a collapsed house in Pakpattan. In Jhelum valley, a cloudburst caused severe damage to houses and vehicles, while roads were destroyed.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast more intense rainfall over the next 24 hours in Lahore and much of Punjab.</p>
<p>Irfan Ali Kathia, director general of Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), said the rains are expected to continue until July 13. Thunderstorms are likely on Thursday in Jhelum, Mandi Bahauddin, Sialkot, Narowal, Gujarat, Lahore and Hafizabad. The Punjab government has also imposed Section 144 around rivers and canals.</p>
<p>According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), water levels are expected to rise in the Kabul, Indus, Chenab and Jhelum rivers, with low-level flooding likely at Tarbela, Kalabagh, Chashma and Taunsa along the Indus.</p>
<p>Low-level flooding is also feared in Marala and Khanki on the Chenab River, and at Mangla on the Jhelum River. Tributaries of the Swat and Panjkora rivers may also experience flooding.</p>
<p>Heavy rainfall is expected to cause a significant rise in water flow in the hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur, as well as in local streams in Jhal Magsi, Kachhi, Sibi, Qila Saifullah, Zhob and Musakhel districts in Balochistan.</p>
<p>Two people were killed and another injured in separate rain-related incidents in Balochistan’s Khuzdar and Mastung districts on Wednesday. Heavy rainfall and strong winds caused a wall to collapse in Khuzdar, resulting in the death of a man named Muhammad Arif and injuring Ehsanullah.</p>
<p>In Bolan Colony in the Kanak area of Mastung, a tanker carrying LPG overturned on a person due to slippery roads caused by the rain. The victim, identified as Muhammad Yaqoob, was killed on the spot.</p>
<p><strong>Glacial melting intensifies in GB</strong></p>
<p>The current <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916931">heatwaves</a> have accelerated glacial melting across Gilgit-Baltistan, leading to widespread flooding and soil erosion that have disconnected roads, damaged homes, agriculture and disrupted power and water supplies in various areas.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Rising water levels in rivers and streams have put downstream communities at significant risk. According to the local administration, river erosion has severed links to the Hoper, Hisper and Nagar Khas areas on Thursday, with access roads submerged or washed away.</p>
<p>Flooding from the Supultar Nallah has once again damaged the RCC bridge and agricultural land in Tokorkot, while water from the Hamari Nallah and Supultar Nallah has cut off drinking and irrigation water supplies to most residents in Nagar Khas and Hoper.</p>
<p>The surge of glacial water near the Hamorkhay area has led to continued erosion, endangering homes in nearby villages. In Upper Hunza, rising water levels in the Khunjerab River have caused the destruction of power infrastructure, with two electricity poles submerged, cutting off the electricity supply to several villages in Gojal.</p>
<p>The situation has also affected irrigation and drinking water systems, crops and bridges, leaving the residents of Nagar and Hunza districts without essential services like water, electricity and road access.</p>
<p>In Gilgit, the increasing water levels in the Shigar River have damaged the K2 Road, leaving hundreds of residents and foreign tourists stranded. Officials said the melting Baltoro Glacier had rapidly increased the volume of water in nearby rivers and streams, further exacerbating the situation.</p>
<p>Flash floods in Babusar Valley, Chilas, also caused significant damage, with 10 homes destroyed and crops damaged. The Karakoram Highway, which had been blocked in Chilas, was reopened for traffic on Thursday, allowing thousands of stranded passengers, including tourists, to continue their journeys.</p>
<p>Rising water levels in the Jutal area in Gilgit have damaged homes and farmland, with many people living near rivers facing the imminent threat of flooding. Local officials have warned that the situation remains precarious, with many areas still without power, water and proper access routes.</p>
<p>The Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency (GBEPA) expressed fears of a major water crisis in the region due to climate change, which is causing a decrease in snowfall and rapid melting of glaciers.</p>
<p><strong>Geo-fenced SMS alerts</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jazz and the NDMA have partnered to deliver geo-fenced SMS alerts to millions of citizens in flood-risk areas. The alerts, part of the Disaster Early Warning System (DEW-3), are designed to enhance public awareness and enable timely evacuations or precautionary measures in flood-prone areas.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, more than 23 million Jazz users residing in regions identified as vulnerable by the NDMA will receive location-based alerts, ensuring that citizens are informed of impending flood risks.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923182/lahores-legal-fraternity-moves-sc-against-judges-transfer-to-ihc' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore’s legal fraternity moves SC against judges’ transfer to IHC</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The Lahore High Court Bar Asso­­ciation (LHCBA) and the Lahore Bar Association (LBA) on Wednesday challenged the June 19 constitutional bench <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918159">judgement</a> that upheld transfer of three judges to the Islamabad High Court (IHC).</p>
<p>The two separate but iden­t­ical intra-court appe­als (ICA) were filed before the Supreme Court through senior counsel Hamid Khan and Muhammad Waqar Rana against the June 19 ruling.</p>
<p>The bar associations moved the apex court after five judges of the IHC — Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Jus­tice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920890">challenged</a> the same ruling before the SC on June 28.</p>
<p>In its decision, the constitutional bench, by a three to two majority, had held that the transfer of three judges from three different high courts to the IHC was within the framework of the Constitution. Less than two weeks after the decision, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921132">nominated</a> Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar as the permanent chief justice of the IHC and he was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922849/justice-dogar-3-others-take-oath-as-regular-high-court-cjs">sworn in</a> on July 8.</p>
<p>The fresh ICA requests the SC to set aside the June 19 judgement, arguing that it failed to resolve the key constitutional question regar­ding the requirement of taking an oath before assuming office as a judge of the IHC.</p>
<p>“It is an admitted fact that the transferred judges did not take oath upon their transfer to the IHC; therefore, they cannot legally assume office,” the petition stated. It added that the June 19 ruling was liable to be set aside as it failed to resolve the issue in essence.</p>
<p>The appeal contended that by remanding the matter to President Asif Ali Zardari, the majority judgment of June 19 effectively allowed the executive to rectify legal deficiencies in the Feb 1 notification, thereby facilitating executive to infringe upon the independence of the judiciary. The ruling, it claimed, violated the doctrine of trichotomy of powers.</p>
<p>It further argued that the June 19 order was against the law and all rules of fairness and thus void, without jurisdiction, coram non judice having been passed without lawful authority and thus of no legal effect.</p>
<p>The appellants submitted that all related actions as well as subsequent proceedings of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan regarding the IHC chief justice’s appointment were unconstitutional and must be declared void. The judgment, notifications and appointments were purportedly made in pursuance of the directions given in the judgment, the petition said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>It is an accepted principle of constitutional interpretation that all articles and legal provisions were aggregate formulations incorporating therein constitutional values/principles and structure, the petition said. A constitutional document is to be read as a whole to understand the underlying constitutional values, principles and objectives, it said.</p>
<p>It explained that the independence of the judiciary was a basic feature of the Constitution and must be protected from executive interference, especially in matters of appointment, transfer, and removal of judges. The Supreme Court recognise the independence of the judiciary as one of the basic features of the Constitution, the petition said, adding the appointments, transfer and removal of judges having been provided in different provisions of the Constitution.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923184/authority-to-regulate-crypto-and-digital-assets-formed' target='_blank'><strong>Authority to regulate crypto and digital assets formed</strong></a>
            <p><p>• President signs Virtual Assets Ordinance to establish PVARA<br />
• Official statement causes confusion by terming ordinance an ‘act of parliament’<br />
• Companies must be licensed by authority to offer virtual asset services</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: The government announced on Wednesday that President Zardari had approved the ‘Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025’ to establish an independent regulator for virtual assets and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>However, an official statement  from the office of the state minister referred to it as the ‘Virtual Assets Act, 2025’, leading to confusion and concerns about why the draft law had not been moved to the National Assembly or Senate, as required for a bill to become an act of parliament.</p>
<p>The confusion was clarified later when the authorities confirmed to <em>Dawn</em> that the regulation was not an act of parliament but rather an ordinance, issued under Article 89 of the Constitution. The provision allows the president to issue an ordinance in urgent matters when both houses are not in session; such ordinances remain in effect for 120 days and do not require passage through the National Assembly and Senate.</p>
<p>According to the Gazette of Pakistan dated July 9, 2025, seen by <em>Dawn</em>, the ordinance (No. VII of 2025) was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922661">promulgated</a> on July 8 by the president to establish a regulatory authority for the licensing, regulation and supervision of virtual assets and virtual asset service providers.</p>
<p>Earlier, the SAPM on blockchain and crypto said in a statement that the president “has approved landmark Virtual Assets Act 2025 on the prime minister’s advice”. It added that the government has formally approved the “act” following endorsements from the federal cabinet, the prime minister and the president.</p>
<p>The statement said that the law (ordinance) established “the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regul­atory Authority (PVARA), an autonomous federal body empowered to license, regulate and supervise entities dealing in virtual assets”.</p>
<p>The authority has been granted comprehensive powers to ensure transparency, compliance, financial integrity and the prevention of illicit activities in alignment with international standards, including those of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).</p>
<p>The authority’s board will include key government stakeholders, such as the State Bank’s governor, secretaries of finance, law and justice, and information technology and telecommunications, as well as the chairpersons of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), and the Digital Pakistan Authority.</p>
<p>Two independent directors with expertise in virtual assets, law, finance or technology will also be appointed by the federal government. The board’s chairperson will be chosen based on demonstrated experience in finance, law, technology or regulatory affairs.</p>
<p>Under the ordinance, any person or company intending to offer virtual asset services in or from Pakistan must be licensed by the PVARA. A structured licensing regime will be introduced, with specific requirements for incorporation, operational capacity, compliance frameworks and reporting obligations, the statement added.</p>
<p>“The legislation (ordinance) also incorporates a framework for responsible innovation by establishing a regulatory sandbox, allowing emerging technologies and business models to be tested under supervisory oversight,” it said.</p>
<p>In addition, the authority may issue no-action relief letters under defined conditions to facilitate experimentation while preserving regulatory accountability.</p>
<p>To ensure compatibility with Islamic finance principles, the law mandates the formation of a Sharia Advisory Committee, which will advise PVARA on matters related to the Sharia compliance of virtual asset products and services.</p>
<p>Licensed entities offering Islamic financial products will be bound by the rulings issued by the committee, the statement said, adding that the ordinance “also provides for the establishment of a Virtual Assets Appellate Tribunal to hear appeals against regulatory decisions”.</p>
<p>The tribunal will function with judicial independence and a specialised bench comprising experts in law, finance and technology.</p>
<p>With this forward-looking legislation, Pakistan takes a major step in shaping a secure, inclusive and innovation-friendly digital financial ecosystem, ensuring that technological progress is matched with institutional readiness and public interest safeguards.</p>
<p>This milestone comes less than four months after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897897">launch</a> of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) on March 14, marking the beginning of a new era in the country’s digital finance journey.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb serves as the chairman of the PCC, while Bilal Bin Saqib is its CEO, holding the status of the prime minister’s special assistant and the minister of state.</p>
