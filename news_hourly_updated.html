                <h2>Responsibility of SC judges to speak truth demands courage to defy political pressure: Justice Shah</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Supreme Court (SC) Senior Puisne Judge Mansoor Ali Shah has said that SC justices have a responsibility to ‚Äúspeak truth to power, guided by the Constitution as their unwavering normative anchor‚Äù, in an interview seen by <em>Dawn.com</em> on Monday.</p>
<p>Shah has previously expressed that the judiciary needs to stand against influence or pressure from the executive. In November 2024, he said, ‚ÄúThe independence of the judiciary is the cornerstone of justice, and its true test lies in a judge‚Äôs ability to stand firm under authoritarian regimes.‚Äù</p>
<p>Speaking exclusively to law magazine <em><a class="link--external" href="https://the-legal.org/the-legal-international-13th-issue-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Legal</a></em>, Shah said that the role of SC justices must be understood as that of protectors of the Constitution and fundamental rights rather than as policymakers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúJudges must balance respect for legislative intent with a commitment to constitutional principles, ensuring that the judiciary acts as an impartial arbiter rather than a policymaker,‚Äù he said in response to a question about the role of SC judges amid a shifting legal landscape.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTheir role demands not only legal expertise but also wisdom, courage, and humility, as their decisions profoundly impact individuals and society at large,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt the heart of this role lies a deeper philosophical imperative: judges must speak truth to power, guided by the Constitution as their unwavering normative anchor.‚Äù</p>
<p>Justice Shah noted that this responsibility ‚Äúrequires not compromise but courage to defy political pressures, resist majoritarian impulses, and stand firm in the face of injustice‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet future jurists not be defined by fear or fatigue, but by purpose. Let them carry forward a judiciary that is not complicit in silence, but committed to struggle. The Constitution doesn‚Äôt just need protection it needs protectors,‚Äù he emphasised.</p>
<p>Previously, Shah <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878549">termed</a> the passing of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866452/26th-constitutional-amendment-awaits-presidential-assent-after-sailing-through-na-in-late-night-session">26th Constitutional Amendment</a> ‚Äúone of its (the judiciary‚Äôs) weakest moments in our history‚Äù, expressing concern that executive overreach was interfering in judicial affairs and processes.</p>
<p>In a letter to SC Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail written in December, Shah wrote, ‚ÄúThis unprecedented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1877116">shift</a> in the composition of the JCP (Judicial Commission of Pakistan) poses grave risks, including the potential for political appointments and the packing of courts with judges lacking an ideological commitment to the rule of law.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909718">landmark decision</a> in May, the SC allowed civilians accused in the May 9, 2023 riots ‚Äî triggered by the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan ‚Äî to be tried in military courts, overturning an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783065/may-9-riots-sc-declares-military-trials-of-civilians-null-and-void">earlier ruling</a> that declared military trials of civilians null and void.</p>
<p>However, the decision was not unanimous ‚Äî the two dissenting judges, Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Naeem Akhtar Afghan ‚Äî declared military court convictions ‚Äúwithout jurisdiction‚Äù and unconstitutional. Rights groups and leaders of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) have likewise decried the ruling, citing concerns over due process.</p>
<p>The legal fraternity weighed in too, warning that the judgment threatened the right to a fair trial and chipped away at civilian justice system.</p></p>

                <h2>Man convicted for desecrating Holy Quran outside London‚Äôs Turkish consulate</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A man who desecrated a copy of the Holy Quran outside the Turkish consulate in London was found guilty on Monday of committing a religiously aggravated public order offence, in a verdict critics said effectively reinstated an abolished blasphemy law.</p>
<p>Hamit Coskun, 50, was fined 240 pounds ($325) at London‚Äôs Westminster Magistrates‚Äô Court after being convicted of being disorderly by shouting ‚ÄúF*** Islam‚Äù as he held aloft the burning book near the consulate in central London in February.</p>
<p>The lawyer for Coskun, whose father was Kurdish and his mother Armenian and who lived in central England, had argued that the prosecution amounted to an attempt to bring back a blasphemy law that was abolished in England in 2008.</p>
<p>Coskun had denied the charge and said on social media he was carrying out a protest against the Turkish government. While he was holding the book aloft, he was attacked by a man with a knife who kicked and spat at him.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBurning a religious book, although offensive, to some is not necessarily disorderly,‚Äù said Judge John McGarva.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat made his conduct disorderly was the timing and location of the conduct and that all this was accompanied by abusive language. There was no need for him to use the ‚ÄòF word‚Äô and direct it towards Islam.‚Äù</p>
<p>He was motivated by ‚Äúhostility towards members of a religious group, namely followers of Islam‚Äù, McGarva said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYour actions in burning the Quran where you did were highly provocative, and your actions were accompanied by bad language in some cases directed toward the religion and were motivated at least in part by hatred of followers of the religion,‚Äù said the judge.</p>
<p>State prosecutors insisted Coskun was not being prosecuted for burning the book.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe is being prosecuted for his disorderly behaviour in public,‚Äù said Philip McGhee, for the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>
<p>The National Secular Society (NSS), which helped pay his legal fees, said the prosecution was ‚Äúa significant blow to freedom of expression‚Äù, a sentiment echoed by the main opposition Conservative Party.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBritain has no blasphemy laws. Yet this verdict creates one de facto,‚Äù the party <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/Conservatives/status/1929558585349951809?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on X.</p>
<p>‚ÄúParliament never voted for it. The British people do not want it. This decision is wrong.‚Äù</p>
