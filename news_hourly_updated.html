                <h2>CM Murad notes faint tremors ‚Äògood thing‚Äô as seismic activity continues in Karachi</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Tuesday said low-intensity tremors helped prevent major earthquakes as he attempted to allay <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915165/sindh-ig-says-78-of-213-escaped-prisoners-from-karachis-malir-jail-recaptured">panic</a> caused by the recent seismic activity that continued for the third day in Karachi.</p>
<p>The metropolis continued to witness faint tremors today, taking the tally since Sunday to 20, according to data provided by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD). Experts have previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say">pointed out</a> that such minor seismic activities ‚Äúpreempt‚Äù high-intensity earthquakes by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have also studied engineering [‚Ä¶] these (low-scale tremors) are a good thing. The earth is releasing its energy,‚Äù CM Shah said, responding to reporters‚Äô queries about yesterday‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915165/sindh-ig-says-78-of-213-escaped-prisoners-from-karachis-malir-jail-recaptured">jail break incident</a> in Karachi.</p>
<p>He explained that if the earth releases its seismic energy altogether, it could result in a major earthquake. ‚ÄúBut if it releases in bits, then it is better ‚Äî nothing is actually better ‚Äî but saves us from a big disaster,‚Äù Murad added.</p>
<p>The most recent tremor occurred at 11:52am and measured 2.0 on the Richter scale, with its <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/WKp4SfRW8Va3WHG36" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">epicentre</a> located 23 kilometres east of Malir, according to the PMD‚Äôs data.</p>
<p>Since Sunday ‚Äî when the series of minor quakes <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914834/karachi-experiences-36-magnitude-quake-with-quaidabad-as-epicentre">began</a> ‚Äî the total of tremors recorded near <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/tWkP5ThpLy3m5iDY6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Malir</a> is nine, five near the Defence Housing Authority, three near <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/f3E8rzVKFY8BwcbR6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quaidabad</a>, along with one each near <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/9jxYCPXSRymYrGTa7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gadap Town</a>, <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rocRpWYWyMR7GGUd9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Korangi</a> and <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/2Us67F7ygbKS7aAT9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DHA City</a> on the outskirts of Karachi.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914834/karachi-experiences-36-magnitude-quake-with-quaidabad-as-epicentre">3.6-magnitude jolt</a> from Sunday evening was the most significant, while the lowest measured was of 2.0 magnitude from today morning.</p>
<p>Karachi Chief Meteorologist Amir Hyder Laghari <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915067">pointed out</a> yesterday that there was a historical fault line which has become activated, causing frequent earthquakes in the city.</p>
<p>He said the fault is releasing its seismic energy, and when it‚Äôs spent, the tremors‚Äô magnitude will reduce. Laghari added he expected the small-scale jolts to end within a week.</p>
<p>Murad‚Äôs remarks today echoed opinions voiced by Laghari and other experts, who have said that the chances of a major quake in Karachi are low.</p>
<p>Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates ‚Äî the Arabian, Eurasian and Indian ‚Äî <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say#:~:text=Tectonic%20positioning">according to</a> geological engineer Muhammad Rehan, creating five seismic zones within the country.</p>
<p>Dr Imran Ahmed Khan of Karachi University‚Äôs Department of Geography said an imbalance between the Indian, Eurasian and Arabian plates may be causing the tremors in the city. He added that the quakes will likely stop when a balance between the plates has been achieved.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Dr Adnan Khan, associate professor at the KU‚Äôs Department of Geology, noted that a huge earthquake was unlikely in Karachi as the city was situated far from active plate boundaries.</p>
<p>‚ÄúKarachi lies on what‚Äôs called a ‚Äòpassive margin‚Äô, so the chances of a big earthquake happening there are low. Small earthquakes do happen sometimes, usually between 3 and 4 on the Richter scale, but they are not dangerous,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Dr Imran explained that the Indian tectonic plate is moving upward by about 4 to 5 centimetres every year in the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Eurasian plate is pushing against it. As these two plates press against each other, they build up pressure, and when the pressure becomes too much, it rebounds and is released as energy, causing earthquakes.</p>
<p>The country had witnessed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say">around 20</a> low-intensity earthquakes in the first half of February ‚Äî an average of more than one tremor each day.</p>
<p>In April, jolts were felt in parts of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905258">Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab</a> ‚Äî including Peshawar, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore ‚Äî <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903840">twice</a> that month.</p></p>

            </a>
            <p><p>The Islamabad Police said on Tuesday they had arrested the main suspect in the murder case of 17-year-old social media influencer Sana Yousaf, a day after she was shot dead in her house.</p>
<p>A first information report (FIR) had been filed yesterday evening at the Sumbal police station against an unidentified man on the complaint of Sana‚Äôs mother, Farzana Yousaf, invoking <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/1860/actXLVof1860.html#:~:text=Punishment%20of%20qatl%2Di%2Damd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Section 302</a> (intentional murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).</p>
<p>The teenager was well-known for her social media activities, with nearly 800,000 followers on her <a class="link--external" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sanayousaf11" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TikTok</a> account and almost 500,000 on her <a class="link--external" href="https://www.instagram.com/sanayousaf22/?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a> account.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference, Islamabad Inspector General (IG) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi said the culprit was a 22-year-old man arrested from Faisalabad and termed it a case of ‚Äúrepeated rejections‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA beast, cold-blooded murderer is now in the law‚Äôs grip,‚Äù IG Rizvi announced, adding that the man had tried to contact Sana repeatedly and was being ‚Äúrejected by her again and again‚Äù.</p>

<p>The police chief said the culprit wanted to establish contact with the social media influencer and ‚Äúbecome friends‚Äù with her.</p>
<p>IG Rizvi described the man as having done matriculation and hailing from a lower-middle-income family, with ‚Äúno source of income‚Äù.</p>
<p>The IG highlighted that the police conducted 11 raids ‚Äî three in the federal capital and the rest in various cities of Punjab, with multiple raids in the Faisalabad district.</p>
<p>He detailed that the suspect had taken Sana‚Äôs mobile phone in a bid to wipe out the evidence but it had been recovered, along with the weapon of offence.</p>
<p>IG Rizvi noted that the man had ‚Äútried his best to contact‚Äù Sana on her birthday on May 29. ‚ÄúHe reached her home and tried to meet her for seven to eight hours but failed.‚Äù</p>
<p>The officer added that yesterday, the culprit made another similar attempt for the same amount of time but could not succeed. ‚ÄúFirst, it was a cellular rejection. Now, it was a physical mode of rejection.‚Äù</p>
<p>Rizvi asserted it was ‚Äúnecessary to give a clear message that if any of our sister or daughter or youngster is becoming a social media influencer, and pursuing it as a profession, [‚Ä¶] as a hobby and even as their bread and butter, we have to encourage it‚Äù.</p>

<p>The Islamabad police chief termed the murder a ‚Äúvery challenging case‚Äù, stressing that arresting the perpetrator in the ‚Äúshortest time possible was necessary‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was a blind murder; there was no clue, things were not clear, and it was further attempted to give it another angle, even though the aim of taking the mobile was to wipe out the clues,‚Äù he said, listing the hurdles faced by the police.</p>
<p>IG Rizvi appreciated members of the social, electronic and print media, stating that ‚Äúmany leads‚Äù came from journalists, who ‚Äúoffered their services in analysing social media‚Äù.</p>
<p>He also hailed seven police teams, as well as officials of the Crime Investigation Agency, for their efforts.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed the arrest in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MohsinnaqviC42/status/1929812722423640136" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe incident occurred yesterday in Islamabad when a young girl was murdered by a masked accused,‚Äù the minister said, adding that the suspect was arrested at around 12pm.</p>
<p>Naqvi stated that the police have recovered the murder weapon and pistol from the man, as well as the mobile phone used by the slain girl. The suspect has confessed to the murder, he added.</p>

<p>In the FIR, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, the mother said that a man with a pistol in his hand entered their house suddenly at around 5pm and ‚Äúshot straight at my daughter with the intention to kill‚Äù.</p>
<p>She added that two shots struck Sana in her chest, injuring her severely. The girl was taken to a hospital but she had succumbed to her wounds, the FIR added.</p>
<p>The mother described the suspect as having a ‚Äúsmart appearance, moderate physique and height‚Äù, and dressed in a black shirt and pants. She asserted that she and her sister-in-law, Lateefa Shah, were eyewitnesses to the incident and could identify the suspect if they saw him in person.</p>
<p>Farzana detailed that her 15-year-old son was not present at the house as he had gone to their native village in Upper Chitral, while her sister-in-law was visiting them for a few days.</p>
