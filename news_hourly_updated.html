                <h2>Finance Bill sails through parliament to greenlight Rs17.57tr budget</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Finance Bill, 2025, was approved by parliament on Thursday, meaning that the Rs17.57 trillion budget for the coming fiscal year has been greenlit.</p>
<p>The PPP on Wednesday voiced strong reservations over a set of politically unpopular provisions in the federal budget for the next fiscal year, urging the government to amend ‚Äúcontentious‚Äù clauses ahead of its expected approval in the National Assembly today (Thursday).</p>
<p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb‚Äôs amendments to various legislation, including the Income Tax Ordnance, 2001, were all approved, while opposition amendments were rejected, according to a <em>Dawn.com</em> correspondent.</p>
<p>The bill was read out in the assembly and approved clause by clause. The session has been adjourned until 11am tomorrow.</p>

<p>Addressing the House, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said his party would ‚Äúhappily support the budget,‚Äù since the government had accepted the party‚Äôs proposals.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe appreciate the government‚Äôs efforts as BISP‚Äôs (Benazir Income Support Programme) budget has been increased,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMoreover, the salaried class will not be taxed if their income equals to Rs1.2m per year and the solar tax has been reduced by 50 per cent.‚Äù</p>
<p>Bilawal added that after the PPP‚Äôs initial rejection, their recommendations regarding the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) were accepted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are grateful to the government and the prime minister for accepting our proposals,‚Äù Bilawal said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, amendments to the Sales Tax Act, 1990, presented by Aurangzeb were approved by a majority vote in the House.</p>
<p>The amendment granted the finance committee powers to arrest traders involved in tax fraud exceeding Rs50 million. The federal government had earlier proposed an amendment to give the powers of arrest to the tax commissioner.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe FBR will not have the power of arrest during the investigation stage,‚Äù the amendment added.</p>
<p>All amendments introduced by the opposition in the Sales Tax Act were rejected by majority vote.</p>
<p>Similarly, an amendment to the Salaries and Allowances Act was presented with the support of the finance minister, according to which ministers and ministers of state will receive the same salary as members of parliament.</p>
<p>The amendment was approved by a majority vote.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#107-institutions-granted-tax-exempt-status" id="107-institutions-granted-tax-exempt-status" title="Permalink"></a>107 institutions granted tax-exempt status</h2>
<p>During the session, 107 entities‚Äî including lawyers‚Äô bodies, hospitals and government projects ‚Äî were granted tax-exempt status as part of amendments to the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001.</p>
<p>The finance minister‚Äôs amendments were all approved, while those presented by the opposition were rejected.</p>
<p>According to the amendments, the following institutions and organisations are exempt from tax:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provincial bar councils</li>
<li>Pakistan Bar Council</li>
<li>The Military Foundation</li>
<li>Army Welfare Trust</li>
<li>Foundation University</li>
<li>Forman Christian College</li>

<li>National Endowment Scholarship</li>
<li>Pakistan Agricultural Research Council</li>
<li>Audit Oversight Board</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the amended ordinance, the pensions of former presidents and their widows will also be tax-exempt.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Aurangzeb unveiled Pakistan‚Äôs annual <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292">federal budget</a> in a charged National Assembly session, outlining ambitious proposals to drive 4.2 per cent economic growth in the coming fiscal year while cutting back on overall spending and tightening tax measures.</p>
<p>The federal budget for fiscal year 2026 has a total outlay ‚Äî the sum of expenditures and net lending of funds ‚Äî of Rs17.573 trillion, representing a 6.9 per cent decrease from the previous year‚Äôs budget.</p>
<p>The government has proposed Rs16,286bn for current expenditure in the FY26 budget, a 5.33pc decrease from the previous year.</p>

                <h2>Muharram to begin from tomorrow as moon sighted, Ashura to fall on July 6</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee on Thursday announced that the Muharram moon has been sighted in the country, hence the first of Muharram will fall on June 27 (Friday).</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Ashura ‚Äî Muharram 10 ‚Äî will be observed on  July 6 (Sunday).</p>
<p>Muharram is the first month of the Islamic calendar. It is also a month of mourning, observed in particular by Shia Muslims worldwide, commemorating the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD, where, amongst many, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), Imam Husain, was martyred, and other family members were martyred or subjected to humiliation.</p>
<p>A notification by The Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com,</em> said, ‚ÄúIn pursuance of the decision of the Central Ruet-e-Hilal Committee, in its meeting held today at Quetta, the Federal Government in the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Islamabad, hereby announces that the moon of Muharram-ul- haram 1447 AH has been sighted.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúTherefore, the 1st Muharram-ul-haram 1447 AH, shall commence from Friday, June 27 2025,‚Äù it added.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, the Ministry of Interior announced that it planned to take strict action against elements spreading religious hate on social media as part of a security plan ahead of the month of Muharram.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920266/interior-ministry-vows-to-take-strict-action-against-religious-hate-online-during-muharram">statement</a> from the ministry today, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi chaired a meeting aimed at reviewing the security plan for the month.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was decided that action will be taken against elements inciting religious hatred on social media in light of Muharram,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn this regard, PEMRA (Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority) has been instructed to monitor hateful content on electronic and social media.‚Äù</p>
<p>The meeting reviewed the security plan for Muharram in all provinces, including Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Islamabad, in detail, planning to take necessary administrative measures to ensure a peaceful Muharram across the country.</p>
<p>Naqvi promised to cooperate on all possible fronts to ensure peace, particularly in AJK, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad.</p>
<p>On the matter of internet and mobile phone service being suspended during processions, the meeting detailed that the decision will be taken in consultation with each province, keeping in view the security situation of each respective province.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll the necessary steps and decisions will be taken with the mutual consultation,‚Äù the minister said, warning that no one would be allowed to incite religious hatred or provocation.</p></p>
