                <h2>PTI shows willingness to talk but demands ‚Äòaccountability‚Äô from institutions</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Saturday called on state institutions to engage in dialogue with the PTI, but demanded that they hold themselves accountable.</p>
<p>Gandapur and the PTI‚Äôs top leadership are on a visit to Lahore to formally launch a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923856/pti-brass-gathers-in-lahore-to-kick-start-aug-5-movement">movement</a> to seek the release of party founder Imran Khan and devise a strategy for its nationwide protest, which will reach its crescendo on August 5 ‚Äî marking two years since the ex-premier was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a>.</p>
<p>Since Imran‚Äôs incarceration in several cases, which he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1890696#:~:text=He%20claimed%20that%20four%20convictions%20against%20him%20were%20politically%20motivated">claims</a> are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1843176">politically motivated</a>, his party‚Äôs relationship with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880551">government</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832432">establishment</a> has turned exceedingly sour. The PTI has held several protests over the last year, most of which escalated into <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1857709">violence</a> after facing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875003/day-of-clashes-in-islamabad-ends-in-pti-protesters-retreat">state repression</a>.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference flanked by PTI‚Äôs Punjab leadership, CM Gandapur said: ‚ÄúWe have to correct our institutions ourselves. Come, sit together, own your mistakes and move forward.‚Äù</p>
<p>He recalled that Imran, despite his wife also being imprisoned in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831">graft case</a>, had repeatedly said he was ready to talk for the sake of the country.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>Imran was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">jailed</a> on Aug 5, 2023 in a case related to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878307/imran-khan-bushra-bibi-indicted-in-new-toshakhana-case">state gifts</a>, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831">¬£190 million graft case</a> and faces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845818">pending trials</a> related to the May 9, 2023 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">riots</a>.</p>
<p>In the wake of the nationwide May 9 protests, which saw important <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">military installations</a> come under attack, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753589">thousands</a> of PTI workers and almost the entire <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1774736">top-tier leadership</a> were rounded up, with many still facing court proceedings under serious <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891122/five-pti-leaders-16-activists-indicted-in-another-may-9-case">charges</a>.</p>
<p>The military considers the PTI the ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832432">planners and architects</a>‚Äù of the May 9 riots and has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832048">demanded</a> an apology from Imran, who in turn <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850002/imran-puts-onus-of-apology-on-army-for-his-detention">claimed</a> that the army owes an apology to him since he was ‚Äúabducted‚Äù by the Rangers on May 9. However, days later, he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850840">offered to apologise</a> on the condition that the involvement of PTI supporters in the violent protests was proved through CCTV evidence.</p>
<p>At today‚Äôs press conference, Gandapur was accompanied by PTI Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja, Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar, KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati and MNA Latif Khosa.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCome and talk, acknowledge and correct your mistakes,‚Äù Gandapur reiterated today, noting that it was everyone‚Äôs collective responsibility to think about Pakistan‚Äôs future.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe state institutions, whose duty is not to engage in politics, are playing every role in forming, running and overthrowing governments,‚Äù the PTI leader alleged. ‚ÄúAnd when you ask, they reply with delight that ‚Äòwe are non-political‚Äô.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Gandapur, stressing that he was a soldier‚Äôs son and brother, said: ‚ÄúMy military is being defamed due to a few wrong people and their decisions.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe state institutions have ignored their duties which are stated in the Constitution and are instead doing other work, due to which terrorism has [risen] in the country,‚Äù he said, adding that the security situation in KP and Balochistan had worsened because ‚Äúthose responsible for guarding the borders were chasing the PTI instead‚Äù.</p>
<p>The KP CM quipped: ‚ÄúWhere are those who imposed martial laws? They are not in Pakistan today. Who is suffering? My Pakistanis.‚Äù</p>
<p>The chief minister called for a dialogue ‚Äúbased on reasons‚Äù, saying he was ready to be punished severely if it was proven that he ‚Äúconspired‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhoever‚Äôs mistake there is, they will admit it [‚Ä¶] we are ready if they punish us, but if the matter comes to punishment, then every person [responsible] will be punished.‚Äù</p>
<p>Asked if the PTI would hold a dialogue with the military establishment or politicians, Gandapur said that decision was up to Imran, noting he has previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891813">stated</a> that talks must be held with ‚Äúdecision-makers‚Äù but there was no objection to government officials being included in the process.</p>
<p>The PTI leader urged ‚Äúthose who are the beneficiaries of this system and those who have hijacked it‚Äù to hold talks, stressing that they are ‚Äúanswerable‚Äù and ‚Äúmust bear the burden‚Äù for the country‚Äôs economic situation and heightened terrorism.</p>
<p>Gandapur also assailed the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866652/president-zardari-gives-assent-to-26th-constitutional-amendment">26th Amendment</a> passed in October last year, saying the judiciary had been ‚Äúhandcuffed‚Äù through it.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Gandapur called on the political parties in the ruling coalition to go into the public, which he said had ‚Äúrejected‚Äù them.</p>
<p>He cautioned that those parties will then face the consequences later on of the ‚Äúculture‚Äù they had developed. Addressing their supporters, he said, ‚ÄúThey (leaders of other political parties) will flee abroad. You have to stay here.‚Äù</p>
<p>He asked if it was ‚Äúright as a human and a Muslim‚Äù if a PTI leader‚Äôs home was raided and their privacy was violated. ‚ÄúIf you are silent on this, then if this happens to you tomorrow, then no one will raise a voice for you either.‚Äù</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#90-days-to-decide-whether-to-continue-politics" id="90-days-to-decide-whether-to-continue-politics" title="Permalink"></a>‚Äò90 days to decide whether to continue politics‚Äô</h2>
<p>Speaking about the PTI‚Äôs new movement, Gandapur referred to a ‚Äú90-day announcement‚Äù made yesterday by his party, saying that they had begun from today.</p>
<p>He said the PTI has given itself 90 days to decide on its future. He detailed: ‚ÄúOn August 5, we will take the movement to its peak through political means while following the laws and the Constitution.</p>
<p>‚Äú[‚Ä¶] We have set our targets that we have to decide within 90 days whether we should even do politics in this country [‚Ä¶] if politics do not lead to a result, then we will let you know about our plan of action that will come forward.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äú<em>Hum aar ya paar karein gain</em> (We will either do or die),‚Äù the KP CM said, adding there was no use of politics in the country as ‚Äúthere is no politics‚Äù. He called the public to let the system continue as is if they wanted to remain ‚Äúslaves‚Äù or join the PTI‚Äôs movement if they wanted ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to a query, Gandapur said that Imran was ‚Äúleading the movement himself‚Äù.</p>
<p>Thanking PTI workers, leaders, its lawmakers and overseas supporters, Gandapur vowed to organise a grassroots movement upwards from the streets, towns, and cities.</p>
<p>A caravan of KP lawmakers led by CM Gandapur, as well as MPA Bhachar, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923856/pti-brass-gathers-in-lahore-to-kick-start-aug-5-movement">reached Lahore</a> via G.T. Road yesterday evening. During a layover in Jhelum, the KP CM said that the protest had been launched, and the parliamentary meeting in Lahore would mull the final protest strategy to step up the campaign seeking Imran‚Äôs release.</p>
<p>The PTI in the northern Punjab region has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923404">decided</a> to rely on its grassroots workers to galvanise its support ‚Äî a move which contrasts with its earlier practice of depending on heavyweights to drum up support for its protests.</p></p>

                <h2>Sindh police form special investigation team to probe death of actor Humaira Asghar</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Police have formed a special investigation team to probe the death of actor Humaira Asghar Ali, whose body was found in a Karachi apartment earlier this week, it emerged on Sunday.</p>
<p>Humaira was laid to rest in the Model Town Q Block graveyard in Lahore on Friday following a sparsely-attended funeral, days after her body was <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193833/actor-and-model-humaira-asghar-ali-found-dead-in-karachis-dha">discovered</a> at her apartment in Karachi.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923487#:~:text=An-,autopsy%20report,-by%20police%20surgeon">autopsy report</a> by police surgeon Summaiya Syed, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, confirmed that the body was in an ‚Äúadvanced stage of decomposition‚Äù and at least eight months old.</p>
<p>According to the notification, available with <em>Dawn.com</em> issued by South Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Mahzoor Ali, ‚ÄúA special team comprising of the following officers/officials is hereby constituted under the supervision of Deputy Superintendent of Police Imran Ali Jagrani (Clifton Division Acting Superintendent of Police) in connection with recovered dead body of Humaira Asghar Ali in the jurisdiction of Gizri Police Station.‚Äù</p>
<p>The team will be headed by Defence Sub-Divisional Police Officer Aurangzaib Khattak with South Assistant Superintendent of Police Nida Junaid, Gizri Station House Officer (SHO) Muhammad Farooq, Sub-Inspector Muhammad Amjad and IT Branch Police Constable Muhammad Adeel as its members.</p>
<p>The notification directed the team to inquire into the facts and thoroughly investigate the death of Humaira to ascertain the cause of death, whether natural, accidental, suicidal or murder, by utilising all available resources and submit a progress report to the SSP‚Äôs office on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The autopsy report was released to the police, but the coroner could not determine the actor‚Äôs cause of death due to the level of decomposition.</p>
<p>Police had earlier said that when approached, her family in Lahore ‚Äî particularly her father ‚Äî refused to take the body for burial, triggering shock across the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>On Thursday, however, her brother Naveed Asghar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923487">arrived</a> in Karachi to take the body to Lahore for burial, calling out media outlets for portraying his family in bad light. Police had stated that the actor‚Äôs body would be handed over to her brother after DNA matching.</p>
<p>Speaking to journalists, Naveed said, ‚ÄúThe body was in police custody. The police had kept the body for investigation before calling us (the family) to claim it.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that for the last three days, the family was in contact with Chhipa and the police.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAccording to the guidelines, we were [eventually] going to receive the body and perform the rites,‚Äù he said.</p>

During her university days, she had interaction with theatre groups such as Natak, led by Dr Ahmed Bilal, which was a university-based theatre group consisting of students.</p>
<p>She had interactions with Amjad Islam Amjad, Qavi Khan and other senior actors who used to visit the university for lectures. In her early years of performing art, she did about four or five Pakistan television plays. She also extensively did socially relevant and objective theatre those days.</p></p>
