            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929441/nab-gets-bids-for-three-bahria-town-properties' target='_blank'><strong>NAB gets bids for three Bahria Town properties</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The National Accountability Bureau on Thursday sold off one already-sealed Bahria Town property, and received conditional bids for two others — at a combined value of Rs2.27 billion — in a long-awaited <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929028">auction.</a></p>
<p>The auction of three remaining properties, owned by controversial real estate tycoon Malik Riaz, was shelved due to a “lack of qualifying bids”.</p>
<p>Although mediapersons were invited to cover the auction, they were not allowed to witness proceedings, which were held behind closed doors at NAB’s regional headquarters for Rawalpindi/Islamabad.</p>
<p>Following the auction, journalists seated in a separate committee room were handed a paper carrying brief details of its outcome.</p>
<p>Dozens of private vehicles were seen parked outside the NAB headquarters, ostensibly belonging to the bidders.</p>
<p>According to NAB’s advertisement, six properties were scheduled to be auctioned. However, only three were sold: Rubaish Marquee fetched Rs508 million, while the bureau received conditional offers of Rs876m and Rs881.5m for two of the property developer’s corporate offices.</p>
<p>NAB claimed that Rubaish Marquee was auctioned at Rs20m above its reserved price of Rs488m, while the other two properties were sold at the reserved prices set by the bureau.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>A source in NAB told <em>Dawn</em> that the conditional offers for the two corporate offices were submitted as the bidders wanted to change the purpose of these premises in order to carry out other businesses at these venues.</p>
<p>The remaining three properties — Arena Cinema (reserve price Rs1.1bn), Bahria Town International Academy (Rs1.07bn), and Safari Club (Rs1.2bn), all located in Bahria Town, Rawalpindi — will be auctioned later.</p>
<p>No date has been announced yet for the next auction.</p>
<p>NAB documents stated that the properties were auctioned due to a default of a plea bargain amount in a reference filed against Zain Malik, Malik Riaz’s son-in-law and one of the owners of Bahria Town housing schemes.</p>
<p>Malik Riaz is currently abroad and is reportedly avoiding arrest in other references filed against him, including the high-profile <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886822">£190m Al-Qadir Trust case</a> and the Bahria Town Karachi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929117">case.</a></p>
<p>The auction followed the Islamabad High Court’s dismissal on Tuesday of petitions filed against the sale of six Bahria Town properties in Rawalpindi and one in Islamabad, thus allowing NAB to proceed with the auction scheduled for August 7.</p>
<p>Following the IHC go-ahead, Bahria Town approached the Supreme Court in a bid to restrain NAB from holding the auction.</p>

            <p><p>QUETTA: The Quetta-bound Jaffar Express narrowly escaped disaster on Thursday when a bomb planted near the track close to Sibi Railway Station exploded just after the passenger train passed.</p>
<p>Pakistan Railways authorities confirmed the explosion, which occurred near the outer signal of the track linking Balochistan to the rest of the country.</p>
<p>“The explosive device was planted near the outer railway signal and detonated shortly after the train passed, causing significant damage to the track but leaving the train unharmed,” a senior official told <em>Dawn</em>.</p>
<p>However, the railway track was badly damaged in the blast.</p>
<p>“A portion of the railway track was blown up in the blast,” railway police officials said, adding that train service has been suspended after the explosion and Quetta-bound trains stopped at Jacobabad station. The repair of the damaged railway line has started.</p>
<p>Following the explosion, security forces rushed to the scene to investigate. Preliminary findings revealed that the explosive device had been remotely detonated.</p>

            <p><p>LAHORE: The Punjab government has extended the summer vacation for all public and private schools across the province until Aug 31 with institutions set to reopen on Sept 1.</p>
<p>The decision, announced through an official notification by the School Education Department on Wednesday, supersedes the previous directive to resume classes on Aug 14.</p>
<p>According to the notification, all district education authorities (DEAs) have been instructed to ensure strict compliance with the revised schedule. The extension comes amid ongoing extreme weather conditions in the province, though the notification did not explicitly cite a reason for the decision.</p>
<p>This marks the second adjustment to the academic calendar this summer. Parents and students are advised to note the revised date, while school administrations are expected to adjust their academic plans accordingly.</p>
<p>The Punjab government has not yet indicated whether the extended break will affect the overall academic year schedule or examinations.</p>
<p>Punjab School Education minister Rana Sikandar Hayat also tweeted about extension of summer vacations.</p>
<p>“Schools in Punjab will be opened from Sept 1,” he tweeted.</p>
