            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday expressed his willingness to talk with India to resolve ongoing disputes between the two countries, including the Kashmir issue and water security, during his visit to Iran.</p>
<p>The PM is currently on a four-nation tour to friendly countries, where he will express his gratitude for supporting Pakistan during the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military escalation</a> with India.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, PM Shehbaz was received Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian at Saadabad Palace in the Iranian capital, where he received a guard of honour.</p>

<p>Addressing a joint press conference with Iranian President Masood Pezeshkian, PM Shehbaz said that the two countries’ delegations had a “very productive and useful meeting … which covered all areas of our mutual interests and cooperation”.</p>
<p>“There was total agreement that our two brotherly and neighbourly countries must enhance our cooperation in the field of trade, investments, commerce, in fact, every walk of life,” he said.</p>
<p>The prime minister said that he thanked Pezeshkian for his support during the military conflict with India and emphasised that both nations have deep-rooted cultural ties and historical relations, adding that they decided to turn these relations into a “very productive cooperation in various fields of life”.</p>
<p>“My dear brother, I dearly appreciate your sense of concern and brotherly feelings for the people of Pakistan and your ardent desire that this crisis comes to a grinding halt before it, God forbid, escalates,” Shehbaz said, addressing the Iranian president.</p>

<p>The PM also lauded Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi for visiting Pakistan during the military escalation, calling him an “outstanding diplomat” and stating that they had a “heart to heart discussion”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan came out of this conflict victorious … through our brave actions by our outstanding armed forces,” Shehbaz said.</p>
<p>“We wanted peace, we want peace and we will work for peace in the region through talks on the table and resolve our outstanding issues, including the Kashmir problem, according to the resolutions passed by the [United Nations] Security Council … and even by Indian Lok Sabha (parliament) back in 1954,” he added, speaking about when then-prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru committed to a plebiscite in the disputed territory.</p>

<p><em>PTV News</em> added that Khameini appreciated PM Shehbaz’s efforts in “promoting regional peace and stability with farsightedness” and praised his personal commitment to further strengthening ties between both nations.</p>

                <h2>PTI announces countrywide movement, party told to prepare itself</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>PTI officials on Monday announced that the party will launch a “countrywide movement” and urged party members and supporters to get ready, though no date was announced.</p>
<p>Party founder and ex-premier Imran Khan has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1778114">imprisoned</a> at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail for over two years upon his conviction in four cases — two Toshakhana references, the cipher case, and the Iddat case, in which his wife, Bushra Bibi, is also jailed.</p>
<p>The party has since launched several mass protests demanding his release, notably a march to Islamabad on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875003/day-of-islamabad-clashes-ends-in-pti-protesters-retreat">November 26</a>, 2024, where a day of pitched battles between security forces and PTI protesters ended in a hasty retreat of the party’s top leadership and supporters from the Red Zone.</p>
<p>In a post on X, PTI Senator Ali Zafar wrote that the party would be mobilising nationwide after having a six-hour discussion with the ex-premier today.</p>
<p>“Some very important matters were discussed. Amongst them was a countrywide movement for which the party should prepare and be well-organised,” the senator wrote.</p>
<p>Zafar warned that according to Imran, “there is no room for anyone in PTI to play both sides, and everyone must stand united for the cause of truth and justice.”</p>
<p>Quoting Imran, Zafar wrote, “I am bearing all the hardship in jail for the sake of the nation, and PTI leadership should not be scared of sacrifice.”</p>
<p>He did not give a date for when this movement is set to take place.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum also spoke to reporters outside the Adiala Jail about the mass mobilisation, though she too did not give a date for when the movement would take place.</p>
<p>“Imran Khan issued instructions to get the party ready,” Aleema said. “He said ‘I will not call anybody to Islamabad, since they (authorities) sit with sniper rifles and people get shot … it brings me great pain, I will not do this.’</p>
<p>“Imran Khan has said that the party should get ready, as he will announce a mass movement across Pakistan soon,” she added.</p>
