            <p><p>QUETTA: Gunmen on Saturday freed 10 prisoners, including two convicts and took five police officials captive after they <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908061/armed-men-torch-several-govt-buildings-in-kalat">erected a roadblock</a> near Mangocher on the Quetta-Karachi highway and intercepted the vehicle transporting prisoners to Quetta from Gadani jail.</p>
<p>The authorities were using a private van to transport prisoners; the driver and the vehicle were released by the gunmen.</p>
<p>Officials said that a police team was shifting 10 prisoners to Quetta and the central jail in Mach from Gadani jail.</p>

<p>When the wagon reached the Mangocher area of the Kalat district in late evening, the armed men were blocking the national highway and inspecting every vehicle, including buses and trucks.</p>
<p>After they came across the prison van, they freed the prisoners and kidnapped five police personnel, who were guarding the van, along with their official weapons.</p>
<p>Two police personnel dressed in plainclothes, however, remained safe.</p>
<p>The prisoners included one condemned prisoner who was awarded a death sentence and another was awarded life imprisonment and both were tried for killing their wives. Other prisoners allegedly involved in drug smuggling were coming to Quetta for their case hearing on May 5.</p>
<p>Officials said that security forces had launched a search operation in the hilly area of Mongochar and the surrounding areas to recover the hostages. No group has claimed responsibility for the incident.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908278/ajk-ramps-up-flour-supply-to-loc-areas-amid-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>AJK ramps up flour supply to LoC areas amid tensions</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Steps up efforts to ensure two-month flour reserves in vulnerable regions<br />
• Food depots being relocated from exposed areas to safer zones<br />
• Officials asked to develop contingency plans to ensure uninterrupted food supply</p>
<p>MUZAFFARABAD: The Food Department of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) has accelerated efforts to replenish wheat flour stocks in vulnerable areas along the Line of Control (LoC), amid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war">heightened tensions</a> with India and fears of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">possible incursion</a> from across the divide.</p>
<p>In snowbound and remote areas of AJK — many of which lie adjacent to the LoC — the Food Department traditionally stocks specially treated wheat flour with an extended shelf life to sustain local populations from December through May. In comparatively safer areas, routine storage is limited to a 15-day supply due to easier accessibility.</p>
<p>However, in response to fresh directives from AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, the department has begun increasing reserves in forward locations to meet the needs of residents for at least two months.</p>
<p>“In accordance with the prime minister’s instructions, we have launched an intensive operation to ensure wheat flour stocks are available for a full two months in the entire LoC belt,” AJK’s Minister for Food Chaudhry Akbar Ibrahim told <em>Dawn</em>.</p>
<p>He said the government was simultaneously working on relocating food depots from areas exposed to potential shelling or military activity to relatively safer zones without disrupting access for residents.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The minister added that he had also instructed officials to prepare contingency plans to maintain uninterrupted food supply chains to vulnerable settlements, especially those that were frequently cut off during winter or during episodes of Indian shelling.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the AJK premier had informed the Legislative Assembly that he had constituted a special ‘Emergency Response Fund’ with an initial allocation of Rs1 billion.</p>
<p>The fund would cater to urgent needs such as replenishment of wheat flour, procurement of lifesaving medicines, and provision of other essential services in the 13 constituencies situated along the volatile LoC, spanning six districts — Neelum, Jhelum Valley, Haveli, Poonch, Kotli and Bhimber.</p>
<p>When contacted, AJK Food Department Director Abdul Hameed Kiani said sufficient wheat flour stocks had already been secured in all depots along the LoC.</p>
<p>“However, in light of the prime minister’s instructions and the uncertain situation, we are now increasing our storage capacity to meet a two-month demand,” he said.</p>
<p>“All contractors engaged by the department have been mobilised to use the maximum number of vehicles to deliver wheat flour in the shortest possible time,” he said, adding that department officials were supervising dispatches directly — both at the flour mills and in the delivery zones.</p>
<p>According to Mr Kiani, nearly 70 per cent of the target had so far been achieved.</p>
<p>On Saturday, around 250 tonnes of flour were dispatched from a single mill on the outskirts of Muzaffarabad.</p>
<p>Food Inspector Syed Zawar Haider, who was overseeing operations at the mill, said the consignments were being sent to various parts of Neelum Valley and forward areas of Jhelum Valley district.</p>
<p>“We are executing the task without interruption and expect to complete the operation within the next two days,” he said.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908274/pro-pakistan-demo-outside-indian-high-commission-in-london' target='_blank'><strong>Pro-Pakistan demo outside Indian High Commission in London</strong></a>
            <p><p>LONDON: A large pro-Pakistan demonstration was held on Saturday outside the Indian High Commission in Aldwych, London, under the aegis of Pakistan Muslim League-N’s UK chapter.</p>
<p>The protest came in the wake of the deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam, Occupied Kashmir, which left <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a> dead and reignited <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907785/any-military-misadventure-by-india-will-be-met-with-swift-resolute-notch-up-response-coas">tensions</a> between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>India has accused Pakistan of involvement in the attack, an allegation Islamabad has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">firmly denied</a>, instead calling for an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">independent</a> and impartial investigation into the incident.</p>
<p>Waving Pakistan flags and placards, demonstrators chanted slogans including, “Gen Asim Munir <em>Zindabad</em>”, “Pakistan <em>Zindabad</em>”, “Kashmir belongs to Pakistan” and “We condemn Indian terrorism”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The protesters also denounced India Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Hindutva ideology, with chants of “Modi is terrorist” and “Down with Hindutva ideology” echoing through the streets.</p>
<p>PML-N UK President Ahsan Dar addressed the protesters, saying:“ This huge show is a reflection of the sentiment Pakistani overseas have for their motherland. Today, Pakistanis from across the UK have gathered outside India House to express their support for the civilian and military leadership of Pakistan.</p>
<p>He added that India had hastily blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack without presenting any evidence. “It’s clear this was a false flag operation aimed at maligning Pakistan.”</p>
<p>Dar also highlighted the unity among the diaspora community. “We countered Indian protesters on April 25 in large numbers. We are glad that activists of PTI, PML-N and other parties joined us against Indian aggression. The whole nation is united.”</p>
<p>The demonstration remained peaceful but drew significant attention from passersby and local media.</p>
<p>London Police maintained a visible presence to ensure order.</p>
