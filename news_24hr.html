            <p><p>Former foreign minister and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Monday said India has the option to either share water fairly or “we will deliver water to us from all six (Indus river system) rivers”.</p>
<p>Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">unilaterally suspended</a> its participation in the 1960 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a> (IWT), which governs the usage of the Indus river system, on April 23, shortly after 26 civilians were killed in India-held Kashmir. Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack. The latter has denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. The accord remains dormant despite a ceasefire agreed upon by the two nuclear-armed neighbours last month following their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">worst fighting</a> in decades.</p>
<p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Saturday had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918691/india-will-never-restore-indus-waters-treaty-with-pakistan-amit-shah">slammed</a> Indian Home Minister Amit Shah’s “brazen disregard” for international agreements after the latter said New Delhi would never restore the IWT with Pakistan.</p>

<p>Speaking in the National Assembly during a session on the federal budget, Bilawal said, “India has two options: share water fairly, or we will deliver water to us from all six rivers.”</p>
<p>“The attack on <em>Sindhu</em> [Indus River] and India’s claim that the IWT has ended and it’s in abeyance, firstly, this is illegal, as the IWT is not in abeyance, it is binding on Pakistan and India, but the threat itself of stopping water is illegal according to the UN charter,” the former foreign minister said.</p>
<p>He continued that if India decides to follow through on the threat, we will have to wage war again.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He added that hopefully Pakistan won’t have to, but if it does have to, it is in the position to defeat India the same way it just did.</p>
<p>Bilawal further told lawamkers that peace between the two nuclear neighbours is impossible without cooperation, especially in counterterrorism efforts. “If India and Pakistan refuse to talk, and if there is no coordination on terrorism, then violence will only intensify in both countries,” he warned.</p>
<p>He said India was weaponising terrorism for political purposes. “India seeks to exploit terrorism as a political tool to harm Pakistan’s international standing,” he said, adding that during his diplomatic visits to the United Kingdom and European Union as foreign minister, it became evident that India had lobbied hard to reverse Pakistan’s progress on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) front.</p>
<p>“At a time when Pakistan had successfully moved from the FATF grey list to the white list, India made every effort to drag us back to the grey list using false narratives and diplomatic pressure,” he said. “But thanks to our Foreign Office, the prime minister, and his team, those efforts failed. Once again, Pakistan won — and India lost.”</p>
<p>Bilawal also urged renewed dialogue between Pakistan and India to curb regional instability. He added, “We are fighting not only for the public of Pakistan but also of India as well.”</p>
<p>He strongly criticised what he called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dangerous doctrine of escalation. “Under Modi’s new ‘abnormal’, any terrorist incident in India becomes an automatic pretext for launching hostilities against Pakistan,” Bilawal warned.</p>
<p>He questioned what would happen if Pakistan were to adopt the same policy. “We suffer from terrorist attacks ten times more than India, many of which are traced back to Indian funding or involvement. Should we then adopt a policy of automatic retaliation, too? That would mean surrendering our future to the will of terrorists.</p>
<p>“That might be Modi’s vision, but it is not ours. We will not let terrorists dictate regional peace,” he declared.</p>
<p>Last week, addressing a crowd of supporters, Bilawal had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918592/kashmir-now-a-global-issue-says-bilawal">said</a> that New Delhi must accept the IWT. Pakistan’s narrative had prevailed, not only in diplomatic circles, but also across international media, he claimed.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915727">condemned</a> India’s unilateral suspension of the IWT, describing it as a “blatant violation and act of water aggression”, and warned that Pakistan would give a befitting response in line with decisions made at the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting held on April 24.</p></p>

            <p><p><strong>• Pakistan condemns attack on nuclear facilities<br />
• Premier holds call with Iranian president; call US action ‘violation of international law’<br />
• Iranian envoy hints at retaliatory strikes on American bases</strong></p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: An emergency meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) will be held today (Monday) to discuss the regional situation after the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842/trump-says-irans-key-nuclear-facilities-obliterated-by-us-airstrikes">airstrike on three nuclear facilities</a> in Iran.</p>
<p>The NSC, chaired by the prime minister and comprising the top brass of both civil and military leadership, is the highest forum for security deliberations.</p>
<p>Sources in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) told <em>Dawn</em> that the NSC meeting will be held on Monday evening. Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir will also attend the meeting.</p>
<p>The field marshal, who recently returned from a trip to the US, will brief the committee on the details of his meeting with US President Donald Trump.</p>
<p><strong>Pakistan condemns strikes</strong></p>
<p>The US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, which came four days after COAS Munir’s meeting with Trump, have been condemned by Pakistan.</p>
<p>In a phone call with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Prime Minister Shehbaz condemned the US attack and Israeli aggression.</p>
<p>“The prime minister conveyed Pakistan’s condemnation of the US attacks, which followed Israel’s unprovoked and unjustified aggression over the past eight days,” said an official press release issued by the PMO.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The PM reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering solidarity with the people and government of Iran and expressed condolences on the loss of lives.</p>
<p>He expressed concerns that the US struck facilities that were under the protection of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
<p>“These attacks constituted a serious violation of international law and the IAEA statute,” he added.</p>
<p>While noting Iran’s right to self-defence, as enshrined under Article 51 of the UN Charter, Prime Minister Shehbaz stressed the need for swift dialogues and called diplomacy “the only viable path forward”. He also called for urgent collective efforts to de-escalate the situation, and said Pakistan was ready to play a constructive role in this regard. According to the PMO, President Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan’s support of Iran.</p>
<p>He thanked the prime minister and people of Pakistan for standing in solidarity with Iran.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, the Foreign Office also condemned the US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>“We are gravely concerned at the possible further escalation of tensions in the region,” the Foreign Office spokesman said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The attacks “violate all norms of international law,” the spokesperson said, adding Iran has the right to defend itself under the UN Charter.</p>
<p>“Any further escalation of tensions will have severely damaging implications for the region and beyond.”</p>
<p>The FO urged all parties to “adhere to international law” and hold dialogues to resolve the crises.</p>
<p><strong>‘Iran can hit US bases’</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Dr Reza Amiri Moghadam has said his country could target US facilities and interests in the region.</p>
<p>While addressing a press conference here at the National Press Club on Sunday, Mr Moghadam said the US has a “presence in the region” and that Iran “will see that where we hit the US”.</p>
<p>Responding to a question about US bases in the region, the ambassador said it was shameful that the US has military facilities in Muslim states.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>However, he added that Iran “does not want to bring any other Islamic state into this war”.</p>
<p>Asked about the damages during the US airstrike on Iran’s nuclear sites, he said Iran has the capability to make a nuclear arsenal but the country was using the technology for energy and medical purposes.</p>
<p>“Our nuclear technology is not a physical thing but it’s in the minds of our nuclear scientists, so therefore the US strikes have not made any significant harm to our nuclear programme,” he added.</p>
<p>He also appreciated Pakistan’s support for Iran during the conflict.</p>
<p><strong>President worried</strong></p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari also expressed concern over the escalating tensions in the Middle East.</p>
<p>In a statement on Sunday, the president urged all parties involved in the conflict to exercise maximum restraint and to choose the path of peace , dialogue and diplomacy to ensure enduring peace and stability in the region.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>President Zardari also called upon the international community to play its part in de-escalating the crisis in the interest of regional stability as well as the well-being of its people.</p>

<p>Last week, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918192">predicted</a> that pre-monsoon rains would fall across the country between June 20 and 23.</p>

<p>“This series of pre-monsoon rains is likely to continue till June23 [today],” a PDMA spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Rain is likely to continue in Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Multan, Bahawalpur, Sargodha, Dera Ghazi Khan and Sahiwal, the statement said.</p>
<p>Punjab PDMA Director General (DG) Irfan Ali Kathi instructed citizens to take precautionary measures, adding that they should stay in safe places during lightning and thunder.</p>
<p>“Keep the speed of the vehicle slow and maintain a proper distance,” the DMGA DG said.</p>
<p>Last Saturday, most parts of the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918777">received</a> heavy to light rain, bringing respite from the heatwave.</p>

Many Zambians have raised the issue of this looting for years, but have met coordinated resistance. Consequently, Zambia’s treasury loses billions of dollars in revenue. These losses are driven by well-known multinationals working in concert with certain insiders close&nbsp;to the Zambian state.</p><p>Your editorial also says: “The US decision to cut $50m a year in aid to Zambia … is dreadful, and the reason given, corruption, rings hollow.” Alas, I disagree and wish to place this in context.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/ordinary-zambians-lose-out-twice-to-global-looting-and-local-corruption">Continue reading...</a></p>
