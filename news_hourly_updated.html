                <h2>Punjab Assembly speaker bins pleas for PTI MPAs‚Äô disqualification</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Punjab Assembly speaker says allegations of constitutional violations need to be first proven in ‚Äòcourt or tribunal‚Äô<br />
‚Ä¢ Notices issued to 10 MPAs for payment of damages caused during budget session withdrawn</p>
<p>LAHORE: In a significant step towards de-escalation of political tensions in the Punjab Assembly, PA Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan has formally rejected the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921937">petitions</a> seeking the disqualification of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920792">26 PTI members</a>.</p>
<p>This decision followed successful <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924877/punjab-assembly-talks-progress-but-pti-stands-firm-on-suspensions">negotiations</a> between the government and the opposition, and is expected to pave the way for the swift reinstatement of these suspended lawmakers.</p>
<p>The ruling comes after weeks of parliamentary deadlock, which saw the opposition members <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920792">suspended</a> for ‚Äúdisorderly conduct‚Äù during the budget session on June 27. The suspension for 15 sittings was a direct response to protests that disrupted Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920664">speech</a> and involved the use of ‚Äúoffensive, abusive, and unparliamentary language and slogans‚Äù, as well as alleged physical altercations.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In his detailed written decision, the speaker firmly rejected the petitions. He underscored that the speaker‚Äôs role was not merely to act as a ‚Äúpostman‚Äù by forwarding such requests to the Election Commission. He cautioned that such an unscrutinised process could ‚Äúweaken the constitutional framework‚Äù and ‚Äúcurtail freedom of expression‚Äù within the provincial assembly.</p>
<p>He clarified that while disruptive behaviour in parliaments worldwide often faced stringent measures, the serious allegations of legal and constitutional violations, including those related to oaths, must first be proven in a competent court or tribunal. He asserted that only after a judicial verdict would he be in a position to determine if disqualification under Article 63(2) of the Constitution was warranted, and if the matter should be subsequently referred to the Election Commission.</p>
<p>Four separate applications had been submitted demanding the disqualification of these members, with petitioners citing precedents like the Panama Papers case involving then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif and alleging violations of the speaker‚Äôs ruling and constitutional oaths. However, the speaker dismissed the disqualification requests that referenced the Panama case and similar decisions made under Articles 199 and 184-3 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>He stated that the petitioners retained the option to approach his office again, but only after securing a definitive decision from a competent court. The speaker also decided to withdraw the notices issued to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920792/26-opposition-mpas-barred-from-punjab-assembly-for-15-sittings-over-disorderly-conduct#:~:text=10%20MPAs%20fined%20for%20%E2%80%98vandalism%E2%80%99">10 PTI MPAs for payment of damages</a> caused to the furniture and other assets of the house during the June 27 session. The opposition members obstructed the proceedings of the house on June 27 by tearing agenda papers, hurling them at the treasury, using extreme derogatory language and physically impeding members who approached the treasury benches, according to the ruling, which shared the background of the petitions.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>It was learnt that the policy of removing opposition members from the chairmanship of 13 standing committees was also being reversed, and the four chairpersons already removed from their offices through no-trust votes would also be reinstated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the opposition has intensified its pressure tactics, holding a ‚Äòpublic assembly‚Äô on the road outside the Punjab Assembly. During this ‚Äòoutdoor session‚Äô, the opposition leaders, like Ahmad Khan Bhachar, criticised the government‚Äôs handling of recent floods, soaring prices of essential commodities like sugar and petrol, and alleged political victimisation.</p>
<p>Mr Bhachar reiterated that the opposition would not return to the assembly until their suspended members were reinstated. He also presented a resolution condemning the government‚Äôs actions, which was passed by the ‚Äòoutdoor assembly‚Äô. According to political analysts, the decision by the speaker stressed the importance of due process and constitutional principles in parliamentary affairs and aimed to foster a more functional and less volatile political environment in Punjab.</p>
<p>While the government and opposition have agreed on activating the Advisory and Ethics Committees and avoiding indecent language in future sessions, the full reinstatement of the 26 members is now the immediate next step in restoring full parliamentary cooperation.</p>

            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Over 500 injured nationwide since rains began<br />
‚Ä¢ NDMA blames climate change, glacier melt for floods<br />
‚Ä¢ PDMA issues fourth spell alert as rivers swell<br />
‚Ä¢ Rs5m relief package announced in Punjab</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: As the country grapples with a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919360">monsoon season</a> that has intensified by up to 60 per cent over previous years, the national and provincial disaster management authorities have predicted further rains in the coming days.</p>
<p>According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), at least 180 people have already been killed and more than 500 injured so far since the rains began unusually early in July.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Saturday forecast further rain, wind and thundershowers, with isolated heavy falls, in Sindh over the next 24 hours. Cities and districts likely to be affected include Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Thatta, Badin, Larkana, Jaco¬≠babad, Nawabshah, Mirpurkhas and others.</p>
<p>The NDMA‚Äôs NEOC has also issued alerts for urban flooding in low-lying parts of Sindh. It advised citizens to stay indoors during intense rainfall, avoid travelling to vulnerable areas and ensure household drainage systems remain clear.</p>
<p>The Provincial Disaster Mana¬≠gement Authority (PDMA) of Punjab also issued an alert about the fourth spell of monsoon rains starting from July 20 (today). It forecasted strong winds, dusty winds and rain in most districts of Punjab from July 20 to 25.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Rain with strong winds is predicted in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Mandi Bahauddin, Hafizabad, Gujrat, Jhelum and Gujranwala. There are also chances of rain in Lahore, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Narowal, Toba Tek Singh, Jhang, Sargodha, Mianwali, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur and Bahaw¬≠alnagar from July 18 to 23.</p>
<p>The PDMA also issued a high-level flood pre-alert for all major rivers and associated streams acro¬≠ss the province, warning of pote¬≠ntial flooding from July 22 due to an incoming weather system.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>According to the Flood Forecasting Division, increased water flows are expected in the Chenab, Jhelum, Ravi, Sutlej and Indus rivers, along with their tributaries and low-lying areas, posing significant risks.</p>
<p><strong>KP, Islamabad on alert</strong></p>
<p>In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the monsoon system and glacial melt pose serious risks of flash flooding, particularly in the rivers Kabul, Swat, Panjkora, Bara and Kalpani Nullah. The NDMA warned of potential disruptions in transport across hilly and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>In Islamabad and central Punjab, strong monsoon currents are forecast to bring moderate to heavy rainfall through July 24, increasing the risk of urban flooding.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, due to rising water levels from recent downpours, the Rawal Dam reached its full capacity of 1,748 feet. Authorities announced the opening of its spillways at 6am on Sunday to reduce the level to 1,746 feet. Residents nearby have been advised to stay cautious.</p>
<p><strong>Three children die in Attock</strong></p>
<p>In a series of rain-related incidents in Attock, three children lost their lives on Saturday. A six-year-old girl, Fatima, drowned in a water channel in Amanpur, 12-year-old Muhammad Suleman died when the roof of his house collapsed in Bhattar, and five-year-old Umer Ayub was electrocuted in Ghourghushti after touching a live electric pole.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in an incident unrelated to the rains, a man was shot dead in Mirza village in a targeted attack. Police said Inayat Rehman, 45, was going towards the mosque when two men hiding in a restaurant opened fire, killing him on the spot.</p>
<p><strong>Over 1,500 rescued in Punjab</strong></p>
<p>In Punjab, Rescue 1122 has rescued 1,594 people since June 25 in rain and flood-related emergencies, according to Secretary Emergency Services Dr Rizwan Naseer. Of these, 449 were seriously injured and shifted to hospitals. Moreover, 119 deaths have been confirmed, the majority due to the collapse of dilapidated buildings.</p>
<p>Rescue efforts included pre-emptive evacuation of 444 residents from high-risk areas and the deployment of over 100 boats and 312 rescue personnel. Lahore recorded the highest deaths at 27, followed by 15 in Faisalabad, 11 in Sheikhupura and 10 in Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>Since June 25, 369 building collapse incidents, 23 electrocutions, 62 rain-related crashes and multiple other emergencies have been reported, Dr Naseer said.</p>
<p>He urged the public to inspect rooftops, avoid contact with electric poles during rainfall and check forecasts before travelling to flood-prone or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif directed the immediate restoration of flood-affected roads. Key arteries including Pind Dadan Khan-Jhelum Road, Matta Khurd Road, and Chakwal-Kallar Kahar Road have been reopened. In Rawalpindi, the Crowley Dhok Bridge and Dhok Parwana Road, damaged by floodwater, were also made accessible.</p>
<p>The chief minister also visited Chakwal on Saturday, where she announced Rs5 million in compensation for families of the deceased.</p>
<p>Five lives were lost in Chakwal‚Äôs record-breaking 430mm downpour earlier in the week. CM Maryam chaired a briefing at the district complex and commended district officials for their round-the-clock rescue efforts.</p>
<p>She ordered the evacuation of families from houses deemed vulnerable ahead of the next spell, and ordered the installation of a steel bridge at Dumman on the Chakwal-Sohawa Road, a key artery damaged by soil erosion. She also sought reports on privately built mini-dams, which worsened flooding in parts of Chakwal and Talagang.</p>
<p>The Punjab government on Saturday decided to ensure drainage in private housing societies, install modern alarm systems around Rawalpindi Nallah Lei and evacuate people living near the basins of Ravi, Sutlej and Beas rivers.</p>
<p><strong>Intensified monsoon</strong></p>
<p>NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik stated that this year‚Äôs unusually severe monsoon season, which he said began a month earlier than usual in July, was forecast by the authority four months in advance.</p>
<p>He said the current monsoon season has intensified by up to 60pc compared to previous years. In an interview with <em>PTV News</em>, he emphasised that comprehensive disaster response measures had been put in place under the guidance of the prime minister, with coordinated efforts from the armed forces, PDMAs and key stakeholders including NGOs and industries.</p>
<p>He attributed the heightened rainfall and disaster risk to climate change and accelerated glacier melting.</p>
