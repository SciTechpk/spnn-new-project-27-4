                <h2>US averted likely Pak-India nuclear war, says Trump</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump has said Washington had averted what could have been a nuclear war between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting drones</a> sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns. On May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, Trump announced that a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> had been reached between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe situation had escalated to the point where nuclear war could have broken out,‚Äù Trump said in an interview with US outlet <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-says-comey-knew-assassination-meaning-behind-deleted-social-media-post#:~:text=pointed%20to%20a%20recent%20ceasefire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News</a></em> on Friday.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to a question about getting both countries to step back from the brink of war, Trump called it a ‚Äúbigger success than I will ever be given credit for‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThose are major nuclear powers [‚Ä¶] and they were angry. [‚Ä¶] It was tit-for-tat, it was getting deeper and more missiles,‚Äù he said. He added the next step would have been ‚Äúthe N-word‚Äù, responding in the affirmative to the host confirming he meant ‚Äúnuclear‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the worst thing that can happen,‚Äù Trump noted. Referring to discussions he said he had with both Pakistan and India on trade, the US president said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm using trade to settle scores and make peace.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Trump said that he had great conversations with Pakistan. ‚ÄúYou know we can‚Äôt forget them because it takes two to tango.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo proud of what we‚Äôre able to do with India and with Pakistan,‚Äù the US president said.</p>
<p>He continued that Pakistan would love to trade with the US. ‚ÄúThey are brilliant people. They make amazing products. We don‚Äôt do much trading with them.‚Äù</p>
<p>As the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810/trumps-tariffs-stoke-global-trade-war-as-china-eu-hit-back">imposed heavy levies</a> on dozens of allies and rivals alike on April 2, Pakistan was hit by a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901838/economists-see-hurdles-and-opportunities-for-pakistan-as-us-imposes-29pc-tariff-on-country">29 per cent tariff</a> on goods it exports to the US. The government has said it is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906864">seeking ways</a> to address the existing trade imbalance between the two countries.</p>
<p>On trade with New Delhi, Trump said that India was one of the highly tariffed nations, making it almost ‚Äúimpossible to do business‚Äù.</p>
<p>However, India is ready to cut 100pc of its tariffs for the US, he added. ‚ÄúThat deal will come soon,‚Äù the president said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, he had stated that India had offered a trade deal that proposed ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911203">no tariffs</a>‚Äù for American goods.</p>
<p>This interview was the third time in a week that the US president expressed his intention of deepening trade ties with Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to do a lot of trade with Pakistan ‚Ä¶ and India,‚Äù Trump said earlier this week, recalling that he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910565/trump-says-warned-pakistan-india-of-no-trade-if-fighting-not-halted">warned</a> both countries of ‚Äúnot doing any trade‚Äù if they did not stop fighting. A day after the ceasefire, he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910382#:~:text=adding%20that%20he%20also%20intended%20to%20%E2%80%9Cincrease%20trade%20substantially%20with%20both%20of%20these%20great%20nations%E2%80%9D">said</a> he was going ‚Äúto increase trade substantially with both of these great nations‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The US-brokered ceasefire had brought a halt to a week of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909156/nuclear-war-can-break-out-at-any-time-in-case-of-pak-india-standoff-khawaja-asif">record escalation</a> between Pakistan and India as the latter took a series of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988">unprovoked military actions</a> despite Islamabad‚Äôs call for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a> into India‚Äôs allegations over the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>The military has confirmed that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910992">13 security personnel</a>, including members of the Pakistan Army and the Pakistan Air Force, were martyred while over 75 were injured during the confrontation with India.</p>
<p>It has also stated that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910848/40-civilians-11-personnel-martyred-in-indian-strikes">40 civilians</a> ‚Äî including seven women and 15 children ‚Äî lost their lives during the Indian aggression, while 121 others sustained injuries.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Britain is working with the US to ensure a ceasefire between India and Pakistan endures and that ‚Äúconfidence-building measures‚Äù and dialogue take place, according to its foreign minister David Lammy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will continue to work with the United States to ensure that we get an enduring ceasefire, to ensure that dialogue is happening and to work through with Pakistan and India how we can get to confidence and confidence-building measures between the two sides,‚Äù Lammy told <em>Reuters</em> in Islamabad at the end of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911413/india-should-adhere-to-ceasefire-pakistan-will-respond-if-hostilities-resume-fo#:~:text=FM%20Dar%20appreciates%20UK%20role%20in%20de%2Descalation">two-day visit</a>.</p>

<p>Asked about India‚Äôs April 23 suspension of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>, potentially <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911383">squeezing</a> Pakistan‚Äôs water supply, Lammy said: ‚ÄúWe would urge all sides to meet their treaty obligations.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Pakistan Commission on Indus Waters earlier this month <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908458">shared</a> a detailed report with the federal government about massive violations of the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) by New Delhi. Pakistan plans to launch <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907454">international legal action</a> against India over its move to hold the critical water-sharing agreement in abeyance.</p>
<p>Pakistan has said Britain and other countries, in addition to the United States, played a major role in de-escalating the fighting. Diplomats and analysts say the ceasefire <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911472">remains fragile</a>.</p></p>

                <h2>PTI‚Äôs Shah Mahmood Qureshi moved to cardio institute due to heart pain</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Former foreign minister and PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi has been moved from Lahore‚Äôs Kot Lakhpat Jail to the Punjab Institute of Cardiology (PIC) on Saturday after he suffered heart pain, his lawyer said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Qureshi has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897723/amended-charges-framed-against-qureshi-others">indicted</a> in multiple cases pertaining to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279/special-report-may-9-mayhem-and-military-trials-a-year-on">May 9, 2023 riots</a> and has remained behind bars since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1771020">August 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em> today, Advocate Rana Mudassar, Qureshi‚Äôs lawyer, said his client suffered heart pain early in the morning after Fajr prayers. He underwent a medical assessment by prison doctors.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe was shifted to the PIC by Rescue 1122 after his health failed to improve,‚Äù Mudassar said, adding that Qureshi was currently undergoing various tests at the hospital.</p>
<p>The PTI leader‚Äôs family had been informed about his condition, the lawyer added.</p>
<p>In July 2024, the PTI vice-president was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845990">indicted</a> by a Lahore anti-terrorism court in a case registered by the Shadman police over allegedly attacking and burning the police station.</p>
<p>The same month, he was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1846704">transferred</a> from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi to Kot Lakhpat on a police request. It had stated that frequent transportation of the PTI leader from Rawalpindi to Lahore was not feasible for the authorities as well as for the jailed ex-minister.</p>
<p>In November last year, a Lahore ATC <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1873389">indicted</a> Qureshi and other senior PTI leaders in multiple cases relating to May 9 riots. The former foreign minister has pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p></p>
