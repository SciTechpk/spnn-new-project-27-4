            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange opened up over nine per cent on Monday after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> over the weekend with India, returning calm to the markets.</p>
<p>Saturday’s ceasefire, announced by US President Donald Trump, followed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">four days</a> of tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">strikes</a> between the nuclear-armed neighbours, as well as diplomacy and pressure from Washington.</p>
<p>The KSE-100 index opened with a gain of 9,929.48 points, or 9.26pc, to stand at 117,104.11 points from the previous close of 107,174.63 at 9:30am.</p>
<p>Due to the massive gains, the PSX was suspended for an hour after opening to control excessive volatility.</p>
<p>“The market has reacted jubilantly to the ceasefire announcement after Pakistan established effective <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910381/deterrence-re-established-say-armed-forces">deterrence against India</a>,” noted Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities.</p>

<p>“The PSX has saluted the Pakistan Air Force this morning with a surge of over 9pc in the KSE-100 Index,” he remarked, in reference to the PAF’s actions in response to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186">India’s strikes</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Farooq noted that the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908601/sbp-cuts-interest-rate-by-100bps-to-11pc">interest rate cut</a> and the approval of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">$1 billion tranche</a> by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) “further fueled investor enthusiasm”.</p>
<p>Commenting on the future investor mood, Farooq said market participants were now expected to shift their focus towards the upcoming federal budget for the next fiscal year, which is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909569">expected on June 2</a>.</p>
<p>Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, listed three main reasons for the robust market activity.</p>
<p>Other than the ceasefire and the IMF’s green light to the disbursement, Tariq mentioned US President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910382/kashmir-takes-centre-stage-as-fragile-ceasefire-holds">recent statement</a> on increasing trade with Pakistan.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">mediating</a> the halt of hostilities between the South Asian arch-rivals, Trump not only offered his help in resolving the Kashmir dispute but also announced he would “increase trade substantially” with both Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, pointed out the heightened possibility of further improving ties with Gulf countries due to Pakistan’s enhanced geopolitical position.</p>
<p>“This brief conflict has also demonstrated our military and technological superiority over India, strengthening our geopolitical position. As a result, it is likely to enhance ties with Gulf countries amid regional tensions and support growth in our defence and technology exports,” Ashraf told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>While noting the investor zest in light of the Pak-India “conflict ending with dominance”, he said the attention was now expected to shift towards improving macroeconomic indicators, including <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908067">historically low inflation</a> and a record-high current account surplus.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s consumer inflation rate plunged to an all-time low of 0.3pc year-on-year <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908067">in April</a>, while the $1.195bn current account surplus <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904945">in March</a> was the highest-ever monthly surplus.</p>
<p>Indian shares also rallied today.</p>

            <p><p>• ISPR DG says 26 Indian sites struck, response textbook demonstration of integrated tri-services<br />
• Indian military dodges question about loss of fighter jets</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s armed forces on Sunday said they struck 26 Indian targets in ‘<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a>’ to re-establish deterrence after India violated Pakistan’s airspace earlier this week and separately targeted air bases in early-morning strikes.</p>
<p>In a press conference alongside Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Director General Public Relations Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed and Naval Staff (Operations) Deputy Chief Vice Admiral Raja Rab Nawaz, Pakistan Army’s chief spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared details about the operation.</p>
<p>He said the dastardly attacks began on the night of May 6 and 7, resulting in the loss of innocent civilian lives, including women, children and the elderly. He said one Pakistani aircraft was slightly damaged during the Indian missile attack.</p>
<p>“Twenty-six military targets, along with facilities in India used to target Pakistani citizens and entities involved in fomenting terrorism in Pakistan, were engaged in both Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and mainland India,” he said in the presser.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Gen Chaudhry said Pakistan’s response was a “textbook demonstration” of integrated tri-services, enabled by real-time situational awareness, network-centric warfare capabilities and seamless multidomain operations.</p>
<p>“The targets included air force and aviation bases at Suratgarh, Sirsa, Adampur, Bhooj, Nalia, Bathinda, Barnala, Halwara, Avantipura, Srinagar, Jammu, Mamoon, Ambala, Udampur and Pathankot — all of which sustained major damages,” he added.</p>
<p>The DG said Brahmos facilities, which had fired missiles in Pakistan and killed innocent civilians, were also destroyed.</p>

<p>India launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">series of strikes</a> under ‘Operation Sindoor’ soon after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam tragedy</a> in the early hours of May 7 across Pakistan, in which 31 people were martyred. Pakistan’s military responded swiftly, downing five Indian jets, destroying Indian brigade headquarters, and check posts in the occupied Kashmir along the Line of Control.</p>
<p>The ISPR chief paid tribute to those who were martyred in the Indian aggression and their families, while praying for the speedy recovery of the wounded.</p>
<p>“We extend our heartfelt gratitude to every officer, soldier, airman and sailor of the Armed Forces of Pakistan who made this success on the battlefield possible through their courage, professionalism and sacrifice.”</p>
<p>The military spokesperson particularly thanked the youth of Pakistan — “who became the frontline soldiers as information and cyber warriors of the country” — and the media that stood as a “steel wall” against the Indian media. He also appreciated politicians for their support to the army during these times and lauded the premier for taking “destiny-changing decisions” during this testing time</p>
<p><strong>War not an option</strong></p>

        <figcaption class="media__caption  ">LAHORE: People wave flags atop a truck as they take part in a rally to support the armed forces, a day after the ceasefire announcement between India and Pakistan.—Reuters</figcaption>
    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to a question about who first requested for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>, the DG ISPR said: “Put it on record that Pakistan never requested for a ceasefire.”</p>
<p>He warned that there was no space for a war between two nuclear-armed nations. “if anyone wants to carve out this space for war, he is actually carving out the space for mutual annihilation,” he added.</p>
<p>He said: “This is why you saw how in this conflict Pakistan acted in a very mature manner and through conventional forces, we maintained escalation control, through conventional forces we gave them a two notch up response while also ensuring that the Pakistan forces employed on the counterterrorism operations … no pull is also exerted on them.”</p>
<p><strong>IAF airfields hit</strong></p>
<p>Air Vice Marshal Ahmed, while describing Pakistan’s response to the Indian Air Force, said the PAF’s response was based “on the time and place of own choosing”, displaying “bold, aggressive and unwavering resolve of the brave military leadership”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“I must appreciate the leadership … they were resolute and clear in giving instructions to all of us and that is perhaps the reason why we were so sure about what we had to do,” he said.</p>
<p>“With unprecedented reach, precision and lethality, while avoiding collateral, the PAF hit maximum number of IAF airfields in a single operational package since 1971 because they crossed the international border,” the officer said.</p>
<p>“While reestablishing deterrence, Pakistan negated the setting of a new normal under the hegemonistic design of a supremacist regime through swift and effective response.”</p>
<p><strong>Sea frontiers</strong></p>
<p>Vice Admiral Rab Nawaz said the Pakistan Navy was able to defend the country’s sea frontiers from a “numerically superior enemy”.</p>
<p>He gave details of the navy’s readiness to thwart any attack from the sea. He said there was a hype that INS Vikrant (Indian fleet) was approaching Karachi. “We were keeping a very close eye on the activities at sea […] we were monitoring it from day one,” he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“On the night of May 6 and 7, it was close to Bombay and on May 9, it was essentially 400 nautical miles from the Pakistani coast and it retreated close to Bombay,” he said.</p>
<p>“If a carrier gets within 400 nautical miles, it simplifies our problem. The navy maritime air arm was proper ready to generate a response at all times. If there was any aggression from the sea we were ready to respond effectively,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Indian military dodges question</strong></p>
<p>Indian military officers, meanwhile, said that the objectives of ‘Operation Sindoor’ were achieved, with ‘high-value terrorists’ being eliminated, but dodged a question whether they had lost a bunch of warplanes in the operation.</p>
<p>The officers, speaking at a press conference, provided key details on Operation Sindoor, its impact and results, saying that the “objective has been achieved”.</p>
<p>Air Marshal AK Bharti, DGMO Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai, Maj Gen SS Sharma and Vice Admiral AN Pramod addressed the press. Responding to reports that Rafale fighter jets were downed, Air Marshal AK Bharti did not confirm or deny the claims, stating instead that “losses are a part of any combat scenario”.</p>
<p>The Indian military said, “We are in a combat scenario and losses are a part of it. Question is that ‘have we achieved our objective’? Answer is a thumping yes. As for details, at this time I would not like to comment on that, as we are still in combat, and give advantage to (our) adversary. All our pilots are back home.”</p>

            <p><p>NEW DELHI: The guns of India and Pakistan have fallen silent after the announcement of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> that paused the hostilities kicked off by India’s ‘<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">Operation Sindoor</a>’ on May 7.</p>
<p>The ceasefire announced on Saturday allayed the fears of broader escalation but the wife of an Indian Border Security Force (BSF) trooper <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906377">captured</a> by Pakistan last month is perturbed about her husband.</p>
<p>She has asked her government if her ‘<em>sindoor</em>’ would be returned.</p>
<p>Sindoor is a vermilion mark worn mostly by rural Hindu women in their hair parting to depict their marital status.</p>
<p>Indian news publication <em>The Wire</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://thewire.in/security/give-me-my-sindoor-back-ceasefire-offers-no-relief-for-family-of-bsf-jawan-captured-by-pakistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that the family of 34-year-old Purnam Sau in Rishra, West Bengal, was hoping diplomatic efforts would help his return.</p>
<p>Sau, posted with the 24th Battalion of the BSF in Firozpur, Punjab, was deployed along the India-Pakistan border on April 23, when he assisted local farmers in evacuating a vulnerable zone and reportedly crossed the international boundary inadvertently.</p>
<p>The event took place at a time when tensions were high between India and Pakistan after 26 tourists were killed in a terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22.</p>
<p>Pakistani forces reportedly deta­ined him and later released a photograph showing him blindfolded, confirming his capture, <em>The Wire</em> said.</p>
<p>At their modest home in Rishra in Hooghly district, Sau’s family is reeling from shock and uncertainty. His wife, Rajani Sau, seven months pregnant, collapsed while narrating her ordeal.</p>
<p>“My husband has been captured by the Pakistani army. He is in their custody. They have released a blindfolded photo of him,” she sobbed.</p>
<p>“BSF officers visited our home and told us they are trying to bring my husband back. But now the situation is like a war. I don’t know what news will come next!”</p>
<p>Purnam’s last call to Rajani was on the night of April 22, hours before his arrest, when he checked in on her health, as he often did after night shifts.</p>
<p>“So many days have passed, and there’s still no word from him,” she said.</p>
<p>At the mere mention of Operation Sindoor, Rajani broke down, pulling her veil over her face as she wept, “Give me back my sindoor, government!”</p>
<p>Purnam’s father, Bhola Sau, a retired security guard, voiced frustration at the silence following initial military assurances.</p>
<p>“We went to Firozpur with my daughter-in-law, and the army officers promised they were trying [to bring Purnam back]. Now, there’s no update.”</p>
<p>Sau’s mother said her son “served the nation” for 18 years. “Today, we feel abandoned.”</p>
<p>The incident has united Rishra’s tight-knit, largely non-Bengali migrant community, descendants of jute mill workers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>Locals have taken turns to visit the family’s home, where TV screens blare news updates around the clock.</p>
<p>“We’re torn. On one side, war cries; on the other, we beg for peace and Purnam’s safe return. We’ll celebrate with sindoor only when he’s home,” shared Purnam’s brother, Shyamsundar Shau.</p>
<p>Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee expressed hope last Monday for a swift resolution from the Home Ministry. Hooghly MP Kalyan Banerjee confirmed he raised the issue with BSF commanders.</p>
