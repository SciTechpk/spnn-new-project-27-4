            <p><p>As the Supreme Court‚Äôs Constitutional Bench resumed hearing review petitions in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914188">reserved seats case</a>, Justice Salahuddin Panhwar recused himself from the bench following an objection from senior counsel Hamid Khan.</p>
<p>In its July 12, 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">short order</a>, eight out of 13 judges ruled that 39 out of a list of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621#:~:text=the%20verdict%20stated.-,List%20of%2080%20MNAs,-The%20verdict%20listed">80 MNAs</a> were and are the returned candidates of the PTI, setting it to emerge as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845532">single largest party</a> in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>However, the ruling had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1868333">not been implemented</a> by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860119">National Assembly</a>, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had raised some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859716">objections</a>.

<p>An 11-member bench headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan resumed the hearing today.</p>
<p>Justice Panhwar noted that Hamid Khan, counsel for the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), had yesterday raised an objection to the bench.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHamid Khan raised an objection to the inclusion of judges in the bench who came to the Supreme Court after the 26th Amendment in the bench,‚Äù Justice Panhwar said, noting that he is one of the judges included in the objection.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPublic trust in the judiciary is essential,‚Äù Panhwar stated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is essential that no party has any objection to the bench,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is because of these objections that I cannot sit on this bench.‚Äù</p>
<p>The judge told Khan that although he was hurt by his remarks ‚Äî having worked together since 2010 ‚Äî this was not a personal matter.</p>
<p>Khan said he appreciated Panhwar‚Äôs decision.</p>
<p>However, Justice Aminuddin Khan told him that this was not a matter to eb appreciated. ‚ÄúThis is a result of your conduct,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe gave you respect, that‚Äôs why we are listening to you, otherwise we were not under any obligation to hear you,‚Äù Justice Khan said. ‚ÄúWe gave you this opportunity, don‚Äôt misuse it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Following Justice Panhwar‚Äôs recusal, the SIC‚Äôs counsel also objected to a 10-memebr bench taking up the hearing.</p>
<p>To this, Justice Mandokhail questioned under which law the counsel was making this argument.</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail added that the 10-member bench will continue hearing cases.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGiving respect is what gets you respect,‚Äù he told Khan. ‚ÄúWhatever respect you have today is because of the Supreme Court.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúToday we are here, tomorrow we will not be here, you will not be here,‚Äù Justice Mandokhail said.</p>
<p>The SIC counsel told Justice Mandokhail not to use the case if he was angry.</p>
<p>Justice Aminuddin interjected here, asking the SIC counsel what objection he had.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy objection is that a twelve-member bench cannot hear the review of the decision of a thirteen-member bench,‚Äù Khan said.</p>
<p>Justice Aminuddin rejected this objection and asked him to proceed with his arguments.</p>
<p>Here, the debate between Khan and the judges became heated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe SIC lawyer had given his arguments, you had no right to speak,‚Äù Justice Mandokhail said. ‚ÄúWe gave you respect.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>Rubio, PM Shehbaz stress importance of promoting durable Israel-Iran peace</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke on Thursday with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif about <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920431/iran-wont-back-down-but-looking-to-avoid-war">recent developments</a> in the Middle East, underlining a shared commitment to regional stability and non-proliferation amid renewed efforts to engage <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920138">Iran</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecretary of State Marco Rubio spoke today with Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif regarding events in the Middle East. Secretary Rubio emphasised that Iran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon,‚Äù US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/06/secretary-rubios-call-with-pakistani-prime-minister-sharif-3/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe two leaders acknowledged the importance of working together to promote a durable peace between Israel and Iran and to maintain regional stability,‚Äù she added.</p>

<p>The call highlights Washington‚Äôs growing engagement with Islamabad at a time when the Trump administration is reportedly exploring a new diplomatic initiative with Tehran, possibly ‚Äúas early as next week‚Äù.</p>
<p>Rubio‚Äôs statement that ‚ÄúIran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon‚Äù will be interpreted in various ways in both Pakistan and the United States. Some may see it as an indication of alignment between the two countries, while others may view it as an affirmation of Pakistan‚Äôs position as a potential stabilising partner in a region fraught with uncertainty.</p>
<p>The latest contact builds on a series of high-level engagements, including a phone call last Friday in which PM Shehbaz expressed satisfaction over what he described as a ‚Äúcordial and productive discussion‚Äù <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917868">between</a> US President Donald Trump and Pakistan‚Äôs military chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir.</p>
<p>That meeting, held earlier this month at the White House, was notable for both its optics and timing. Munir became the first serving Pakistani army chief to be formally received by a sitting US president ‚Äî a gesture widely interpreted as an acknowledgment of the military‚Äôs central role in Pakistan‚Äôs foreign and security policy.</p>
<p>The Pakistani military‚Äôs media wing later reported that the White House luncheon focused on joint counterterrorism efforts and the potential for expanded bilateral trade.</p>
<p>Trump, in remarks at a Nato summit in The Hague following the meeting, credited General Munir with helping to avert a nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan, referring to him ‚Äî though not by name ‚Äî as a quiet but decisive actor during last month‚Äôs standoff.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>‚ÄúThe most important of these conflicts,‚Äù Trump said, ‚Äúwas last month‚Äôs war scare between India and Pakistan. And that was not whether or not they may someday have nukes, like we are talking about the Middle East‚Ä¶ This is ‚Äî they have nuclear weapons.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump described how he intervened through a series of calls that linked trade to peace.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>‚ÄúIf you are going to be fighting each other‚Ä¶ we are not going to do any trade,‚Äù he recalled telling both sides. ‚ÄúThey said, ‚ÄòNo, no. No, you have to do a trade deal.‚Äô‚Ä¶ And we stopped the nuclear war.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Trump avoided naming General Munir directly, he has in the past referred to the Pakistani general as ‚Äúan exceptional human being and an inspiring personality‚Äù.</p>
<p>These remarks, which closely mirror Pakistan‚Äôs version of events, stand in contrast to India‚Äôs official stance. New Delhi maintains it acted independently during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918769">May crisis</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917877/modi-maintains-there-was-no-us-mediation-in-ceasefire-with-pakistan">rejects</a> any suggestion of third-party mediation. Trump‚Äôs candid remarks suggest otherwise, indicating a more active White House role than previously acknowledged.</p>
<p>In his broader comments following last week‚Äôs White House meeting, Trump also noted: ‚ÄúThe Pakistanis know Iran very well, better than most. But they are not happy.‚Äù</p>
<p>Though brief, this comment hints at Washington‚Äôs evolving perception of Pakistan ‚Äî not merely as a South Asian actor but as a player with insight into regional dynamics. It also reinforces the relevance of Rubio‚Äôs phone call with Sharif, suggesting that the US is keen to draw on Islamabad‚Äôs experience as it revisits the idea of talks with Tehran.</p>
<p>Rubio‚Äôs statement on preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon re-emphasises US strategic priorities. Pakistan‚Äôs apparent position ‚Äî implicit in the call‚Äôs emphasis on peace and stability ‚Äî may help strengthen its image in Washington as a constructive and responsible actor in a volatile neighborhood.</p>
<p>Observers say the back-to-back engagements ‚Äî and Pakistan‚Äôs active role in both South Asian and Middle Eastern dialogues ‚Äî signal a diplomatic moment of consequence, one in which Islamabad has the opportunity to shape outcomes far beyond its immediate borders.</p></p>
