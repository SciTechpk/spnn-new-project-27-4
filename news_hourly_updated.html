                <h2>2 cops shot dead by ‚Äòterrorists‚Äô in KP‚Äôs Dera Ismail Khan: police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Two policemen were gunned down in a ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù attack on Wednesday in Kulachi area of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Dera Ismail Khan district, police said.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, DI Khan Police Spokesperson, Yaqoob Khan, said, ‚ÄúThe two police personnel were on their way to buy food when the terrorists opened fire on them.‚Äù</p>
<p>The deceased have been identified as head constable Ghulam Muhammad and constable Shahzad, both of whom were ex-servicemen.</p>
<p>Following the attack, police and Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) personnel tracked down the terrorists and killed one of them during an operation, while the other two, though injured, fled.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWeapons and ammunition have been recovered from the slain terrorist, while a search operation is underway for the terrorists at large,‚Äù according to the spokesperson.</p>
<p>Federal Minister for Interior Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack, paying tribute to the martyred personnel.</p>
<p>He saluted the ‚Äúsacrifices made by the brave sons‚Äù of KP in their fight against terrorism. Expressing sympathy for the families of the deceased, he said that the government stands with them at this difficult time.</p>
<p>Naqvi vowed that ‚Äútheir sacrifices will not go in vain‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúKP police is leading the fight against terrorism in the country,‚Äù he noted.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents, with a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a> across Peshawar, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, and Bajaur in the past few months.</p>
<p>On June 21, KP Police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918714">killed</a> a terrorist and injured two others belonging to the TTP group in Dera Ismail Khan as they attempted to attack the police.</p>
<p>On June 3, terrorist <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915202">attacks</a> on two police stations in KP‚Äôs Bajaur and Bannu districts injured four police personnel. In May, two policemen were martyred and two were injured in a suicide <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911459">attack</a> in Peshawar, while in a separate incident, two cops <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912410">lost</a> their lives as a result of an attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu.</p>
<p>Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.</p>
<p>On July 5, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP‚Äôs Tipu Gul group were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922269">killed</a> in a joint operation by the CTD.</p>
<p>Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p></p>

            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924568/us-lawmakers-warn-pakistan-over-transnational-repression-hint-at-possible-sanctions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <h2>US lawmakers warn Pakistan over transnational repression, hint at possible sanctions</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The US Congress may soon urge President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration to consider imposing sanctions on countries that suppress religious freedom and violate human rights, Republican Congressman Christopher H. Smith suggested on Tuesday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOne of the biggest disappointments ‚Äî regardless of who is in the White House or at the State Department ‚Äî is the absence of sanctions,‚Äù said Smith, who co-chairs the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission (<a class="link--external" href="http://humanrightscommission.house.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TLHRC</a>), during a <a class="link--external" href="https://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=414868" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">congressional hearing</a> on Pakistan.</p>
<p>Smith recalled that the only individual ever sanctioned under US religious freedom laws was Indian Prime Minister <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1107011">Narendra Modi</a>, following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1265474">2002 Gujarat riots</a>. ‚ÄúWe are going to call on the Irfa office to consider imposing [sanctions] ‚Äî especially in light of the terrible acts committed against people of various faiths,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The Irfa office, based at the State Department, enforces the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/2021%20Legislation%20Factsheet%20-%20IRFA.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Religious Freedom Act</a>, which authorises the US government to designate and penalise countries that engage in or tolerate severe religious persecution.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. We‚Äôve got 18 sanctions here, and we are going to impose them on you,‚Äù Smith declared during the hearing on Pakistan‚Äôs current political and human rights situation.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Amnesty International‚Äôs advocacy director for Europe and Central Asia, Ben Linden; PTI leader Zulfi Bukhari; law firm Perseus Strategies‚Äô Managing Director Jared Genser; and Afghanistan Impact Network founder Sadiq Amini provided their testimonies during the hearing.</p>
<p>Although the TLHRC does not directly recommend sanctions, Smith‚Äôs remarks were widely seen as a signal that such measures may be under consideration if current trends persist.</p>
<p>His Democratic counterpart, Congressman James McGovern, echoed the concern. ‚ÄúA vibrant Pakistani community in Massachusetts engages me all the time, and quite frankly, they are worried about the signals coming from our government right now,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Speaking about the political climate in Pakistan, McGovern added: ‚ÄúThey need to know that people are watching. They need to know we don‚Äôt like what we are hearing.‚Äù</p>
<p>The bipartisan hearing focused on civil liberties and political freedoms in Pakistan, highlighting reports of repression, persecution of minorities, and efforts to silence dissidents abroad.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Amnesty‚Äôs Ben Linden opened his testimony by raising concerns over the situation in Balochistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDr Mahrang and other Baloch detainees should be freed,‚Äù he said, referring to the rights activist who has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922808/quetta-atc-sends-mahrang-other-byc-activists-on-10-day-physical-remand">in prison</a> for more than three months over cases on allegedly ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899608">attacking</a>‚Äù the Quetta Civil Hospital and ‚Äúinciting people to violence‚Äù.</p>
<p>A day ago, a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa33/0109/2025/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">campaign letter</a> by Amnesty International <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924391">called upon</a> Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti to ‚Äúrelease all detained Baloch activists‚Äù.</p>
<p>Linden warned that recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875102">crackdowns</a> on PTI supporters should be seen in the context of a broader assault on fundamental rights.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAhmadis and other religious minorities are being targeted while local authorities fail to protect them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúVaguely worded blasphemy laws are being weaponised by majoritarian religious groups, while the accused have few means to defend themselves.‚Äù</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860220">2024 alone</a>, over 300 new blasphemy cases were registered ‚Äî most against Muslims. ‚ÄúSeveral of the accused were killed extrajudicially,‚Äù Linden said, calling the trend ‚Äúa tragedy‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He also condemned the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923067/hrcp-expresses-concern-as-govt-warns-criminal-action-against-27-youtube-channels-set-for-blocking">blocking</a> of US-based YouTube channels critical of Pakistan‚Äôs military, describing the move as ‚Äútotally unacceptable‚Äù.</p>
<p>However, Jared Genser of Perseus Strategies stressed that Washington could not afford to disengage entirely.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt act that way with any regime. We have to engage. The key is for President Trump and Secretary [of State] Marco Rubio to say very clearly: we want a strong relationship with Pakistan, but this is what needs to be done to get there. And that includes releasing [ex-prime minister] <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885852">Imran Khan</a> and other political prisoners,‚Äù Genser said.</p>
<p>He noted: ‚ÄúWe need to talk about the tragedy that Pakistan is today in terms of human rights. The Pakistani diaspora is a ray of hope.‚Äù</p>
<p>McGovern concurred: ‚ÄúWe need to talk. We need to engage. And we need to be talking about political prisoners, the future of Imran Khan ‚Ä¶ but also how you do it.‚Äù</p>
<p>The hearing also addressed last week‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093">White House meeting</a> between Trump and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.</p>
<p>Bukhari, a former close aide to Imran, told the panel: ‚ÄúPresident Trump wanted to meet someone who is calling the shots. That‚Äôs why he met the army chief.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Bukhari claimed nearly 200 politically motivated cases had been filed against Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi. He alleged that ‚Äúfundamental rights had been suspended‚Äù in Pakistan, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893958">media</a> silenced, and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893562">judicial independence</a> undermined through ‚Äúcoercive‚Äù <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866825">amendments</a>.</p>
<p>Sadiq Amini, founder of the Afghanistan Impact Network, focused on what he called Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúduplicity‚Äù in its relationship with the United States, claiming that ex-prime minister Imran was ‚Äúused‚Äù to mislead Trump during his first term.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter the announcement of his South Asia strategy, [Imran] Khan rushed to Washington with a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1649709">message of peace</a> from the Taliban ‚Äî a message that was actually a carefully crafted deception by his Russian counterparts. He convinced President Trump to pursue a peace deal with the Taliban, which only empowered them.‚Äù</p>
<p>He argued that the peace process ultimately failed, leading to the US withdrawal and the rise of a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907890">gender apartheid regime</a>‚Äù in Kabul.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Amini further alleged that Imran, as prime minister, acted as a spokesperson for the Taliban, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1674947">promoting</a> them as an indigenous movement serving Afghan interests.</p>
<p>He warned that Pakistan‚Äôs leadership could not win US trust by imprisoning a few individuals like Imran or former spy chief <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1877892">Faiz Hameed</a>. ‚ÄúPakistani leaders, both military and civilian, complain about the Taliban threat. But even now, they say the Taliban is good for Afghanistan but <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892006">bad for Pakistan</a>. That‚Äôs a blatant display of duplicity.‚Äù</p>
<p>He also denounced Pakistan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902083">detention</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915407">deportation</a> of Afghan refugees as ‚Äúshameful and inhumane‚Äù, and called on the US to reassess Islamabad‚Äôs commitment to democracy.</p>
<p>In earlier remarks, TLHRC Co-chair Smith warned that the US ‚Äúcannot stand by‚Äù while military influence allegedly subverts civilian rule in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, US lawmakers also heard disturbing accounts of harassment faced by Pakistani dissidents in the US. Multiple speakers alleged that within 48 hours of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916434#:~:text=PTI%20plans%20protests%20on%2014th">protest</a> outside the Pakistani Embassy in Washington on June 14, ‚Äúfamily members of critics were abducted in Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>Lawmakers, including Democratic representatives Jimmy Panetta, Suhas Subramanyam and Greg Casar, expressed support for safeguarding the civil liberties of Pakistani Americans.</p>
<p>In March, Panetta and Republican Congressman Joe Wilson had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900312">introduced a bipartisan bill</a> in the US House of Representatives, calling for sanctions on Pakistani state functionaries over alleged human rights violations.</p>
<p>A month before that, US Congressmen Joe Wilson and August Pfluger had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894451">written to Rubio</a>, urging him to engage with Pakistan to secure Imran‚Äôs release.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>During the commission‚Äôs hearing, speakers also urged Congress to oversee foreign surveillance operations on US soil and to press technology companies to resist censorship demands from foreign military courts.</p>
<p>Established in 2008 and named after Holocaust survivor and former House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Tom Lantos, the TLHRC holds bipartisan hearings to guide US human rights policy.</p>
<p>Tuesday‚Äôs session underscored longstanding concerns about Pakistan‚Äôs democratic trajectory and signalled growing interest in potential policy responses ‚Äî including targeted sanctions.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921746">deep concern</a> over the steadily shrinking space for human rights advocacy. Its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907651">annual report</a> for 2024 also highlighted a troubling dec¬≠line in civic freedoms, deteriorating law and order, and a marked strain on federalism.</p>
<p>Rights tracker <a class="link--external" href="https://monitor.civicus.org/watchlist-march-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Civicus Monitor</a> has listed Pakistan‚Äôs status as ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896892">repressed</a>‚Äù and added the country to its human rights watchlist for 2025 due to a narrowing civil space.</p>
<p>Washington DC-based organisation Freedom House ranked Pakistan as ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894421">partly free</a>‚Äù in political rights and civil liberties in its latest annual report, with the country losing three points from the year prior.</p></p>
