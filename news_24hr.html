            <p><p>Military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has rubbished rumours of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir becoming the president.</p>
<p>His statement follows a similar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923280/interior-minister-rebuts-rumours-about-president-zardari-resigning-from-office">rebuttal</a> by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi early in July, when he clarified that no idea existed “about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency”.</p>
<p>Gen Chaudhry, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general, told <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2025/08/03/pakistans-army-chief-is-cosying-up-to-donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Economist</a></em> that “talk of his boss becoming president is ‘nonsense’”.</p>
<p><em>The Economist</em> noted that COAS Munir’s popularity has surged since the May <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">conflict with India</a>. It added that the ruling coalition’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921643">recently acquired</a> two-thirds majority in the parliament needed for a Constitutional Amendment “ignited rumours that the army chief could become president too”.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856908">government</a>, as well as the military, have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1876905">repeatedly</a> warned about “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=fake%20news%20and%20propaganda%20have%20become%20so%20common%20and%20there%20is%20no%20accountability%20for%20it.%E2%80%9D">fake news and propaganda</a>” proliferating on social media, with Gen Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=theories%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20added.-,%E2%80%98Digital%20terrorism%E2%80%99,-Questioned%20about%20criticism">digital terrorism</a>” under the laws.</p>
<p>On July 10, Naqvi asserted that President Asif Ali Zardari “enjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces”.</p>
<p>He quoted the president as having “clearly” stated: “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”</p>
<p>Naqvi stressed that the “sole focus” of COAS Munir was Pakistan’s strength and stability, and “nothing else”.</p>
<p>In May, President Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formally decorated COAS Munir with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912748/president-pm-decorate-coas-munir-with-rank-of-field-marshal">rank of field marshal</a> for his “sagacious leadership and exceptional strategy” during the recent conflict with India.</p>

<p>The rank of field marshal is the highest rank of armies built on the pattern of the British Army. It has only been awarded to one other — Gen Ayub Khan — by the presidential cabinet in 1959. It is a ceremonial five-star rank that usually signifies extraordinary leadership and wartime achievement.</p>
<p>In a subsequent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913061">dinner</a> hosted by the army chief, Field Marshal Munir lauded the political leadership for their “strategic foresight” during <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> against India.</p>
<p>The next month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who belongs to PM Shehbaz’s PML-N, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918558/whats-behind-khawaja-asifs-praise-for-hybrid-system">hailed</a> the “existing hybrid model of governance” in the country. In a separate interview, he also termed it as a “practical necessity” for Pakistan, saying the system was “doing wonders”.</p></p>

            <p><p>Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal stressed Pakistan’s interest in benefitting from China’s technological progress for the development of electric vehicles (EVs), state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/06-08-2025/planning-minister-reaffirms-pakistans-interest-in-partnering-with-chinese-ev-firms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pakistan and China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/china-says-it-backs-pakistan-in-defending-sovereignty">share</a> a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure — with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884628">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media in Beijing during an official visit, the planning and development minister expressed Pakistan’s “desire to benefit from Chinese technological advancements”, according to <em>Radio Pakistan</em>.</p>
<p>This includes the development of next-generation batteries, such as sodium-ion batteries, which offer advantages over traditional lithium technology.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Iqbal also reaffirmed Pakistan’s interest in developing the EV sector in partnership with China, noting electric vehicles as a “key area of future cooperation between Pakistan and China”.</p>
<p>He stressed that establishing EV manufacturing in Pakistan would offer cost advantages for Chinese companies, adding that it would also help Pakistan to reduce its dependence on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923612/centres-policies-hindering-development-of-sindhs-energy-sector-murad">fossil fuels</a>.</p>
<p>The planning minister is currently on an official visit to China, where he is conducting meetings with officials to strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries and advance plans for economic cooperation and development.</p>
<p>Last week, Iqbal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928392">met</a> with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong in Beijing, where the two parties discussed the second phase of CPEC, industrial development and business-to-business cooperation.</p>
<p>On Sunday, he <a class="link--external" href="https://pc.gov.pk/web/press/get_press/1611" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">met with</a> the president of China’s Development Research Centre and Centre for International Knowledge on Development, Lu Hao. During the meeting, Iqbal stated that strong economic collaboration between Pakistan and China was key to national development.</p>

<p>Separately, the government yesterday approved a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929034/new-car-levy-to-power-ev-revolution">five-year subsidy scheme</a> for the rollout of 116,000 electric bikes and 3,170 electric rickshaws/loaders, with an estimated cost of around Rs100bn.</p>
<p>The scheme is part of efforts to encourage the adoption of EVs in Pakistan, reduce oil imports, and foster environmental sustainability. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to launch the initiative on August 14 formally.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928939/ttp-agrees-not-to-use-civilians-as-human-shield-in-tirah' target='_blank'><strong>TTP agrees not to use civilians as human shield in Tirah</strong></a>
            <p><p>KHYBER: The leaders of banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) agreed on Tuesday that they would not use civilians as a human shield in their armed struggle against security forces, nor would they extort money from anyone in the name of Zakat and Ushr in the restive Tirah valley of Khyber tribal district.</p>
<p>Written in Pastho on the letterhead of TTP and duly stamped by its ‘supreme council’ (Rahbari Shura), a Bar Qambarkhel elder read out the five-point agreement in front of a gathering of local tribesmen in response to their demand for ending hostilities against ordinary tribesmen and a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928146/marchers-demand-peace-as-north-waziristan-under-curfew">pullout</a> from Tirah to restore peace.</p>
<p>There was, however, no mention of a pullout from Tirah in the agreement inked between local elders and TTP. The leaders banned TTP vowed to continue their armed resistance against security forces and also punish those, who supported forces or found guilty of spying against them.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Our sole purpose is an armed struggle (jihad) against anti-Islam forces and their collaborators for which we desperately need sympathies and assistance of Muslim population. We consider our involvement in internal and personal affairs of local people as inappropriate and have thus strongly refrained our volunteers from doing so,” said the agreement.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Agreement inked between local jirga and banned outfit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The agreement made it clear that TTP members would not take shelter in private houses or use it as a bunker against security forces, but they would resist any effort by forces to either capture or eliminate them at any such private building.</p>
<p>It claimed that none of TTP members was allowed to demand any type of money from locals in the name of Ushr and Zakat and would take strict action against those, who were found guilty of doing so if locals registered any complaint against them.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The TTP leaders, through the agreement, also agreed that no one would be abducted or tortured by them as they consider it an irresponsible act, which was harming their ‘sacred armed struggle’</p>
<p>It was also agreed that TTP would investigate in accordance with Sharia the killing of innocent locals and abduction or torture by unidentified armed men for which its members were blamed and local elders would be required to provide evidence of such incidents.</p>
<p>The Tuesday’s agreement was reached between TTP and a representative jirga of Bar Qamberkhel tribe of Tirah in Bar Bagh area. The first round of the parleys was held between them on July 28 during which TTP local commanders sought time till August 5 for conveying the demands of jirga to their leadership in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Captured on video footages, the Bar Qambarkhel elders explicitly demanded an end to all types of hostilities against innocent locals and a complete pullout of all the militant groups from Tirah after a girl child was killed in a firing incident after refusal of Ushr by her parents while two handicapped bothers were also critically injured in a similar incident in July.</p>
<p>Both the incidents sparked widespread <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926949">protests</a> among local tribesmen in the valley with a procession of hundreds of Bar Qambarkhel tribesmen besieging a Markaz (centre) of TTP while holding the Holy Quran in their hands and pleading them to leave their area.</p>
<p>The Bar Qambarkhel jirga had then announced a fine of Rs5 million on those, who would pay any illegal money to TTP, and another Rs500,000 on those, who would not side with it against militant groups.</p>
<p>Reacting on social media, many a Tirah and Bara residents termed the agreement an eyewash, saying there was no mention of TTP leaving its ‘ground’. Some questioned as to why security forces failed to locate TTP leaders in Tirah and launch a targeted operation against them while the Bar Qambarkhel jirga met them twice and held negotiations with them.</p>
<p>The agreement was by and large lauded by majority of Tirah residents with the hope that they would not be harmed and harassed by militant groups as was pledged in the agreement.</p>
