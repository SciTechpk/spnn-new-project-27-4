            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923064/sbp-to-launch-pilot-for-digital-currency-says-governor' target='_blank'><strong>SBP to launch pilot for digital currency, says governor</strong></a>
            <p><p>State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Jameel Ahmad said on Wednesday the institution plans to launch a pilot for a digital currency and is finalising legislation to regulate virtual assets as the government ramps up efforts to modernise the country’s financial system.</p>
<p>Central banks globally are exploring the use of digital currencies as interest in blockchain-based payments grows. Pakistan’s move follows similar steps by regulators in China, India, Nigeria and several Gulf states to test or issue digital currencies through controlled pilot programmes.</p>
<p>At the <a class="link--external" href="https://events.reutersevents.com/nextasia" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Reuters</em> NEXT Asia</a> summit in Singapore, Ahmad said Pakistan was “building up our capacity on the central bank digital currency” and hoped to roll out a pilot soon.</p>
<p>He was speaking on a panel alongside Sri Lanka’s central bank governor, P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, with both discussing monetary policy challenges in South Asia.</p>
<p>Ahmad said a new law would “lay down the foundations for the licensing and regulation” of the virtual assets sector and that the central bank was in touch with some tech partners.</p>
<p>The move builds on efforts by the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897897">set up</a> in March by the government to drive virtual asset adoption.</p>
<p>Bilal bin Saqib, PCC chief executive officer and state minister on blockchain and crypto, said in a statement today that the government had <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/business/virtual-assets-act-2025-approved-formally/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approved</a> the  Virtual Assets Act 2025, creating an independent regulator to license and oversee the crypto sector.</p>
<p>The PCC is exploring bitcoin mining using surplus energy, has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902715">appointed</a> Binance founder Changpeng Zhao as a strategic adviser and plans to establish a state-run <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914060">Strategic Bitcoin Reserve</a>.</p>

<p>It has also held talks with US-based crypto firms, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906732">World Liberty Financial</a> linked to US President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>In May, the SBP <a class="link--external" href="https://www.sbp.org.pk/press/2025/Pr-30-May-2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">clarified</a> that virtual assets were not <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914439#:~:text=informed%20the%20National%20Assembly%E2%80%99s%20Standing%20Committee%20on%20Finance%20that%20cryptocurrency%20is%20currently%20banned">illegal</a>. However, it advised financial institutions not to engage with them until a formal licensing framework was in place.</p>
<p>“There are risks associated, and at the same time, there are opportunities in this new emerging field. So we have to evaluate and manage the risk very carefully, and at the same time not allow to let go of the opportunity,” he said on the panel.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#tight-grip-falling-interest-rates" id="tight-grip-falling-interest-rates" title="Permalink"></a>Tight grip, falling interest rates</h2>
<p>Ahmad said the SBP would continue to maintain a tight policy stance to stabilise inflation within its 5–7 per cent medium-term target.</p>
<p>Pakistan has cut its benchmark rate from a peak of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1830543">22pc</a> to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908601">11pc</a> over the past year, as inflation slumped from 38pc in May 2023 to 3.2pc in June, averaging 4.5pc in the 2025 fiscal year just ended, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921571">nine-year low</a>.</p>
<p>“We are now seeing the results of this tight monetary policy transfer, both on our inflation as well as on the external account,” he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Ahmad said Pakistan was not overly exposed to dollar weakness, noting its foreign debt was mostly dollar-denominated and only 13pc comprised Eurobonds or commercial loans.</p>
<p>“We don’t see any major impact,” he said, adding that reserves had risen to $14.5 billion from under $3bn two years ago.</p>
<p>Ahmad said Pakistan’s three-year $7bn <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">IMF programme</a>, which runs through September 2027, was on track and had resulted in reforms in fiscal policy, energy pricing and the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>“We are confident that after that [IMF programme], maybe we will not require an immediate [follow-up].”</p>
<p>Asked whether Pakistan had financing plans lined up for upcoming military equipment purchases, particularly imports from China, the SBP governor said he was not aware of such plans.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923063/dg-ispr-brands-indian-nsa-ajit-doval-chief-architect-of-terrorism-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>DG ISPR brands Indian NSA Ajit Doval ‘chief architect’ of terrorism in Pakistan</strong></a>
            <p><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Wednesday accused Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval of being the “chief architect” of terrorism in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The interview comes amid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913855/pakistan-slams-modis-inflammatory-monologue-urges-india-to-honour-international-order">tensions</a> between the two nuclear-armed countries in the wake of their recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military confrontation</a>, sparked by New Delhi’s baseless allegations against Islamabad over a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.</p>
<p>During an exclusive interview with Qatari broadcaster <em>Al Jazeera</em>, the military’s spokesperson branded Doval the “evil chief architect of India’s terror enterprise” and accused him of being responsible for not only acts of terrorism in Pakistan, but also terrorism within the region and transnational killings.</p>
<p>“Do you think it’s happening on its own? This terror enterprise cannot be sustained without the sponsorship of India,” the DG ISPR said. “Who is the chief architect? Mr Ajit Doval.”</p>
<p>According to the ISPR chief, India provided funding, planning, intelligence and technical support to terrorist groups within Pakistan, such as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917495"><em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em></a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914774#:~:text=Earlier%20during%20the%20event,%20PM%20Shehbaz%20underscored%20that%20terrorist%20groups%20under%20the%20umbrella%20of%20Fitna%20Al%20Hindustan%20sought%20the%20support%20of%20locals,%20which%20must%20be%20denied%20to%20them."><em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em></a>.</p>
<p>In July last year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349">designated</a> the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em>, while mandating all institutions to use the term <em>khariji</em> (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.</p>
<p>In May this year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525">designated</a> all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna al Hindu­stan</em> — a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">new phrase</a> aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>
<p>“The strategy of India is to keep Pakistan embroiled in this menace of terrorism, so that its true power … potential is not realised,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. “The power differential between the two countries keeps increasing, so that India can act as a regional hegemon, a bully and can dictate its own terms.”</p>
<p>He added that this strategy of supporting terrorists in the region went as far back as 1971, when India supported the Mukti Bahini in East Pakistan.</p>
<p>“Indians have acknowledged it — PM [Narendra] Modi went on record not only acknowledging but boasting about it.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The military’s spokesperson then added that terrorist commanders who had surrendered or been captured confessed that they received support from New Delhi, citing press conferences by captured <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> commanders and the case of captured Indian Navy Officer Kulbhushan Jadhav.</p>
<p>“This evidence is all public. It is RAW,” he said, referring to India’s spy agency, Research and Analysis Wing.</p>
<p>“And not only are they using men, they are also exploiting the Baloch women for these nefarious purposes.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#a-reckless-and-irresponsible-state" id="a-reckless-and-irresponsible-state" title="Permalink"></a>‘A reckless and irresponsible state’</h2>
<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry further said that Pakistan was “not a reckless and irresponsible state like India”, blaming external actors for internal issues.</p>
<p>“We must understand that terrorism is an internal problem of India as a result of the continuous oppression which India does to its minorities as part of its policy,” he said. “Rather than addressing these grave injustices, inequalities, and doing soul searching, it (India) is very quick to put all the blame on Pakistan.</p>
<p>“Because of this senseless blame game that the Indians are resorting to, it is bringing the thresholds between India and Pakistan to dangerously low levels, to such levels that where one incident of terrorism or an act of violence can be turned into an act of war.”</p>
<p>The ISPR chief warned that such an approach was putting the lives of over 1.6 billion people “in the hands of non-state actors” who had an interest in Pakistan and India going to war.</p>
<p>“We are an established and declared nuclear power, and the world has no experience of going to or even attempting to go into a misadventure against an established nuclear power,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said.</p>
<p>“If such a misadventure is taken or attempted, then it will lead to horrific consequences which the world may not be able to endure.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday said Pakistan and Turkiye were pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) for Turkish entrepreneurs in Karachi.</p>
<p>The announcement came after Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan arrived in Islamabad earlier today on an official visit. Turkiye’s Minister of National Defence Yasar Guler is also visiting Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Turkiye enjoy strong bilateral ties built on shared cultural, religious and historical bonds, as well as mutual respect. In February, the two countries pledged to boost bilateral trade to $5 billion as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891671">visited</a> Islamabad.</p>
<p>“We are pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone dedicated to Turkish entrepreneurs at Karachi,” Dar said, addressing a press conference alongside Fidan at the Foreign Office (FO).</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Dar also mentioned other engagements, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753314">revival</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1665062/freight-train-launched-to-link-istanbul-with-tehran-islamabad">Istanbul-Tehran-Islamabad</a> train, saying, “Our delegations are meeting in the coming weeks to finalise the roadmap for revival.”</p>
<p>The deputy PM further said that Pakistan has allocated land for the construction of a Maarif School in Muzaffarabad, referring to the Turkish Maarif Foundation, which Fidan said has more than 80 schools in Pakistan.</p>
<p>“A Maarif Foundation delegation is visiting Muzaffarabad today and visiting the site for evaluation,” he said.</p>
<p>Dar further stated that Turkish companies were being considered for undertaking the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1883728">Jinnah Medical Complex</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910839">Daanish University</a> megaprojects in Islamabad.</p>
<p>The Turkish companies will also be participating in offshore drilling projects and the privatisation of electricity distribution companies (Discos) in the power sector, he highlighted.</p>
<p>“We are actively engaged in different activities, including capacity building and counterterrorism,” Dar asserted.</p>
<p>He appreciated Turkiye’s indigenisation of the defence industry from 20 per cent to 80pc in the last few years, adding: “We would like to benefit from Turkiye’s experience and expertise.”</p>
<p>In his remarks, the Turkish foreign minister said defence cooperation will be further strengthened in the coming days, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/09-07-2025/pakistan-turkiye-vow-to-strengthen-economic-defence-ties" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Fidan called it a “strategic step”, emphasising that it was very important for the security of Pakistan and Turkiye. He asserted that both countries will continue to support each other in countering terrorism. Over a month ago, the two nations conducted a joint operation and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914759/is-operative-captured-at-pak-afghan-border-in-joint-pak-turkiye-intelligence-operation">arrested</a> a high-ranking terrorist.</p>
<p>Referring to the recent Pakistan-India conflict, Fidan was “appreciative of Pakistan’s wisdom-oriented attitude”, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> stated.</p>
<p>He noted that Turkiye and Pakistan were intensifying their cooperation in the field of energy, including mining, precious stones, natural gas and oil. The minister also highlighted that the two nations have expanded their relations in other fields, such as the economy, education and culture.</p>
<p>Fidan reiterated the countries’ aim to increase their commercial relations to $5bn and expressed the firm resolve to take Pakistan-Turkiye relations to a higher level, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> added.</p>
<p>Following their meetings, Dar wrote on X: “Held productive discussions on the entire gamut of bilateral relations and exchanged views on key regional and global developments.</p>
<p>’“Pakistan and Türkiye share deep-rooted bonds of brotherhood, mutual trust, and strategic cooperation,” the deputy PM stressed.</p>

<p>Separately, a high-level delegation led by Guler called on Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) chief, at the Air Headquarters in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Both officials agreed on the establishment of “dedicated joint working groups to streamline and accelerate progress across various sectors of mutual interest”, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7347" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).</p>
<p>The meeting encompassed discussions on evolving regional security dynamics, progress of ongoing defence cooperation and prospects for future collaboration in emerging domains of warfare, ISPR said.</p>

<p>The Turkish defence minister expressed sincere gratitude to the air chief for the warm reception and gracious hospitality extended by the PAF.</p>
<p>He lauded PAF’s “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">exceptional performance</a> under the insightful leadership of the air chief in the recent conflict with India, commending its operational preparedness and resolute defence of national sovereignty”, the ISPR said.</p>
<p>“Highlighting the longstanding fraternal ties between Turkiye and Pakistan, Yasar Guler conveyed Turkiye’s earnest desire to bolster bilateral defence relations through deeper industry-to-industry collaboration,” the ISPR highlighted.</p>
<p>Guler “particularly emphasised the need to explore joint ventures in cutting-edge domains, including niche disruptive technologies, advanced avionics and unmanned aerial systems”, the statement said.</p>
<p>The Turkish defence minister expressed his appreciation for PAF’s continued support in the pilot exchange programme, which he termed as a “vital initiative for fostering professional growth and operational understanding” between the two air forces.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the Air Chief Marshal Sidhu highlighted the enduring brotherly ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, emphasising the common aspirations and strategic convergence that bind the two nations.</p>

<p>He reaffirmed PAF’s “steadfast resolve to further strengthen bilateral cooperation in the domains of advanced training and aerospace technologies”, the military’s media wing said.</p>
<p>“Both dignitaries concurred on finalising the modalities for enhanced training collaboration and reaffirmed their strong commitment to expanding the scale and scope of joint bilateral and multilateral air exercises,” according to the ISPR.</p>
<p>The military’s media wing noted that the visit reflected the shared commitment of both nations to enhance strategic cooperation, solidify defence ties and promote “lasting institutional linkages” between the armed forces of Pakistan and Turkiye.</p>
