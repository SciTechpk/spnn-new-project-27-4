            <p><p>The Peshawar High Court granted protective bail to PTI leaders Shibli Faraz and Zartaj Gul Wazir on Wednesday until August 11.</p>
<p>The ECP on Tuesday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928901">disqualified</a> Faraz as the Senate opposition leader, Omar Ayub as the National Assembly equivalent, then-MNAs Wazir and Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza, and other PTI lawmakers following their convictions in cases related to the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">attacking</a> the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.</p>
<p>An anti-terrorism court in Faisalabad last week <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">senten­ced</a> over PTI 100 leaders and workers to jail terms of up to 10 years in connection with the riots. Faraz, Zartaj Gul and Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan were among those awarded rigorous imprisonment.</p>
<p>During today’s hearing on Faraz and Gul’s bail applications, the PHC issued a reserved verdict awarding them protective bail until August 11.</p>
<p>“The court orders Zartaj Gul Wazir and Shibli Faraz to appear before the concerned High Court (PHC) by August 11 and file an appeal,” the bench directed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Faraz and Ayub filed writ petitions with the PHC contesting the ECP’s disqualification order, branding it “unconstitutional” and “illegal”.</p>
<p>“In the case of Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz, the speaker of the National Assembly did not send them a reference and the Election Commission disqualified them based on the convictions,” Bashir Khan Wazir, a lawyer for the PTI leaders, argued in the petition.</p>
<p>“The Election Commission’s order is unconstitutional and illegal and cannot disqualify members without the speaker’s reference.”</p>
<p>A day prior, Ayub lambasted the ATC’s “bogus verdict” in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/OmarAyubKhan/status/1952737607013576874" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, saying that he would contest it and the ECP’s disqualification in court.</p>
<p>He also posted a video of himself at the PHC with other PTI leaders and lawyers, saying the court had given him a few days and bail would be granted to him on filing his appeal.</p>

            <p><p>A Pakistan Mart will be established in Dubai to boost the “global footprint” of exports, state media <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/06-08-2025/pakistan-uae-to-establish-pakistan-mart-in-dubai" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884644">trading partners</a> in the Middle East and a major source of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884404#:~:text=while%20the%20UAE%20recorded%20the%20highest%20growth%20at%2054pc%2C%20with%20inflows%20totalling%20%243.58bn.">remittances</a>, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media about the project, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan called it a “game changer for Pakistani trade boost”.</p>
<p>He was quoted as saying, “The Pakistan Mart will facilitate Pakistani traders, enabling them to export their products to regions across the world.”</p>
<p>“The initiative is spearheaded by the National Logistics Corporation of Pakistan and the DP World company of UAE,” the report added.</p>
<p>Last month, trade with the UAE showed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925706">upward trend</a>. Pakistan’s key export items to the UAE include rice, bovine meat, cotton garments, mangoes, and guavas.</p>
<p>Exports increased 1.87 per cent to $2.121 billion in FY25 from $2.082bn last year. In FY24, exports to the UAE had surged 41.15pc, largely due to increased shipments to Dubai. Imports from the UAE rose 25.75pc to $7.958bn in FY25 from $6.328bn a year ago.</p>
<p>Overall, the country’s trade deficit with the Middle East widened by 7.37pc to $13.974bn in FY25 from $13.014bn a year ago, primarily due to a sharp increase in petroleum imports.</p></p>

            <p><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit China for the first time in over seven years, a government source said on Wednesday, in a further sign of a diplomatic thaw with Beijing as tensions with the United States rise.</p>
<p>Modi will go to China for a summit of the multilateral Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) that begins on Augst 31, the government source, with direct knowledge of the matter, told <em>Reuters</em>. India’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>His trip will come at a time when India’s relationship with the US faces its most serious crisis in years after President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927587">imposed the highest tariffs</a> among Asian peers on goods imported from India, and has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928905/trump-says-he-will-very-substantially-raise-tariffs-on-india-in-next-24-hours-over-russian-oil-purchases">threatened</a> an unspecified further penalty for New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil.</p>
<p>Modi’s visit to the Chinese city of Tianjin for the summit of the SCO, a Eurasian political and security grouping that includes Russia, will be his first since June 2018. Subsequently, Sino-Indian ties deteriorated sharply after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1563892">military clash</a> along their disputed Himalayan border in 2020.</p>
<p>Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867103">held talks</a> on the sidelines of a BRICS summit in Russia in October that led to a thaw. The giant Asian neighbours are now slowly defusing tensions that have hampered business relations and travel between the two countries.</p>
<p>Trump has threatened to charge an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922652/trump-announces-up-to-40pc-tariffs-on-several-nations">additional 10pc tariff</a> on imports from members — which include India — of the BRICS group of major emerging economies for “aligning themselves with anti-American policies”.</p>
<p>Trump said on Wednesday his administration would decide on the penalty for buying Russian oil after the outcome of US efforts to seek a last-minute breakthrough that would bring about a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Trump’s top diplomatic envoy, Steve Witkoff, is in Moscow, two days before the expiry of a deadline the president set for Russia to agree to peace in Ukraine or face new sanctions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is in Russia on a scheduled visit and is expected to discuss India’s purchases of Russian oil in the wake of Trump’s pressure on India to stop buying Russian crude, according to another government source, who also did not want to be named.</p>
<p>Doval is likely to address India’s defence cooperation with Russia, including obtaining faster access to pending exports to India of Moscow’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1436971">S400 air defence system</a>, and a possible visit by President Vladimir Putin to India.</p>
<p>Doval’s trip will be followed by Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in the weeks to come.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#export-impact" id="export-impact" title="Permalink"></a>Export impact</h2>
<p>US and Indian officials told <em>Reuters</em> a mix of political misjudgement, missed signals and bitterness scuttled trade deal negotiations between the world’s biggest and fifth-largest economies, whose bilateral trade is worth over $190 billion.</p>
<p>India expects Trump’s crackdown could cost it a competitive advantage in about $64bn worth of goods sent to the US that account for 80pc of its total exports, four separate sources told <em>Reuters</em>, citing an internal government assessment.</p>
<p>However, the relatively low share of exports in India’s $4 trillion economy is expected to limit the direct impact on economic growth.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Reserve Bank of India left its GDP growth forecast for the current April-March financial year unchanged at 6.5pc and held rates steady despite the tariff uncertainties.</p>
<p>India’s government assessment report has assumed a 10pc penalty for buying Russian oil, which would take the total US tariff to 35pc, the sources said.</p>
<p>India’s trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The internal assessment report is the government’s initial estimate and will change as the quantum of tariffs imposed by Trump becomes clear, all four sources said.</p>
<p>India exported goods estimated at around $81bn in 2024 to the U.S.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch    media--uneven  media--stretch">

<p>The South Asian nation’s goods exports to the US constituted 2pc of GDP in 2024. Its total goods exports globally were at $443bn in 2024.</p>

<p>The proposed tariffs on India’s high-value exports face “erosion of price competitiveness encountering intensified rivalry from countries subject to lower duties”, two sources said, citing the internal assessment.</p></p>
