            <p><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday said that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910113/world-community-hails-ceasefire-decision-between-pakistan-and-india">ceasefire</a> between India and Pakistan was extended until May 18, adding that the matter will “ultimately go to dialogue” between the civilian leadership of the two nations.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">American intervention</a> for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>On Monday, the director general of military operations for both sides <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910567">held</a> the first round of talks via hotline after the ceasefire.</p>
<p>Speaking in the Senate today, FM Dar said that a military-to-military conversation took place between the two countries today, where they decided to extend the ceasefire until May 18.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, the matter will go to dialogue between the civilian leadership of the countries,” FM Dar said. “Right now, these are military-to-military communications.”</p>
<p>He said that a political dialogue would take place between the two countries and that a “resolution for all the problems will be discussed”.</p>
<p>“We have told the world that we will carry out a composite dialogue,” Dar said.</p>
<p>A day prior, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911132">invited</a> India to a comprehensive dialogue to address all contentious issues, including the Kashmir dispute and the water distribution, between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)</em>, Dar said that Pakistan did not request a ceasefire during the recent escalation with India.</p>
<p>Instead, it [ceasefire] was initiated following a call from the US Secretary of State, who conveyed that India was willing to halt hostilities, Dar said.</p>
<p>Dar emphasised that Pakistan had exercised restraint and communicated this to all friendly nations even before the outbreak of hostilities.</p>
<p>“We told our friends we would not initiate an attack, but we would certainly respond if provoked,” he said, adding that Pakistan’s response was measured, decisive, and in line with international norms.</p>

<p>Separately, the Senate passed a resolution paying tribute to the armed forces for demonstrating “unwavering resolve, unparalleled Professionalism, and steadfast dedication in the successful execution of Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos.”</p>
<p>The resolution, presented by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, said the operation was carried out with exceptional restraint and maturity, reflecting the conduct of a responsible nuclear state.</p>
<p>It congratulated the people of Pakistan for rising above all political, ethnic, and ideological divides and differences, demonstrating unity in support of national leadership across the political spectrum and speaking with one voice and one purpose to defend the people, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and dignity of the country.</p>
<p>It honoured the sacrifices of the valiant martyrs who laid down their lives in the defence of the sovereignty and national honour of the country.</p>
<p>It condemned “the brutal and unprovoked Indian attacks on innocent civilians, including women, children and mosques”.</p>
<p>It urged the government to proactively engage the international community for a peaceful, just and lasting resolution of the Indian-held Kashmir, stressing the critical importance of strict adherence to the Indus water treaty.</p></p>

            <p><p>Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Thursday warned in an interview with British broadcaster <em><a class="link--external" href="https://news.sky.com/story/pakistan-vows-swift-response-if-india-violates-ceasefire-13368060" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sky News</a></em> that any Indian ceasefire violation would be met with a “swift and assured response” by Pakistan, cautioning that serious escalation could result in mutual destruction.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>.

It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>On May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">announced</a> that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan. According to the government, forty civilians — including seven women and 15 children — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910733">lost</a> their lives in the Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Sky News</em>, DG ISPR warned that by rooting for war, India was carving out a “recipe for mutual destruction,” adding that the world now recognised the extent of the nuclear threat.</p>
<p>“Any sane player like the USA understands this absurdity and what the Indians are trying to do here,” Lt Gen Chaudhry told the publications.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Talking about India’s actions in Kashmir, he accused the country of trying to “internalise the issue and harassing” Kashmiri people with a heavy troop presence.</p>
<p>“It is a problem that has to be resolved by the people of Kashmir as per the United Nations Security Council resolution,” he said.</p>
<p>He continued: “Anyone who tries to violate our territory and integrity and sovereignty, our response will be brutal.”</p>
<p>DG ISPR warned that a “serious escalation between India and Pakistan would destroy both sides” under the concept of mutually assured destruction — a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy which posits that a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by an attacker on a nuclear-armed defender with second-strike capabilities would result in the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender.</p>
<p>In a press conference <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910381">held</a> last week after the ceasefire was brokered, DG ISPR had cautioned that a conflict between Islamabad and New Delhi “can lead to peril of more than 1.6 billion people.”</p>
<p>“In reality, there is no space for war between India and Pakistan,” he added.</p></p>

            <p><p>US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook and told him not to expand his production facilities in India, but to do so in America.</p>
<p>“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump said during his visit to Qatar.</p>
<p>“I said to him, Tim, you’re my friend, I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now you’re building all over India,” he said, referring to Apple’s plan announced in February to invest $500bn in the US over the next four years.</p>

<p>Trump said he informed Cook that he does not want him to build production facilities in India, and that Apple will be “upping their production in the United States”.</p>
<p>The US president claimed that selling American goods in the world’s most populous country is “very difficult” because India has one of the highest tariff barriers in the world.</p>
<p>However, he noted that while the Asian country looks for a deal on import duties, India has offered them a “no-tariff” deal.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Trump’s remarks came after Tim Cook said earlier this month that the majority of Apple’s products to be sold in the US in the coming months will be sourced from India and Vietnam rather than China, which has been the target of US President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911203/india-has-offered-us-a-trade-deal-with-no-tariffs-trump">highest tariffs</a>.</p>
<p>“We do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin,” Cook said.</p>
<p>The primary production location “for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods products sold in the US” will be Vietnam in the meantime.</p>
<p>Cook noted that the great bulk of all products sold outside the US will continue to be manufactured in China.</p>
<p>Apple is among the most impacted tech firms in the US, with its shares falling by around 5.1 per cent since the tariffs were announced.</p>
<p>Due to low production costs, the majority of Apple products are now manufactured in China.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has repeatedly stated that it wants Apple to move production to the US.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the US and China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910528">agreed</a> to a sweeping rollback of punitive tariffs for an initial 90-day period, signalling a rare moment of relief in their protracted trade conflict and raising hopes for longer-term economic stability.</p></p>
