            <p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he has nominated Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, presenting the US president with a letter he sent to the prize committee.</p>
<p>The move comes as Israel continues its onslaught on Gaza, which has so far killed 57,523 Palestinians. Last year, the UN-backed International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1874034">issued</a> arrest warrants for Netanyahu, citing allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court said he, along with ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, “intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival”, including food, water, medicine, fuel, and electricity.</p>
<p>“He’s forging peace as we speak, in one country, in one region after the other,” Netanyahu said at a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922520">dinner</a> with Trump at the White House.</p>

<p>Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514">nominations</a> from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years and has made no secret of his irritation at missing out on the prestigious award.</p>
<p>The Republican has complained that he had been overlooked by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">mediating role</a> in conflicts between India and Pakistan, as well as Serbia and Kosovo.</p>
<p>In 2024, he <a class="link--external" href="https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/trump-grumbles-about-obama-s-nobel-peace-prize-and-claims-he-deserved-it-more/ar-AA1sVZiM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">insisted</a> that he was more deserving of a Nobel than ex-president Barack Obama, and complained how it was unfair that “anybody else” but him would have been honoured with one.</p>
<p>In June, Pakistan had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514/govt-to-recommend-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize-for-decisive-diplomatic-intervention-in-india-pakistan-crisis">decided</a> to formally recommend Trump for the coveted prize, given his role in de-escalating the India-Pakistan conflict when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">US mediation</a>.</p>
<p>However, as the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">joined</a> Israel’s war with Iran and launched attacks on three Iranian nuclear facilities, Pakistani lawmakers, activists, authors and ex-diplomats criticised the move. A resolution was also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919467#:~:text=In%20the%20resolution,in%20the%20region.%E2%80%9D">submitted</a> in the Senate by the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl to rescind the decision but led to no tangible outcome as Pakistan had not officially submitted the nomination.</p>
<p>Trump has also demanded credit for “keeping peace” between Egypt and Ethiopia and brokering the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements aiming to normalise relations between Israel and several Arab nations.</p>
<p>He campaigned for office as a “peacemaker” who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging more than five months into his presidency.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922775/texas-flood-toll-passes-100-as-more-bodies-recovered' target='_blank'><strong>Texas flood toll passes 100 as more bodies recovered</strong></a>
            <p><p>The death toll from catastrophic flooding in Texas rose to more than 100 on Monday, as rescuers continued their grim search for people swept away by torrents of water.</p>
<p>Among the dead were at least 27 girls and counsellors who were staying at a youth summer camp on a river when disaster struck over the Fourth of July holiday weekend.</p>
<p>Forecasters have warned of more flooding as rain falls on saturated ground, complicating recovery efforts involving helicopters, boats, dogs and some 1,750 personnel.</p>
<p>“There is still a threat of heavy rain with the potential to cause flooding,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott said in a statement Monday, with the number of victims expected to rise still.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump confirmed he planned to visit Texas on Friday, as the White House slammed critics claiming his cuts to weather agencies had weakened warning systems.</p>
<p>“Blaming President Trump for these floods is a depraved lie, and it serves no purpose during this time of national mourning,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday.</p>
<p>She said the National Weather Service, which <em>The New York Times</em> reported had several key roles in Texas unfilled before the floods, issued “timely and precise forecasts and warnings.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Trump has described the floods that struck in the early hours of Friday as a “100-year catastrophe” that “nobody expected.” The president, who previously said disaster relief should be handled at the state level, has signed a major disaster declaration, activating fresh federal funds and freeing up resources.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#tragedy" id="tragedy" title="Permalink"></a>‘Tragedy’</h2>
<p>At least 104 flood-related deaths were reported across central Texas.
Kerr County, through which the Guadalupe River runs, was the hardest hit, with at least 84 people killed including 28 children, according to the local sheriff’s office.</p>
<p>The toll includes 27 who had been staying at Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian camp that was housing about 750 people when the floodwaters struck.
Camps are a beloved tradition in the long US summer holidays, with children often staying in woods, parks and other rural areas.</p>
<p>Texas Senator Ted Cruz described them as a chance to make “lifetime friends — and then suddenly it turns to tragedy.”</p>
<p>But some residents were questioning the absence of more robust flood-warning systems in this region of south and central Texas — where such deluges are so frequent that it is known colloquially as “Flash Flood Alley.”</p>
<p>Experts stress the NWS sent out timely forecasts, and climate scientist Daniel Swain pinned the problem on a failure of “warning dissemination.” San Antonio mother Nicole Wilson—  who almost sent her daughters to Camp Mystic — launched a petition on Change.org urging Governor Greg Abbott to approve a modern warning network.</p>
<p>“Five minutes of that siren going off could have saved every single one of those children,” she told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>At a candlelight vigil in San Antonio on Monday night, Texans gathered to pray for the victims of the floods and voice lingering fears.</p>
<p>“I was pretty shocked on the gravity of the situation and how big it was, and I wouldn’t necessarily expect that our rivers would rise so quickly,” said Rebeca Gutierrez, 29.</p>
<p>“Hopefully there’s preventative efforts happening in similar areas to make sure nothing to this degree happens.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#two-story-building" id="two-story-building" title="Permalink"></a>Two-story building</h2>
<p>In a terrifying display of nature’s power, the rain-swollen waters of the Guadalupe River reached treetops and the roofs of cabins as girls at the camp slept.</p>
<p>Blankets, teddy bears and other belongings were caked in mud. Windows in the cabins were shattered, apparently by the force of the water.</p>
<p>Volunteers were helping search through debris from the river, with some motivated by personal connections to the victims.</p>
<p>“We’re helping the parents of two of the missing children,” Louis Deppe, 62, told <em>AFP</em>. “The last message they got was ‘We’re being washed away,’ and the phone went dead.”</p>
<p>Months’ worth of rain fell in a matter of hours on Thursday night into Friday, and rain has continued in bouts since then.</p>
<p>The Guadalupe surged around 26 feet (eight meters) — more than a two-story building – in just 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Flash floods occur when the ground is unable to absorb torrential rainfall.
Human-driven climate change has made extreme weather events such as floods, droughts and heat waves more frequent and more intense in recent years.</p></p>

            <p><p>LAHORE: Police arrested a 14-year-old boy on Sunday night after he recklessly drove a car, crashing into three motorcycles and killing a young man on the spot in Shahdara Town. Two others sustained injuries, one of them critically.</p>
<p>In a related development, the Lahore investigation SSP suspended an investigator for allegedly misbehaving with the victim’s family when they approached him for the timely postmortem examination of the body.</p>
<p>The accident came to the limelight when footage of the car went viral on social media.</p>
<p>According to police, the underage driver, identified as Hashir Ali — a Grade 7 student — was driving at over 120kph on a road leading to a village in Shahdara when he struck the motorcycles. The deceased was identified as Malik Amin, while his brother Malik Farid was among the injured.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Investigator suspended for ‘misbehaviour with victim’s family’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The injured were rushed to a local hospital where the condition of one of them was stated to be critical due to head injuries.</p>
<p>After receipt of information, SP Bilal Ahmad and other police officials rushed to the site, got the underage driver arrested and seized the car.</p>
<p>The police expanded the scope of investigation, examined the nearby cameras installed privately and those managed by the Safe City Authority besides reaching to the family of the arrested boy.</p>
<p>Sharing details of the initial findings, the SP said Hashir was living with his maternal grandmother after the separation of his parents following domestic issues.</p>
<p>He said Hashir’s mother had contracted a second marriage while his father, who runs a private business, left him to be looked after by his (boy’s) grandmother.</p>
<p>The grandmother of the boy was living in a rented house, Bilal said, adding that on Sunday night Hashir picked up the keys of the car.</p>
<p>The car belonged to the owner of the house Khurram Ijaz who was holding a key position at a pharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>The SP added Khurram Ijaz had gone to the house of his sister in Ravi Road area at the time when Hashir took his car to the road.</p>
<p>He said the teen first hit a cyclist after exiting the parking stand and then ran over three motorbikes.</p>
<p>The boy escaped unhurt in the accident which, however, led to the death of a young man on the spot and injuries to two others.</p>
<p>“We immediately seized the car, arrested the underage driver and lodged a case against him,” the SP said adding that the case was transferred to the investigation wing police for further action.</p>
<p>There were reports that the victim’s family and other local residents lodged a protest outside the Shahdara Town police station alleging that the investigation officer misbehaved with the complainant of the FIR when he demanded autopsy of the body.</p>
<p>Lahore Investigation SSP Mohammad Naveed confirmed to <em>Dawn</em> saying the investigator mishandled the matter when the complainant approached him.</p>
<p>Following the complaint, he said, he ordered immediate suspension of investigation the officer and reassigned the case to the investigation station in-charge for further proceedings.</p>

<p><strong>UNDERAGE DRIVING:</strong> In the past, a fatal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1788906">accident</a> which claimed lives of six members of a family, including two infants and two women in Defence Phase 7 in Nov 2023, had sparked outrage when a speeding car driven by a teenage boy rammed into their vehicle.</p>
<p>The family was reportedly returning home in two cars after visiting relatives in Shadab Colony on Ferozpur Road. As they reached near a roundabout, the car driven by a teenage boy rammed into their vehicle. The collision was so intense that the vehicle overturned and was badly damaged.</p>
<p>This incident had led to a high-level meeting in the Lahore police where the senior police officers issued an order for action at a large-scale against the rash and reckless driving, particularly by the underage.</p>
