            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday urged the United Nations Security Council and the international community to bring about an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, along with unrestricted humanitarian access amid a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925922/un-says-israeli-forces-kill-over-1000-aid-seekers-21-die-from-starvation">food crisis</a> in the besieged territory.</p>
<p>Gaza’s population of more than two million people is facing severe shortages of food and other essentials, with residents frequently killed as they try to collect humanitarian aid at a handful of distribution points.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>The UN on Tuesday said Israeli forces have killed over 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food aid in Gaza since the US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) started operations. An officially private effort, the GHF began operations on May 26 after Israel halted supplies into the Gaza Strip for more than two months, sparking famine warnings. GHF operations have been marred by chaotic scenes and near-daily reports of Israeli forces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925553/israeli-forces-kill-115-palestinians-waiting-for-un-aid">firing on people waiting</a> to collect rations in the Palestinian territory, where the Israeli military is seeking to destroy Hamas.</p>
<p>The crisis was addressed by FM Dar as he chaired the UNSC’s Quarterly Open Debate on the “Situation in the Middle East including the Palestinian Question”.</p>
<p>“It is time to give the Palestinian people what they have been denied for too long: justice, freedom, dignity, and a state of their own. That is the path to durable peace and stability in the Middle East,” FM Dar said.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>He emphasised that the path to lasting peace lay in upholding international law, ending foreign occupation, rejecting the use of force and advancing solutions through dialogue and diplomacy.</p>
<p>“Gaza has become a graveyard for innocent lives as well as for international law,” Dar said, citing systematic attacks on hospitals, schools, refugee camps and aid convoys.</p>
<p>He emphasised that the unfolding hunger crisis, with a third of Gaza’s population going days without food, was a dire warning of “catastrophic levels of food insecurity”.</p>
<p>Calling the Palestinian issue a litmus test for the UN’s credibility, FM Dar warned that failure to act decisively would embolden impunity and erode the international rules-based order.</p>

<p>He urged the UNSC to pursue with unity and urgency, concrete measures, including an immediate, permanent and unconditional ceasefire across Gaza and the Occupied Palestinian Territories with full implementation of Resolution 2735, unfettered humanitarian access and protection for aid workers, urgent restoration of food and medical supply lines, renewed support for the UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees, an end to forced displacement and illegal settlement expansion, particularly in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, implementation of the Arab and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation-led reconstruction plan for Gaza and revival of a time-bound political process to achieve a two-state solution in accordance with UN resolutions and international law.</p>
<p>Reaffirming Pakistan’s support for a sovereign Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders with Jerusalem as its capital, FM Dar welcomed recent momentum toward Palestine’s recognition and UN membership.</p>
<p>He highlighted the upcoming International Conference on the Two-State Solution, co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and France, as a key opportunity for renewed diplomatic progress.</p>
<p>Dar also addressed broader regional issues, urging peaceful resolution of conflicts in Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, and condemning recent Israeli military actions in Iran.</p>
<p>He reiterated Pakistan’s support for multilateral diplomacy and adherence to international law as the only path to regional peace and stability.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926082/worlds-top-court-paves-way-for-climate-reparations' target='_blank'><strong>World’s top court paves way for climate reparations</strong></a>
            <p><p>The world’s highest court on Wednesday declared that states are obligated under international law to tackle climate change and warned that failing to do so could open the door to reparations.</p>
<p>In a historic ruling, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said climate change was an “urgent and existential threat” and states had a legal duty to prevent harm from their planet-warming pollution.</p>
<p>Countries breaching their climate obligations were committing a “wrongful act”, the court said in its advisory opinion, which is not legally binding but carries significant moral, political and legal weight.</p>
<p>“The legal consequences resulting from the commission of an internationally wrongful act may include … full reparations to injured states in the form of restitution, compensation and satisfaction,” said ICJ President Yuji Iwasawa on behalf of the 15-judge panel.</p>
<p>This would be on a case-by-case basis where a “sufficient direct and certain causal nexus” had been shown “between the wrongful act and the injury”, the court added.</p>
<p>Historically, rich, industrialised countries have been responsible for the majority of emissions. Iwasawa said these countries had to take the lead in addressing the problem.</p>
<p>Campaigners and countries on the climate frontlines hailed a milestone moment in the fight for accountability from big polluters most responsible for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913992">global warming.</a></p>
<p>Ralph Regenvanu, the climate change minister for Vanuatu, the small Pacific island nation which spearheaded the case at the Hague, was jubilant.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>AFP</em> outside the court, Regenvanu said it was “a very strong opinion at the end” and better than hoped.</p>
<p>“We can use these arguments when we talk with our partners, some of the high-emitting states. We can say you have a legal obligation to help us,” he said.</p>
<p>“This helps us in our arguments. It’s going to give us a lot more leverage … in all negotiations.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#catalyst-for-change" id="catalyst-for-change" title="Permalink"></a>Catalyst for change</h2>
<p>This was the biggest case in ICJ history, and seen as the most consequential in a recent string of landmark climate rulings.</p>
<p>The United Nations had tasked the 15 judges at the ICJ, a UN court in the Hague that adjudicates disputes between nations, to answer two fundamental questions.</p>
<p>First: What must states do under international law to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions for the future?</p>
<p>Second: What are the consequences for states whose emissions have caused environmental harm, especially to vulnerable low-lying island states?</p>
<p>In a detailed summary of the opinion, Iwasawa said the climate “must be protected for present and future generations”.</p>
<p>The adverse effect of a warming planet “may significantly impair the enjoyment of certain human rights, including the right to life”, he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Legal and climate experts said the opinion, while not legally binding, could have far-reaching consequences for national courts, legislation and public debate.</p>
<p>“The court’s clear and detailed articulation of state obligations will be a catalyst for accelerated climate action and unprecedented accountability,” David Boyd, a former UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said the ruling bound all nations by international law to prevent harm from emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>The court was “pointing the direction for the entire world and making clear that every nation is legally obliged to solve the climate crisis”, he told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#classroom-to-court" id="classroom-to-court" title="Permalink"></a>Classroom to court</h2>
<p>Courts have become a key battleground for climate action as frustration has grown over sluggish progress toward curbing planet-warming pollution from fossil fuels.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1226151/paris-agreement-turning-point-for-world-climate-says-obama">Paris Agreement</a>, struck through the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), has rallied a global response to the crisis, but not at the speed necessary to protect the world from dangerous overheating.</p>
<p>The journey to the Hague began six years ago with students from the climate-imperilled Pacific region fed up with the lack of accountability for the damage afflicting their homelands.</p>
<p>The fight pitted major wealthy economies against the smaller, less developed states, which are most at the mercy of a warming planet.</p>
<p>More than 100 nations and groups made submissions in the Hague, many from the Pacific who gave impassioned appeals in colourful traditional dress.</p>
<p>“It’s such a perfect ending to a campaign that started in a classroom,” said Vishal Prasad, director of the student-led campaign that kicked off the case.</p>
<p>“We have now a very, very strong tool to hold power accountable, and we must do that now. The ICJ has given everything possible,” he told <em>AFP</em> in the Hague.</p>
<p>John Kerry, the former US special envoy for climate change, told <em>AFP</em>, “It should not take the stamp of international law to motivate countries to do what is already profoundly in their economic interests.</p>
<p>“We shouldn’t need another reason to act and accelerate action.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The ruling could also make it easier for states to hold other states to account over climate issues like pollution or emissions.</p>
<p>“The court can affirm that climate inaction, especially by major emitters, is not merely a policy failure but a breach of international law,” said Fijian Vishal Prasad, one of the law students who lobbied the government of Vanuatu in the South Pacific Ocean to bring the case to the ICJ.</p>
<p>Although it is theoretically possible to ignore an ICJ ruling, lawyers say countries are typically reluctant to do so.</p>
<p>“This opinion is applying binding international law, which countries have already committed to,” Chowdhury said.</p></p>

<p>Pakistan previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911132">invited</a> India to a comprehensive dialogue to address all contentious issues, including the Kashmir dispute and the water distribution.</p>
<p>During a meeting with British High Commissioner Jane Marriott today, PM Shehbaz appreciated the UK’s role in de-escalating tensions during the Pakistan-India standoff and reiterated that Pakistan was ready for a meaningful dialogue with India on all outstanding issues.</p>
<p>He welcomed the British government’s decision to resume <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924570/uk-lifts-ban-on-pakistani-airlines-removes-country-from-air-safety-list">PIA flights</a> to the UK. He said, “This [decision] would go a long way in alleviating the hardships faced by the British-Pakistani community as well as enhancing people-to-people exchanges,” while appreciating the role of the high commissioner.</p>
<p>Both sides discussed the “positive trajectory” of bilateral relations. The prime minister said that the recently held <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924280/pakistan-uk-ink-accord-to-boost-economic-cooperation">trade talks</a> between the two countries would lead to mutually beneficial opportunities for both sides. “Pakistan is also cooperating closely with the UK at the UN Security Council, where Pakistan currently holds the monthly Presidency,” he said.</p>
<p>Marriott briefed PM Shehbaz about her recent visit to London, where she had extensive consultations on enhancing bilateral ties.</p>
<p>She lauded the Pakistani government’s recent economic performance which brought about a significant improvement in key macroeconomic indicators. She also discussed the UK’s perspective on regional developments in South Asia and the Middle East.</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#un-envoy-hits-back-at-india-for-cross-border-terrorism-claims" id="un-envoy-hits-back-at-india-for-cross-border-terrorism-claims" title="Permalink"></a>UN envoy hits back at India for cross-border terrorism claims</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Pakistan’s envoy to the UNSC, Ambassador Usman Jadoon, rejected Indian allegations of cross-border terrorism and asked India to change its behaviour, instead of resorting to its “tired narrative of victimhood and blame-shifting”, during the UNSC debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes” on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Indian envoy was reacting to Deputy PM Dar’s speech in New York during the reception hosted for Pakistan’s presidency of the UNSC, where the latter underscored the need for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute.</p>
<p>“It is India which actively sponsors, aids and abets terrorism in my country and beyond,” Ambassador Jadoon, deputy permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, told the 15-member body on Tuesday evening, while responding to allegations made by India’s UN Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish.</p>
<p>“Rather than being blinded by hubris and a misplaced sense of impunity, and instead of resorting to its tired narrative of victimhood and blame-shifting, India must introspect seriously, change its behaviour and comply with its international legal obligations on all counts,” he said, in the debate convened by Pakistan to promote pacific settlement of disputes between nations.</p>
<p>Ambassador Jadoon said that it was especially regrettable that the Indian ambassador targeted Pakistan yesterday, when earlier in the day, the council “spoke with a unanimous voice to reaffirm the purposes and principles of the UN charter and the imperative of peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for international law and effective implementation of the resolution of the security council”.</p>
<p>The Pakistani envoy pointed out that firstly, India was in illegal occupation of the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>“While claiming to abide by the UN charter, and purportedly the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes, India has been in violation of security council resolutions on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, and has refused to implement those resolutions, thereby denying the Kashmiri people the exercise of their inalienable right to self-determination,” he said.</p>
<p>“India’s egregious violations of human rights which extend beyond the occupied territory of Jammu and Kashmir and encompass its appalling treatment of minorities has been widely reported by international human rights organisations,” Jadoon added.</p>
<p>He also said that India had “stooped to a new low” of unilaterally and illegally holding in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">abeyance</a> the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, with the stated aim of depriving the people of Pakistan of water from the Indus river system.</p>
<p>“In gross violation of international law, India resorted to blatant aggression against my country between 7-10 May, targeting civilians, including women and children,” the ambassador said.</p>
<p>He highlighted Pakistan’s “befitting but measured response” in accordance with its right to self-defence, aimed exclusively at military targets, that resulted in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">downing</a> of six Indian aircraft that took part in the aggression, among other significant military losses.</p>
<p>“The hostilities came to an end owing to Pakistan’s position of strength and responsible approach, and facilitation of the US, as also highlighted in the statement of the US this morning, “ Jadoon told the delegates.</p>
<p>“It is ironic that India, which itself brought the Jammu and Kashmir dispute to the security council, refuses to implement the resolutions adopted by the council to peacefully resolve this dispute,” he added.</p>

<p>Obviously stung by the success of Pakistan’s signature event at the council, the Indian envoy had claimed that Pakistan was “steeped in fanaticism and terrorism”, and a “serial borrower from the International Monetary Fund”.</p>
<p>The debate will resume on July 24 to listen to the remaining speakers, after listening to scores of high-level representatives.</p></p>
