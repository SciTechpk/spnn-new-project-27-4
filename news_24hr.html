            <p><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi turned down an invitation from United States President Donald Trump to visit the White House over concern that he would setup a meeting with Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-08/trump-s-50-india-tariff-threats-upend-decades-of-us-policy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on Friday.</p>
<p>Trump on Wednesday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929119/trump-imposes-additional-25pc-tariff-on-indian-goods-relations-hit-new-low">imposed</a> an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, citing New Delhi’s continued imports of Russian oil in a move that sharply escalated tensions between the two nations after trade talks reached a deadlock. The new import tax, set to come into place in three weeks, will raise duties on some Indian exports to as high as 50pc — among the highest levied on any US trading partner.</p>
<p>While the rupture in US-India ties was abrupt, there have been strains in the relationship. Delhi has repeatedly rebutted Trump’s repeated statements that the US brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after four days of fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Trump also hosted Pakistan’s army chief at the White House in the weeks following the conflict.</p>
<p>The two leaders <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917877">spoke</a> over the phone at the insistence of Trump on the sidelines of June’s G7 summit in Canada, which Modi attended as a guest. The call lasted 35 minutes.</p>
<p>“PM Modi told President Trump clearly that during this period, there was no talk at any stage on subjects like India-US trade deal or US mediation between India and Pakistan,” Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had said of the talk. “Talks for ceasing military action happened directly between India and Pakistan through existing military channels, and on the insistence of Pakistan. Prime Minister Modi emphasised that India has not accepted mediation in the past and will never do,” he said.</p>
<p><em>Bloomberg</em> reported today that “tensions came to a head” between the two leaders in the call with Trump’s repeated claiming of credit and India’s downplaying of the matter.</p>
<p>“Modi felt like he needed to set the record straight in the call after his aides discovered that Trump planned to host a lunch the following day at the White House for Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir,” the report cited officials in New Delhi familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to speak about confidential discussions.</p>
<p>“While India had no problem if Trump met Pakistan’s civilian leaders, hosting Munir was seen as giving legitimacy to a military that Modi’s government accuses of supporting militant groups, they said. Wary that Trump would look to orchestrate a meeting between Munir and Modi, the Indian leader turned down an invitation to stop by the White House on the way back from Canada, they said, adding that he was also committed to visiting Croatia,” the report said.</p>
<p>It added that since the phone call, “India saw a shift in tone from the White House after that phone call, according to the officials in New Delhi” despite the US not making a direct request for Modi to acknowledge Trump’s role.</p>
<p>“Once Trump began publicly attacking India, they added, it was clear the episode marked a turning point in the broader relationship,” the report said.</p>
<p>Modi said a day ago he would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929293">not compromise</a> on the agriculture sector.</p>
<p>For New Delhi, one of the main sticking points in trade negotiations has been Washington’s demand to access India’s vast agricultural and dairy market. India has remained steadfast about its labour-intensive agricultural sector, unwilling to risk angering farmers, a powerful voting bloc.</p>
<p>“We will not compromise with the interests of our farmers, our dairy sector, our fishermen,” Modi said during a speech at a conference in New Delhi, his remarks widely seen as his first public response to the tariffs.</p>
<p>“I know I will have to pay a personal price for this, but I am ready for it,” he added, without giving further details.</p>
<p>In February, Trump said that he found a “special bond” with Modi when he visited Washington — complimenting Modi as being a “much tougher negotiator” than he was.</p>
<p>Successive US administrations have seen India — the world’s most populous nation and fifth-largest economy — as a key partner, with like-minded interests in the face of powerful China.</p>
<p>India and neighbouring China have long been intense rivals competing for strategic influence across South Asia.</p>
<p>Now, India is bracing for a bumpy ride, as the US is its largest trading partner, with New Delhi shipping goods worth $87.4 billion in 2024.</p></p>

            <p><p>Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) founder Altaf Hussain was hospitalised again in London on Friday after falling ill.</p>
<p>In a post on the party’s X account, it said: “The health of MQM founder and leader Altaf Hussain has deteriorated again, after which he has been taken to a local hospital. According to details released by the MQM Central Information Department, on Friday, Altaf Hussain’s health worsened again.</p>
<p>“Immediate medical attention was sought, and an ambulance was called. The doctor promptly dispatched a medical emergency team. The emergency team initially examined Altaf Hussain at his residence, after which he was shifted to a local hospital for further examination and treatment.”</p>
<p>The MQM Coordination Committee appealed to all workers and the public to pray for his recovery.</p>

<p>Hussain was hospitalised in London <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923515">last month</a> due to “severe illness”, where he underwent multiple tests.</p>
<p>Previously known as the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, Hussain founded his party in 1984 to represent the Urdu-speaking community, which had migrated to Pakistan amid Partition.</p>
<p>Under Hussain’s leadership, MQM swept the 1988 election in Sindh’s urban areas, emerging as the third-largest party in the country.</p>
<p>The MQM under Hussain was accused of using violent tactics to attain and retain political power. On the contrary, Hussain maintained that the state and other political parties have targeted MQM and its workers ever since its formation.</p>
<p>Hussain currently lives in London, where he has been in self-imposed exile since 1992. He was later granted British citizenship. From London, Hussain played an active role in politics, regularly broadcasting political speeches to his followers in Karachi.</p>
<p>He was in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1604892">intensive care unit</a> at a hospital in Britain, apparently after contracting Covid-19 in February 2021.</p>
<p>Hussain was born on September 17, 1953, in Karachi. He obtained his early education at a public school in Karachi’s Azizabad neighbourhood, a middle-class locality in Karachi where he spent his early years and his youth. He later enrolled at the University of Karachi to study Pharmacy and graduated from the programme in 1979.</p>
<p>His political career began during his student years in KU when he and Azeem Ahmed Tariq founded the All-Pakistan Mohajir Students Organisation (APMSO).</p>
<p>Formed in 1978, APMSO gained a massive following within a short period of time.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, the MQM chief went into exile as the government at the time conducted an operation in Karachi.</p>
<p>Viewed as the man who controlled Karachi from London, Hussain came under fire in May 2013 for his televised speech across Pakistan, where he allegedly demanded the separation of Karachi from the rest of Pakistan if the public mandate of his party was not acceptable to the ‘establishment’. The party later clarified, saying it was taken out of context.</p>
<p>However, the final undoing of the MQM, as it was known, came after Hussain delivered an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1279393">incendiary speech</a> in August 2016 in which he not only raised slogans against Pakis­tan but also called the country “a cancer for the entire world”. Hours after the speech, MQM workers had attacked the ARY News office in Kara­chi.</p>
<p>Authorities launched a crackdown following the speech and the MQM’s Karachi headquarters and Hussain’s residence in Azizabad were sealed. Later, Hussain’s own party leaders in Pakistan distanced themselves from him and omitted his name from the party constitution.</p>
<p>In October 2019, Hussain was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1510088/altaf-hussain-charged-by-uk-police-with-terrorism-offence-over-2016-speech">charged</a> with “encouraging terrorism” by British police over his speech. He was also arrested in the case earlier in 2019 but was released on bail.</p>
<p>After deliberations that spanned three days, a 12-member jury had returned a majority verdict in Rex (crown) versus Altaf Hussain in February 2022, acquitting the MQM founder on two counts of ‘encouraging terrorism’.</p>
<p>The jury found Hussain <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1675337">not guilty</a> on both counts of encouraging terrorism, contrary to section 1(2) of the UK’s Terrorism Act 2006.</p></p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday blasted the Israeli cabinet’s approval of a plan to occupy Gaza City as a “dangerous escalation”.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Israel’s political-security cabinet <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929467">approved</a> a plan to take control of Gaza City, nearly two years into its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1784085">invasion</a> of the Palestinian territory. The approval came hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel intended to take military control of the entire strip, American news agency <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>
<p>“We strongly condemn the Israeli cabinet’s approval of a plan to take illegal and illegitimate control of Gaza City. This tantamounts to a dangerous escalation in an already catastrophic war against the people of Palestine,” the prime minister said in a post on X.</p>

<p>He added that the expansion of military operations will only worsen the already existing humanitarian crisis and derail any prospect for peace in the region.</p>
<p>“We must not lose sight of the root cause of this ongoing tragedy: that is, Israel’s prolonged, illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. As long as this occupation endures, peace will remain elusive,” the premier added.</p>
<p>“Pakistan reiterates its unwavering support for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent and sovereign State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in line with relevant UN and OIC resolutions.”</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz called upon the international community to intervene urgently to bring an immediate halt to Israel’s unwarranted aggression, ensure the protection of innocent civilians, and ensure the direly needed delivery of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza.</p>
<p>Earlier, Foreign Office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan in his weekly briefing <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/transcript-of-the-weekly-press-briefing-by-the-spokesperson-friday-august-8-2025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that Federal Information Minister Attaullah Tarar officiated the send-off of the 18th humanitarian aid consignment to Gaza at a ceremony held at Islamabad International Airport today.</p>
<p>“Under the directives of the Prime Minister, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), in close coordination with relevant partners, facilitated the dispatch of this consignment, which is the 18th shipment from Pakistan,” the FO spokesperson said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

<p>The aid consignment comprised of essential supplies including dry ration packs, Meals Ready-to-Eat and medicines. The ceremony was attended by senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the NDMA, and the Ambassador of Palestine to Pakistan, he added.</p>
<p>This consignment brings Pakistan’s total humanitarian assistance to Gaza to 18 shipments, comprising 1,815 tons of vital relief supplies, he added, saying “This sustained support reflects Pakistan’s resolute solidarity with the people of Gaza.”</p>
<p>Since October 7, 2023, Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed 61,258 and injured 152,045 Palestinians, per the Palestinian health ministry. Bombardments have also <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-has-destroyed-88-of-gaza-strip-since-oct-7-2023-gaza-media-office/3634914" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">destroyed</a> 88 per cent of the Gaza Strip, according to the Gaza Media Office, with Tel-Aviv facing accusations of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929014/south-africa-urges-more-countries-to-stand-up-to-israels-genocidal-activities">genocide</a>.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the World Health Organisation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929483/99-die-from-malnutrition-in-gaza-this-year-says-who">said</a> that 99 people were now known to have died from <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926555/unrwa-chief-says-mass-starvation-in-gaza-is-deliberate">malnutrition</a> in the Gaza Strip so far this year, with the figure likely an underestimate.</p>
<p>International outrage over the humanitarian situation in Gaza has ratcheted up pressure on Israel, with UN agencies warning of famine in the devastated Palestinian territory.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Israel’s military chief had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929206/israeli-military-chief-told-to-toe-the-line-after-opposing-reoccupation">pushed back</a> against Benjamin Netanyahu’s plans to seize areas of Gaza it doesn’t already control, three Israeli officials said, as the prime minister faced increasing pressure over the invasion both at home and abroad.</p>

<p>The Foreign Office, in a separate <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/pakistan-condemns-the-reported-israeli-plan-for-a-complete-military-takeover-of-gaza" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, condemned the Israeli plan for complete military takeover of Gaza.</p>
<p>“Pakistan condemns in the strongest possible terms the reported Israeli plan for a complete military takeover of Gaza,” the statement said.</p>
<p>This not only represents yet another flagrant violation of international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions, but also the occupying power’s intention to further expand its ongoing genocidal military campaign, the statement added.</p>
<p>This highly escalatory action will further aggravate the prevailing grave humanitarian situation and suffering of the civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in addition to undermining international efforts aimed at achieving peace and stability in the region, the FO said.</p>
<p>“Pakistan reiterates its call on the international community to ensure an immediate end to Israeli impunity and its genocidal military campaign”, the FO said, calling for concrete measures for the provision of unimpeded humanitarian supplies to millions of Palestinians in dire need, and to hold Israel accountable for its heinous crimes.</p></p>
