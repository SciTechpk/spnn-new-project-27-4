                <h2>Pakistan fully committed to building secure, prosperous regional environment with allies: COAS</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Saturday said Pakistan was committed to building a secure and prosperous environment in the region with the help of partner nations.</p>
<p>Over the past week, Pakistan has made efforts to expand defence cooperation with other nations. Saudi Arabia‚Äôs naval chief <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926301/pakistan-and-saudi-arabia-stress-mutual-resolve-to-strengthen-defence-cooperation">met</a> with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza in Rawalpindi on Thursday, while COAS Munir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926523/china-appreciates-pakistans-role-for-regional-peace-in-meeting-with-coas-munir-ispr">met</a> Chinese senior political and military leadership in Beijing on Friday.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7368" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Islamabad hosted the Regional Chiefs of Defence Staff Conference under the theme of ‚ÄòStrengthening Bonds, Securing Peace‚Äô today, attended by senior military officials from the United States, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>The ISPR said COAS Munir formally welcomed the distinguished defence delegations and reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs steadfast commitment to peace, stability and constructive engagement across the region.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn an era defined by transnational threats and complex hybrid challenges, the imperative for deeper military-to-military cooperation, strategic dialogue and mutual trust is paramount. Pakistan remains fully committed to working with partner nations to build a secure and prosperous regional environment,‚Äù Field Marshal Munir was quoted as saying by the statement.</p>
<p>The ISPR said the session‚Äôs participants also discussed regional security dynamics, the evolving security environment in central and south Asia and the necessity of joint training initiatives, counter-terrorism cooperation and coordinated humanitarian responses.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis landmark multilateral engagement marked a significant stride toward advancing regional security cooperation, military diplomacy and strategic dialogue among participating nations,‚Äù the statement said.</p>

<p>According to the ISPR, the conference sought to reinforce security collaborations, enhance training initiatives and exchange the best practices in counterterrorism and other defence and security programmes.</p>
<p>The military‚Äôs media wing added that the participants collectively reaffirmed their resolve to uphold peace, respect, national sovereignty and confront common security threats such as terrorism, cybersecurity and violent extremism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúParticipants commended Pakistan‚Äôs leadership, hospitality, and initiative in fostering such inclusive and forward-looking defence diplomacy,‚Äù the ISPR said.</p>
<p>It further added: ‚ÄúThis strategic convergence reflects Pakistan‚Äôs enduring commitment to a secure, interconnected and cooperative region, anchored in shared security interests and regional solidarity.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pakistan‚Äôs role in regional peace was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926499">lauded</a> by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a meeting with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan has always played a positive role in global and regional peace,‚Äù the Foreign Office had quoted the US secretary of state as saying while the US State Department said he expressed appreciation for Pakistan‚Äôs continued willingness to play a constructive role in mediating conversations with Iran and its commitment to preserving regional stability.</p></p>

                <h2>Asia Cup 2025 to be held in UAE from September 9-28</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Asia Cricket Council‚Äôs (ACC) Asia Cup 2025 tournament will be held in the United Arab Emirates from September 9-28, ACC President Mohsin Naqvi announced on Saturday.</p>
<p>In a post on X, he said: ‚ÄúI am delighted to confirm the dates for the ACC Men‚Äôs Asia Cup 2025 in UAE. The prestigious tournament will take place from September 9th to 28th. We look forward to a spectacular display of cricket! Detailed schedule will be out soon.‚Äù</p>

<p>Naqvi later announced the schedule for the tournament on X, with India and Pakistan set to clash on September 14. In addition to India, the Green Shirts will play Oman on September 12 and the UAE on September 17.</p>

<p>Pakistan, India, the UAE and Oman will make up Group A, while Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Hong Kong will make up Group B.</p>
<p>The group stage will be followed by a super four stage, in turn followed by the final on September 28.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman‚Äôs confirmation came after the tournament was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926436/asia-cup-set-to-be-held-in-uae">already expected to be hosted</a> in the UAE.</p>
<p>The tournament, originally scheduled to be hosted by India in September, was poised to be relocated due to logistical and political challenges, though India is expected to retain hosting rights.</p>
<p>The decision followed the ACC‚Äôs Annual General Meeting (AGM), <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926256/pcb-chief-naqvi-hails-positive-acc-agm-says-asia-cup-fate-to-be-announced-soon">held</a> in Dhaka on Thursday, which was attended by all 25 member countries either physically or virtually.</p>
<p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), after initially <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926154/bcci-makes-volte-face-decides-to-attend-acc-meeting-virtually">threatening</a> to boycott the meeting due to political tensions with Bangladesh, eventually joined the proceedings virtually. BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla represented the board at the meeting.</p>

<p>The Asia Cup must conclude before India begins its Test series against the West Indies later that month.</p>
<p>In May, Pakistan and India stepped back from an all-out war after a four-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military confrontation</a> ‚Äî the worst in decades ‚Äî in the aftermath of the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> in India-occupied Kashmir. New Delhi blamed Pakistan for the attack without evidence, launching Operation Sindoor. Islamabad has strongly denied the accusations.</p>
<p>During the conflict, India‚Äôs head coach Gautam Gambhir had called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908921">complete halt</a> to cricketing engagements with Pakistan at any forum.</p>
<p>Last week, a cricket match between Indian and Pakistani veteran players was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925419/pak-india-cricket-veteran-match-cancelled-after-indian-players-pull-out-of-game">called off</a> after Indian players, including Shikhar Dhawan, refused to play against Pakistan, citing recent ‚Äúgeopolitical tensions‚Äù between the two nations.</p>
<p>With both the BCCI and PCB reportedly unwilling to play on each other‚Äôs soil, a neutral venue such as the UAE was viewed as a practical compromise, similar to the hybrid model used during the 2025 ICC events and the 2023 Asia Cup.</p>
<p>The UAE, having <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1735351">previously hosted</a> the tournament in similar circumstances, emerged as the most feasible neutral venue, particularly in light of ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan.</p></p>
