            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923014/uae-denies-granting-lifetime-golden-visas-to-certain-nationalities' target='_blank'><strong>UAE denies granting lifetime Golden Visas to certain nationalities</strong></a>
            <p><p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) late on Tuesday night denied widespread media reports that claimed it had begun granting lifetime Golden Visas to select nationalities under a “new nomination-based” scheme, according to the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.wam.ae/en/article/bkkw61s-uae-denies-rumours-about-lifetime-golden-visa-for" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Emirates News Agency</em></a> (<em>WAM</em>).</p>
<p>The <a class="link--external" href="https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/residence-visas/golden-visa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Golden Visa</a> is a long-term residence visa that enables foreign talent to live, work, or study in the UAE while enjoying a range of exclusive benefits. According to the UAE government’s official portal, eligible categories include investors, entrepreneurs, scientists, outstanding students and graduates, humanitarian pioneers, and frontline heroes.</p>
<p>This week, several Indian media outlets, including <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.ptinews.com/editor-detail/Indians-can-now-get-UAE-s-Golden-Visa-without-trade-license--property-purchase/2704586" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Press Trust of India</a></em> and <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indians-can-now-get-uaes-golden-visa-without-trade-license-property-purchase/article69782170.ece" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Hindu</a></em>, reported that the UAE government had initiated a “new nomination-based visa policy”, allowing Indians to “enjoy the UAE’s Golden Visa for life by paying a fee of AED100,000”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uae-golden-visa-how-indians-can-now-get-lifetime-residency-without-investment-key-details/amp_articleshow/122288489.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Times of India</a></em> reported that the newly launched scheme was in its pilot phase and was currently available to applicants from both India and Bangladesh, with over 5,000 Indian applications expected in the first three months. Dubai-based <em><a class="link--external" href="https://gulfnews.com/uae/good-news-bangladeshis-can-now-apply-for-uae-golden-visa-remotely-1.500189952" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gulf News</a></em> also reported on Monday that Bangladeshi citizens could apply for the Golden Visa remotely if they meet the requirements.</p>
<p>“The Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has denied the accuracy of rumours circulated by some local and international media outlets and websites regarding the United Arab Emirates granting lifetime Golden Visas to certain nationalities,” the <em>WAM</em> report said.</p>
<p>“ICP clarified that the categories, conditions, and regulations of the Golden Visa are clearly defined in accordance with official laws, legislations, and ministerial decisions.”</p>
<p>According to <em>WAM</em>, the ICP emphasised that “all Golden Visa applications are handled exclusively through official government channels within the UAE, and that no internal or external consultancy entity is recognised as an authorised party in the application process”.</p>
<p>The federal authority said it had “recently observed news articles from a consultancy office based in another country, suggesting that lifetime Golden Visas could be obtained for all categories from outside the UAE via consulting or commercial entities under simplified conditions”.</p>
<p>The <em>WAM</em> report further added: “These claims have no legal basis and were made without coordination with the relevant authorities in the UAE. The federal authority reaffirmed its commitment to providing a safe and transparent environment for applicants.”</p>
<p>It also stated that legal action would be taken against entities “spreading such false information in an attempt to illegally collect money from individuals aspiring to live and reside in the UAE, exploiting their hopes for a dignified and secure life.”</p>
<p>The federal authority urged individuals wishing to visit, live, or invest in the UAE not to respond to inaccurate rumours and false news aimed at a quick profit. They should avoid paying any fees or submitting personal documents to any party claiming to provide these services, the report said.</p>

<p>“I checked with the authorities here, and they say they have no such information. So, the news is likely to be untrue,” Iqbal Marconi, ex-chief executive officer of ECH Group (which <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.khaleejtimes.com/kt-network/golden-horizons-iqbal-marconis-ech-digital-pioneers-uaes-golden-visa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Khaleej Times</a></em> has described as the largest golden visa facilitator in the region), told <em>Economic Times</em>.</p>
<p>“The only new update they have is that crypto investors won’t be considered for the Golden Visa scheme. I checked with the GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs Dubai) also; they too said they don’t have any information on this, “ Marconi said.</p>
<p>He added that a “couple of officials […] in the same line of work” whom he contacted also did not have any information in this regard.</p></p>

            <p><p>Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan arrived in Islamabad on an official visit early Wednesday morning to hold discussions on bilateral issues, the Foreign Office said in a statement.</p>
<p>A day ago, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs had <a class="link--external" href="https://www.mfa.gov.tr/no_-140_-sayin-bakanimizin-pakistan-i-ziyareti-hk.en.mfa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that Fidan, along with Minister of National Defence Yasar Guler, will visit Pakistan on July 9. Fidan also <a class="link--external" href="https://www.mfa.gov.tr/turkiye-pakistan-relations.en.mfa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paid a visit</a> to Pakistan in May last year.</p>
<p>“During his official engagements in Pakistan, all important issues of mutual interest will be discussed,” the Foreign Office said in a post on X. “The visit reflects the close and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, rooted in shared history, culture, and mutual trust.”</p>

<p>Pakistan and Turkiye enjoy strong bilateral ties built on shared cultural, religious, and historical bonds, as well as mutual respect.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922785">extended condolences</a> to Turkiye after 12 Turkish soldiers died of methane exposure in Iraq during a search mission in the Claw-Lock Operation zone a day earlier.</p>
<p>Last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met on the sidelines of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) summit in Khankendi, Azerbaijan, to reaffirm their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties.</p>
<p>The two leaders <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/turkiye/efforts-ongoing-to-deepen-turkiye-pakistan-cooperation-in-various-fields-turkish-president/3622179" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discussed</a> deepening cooperation in key areas, including trade, energy, defence, connectivity and investment. PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to working closely with Turkiye to promote peace, stability and sustainable development in the region.</p>
<p>In February, President Erdogan also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891671">visited</a> Pakistan, during which both nations pledged to ensure bilateral trade worth $5bn.</p></p>

            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump’s Justice Department scrambled on Tuesday to answer questions after its leadership concluded there was no evidence to support a number of long-held conspiracy theories about the death of accused <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1492768/us-financier-epstein-arrested-on-sex-charges">sex trafficker</a> Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged clientele.</p>
<p>Conservative influencers from <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1942373944377463168" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Laura Loomer</a> to <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1942132189229162960" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> have criticised Attorney General Pam Bondi and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Kash Patel for their findings, which came months after Bondi pledged to reveal major revelations about Epstein, including “a lot of names” and “a lot of flight logs”.</p>
<p>“It’s sitting on my desk right now to review,” Bondi <a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bondi-says-epstein-client-list-sitting-my-desk-right-now-reviewing-jfk-mlk-files" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Fox News</em></a> in February when she was asked if the Justice Department would be releasing Epstein’s client list.</p>
<p>On Tuesday at the White House, Bondi walked that comment back, telling reporters that she was referring to the entire Epstein “file” along with other files pertaining to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. “That’s what I meant by that,” she said.</p>
<p>She added that the many of the videos in the Epstein investigative file “turned out to be child porn”. This material, she added, is “never going to be released. Never going to see the light of day”.</p>
<p>The Justice Department’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922841/sex-offender-jeffrey-epstein-died-by-suicide-did-not-have-client-list-us-govt-memo">memo</a> on Epstein, released on Monday, concluded that after reviewing more than 300 gigabytes of data, there was “no incriminating client list” nor was there any evidence that Epstein may have blackmailed prominent people.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The memo also confirmed prior findings by the FBI which concluded that Epstein <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1499139">died by suicide</a> in his jail cell while awaiting trial, and not as a result of a criminal act such as murder.</p>
<p>A subsequent report by the Justice Department’s inspector general later found that the Bureau of Prisons employees who were tasked with guarding Epstein failed to search his cell or check on him in the hours before his suicide.</p>
<p>Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, a former conservative podcaster, both previously made statements before working at the FBI about a so-called client list and often suggested that the government was hiding information about Epstein from the American public.</p>
<p>Trump defended them in a Truth Social <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114813826512783399" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on Monday amid a backlash by his Make America Great Again (MAGA) base, calling them the “greatest law enforcement professionals”.</p>

<p>He expressed annoyance when reporters asked him questions about Epstein on Tuesday at the White House during a cabinet meeting, saying, “Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?”</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Tech tycoon Elon Musk, now Trump’s estranged former close aide, said on X: “How can people be expected to have faith in Trump if he won’t release the Epstein files?”</p>
<p>When their feud <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915655/very-disappointed-trump-says-in-stunning-live-break-up-with-musk">blew up</a> last month, Musk <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193714/elon-musk-and-donald-trump-just-had-the-messiest-breakup-and-x-is-eating-it-up">alleged</a> that Trump was named in the Epstein files, but he later deleted his posts.</p>
<p>“They arrested (and killed) Peanut, but have not even tried to file charges against anyone on the Epstein client list,” Musk said in another <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1942636971450589642" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a>, referring to an Instagram-famous squirrel <a class="link--external" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/01/us/instagram-famous-squirrel-peanut-seized-new-york-intl-scli" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seized</a> by New York state authorities last year.</p>
