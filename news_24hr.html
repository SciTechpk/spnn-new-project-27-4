            <p><p>A preliminary report depicted confusion in the cockpit shortly before an Air India jetliner <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916728">crashed</a> and killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923062/toll-of-air-india-disaster-rests-at-260-as-focus-turns-to-crash-report">260 people</a> last month, after the plane’s engine fuel cutoff switches flipped almost simultaneously and starved the engines of fuel.</p>
<p>The Boeing 787 Dreamliner bound for London from the Indian city of Ahmedabad began to lose thrust and sink shortly after takeoff, according to the report on the world’s deadliest aviation accident in a decade released on Saturday by Indian accident investigators.</p>
<p>The report by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) about the June 12 crash raises fresh questions over the position of the critical engine fuel cutoff switches.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after the plane lifted off the ground, closed-circuit TV footage showed a backup energy source called a ram air turbine had deployed, indicating a loss of power from the engines.</p>
<p>In the flight’s final moments, one pilot was heard on the cockpit voice recorder asking the other why he cut off the fuel. “The other pilot responded that he did not do so,” the report said.</p>
<p>It did not identify which remarks were made by the flight’s captain and which by the first officer, nor which pilot transmitted “Mayday, Mayday, Mayday” just before the crash.</p>
<p>The commanding pilot of the Air India plane was Sumeet Sabharwal, 56, who had a total flying experience of 15,638 hours and, according to the Indian government, was also an Air India instructor. His co-pilot was Clive Kunder, 32, who had 3,403 hours of total experience.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>The fuel switches had almost simultaneously flipped from run to cutoff just after takeoff. The preliminary report did not say how the switches could have flipped to the cutoff position during the flight.</p>
<p>The crash is a challenge for Tata Group’s ambitious campaign to restore Air India’s reputation and revamp its fleet, after taking the carrier over from the government in 2022.</p>
<p>Air India acknowledged the report in a statement. The carrier said it was cooperating with Indian authorities but declined further comment.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#fuel-switches" id="fuel-switches" title="Permalink"></a>Fuel switches</h2>
<p>Experts have said a pilot would not be able to accidentally move the fuel switches.</p>
<p>“If they were moved because of a pilot, why?” asked US aviation safety expert Anthony Brickhouse.</p>
<p>The switches flipped a second apart, the report said, roughly the time it would take to shift one and then the other, according to US aviation expert John Nance. He added that a pilot would normally never turn the switches off in flight, especially as the plane is starting to climb.</p>
<p>Flipping to the cutoff almost immediately cuts the engines. It is most often used to turn engines off once a plane has arrived at its airport gate and in certain emergency situations, such as an engine fire. The report does not indicate there was any emergency requiring an engine cutoff.</p>
<p>At the crash site, both fuel switches were found in the run position and there had been indications of both engines relighting before the low-altitude crash, said the report, which was released around 1:30am IST today (1:00am PKT).</p>
<p>Asked about the report, the father of first officer Kunder told reporters, “I am not from the airline”, declining to comment further during a prayer meeting held in the memory of the airline’s crew on Saturday in Mumbai, where emotional scenes played out among grieving relatives.</p>
<p>The US National Transportation Safety Board thanked Indian officials for their cooperation in a statement and noted that there were no recommended actions in the report aimed at operators of Boeing 787 jets or the GE engines.</p>
<p>The US Federal Aviation Administration said its priority was to follow the facts where they lead, and it was committed to promptly addressing any risks identified throughout the process.</p>
<p>Boeing said it continued to support the investigation and its customer, Air India. GE Aerospace did not respond immediately to a request for comment.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#crash-probe" id="crash-probe" title="Permalink"></a>Crash probe</h2>
<p>The AAIB, an office under India’s civil aviation ministry, is leading the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917018/air-india-crash-probe-focuses-on-engine-flaps-landing-gear">probe</a> into the crash, which killed all but one of the 242 people on board and 19 others on the ground.</p>
<p>Most air crashes are caused by multiple factors, with a preliminary report due 30 days after the accident, according to international rules, and a final report expected within a year.</p>
<p>The plane’s black boxes, combined cockpit voice recorders and flight data recorders, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918113/india-to-send-crashed-planes-black-box-to-us-local-media-report">recovered</a> in the days following the crash and later downloaded in India.</p>
<p>The report said “all applicable airworthiness directives and alert service bulletins were complied [with] on the aircraft as well as engines.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>The airport closed-circuit TV recording from Ahmedabad had earlier shown the Air India plane rose to a height of 650 feet after it took off, but then suddenly lost altitude, crashing in a fireball into a nearby building.</p>
<p>The investigation report said as the Dreamliner lost altitude, it initially made contact with several trees and an incineration chimney, before hitting the building.</p>
<p>Air India has faced additional scrutiny on other fronts after the crash.</p>
<p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said last week it plans to investigate its budget airline, Air India Express, after <em>Reuters</em> reported the carrier did not follow a directive to change engine parts of an Airbus A320 in a timely manner and falsified records to show compliance.</p>
<p>India is banking on a boom in aviation to support wider development goals, with New Delhi saying it wants India to be a job-creating global aviation hub along the lines of Dubai.</p></p>

            <p><p>A farm worker died on Friday after being injured during a raid by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918869">US immigration agents</a> on a legal cannabis farm in California that resulted in the arrests of 200 undocumented migrants and clashes with protestors.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, called demonstrators involved in attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents “slimeballs” and said they should be arrested.</p>
<p>In another development, a district judge ordered a halt to “roving patrols” in Los Angeles by federal agents who were detaining suspected undocumented migrants without probable cause and denying them due process.</p>
<p>District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong ordered an end to the arrests, which she said were being made “based upon race alone”, on whether a person was speaking Spanish or English with an accent or because of their place of work and ordered them stopped.</p>
<p>Trump’s remarks and the court order come a day after a chaotic raid on a cannabis plantation in Ventura County, some 56 miles (90 kilometers) from Los Angeles, left one farm worker critically injured.</p>
<p>The United Farm Workers labour union said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/UFWupdates/status/1943778822761197939" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X on Friday that the worker had “died of injuries they sustained as a result of yesterday’s immigration enforcement action”.</p>

<p>Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman, said the man who died was never in custody.</p>
<p>“Although he was not being pursued by law enforcement, this individual climbed up to the roof of a greenhouse and fell 30 feet (10 metres),” McLaughlin said.</p>
<p>“[Customs and Border Patrol] immediately called a medivac to the scene to get him care as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>The DHS said 200 undocumented migrants were arrested during raids on marijuana growing sites in Carpinteria and Camarillo on Thursday and 10 children were rescued “from potential exploitation, forced labour, and human trafficking”.</p>
<p>Glass House Brands, which owns the farms, said in a statement that it has “never knowingly violated applicable hiring practices and does not and has never employed minors”.</p>
<p>DHS said more than 500 “rioters” had attempted to disrupt the operation and four US citizens are facing charges for assaulting or resisting officers.</p>
<p>Tear gas was used against the protestors, some of whom were seen in television footage throwing projectiles at law enforcement vehicles.</p>
<p>The department said immigration agency vehicles were damaged and a $50,000 reward was being offered for the arrest of an individual who allegedly fired a gun at law enforcement officers.</p>

<p>Trump said he was authorising law enforcement officers who are “on the receiving end of thrown rocks, bricks, or any other form of assault, to stop their car, and arrest these SLIMEBALLS, using whatever means is necessary to do so”.</p>
<p>“I am giving Total Authorisation for ICE to protect itself, just like they protect the Public,” he said.</p>

<p>Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to deport millions of migrants, has been involved in a showdown over immigration enforcement with Democratic-ruled California for weeks.</p>
<p>The Republican president sent thousands of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916010/troops-sent-by-trump-reach-protest-hit-los-angeles-over-governors-wishes">National Guard troops</a> to Los Angeles last month to quell <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915984">protests</a> against roundups of undocumented migrants by federal agents.</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has said the troops were not necessary to address the mostly peaceful protests, but his legal efforts to have them removed have failed so far.</p>

            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said that transforming the outdated system into a modern, digital and effective governance model is among the government’s top priorities as economic development and prosperity are not possible without modernising the system to meet contemporary demands.</p>
<p>Presiding over a meeting to evaluate the performance of federal ministries, the prime minister directed officials to introduce reforms to enhance the performance of ministries and hire services of experts in every sector.</p>
<p>The prime minister formed a committee for recruiting the best workforce, aligning ministries with modern systems and improving governance through reforms.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the Ministry of Energy gave a detailed briefing on a system comprising experts for improving governance and implementing reforms.</p>

<p>The prime minister said the country could not achieve progress with a system that has been in place for seven decades.</p>
<p>He said the country has rich resources and its young workforce is the country’s most valuable asset, with many talented Pakistanis bringing fame to the country globally.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz lauded Minister for Energy Sardar Awais Khan Legh­ari and his team for their efforts and emphasised that assistance from internationally renow­ned experts and consultants is crucial for system’s change, and introducing new thinking and governance methods through reforms aligning with modern requirements.</p>
<p>He said the energy ministry’s reforms, which brought about reduction in losses and saved billions of rupees for the national treasury, served as a model for other ministries to follow.</p>

<p>The PM directed the formation of a committee to finalise actionable proposals for restructuring other ministries and institutions in the light of reforms undertaken by the energy ministry.</p>
<p>The committee will also focus on recruiting the best workforce, aligning ministries with modern systems, and improving governance through reforms.</p>
<p>The meeting was also given a detailed briefing on profiles of the sector experts and the current working of the ministry under the established system.</p>
<p>Federal ministers Dr Musadik Malik, Ahad Khan Cheema, Sardar Awais Khan Leghari, Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Ali Pervaiz Malik, Min­i­s­ter of State Bilal Azhar Kiyani, Chief Coordinator Moshar­raf Zaidi, and other relevant senior officials attended the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>World Population Day</strong></p>
<p>In his message on World Population Day, PM Shehbaz Sharif said the government is fully committed to a comprehensive, rights-based population agenda with a focus on equitable access of people to healthcare, informed family planning and strengthening systems allowing individuals to make choices about their future with dignity and autonomy.</p>
