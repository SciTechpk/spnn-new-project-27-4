            <p><p>The bodies of nine bus passengers who were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923411/armed-men-kidnap-and-kill-nine-passengers-in-balochistan">kidnapped and killed</a> in Balochistan’s Sardhaka area last night were recovered and transported to their hometowns in Punjab on Friday morning, officials said.</p>
<p>On Thursday night, at least nine passengers travelling on two Punjab-bound coaches were abducted and killed by unidentified armed men in the Sur-Dakai area, situated on the border between Balochistan’s Zhob and Loralai districts, Assistant Comm­issioner Naveed Alam said a day ago.</p>
<p>Provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind also confirmed the incident and said that <em>Fitna-al-Hindu­stan</em>  — a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">term</a> the government uses for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan — had carried out attacks at three different places — Kakat, Mastung, and Sur-Dakai.</p>
<p>The Balochistan Liberation Front, a banned outfit, later claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group said it had killed the nine individuals after blocking the highway between Musakhail-Makhtar and Khajuri.</p>
<p>Alam told <em>Dawn.com</em> on Friday that the bodies of all nine passengers were handed over to a political agent in the Sakhi Sarwar district of Dera Ghazi Khan to be handed over to their families.</p>
<p>He said that seven of the passengers had been identified but two could not be identified due to a lack of documents.</p>
<p>“The terrorists must have taken the passengers’ identification documents with them,” AC Alam said.</p>
<p>Of the seven passengers identified, two were residents of Lodhran, while one passenger each were residents of Dera Ghazi Khan, Gujrat, Attock, Khanewal and Gujranwala.</p>

<p>The country’s top leaders strongly condemned the incident and vowed action against the perpetrators “at all costs”.</p>
<p>In a statement today, President Asif Ali Zardari said: “This barbarity is part of <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>’s evil conspiracy to spill blood in Pakistan,” state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed commitment to “clear the land of <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> and its facilitators at all costs”.</p>
<p>Similarly, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in a statement issued by his office: “We will deal with terrorists with full force. The blood of innocent people will be avenged.”</p>
<p>The premier added that the killing of unarmed civilians was a blatant act of terrorism by <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>.</p>
<p>“With resolve, unity, and strength, we will confront the scourge of terrorism and uproot it completely,” the prime minister said.</p>
<p>Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also strongly condemned the incident, calling it “blatant terrorism”.</p>
<p>“The killing of innocent civilians based on Pakistani identity is an unforgivable crime,” Bugti said, vowing that the response would be “severe”.</p>
<p>“The terrorists have proven that they are not human beings, but cowardly beasts,” he said, adding that the state “would not even let these murderers hide underground.”</p>
<p>The chief minister added: “All networks of terrorists who are the sponsors of <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> will be destroyed.”</p>
<p>Noting that this was a “state war”, he vowed decisive action.</p>
<p>CM Bugti further vowed to crush “every plan of terrorism” with strength, determination and unity. “Balochistan will become a graveyard for enemies.”</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MOIofficialGoP/status/1943412958844829757" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on X late last night, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident, saying: “We will chase and eliminate Indian-sponsored terrorists who target innocent passengers.”</p>
<p>“The conspiracies of Indian-sponsored terrorists and their accomplices must be foiled with the support of the nation.”</p>

<p>According to sources, two passenger coaches en route to Punjab were intercepted in the Sur-Dakai area near the N-70 highway, close to Dab — a place along the Loralai-Zhob border. A group of armed men had blocked the road and stopped the two vehicles.</p>
<p>The armed assailants boarded the coaches, checked the identity cards of passengers and forced 10 persons off the vehicles at gunpoint.</p>
<p>“They dragged out 10 passengers — seven from one coach and three from the other — and took them away (to an unknown place),” a surviving passenger told Levies. “I don’t know what they did to them, but I heard gunfire as we were leaving.”</p>
<p>After abducting the nine passengers, the assailants allowed both coaches to leave the area.</p>
<p>Security forces suspended traffic on the highway and began a large-scale search operation to locate the perpetrators.</p>
<p>According to sources, the attackers checked the national identity cards of all passengers and specifically targeted individuals with Punjab addresses. They also opened fire on the coaches during the abduction to prevent any escape.</p>

<p>One of the surviving passengers, Sabir Toor, told <em>Geo News</em> that he and 10 members of his family were on their way to Lodhran from Quetta for their father’s funeral when the attack occurred.</p>
<p>The gunmen offloaded his two brothers, Usman and Jabir, from the bus in front of women and children of the family and killed them. “I cannot describe this hour of grief — we have three funerals in the family now.”</p>
<p>“I urge security forces to get rid of these miscreants,” he said, adding that he and his brothers had been working in Quetta for the past 30 years and had no relations to any political party.</p>

<p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed deep grievance over the incident, urging the state to seek a “political solution” to long-standing issues in Balochistan.</p>

<p>In February, seven Punjab-bound passengers were offloaded from a bus and shot dead in Barkhan district. The incident came days after 12 were killed in a blast targeting a bus carrying coal miners in Harnai.</p>
<p>In May last year, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832433">seven barbers</a> from Punjab were shot dead near Gwadar, while August saw <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854830">23 travellers</a> offloaded from trucks and buses and shot in the Musakhail district.</p></p>

            <p><p>The brother of the deceased model and actor Humaira Asghar Ali has criticised the media for reporting that the family refused to claim her body.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Humaira’s partially decomposed body was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922857/actor-and-model-humaira-asghar-ali-found-dead-in-karachis-dha">found</a> in her rented apartment in Karachi’s upscale Defence Housing Authority (DHA) when the police entered to enforce a court-ordered eviction.</p>
<p>Police on Wednesday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923110">said</a> that she might have died around six months ago, citing the expiry date of food kept in the refrigerator and her phone records, which were both from  September 2024.</p>
<p>They also said that when approached, her family in Lahore — particularly her father — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923110#:~:text=Family%20refuses%20to%20take%20body">refused</a> to take the body for burial, triggering shock across the <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193842/celebrities-step-in-to-lay-humaira-asghar-ali-to-rest-after-her-family-refuses-to-claim-her-body">entertainment industry</a>. A day earlier, the brother Naveed Asghar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923361/elder-brother-keen-to-receive-actor-humairas-body-for-burial">arrived</a> in Karachi to take the body to Lahore for burial. Police had stated that the actor’s body would be handed over to her brother after DNA matching.</p>
<p>An autopsy report by police surgeon Summaiya Syed today, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, confirmed that the body was in an “advanced stage of decomposition” and at least eight months old.</p>
<p>Speaking to journalists last night, Naveed said, “The body was in police custody. The police had kept the body for investigation before calling us (the family) to claim it.”</p>
<p>He said that for the last three days, the family was in contact with Chhipa and the police, including Station House Officer Farooq Ahmed Sanjrani of the Gizri Police.</p>
<p>“According to the guidelines, we were [eventually] going to receive the body and perform the rites,” he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Naveed criticised the media for reporting that the family had refused to accept Humaira’s body, revealing that his parents were “distressed” due to the recent death of another close relative.</p>
<p>“Due to the condition of the body, we could not carry it at that moment,” he said, adding that the police were carrying out legal procedures before the handover.</p>
<p>“The media’s focus was entirely on our family. It never highlighted other possible causes of death,” he said.</p>
<p>Naveed acknowledged that his sister’s body was several months old, urging that the media should urge authorities to manage the installation of CCTV cameras in every house with a tenant.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Naveed also said that Humaira was an “independent person” who wouldn’t visit the family for extended periods.</p>
<p>“She moved to Karachi and had been living here for the last seven years … she would visit home after several months or even a year at times,” he said. “She didn’t contact us for a year, although our mother had reached out to her asking about her whereabouts.”</p>
<p>He continued: “Her mobile phone had been switched off for the last six months, so our mother could not contact Humaira. We could not trace her number either.”</p>

<p>The reports suggesting Humaira’s family had refused to claim her body prompted the authorities and celebrities to come forward and take responsibility for her burial.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193844/sindh-culture-department-says-it-is-willing-to-take-responsibility-for-humaira-asghar-alis-burial?utm_source=www.dawn.com">Sindh culture department</a> offered to take care of Humaira’s burial and funeral if no relatives were willing to do so.</p>
<p>In a notification issued by the Sindh culture department on Thursday, Culture Minister Syed Zulfiqar Ali Shah took notice of her death. He was “very much aggrieved for non-cooperation from her legal heirs to take over custody of the body for burial.”</p>
<p>“In light of this situation and considering her contributions to the arts and culture of the country, the culture department is willing to take responsibility for her burial arrangements with respect and in a dignified manner,” read the notice.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, several members of the entertainment fraternity also approached the police, <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193842/celebrities-step-in-to-lay-humaira-asghar-ali-to-rest-after-her-family-refuses-to-claim-her-body?utm_source=www.dawn.com">expressing their willingness</a> to perform the last rites and arrange the burial. Actors Yashma Gill and Sonya Hussayn were among many who volunteered to take responsibility for arranging the burial.</p>
<p>The Actors Collective of Pakistan — a trade body representing actors in the country — had also announced that it will ensure she is “laid to rest with the dignity and respect every human being deserves”.</p>
<p>“In our family, no one is forgotten. No member is left behind. We stand together — in life, in loss, and in remembrance,” the organisation wrote in a statement on Wednesday.</p></p>

            <p><p>Six members of a family, including four children, were injured after the roof of a mud house collapsed due to heavy rains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Charsadda district in the early hours of Friday, a rescue official said.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122, Charsadda’s District Emergency Officer Jawad Ali told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the incident occurred in the Omarzai area, where the roof of a house collapsed, adding that his team responded promptly and recovered the injured from the debris.</p>
<p>“The injured were transported to the district headquarters hospital in Charsadda for medical assistance,” he said. “The Rescue 1122 team had also provided first aid to the injured on the spot and in the ambulances; they seemed out of danger.”</p>
<p>According to the DEO Ali, four of the injured were guests from Karachi. Of the four children, aged five to nine, three suffered multiple injuries, while the fourth suffered a forehead wound.</p>
<p>The DEO appealed to the public to take precautionary measures during the monsoon season.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ali and Charsadda Deputy Commissioner Azmat Wazir both said in statements that the water level in the Pali Dam surged due to heavy rains on the night of July 10 and 11, causing a flooding situation in the Jundi River.</p>
<p>They added that Rescue 1122, civil defence, revenue and administration teams had been alerted and were in the field to monitor the situation.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>“Rescue 1122 Charsadda took timely action on the flood situation in the Jundi river,” the DEO said, adding that he personally supervised the operations.</p>
<p>He said six ambulances, a disaster vehicle, a water rescue vehicle, and a total of 90 rescue personnel participated in the operations.</p>
<p>“A total of 105 people were rescued and taken to safe places in the affected areas”, Ali said, adding that four people were rescued from Sherpao Kanyur and 10 people were taken to a safe place from Omarzai. Similarly, 76 people were taken to shelter homes from Gedar Kaly.</p>
<p>The deputy commissioner urged the public to avoid visiting the riverside this season, as has already been banned, to avoid any mishap.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1852031#:~:text=Monsoon%20rains%20across%20the%20region%20from%20June%20to%20September%20offer%20respite%20from%20the%20summer%20heat%20and%20are%20crucial%20to%20replenishing%20water%20supplies.%20They%20are%20also%20vital%20for%20agriculture%2C%20and%20therefore%20the%20livelihoods%20of%20millions%20of%20farmers%20and%20food%20security%20for%20South%20Asia%E2%80%99s%20nearly%20two%20billion%20people.">fall across</a> the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat. They are crucial to replenishing water supplies and agriculture, and therefore, the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security. However, they also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923467/kp-pdma-alerts-districts-as-new-rain-spell-begins-today">alerted</a> the district administrations across the province to the possibility of floods due to a new spell of torrential rains from July 11 to 17.</p>
<p>On Sunday, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922498">six people</a> lost their lives while one person was injured amid flash floods and heavy rain across Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the PDMAs of both provinces. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920723">wreaked havoc</a> in the province in June and are set to continue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, due to a significant rise in temperature, accelerating snow and glacier melt have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922323">triggered</a> flash floods and landslides in various areas of KP and Gilgit-Baltistan. Two boys <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922856/two-drown-in-kp-as-flash-floods-hit-province-gb">drowned</a> in the Indus River in the Torghar district and Jabba nullah of KP’s Mansehra on Tuesday.</p></p>
