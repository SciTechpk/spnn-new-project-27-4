            <p><p>KARACHI: <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1658993">Microsoft</a> has decided to close its office in Pakistan and laid off five employees, <em>Dawn</em> has learnt.</p>
<p>Earlier, media reports suggested that the global tech giant had moved its operations out of the country.</p>
<p>These were based on a LinkedIn post by Jawad Rehman, the former head of Microsoft in Pakistan. Citing sources, he claimed the company “is officially closing its operations in Pakistan”.</p>
<p>Microsoft had an on-ground presence in Pakistan until recently, albeit with a significantly reduced local workforce. Most of its operations were handled from foreign offices and by partners in Pakistan, people familiar with the matter told <em>Dawn</em>.</p>
<p>In response to <em>Dawn</em>’s query, a Microsoft spokesperson said, “We will serve our customers through both our strong and extensive partner organisation, and other closely located Microsoft offices. We follow this model successfully in a number of other countries around the world.”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The decision to move out of Pakistan was part of the company’s ongoing series of layoffs worldwide as it looks to pivot towards artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Microsoft announced it would lay off nearly four per cent of its around 228,000 employees, <em>Reuters</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/microsoft-lay-off-many-9000-employees-seattle-times-reports-2025-07-02/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rep­orted</a>. In May, the company announ­ced layoffs affecting around 6,000 workers.</p>
<p>The company said on Wednesday it planned to manage its operations with fewer managers and streamline its products, procedures and roles.</p>
<p><strong>Evolving business models</strong></p>
<p>In a statement on Wednesday, the IT and Telecommunications ministry said global tech companies are moving from on-premises software deployment to the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. Microsoft’s decision is also reflective of this shift.</p>
<p>According to technology expert Habibullah Khan, large software enterprises have two business models: on-premise and Saas.</p>
<p>Under the former model, the company installs and runs software on the customer’s servers or infrastructure, with hardware and data centres managed internally by customers. The company gets a one-time payment through the sale of licences.</p>
<p>On-premise software deployment is a capital-intensive model and results in high upfront costs with recurring needs for maintenance and upgradation.</p>
<p>In comparison, SaaS allows a company to serve a particular location without any on-ground presence as the software is hosted in the cloud. In the model, the company makes money through subscription costs.</p>
<p>With the evolution of technology, more companies have transitioned to SaaS models, as it reduces upfront costs, Mr Khan explained.</p>
<p><strong>Not an ‘exit’</strong></p>
<p>The IT ministry also said Microsoft’s move couldn’t be construed as an exit from Pakistan, but rather a shift to a “partner-led, cloud-based delivery model”.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, several multinational companies in various sectors have either shut down their operations in Pakistan or sold them to local enterprises. Last month, ride-hailing service Careem announced it would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917884/careem-announces-end-of-ride-hailing-service-in-pakistan-from-next-month">end operations</a> in Pakistan from July 18.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>However, Mr Khan believes Microsoft’s move is different from other exits, as the company now earns almost all of its revenue through cloud-based subscriptions.</p>
<p>He added the company is on a global cost-cutting drive and its decision to close the office in Pakistan was reflective of the move towards SaaS-and-AI operating model, “and is not in any way a reflection on Pakistan’s tech ecosystem or its economy”.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922165/despite-tensions-trade-with-india-continues' target='_blank'><strong>Despite tensions, trade with India continues</strong></a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: Despite a brief military conflict and the continued <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284">closure</a> of borders, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908417">trade</a> between Pakistan and India persisted in May, with official data showing that imports from India reached a three-year high during July-May FY25.</p>
<p>According to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), imports from India totalled $211.5 million in the first 11 months of FY25 — surpassing $207m in FY24 and $190m in FY23. In May alone — when the four-day conflict broke out in the first week—imports stood at $15m, slightly down from $17m in the same month last year.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>However, Pakistan’s exports to India remained negligible. In May, they were recorded at just $1,000, while total exports during July-May FY25 were only $0.5m. In FY24 and FY23, exports stood at $3.44m and $0.33m, respectively—highlighting the highly one-sided nature of bilateral trade.</p>
<p>Traders were reluctant to discuss the continuation of imports during the tense period. One trader suggested the goods might have arrived through third countries, with payments made prior to the hostilities.</p>
<p>“It may have come from a third country and the payment for the May imports would have been made before the war,” he said.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Pakistan’s imports from New Delhi hit 3-year high</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although official data reflects limited trade, Indian research institutions claim actual trade is far higher. The India-based Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) reported last month that India’s unofficial exports to Pakistan are estimated at $10bn annually, routed primarily through Dubai, Colombo, and Singapore.</p>
<p>Analysts say the unofficial trade remains robust due to Pakistan’s high cost of production and industrial dependence on foreign inputs.</p>
<p>“We should not ignore smuggling from India since the cost of production in Pakistan is the highest in the region, which creates space for goods from India, China, and Bangladesh,” said an exporter.</p>
<p>Formal trade relations between Pakistan and India have remained frozen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1499076">since 2019</a>, but the data and ground realities suggest economic interdependence persists, albeit through unofficial channels.</p>

            <p><p>WASHINGTON: With less than a week to go before the July 9 deadline, Pakistan and the United States have concluded a critical round of trade negotiations, reaching an understanding on a deal that could shape the future of the country’s key export sectors.</p>
<p>The Pakistani delegation, led by Commerce Secretary Jawad Paal, was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921336/pakistani-delegation-arrives-in-us-to-finalise-trade-deal">scheduled</a> to return on Friday after completing four days of talks in Washington.</p>
<p>While both sides have reached an understanding, a formal announcement is expected only after the US concludes similar ongoing negotiations with other trade partners.</p>
<p>The delegation arrived in Washington on Monday with the aim of finalising a long-term reciprocal tariff agreement that would prevent the re-imposition of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">29 per cent tariff</a> on Pakistani exports — primarily textiles and agricultural products.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Formal announcement expected once Washington wraps up talks with other nations</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tariff relief, temporarily paused earlier this year, was at risk of expiring if no progress had been made by the July 9 deadline.</p>
<p>Officials familiar with the negotiations say the talks were successful, with both sides agreeing to a broad framework.</p>
<p>The agreement, when signed, could lead to incre­ased Pakistani imports of US goods — notably crude oil — and potential Ameri­can investment in Pakistan’s mining, energy, and infrastructure sectors.</p>
<p>Projects like the Reko Diq copper and gold mine and related energy infrastructure were a focus of the discussions. The deal could also pave the way for expanded engagement through the US Export-Import Bank.</p>
<p>Although US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had earlier indicated that Washington might allow limited flexibility on the deadline if meaningful pro­g­ress was evident, Pakistani officials say they pushed for early completion to remove uncertainty for exporters and investors.</p>
<p>Officials remain optimistic that the agreement will sustain Pakistan’s access to the US market and help reset bilateral economic ties, which had been under strain since the high tariffs were introduced during the Trump administration.</p>
