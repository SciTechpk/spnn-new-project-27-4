                <h2>Judicial top brass forms body to devise ‚Äòinstitutional response‚Äô to enforced disappearances</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The National Judicial Policy Making Committee (NJPMC) constituted a ‚Äúdedicated committee‚Äù on Friday to devise an institutional response to the emotive and chronic issue of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1883694">enforced disappearances</a> in the country.</p>
<p>The NJPMC was set up under an ordinance in 2002 to coordinate and harmonise judicial policy within the court system and in coordination with the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP). The committee also makes recommendations for bringing about an improvement in the capacity and performance of the administration of justice, setting performance standards for judicial officers and persons associated with performance of judicial and quasi-judicial functions, improvement in the terms and conditions of service of judicial officers, court staff and to ensure skilled and efficient judiciary.</p>
<p>A press release issued today from the Supreme Court said the committee‚Äôs 53rd meeting was held under the chairmanship of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and attended by the high court chief justices, as well as Additional Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan.</p>
<p>The members deliberated on ‚Äúkey policy issues and adopted several significant measures to improve judicial performance, technology integration in judicial processes and citizen-centric justice delivery‚Äù.</p>
<p>Among those measures was taking ‚Äúserious notice of the enforced disappearances‚Äù and unanimously resolving that the judiciary ‚Äúwould not compromise on its constitutional duty to safeguard fundamental rights‚Äù.</p>
<p>The press release said a dedicated committee was constituted to formulate an institutional response, after taking into consideration the concerns of the executive, to be communicated through AGP Awan.</p>
<p>The <a class="link--external" href="https://ljcp.gov.pk/SiteImage/Misc/files/NJPMC%20Decisions-11_07_2025(1).pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">detailed decisions</a> of the meeting said: ‚ÄúThe NJPMC strongly condemned enforced disappearances and unanimously resolved that the judiciary will neither compromise on its constitutional mandate, nor shall it fall prey to expediencies when it comes to safeguarding fundamental liberties, particularly in matters as grave as enforced disappearances.‚Äù</p>
<p>The committee constituted to devise the institutional response would include the director general and senior director (academics) of the Federal Judicial Academy, and the secretary of the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP).</p>
<p>AGP Awam would communicate all concerns of the government to the committee with plausible legal options for consideration and review, after which the committee would submit its report to the NJPMC within 30 days.</p>

<p>A total of 125 missing persons cases were submitted to the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances in the first half of 2025, it emerged on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The commission was set up in 2011 to trace missing persons and fix responsibility on the individuals or organisations responsible for their disappearance.</p>
<p>In the month of June alone, a total of 27 missing persons cases were received nationwide, while 33 cases were disposed of.</p>
<p>The commission offered a monthly breakdown of the cases received and disposed; 26 cases were received in January and 209 disposed of; 12 new cases in February and 104 disposed of; 30 were received in March and 34 disposed of; 11 were reported in April and 42 disposed of; 19 were received in May and 62 disposed of.</p>
<p>The total number of cases received up till June 2025 was 10,592, while 1,914 cases of them were disposed of and 6,786 were traced, the commission said.</p>
<p>A total of 4,771 missing persons have returned home, according to the report, while 1,017 people are being held in internment centres and 705 in prisons.</p>
<p>In December 2024, the Cons¬≠ti¬≠tutional Bench of the Sup¬≠reme Court emphasised that only parliament holds the authority to add¬≠ress and resolve the longstanding, yet unlawful, practice of enforced disappearances ‚Äî a persistent issue that has plagued the nation for decades.</p>
<p>CJP Afridi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908953">said</a> in May that ‚Äúthere should be a closure of this issue for all times to come‚Äù.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#tackling-external-influence" id="tackling-external-influence" title="Permalink"></a>Tackling external influence</h2>
<p>Regarding the issue of external influence in the judiciary, the press release said: ‚ÄúThe committee also decided to protect judicial officers from external influence and asked the high courts to establish structured mechanisms for reporting and redressal of such instances within a stipulated timeframe.‚Äù</p>
<p>The detailed decisions that on the agenda item of ‚Äúinstitutional response to extraneous influence on judges of district judiciary‚Äù, the NJPMC ‚Äúunanimously decided that there must be some reporting and redressal mechanism in place for judicial officers against external influence by executive functionaries/organisations‚Äù.</p>
<p>It was decided that the high courts would develop a reporting and redressal mechanism in this regard, within 30 days, under intimation to LJCP.</p>
<p>The Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922929">expected to meet</a> on July 12 to consider a number of pending issues. It is also expected to resume consideration of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1824028/ihc-judges-detail-brazen-meddling-in-letter-to-supreme-judicial-council">letter by six judges</a> alleging interference by intelligence agencies in judicial affairs and calling for a thorough investigation. The letter was sent by six judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 25, 2024.</p>
<p>The SJC, at a previous session while considering different options concerning the letter, agreed to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1871166/supreme-judicial-council-to-expand-consultations-on-meddling-allegations">expand consultations</a>, noting that the code of conduct of judges also applies to the heads of different institutions.</p>
<p>The letter had earlier prompted then-CJP Qazi Faez Isa to initiate suo motu proceedings after ex-CJP Tassaduq Jillani declined to lead a one-man commission to investigate the alleged meddling in judicial affairs. CJP Afridi, before assuming the top office, had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1827130/justice-afridi-wont-hear-suo-motu-on-meddling">recused himself</a> from hearing the suo motu case, arguing that ‚Äúinaction by Islamabad High Court chief justice or judges‚Äù should not drag the Supreme Court into imposing its jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.</p></p>

                <h2>MQM founder Altaf Hussain hospitalised in London after ‚Äòsevere illness‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) founder Altaf Hussain is currently hospitalised in London due to ‚Äúsevere illness‚Äù, according to party officials.</p>
<p>Previously known as the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, Hussain founded his party in 1984 to represent the Urdu-speaking community, which had migrated to Pakistan amid Partition.</p>
<p>Hussain currently lives in London, where he has been in self-imposed exile since 1992. He was later granted British citizenship. From London, Hussain played an active role in politics, regularly broadcasting political speeches to his followers in Karachi.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe founder and leader of MQM, Altaf Hussain, has been admitted to a hospital in London due to severe illness, where various tests have been conducted on him,‚Äù said senior London-based MQM leader Mustafa Azizabadi.</p>
<p>He appealed to people to pray for the MQM founder.</p>

<p>In a subsequent video message, he said Hussain‚Äôs health deteriorated last night and he was hospitalised upon a doctor‚Äôs inspection and recommendation. ‚ÄúDoctors have conducted various tests and are focusing their attention on his treatment.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a follow-up conversation with <em>Dawn.com</em>, Azizabadi said the MQM founder‚Äôs treatment was ongoing and ‚Äúhopefully it‚Äôs not something serious‚Äù.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an update from MQM Coordination Committee Deputy Convener Qasim Ali said doctors had recommended various tests, including blood tests, electrocardiogram, computed tomography scan, X-ray and ultrasound.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAltaf Hussain has been facing prolonged stress due to the national and international situation, multiple legal cases in London, and severe financial difficulties.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSuffering from severe mental stress, doctors have prescribed blood transfusion in addition to medications for their treatment, and blood has been transfused.‚Äù</p>

<p>He was in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1604892">intensive care unit</a> at a hospital in Britain, apparently after contracting Covid-19 in February 2021.</p>

<p>Hussain was born on September 17, 1953, in Karachi. He obtained his early education at a public school in Karachi‚Äôs Azizabad neighbourhood, a middle-class locality in Karachi where he spent his early years and his youth. He later enrolled at the University of Karachi to study Pharmacy and graduated from the programme in 1979.</p>
<p>His political career began during his student years in KU when he and Azeem Ahmed Tariq founded the All-Pakistan Mohajir Students Organisation (APMSO).</p>
<p>Formed in 1978, APMSO gained a massive following within a short period of time.</p>
<p>Under Hussain‚Äôs leadership, MQM swept the 1988 election in Sindh‚Äôs urban areas, emerging as the third largest party in the country.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, the MQM chief went into exile as the government at the time conducted an operation in Karachi.</p>
<p>The MQM under Hussain was accused of using violent tactics to attain and retain political power. On the contrary, Hussain maintained that the state and other political parties have targeted MQM and its workers ever since its formation.</p>
<p>Viewed as the man who controlled Karachi from London, Hussain came under fire in May 2013 for his televised speech across Pakistan, where he allegedly demanded the separation of Karachi from the rest of Pakistan if the public mandate of his party was not acceptable to the ‚Äòestablishment‚Äô. The party later clarified, saying it was taken out of context.</p>
<p>However, the final undoing of the MQM, as it was known, came after Hussain delivered an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1279393">incendiary speech</a> in August 2016 in which he not only raised slogans against Pakis¬≠tan but also called the country ‚Äúa cancer for the entire world‚Äù. Hours after the speech, MQM workers had attacked the <em>ARY News</em> office in Kara¬≠chi.</p>
<p>Authorities launched a crackdown following the speech and the MQM‚Äôs Karachi headquarters and Hussain‚Äôs residence in Azizabad were sealed. Later, Hussain‚Äôs own party leaders in Pakistan distanced themselves from him and omitted his name from the party constitution.</p>
<p>In October 2019, Hussain was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1510088/altaf-hussain-charged-by-uk-police-with-terrorism-offence-over-2016-speech">charged</a> with ‚Äúencouraging terrorism‚Äù by British police over his speech. He was also arrested in the case earlier in 2019 but was released on bail.</p>
<p>After deliberations that spanned three days, a 12-member jury had returned a majority verdict in Rex (crown) versus Altaf Hussain in February 2022, acquitting the MQM founder on two counts of ‚Äòencouraging terrorism‚Äô.</p>
<p>The jury found Hussain <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1675337">not guilty</a> on both counts of encouraging terrorism, contrary to section 1(2) of the UK‚Äôs Terrorism Act 2006.</p></p>
