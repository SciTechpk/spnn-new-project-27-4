                <h2>Pakis­tan Airports Authority suffered Rs4bn shortfall after airspace closure to India, NA told</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The Pakis­tan Airports Authority (PAA) has lost Rs4.1 billion in just over two months after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912929/pakistan-india-extend-airspace-bans-by-another-month">closing</a> its airspace to Indian-registered aircraft, the Ministry of Defence informed the National Assembly on Friday.</p>
<p>The ministry said the shortfall, from April 24 to June 30, was in overflying revenue and was lower than the reported Rs8.5bn. The closure followed India’s unilateral <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274">suspension</a> of the Indus Waters Treaty on April 23.</p>
<p>From the very next day, Pakistan withdrew overflight permission for all Indian-registered aircraft and those operated, owned, or leased by Indian carriers.</p>
<p>The measure affected 100 to 150 Indian aircraft daily, cutting transit traffic by almost 20 per cent. In 2019, a similar closure led to an estimated Rs7.6bn ($54m) revenue loss, compared to $100m previously reported.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Islamabad airport airspace to close daily for two hours until Aug 14</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ministry apprised the parliament that such decisions, under the jurisdiction of the federal government, were issued through Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) and carried strategic and diplomatic weight to safeguard civilians, protect infrastructure, and allow military planning.</p>
<p><strong>Sovereignty, defence</strong></p>
<p>“While financial losses occur, sovereignty and national defence take precedence over economic considerations,” the statement read.</p>
<p>The PAA’s average daily overflight revenue in 2019, before tensions, was $508,000, compared to $760,000 in 2025.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The ministry made it clear that the amounts reflected “revenue shortfalls, not overall financial losses”, and noted that overflight and aeronautical charges remained unchanged, demonstrating resilience and avoiding tariff hikes or government bailouts.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s airspace is open to all except Indian airlines and aircraft till last week of August after the ban was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912929/pakistan-india-extend-airspace-bans-by-another-month">extended</a> twice on a monthly basis. Similarly, Pakistani carriers remain banned from Indian airspace. “When safeguarding sovereignty and security, no price is too high,” the ministry reiterated.</p>
<p><strong>Islamabad flights</strong></p>
<p>Separately, Islamabad International Airport’s airspace will be closed daily for two hours until August 14 for operational reasons, according to NOTAM A0510/25. Departures and arrivals will be halted from ground level to FL210, affecting flights to Lahore and northern areas.</p>
<p>The airspace will remain closed from 11am to 1pm.</p>
<p>On Friday, the temporary closure caused minor delays, with hundreds of passengers facing changes to their travel plans. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) said all immigration counters were fully staffed and operational, processing 2,847 passengers from 12 international flights in three hours.</p>
<p>A sudden schedule change led to many passengers departing at the same time. FIA Immigration completed screening and clearance in line with regulations and pledged to maintain efficient services while continuing efforts against human trafficking and wanted suspects.</p>

                <h2>SC’s Justice Salahuddin Panhwar comes down hard on ‘dishonest judges’</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>UMERKOT: <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891816/in-a-first-new-sc-judges-to-take-oath-outdoors">Justice Salahuddin Panhwar</a> of Supreme Court has expressed his deep regrets over shortcomings of the country’s judicial system and institutions, and also criticised dishonest judges, lawyers and police officers responsible for the delay and denial of justice to the public.</p>
<p>He was speaking at the oath-taking ceremony of the Umerkot Bar Association here on Friday.</p>
<p>Describing the saying: “Justice delayed is justice denied” as absolutely correct, he declared that a court failing to deliver justice serves no purpose. Mentioning the cases where justice was delayed for decades, he gave a couple of examples: “One woman waited for 71 years for a decision on her inheritance case and another person’s case relating to an accident was decided after 24 years”.</p>
<p>He condemned use of influence by feudals and bureaucrats and observed that some judges were compromising their integrity to appease the powerful.</p>
<p>Justice Panhwar said judges must act with courage, and not fear, and warned them that betraying the oath undermines public trust.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Says ‘they compromise their integrity to appease the powerful’; regrets how three bars, some judges and police backed accused in journalist Nasrullah Gadani’s murder case</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Highlighting systemic corruption, he referred to the case of journalist Nasrullah Gadani’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1842412/family-points-finger-at-ppp-mna-two-sons-in-journalist-nasrullah-gadanis-murder-in-ghotki">murder</a>, and noted that lawyers from three bars, police and even some judges defended the accused.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He criticised misuse of the Dispossession Act, meant to protect the poor, and pointed out that it was now being used to harass them.</p>
<p>He also pointed to the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) where, he recalled, judicial decisions had led to loss of life. He wondered: “Whose judges we are … people’s or the elite’s?”</p>
<p>Justice Panhwar also lamented societal hypocrisy, observing that in Pakistan, people pretended to be virtuous while acting otherwise. He urged judges to engage with communities directly, saying: “We must stop isolating ourselves and see how people live.” Sharing his feelings with the audience, he remarked: “Sometimes I wonder whether we are judges or bandits”.</p>
<p>Touching upon social issues, he debunked claims of “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921711/probe-ordered-into-abduction-forced-conversion-of-hindu-girl-in-badin">forced conversions</a>” and pointed out that 90pc of girls running away from their homes happened to be from Muslim families, and not minorities. This, however, signals a broader societal failure to protect women, he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He also noted a lack of shelters for the girls and women vulnerable to injustice, and said this segment is denied education and inheritance rights, particularly in marginalised communities like the scheduled castes.</p>
<p>While criticising judicial system’s inefficiency, he cited the example of Mirpurkhas courts which ‘disposed of’ 319 out of 320 cases within a week, and remarked that it was a ‘formality’ rather than ‘justice’. How could police deliver, he wondered.</p>
<p>Justice Panhwar expressed the view that upper Sindh’s ‘dacoit culture’ and lower Sindh’s ‘drug epidemic’, particularly in Umerkot district, had paralysed the system.</p>
<p>He revealed that one Sukkur SSP had admitted his helplessness in controlling crime, and said he responded [to his statement] by saying that “If we can’t act, we should resign and go home.”</p>
<p>Justice Panhwar accused the Umerkot police of focusing on extortion, instead of curbing crime. “Crime surged under a former sessions judge,” he deplored.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He said that the Cooperative Housing Society Act was meant for protecting rights of farmers and labourers, not for developing housing schemes. It was designed to empower the working class through loans and by encouraging collective forums, he added.</p>
<p>Justice Panhwar concluded with a warning: “Our rulers tell lies, our institutions tell lies, and people also have stopped speaking the truth. If we don’t change ourselves, then the system will collapse.”</p>
<p>Justice Jan Ali Junejo of Sindh High Court, Tharparkar Sessions Judge Abdul Waheed Sheikh, Umerkot Sessions Judge Abdul Qudoos  Memon, Advocate Yousif Laghari, Mir Pervez Talpur, President of the SHC Bar Association (Mirpurkhas) and Sindh Bar Council members Nand Kumar Goklani and Sher Mohammad  Wassan were among the prominent figures who attended the ceremony.</p>
