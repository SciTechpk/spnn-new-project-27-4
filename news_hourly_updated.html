                <h2>Bilawal-led delegation reaches Washington after wrapping up NY visit</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The high-powered delegation, led by former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, has reached Washington after concluding its two-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow">visit</a> to the United Nations Headquarters in New York on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pakis¬≠tan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">launched</a> a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi‚Äôs growing lobbying presence here.</p>
<p>The delegation comprises Senator Rehman, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt and Jalil Abbas Jilani.</p>
<p>In New York, the delegation ‚Äúdrew attention to India‚Äôs illegal use of force and violations of international law, including the UN Charter and International Humanitarian Law, particularly targeting of civilian areas and killing of innocent civilians, including women and children‚Äù, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>It added that the delegation rejected India‚Äôs allegations regarding the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909746">attack</a> in India-occupied Kashmir ‚Äúwithout a shred of evidence, and warned against India‚Äôs weaponisation of water through its unilateral hold on the IWT [Indus Waters Treaty] in violation of international law and treaty obligations‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to the statement, the delegation met with the UN secretary-general, the president of the General Assembly, the president of the Security Council, the representatives of the Security Council‚Äôs permanent and non-permanent members, ambassadors of the OIC Group, representatives of the media, civil society, and think tanks, and the Pakistani community.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Furthermore, the delegation highlighted the country‚Äôs role and commitment to combating terrorism in all forms, while also ‚Äúdrawing attention of the international community towards Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan, and its transnational assassination campaign‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCooperation, not politicisation, was required to effectively combat the menace of terrorism, it was underlined,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>The delegation also emphasised the country‚Äôs responsible and lawful response to Indian aggression and provocations, adding that Pakistan ‚Äúseeks peace but will always defend its sovereignty with resolve‚Äù.</p>
<p>It warned that Indian attempts to create a ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù that implied arbitrary and unilateral strikes could lead to disastrous consequences in South Asia‚Äôs nuclear environment, reiterating that peace in the region hinged on a just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in line with the UN Security Council resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe international community was urged to uphold international law and the sanctity of treaties, push for the revival and normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty, and support the initiation of a comprehensive dialogue to resolve all outstanding issues between India and Pakistan, including the core dispute of Jammu and Kashmir,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>Speaking at a press conference at UN Headquarters, Bilawal said coope¬≠ration between Pakistan and India‚Äôs intelligence agencies could significantly reduce terrorism in South Asia.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am completely confident that if ISI and RAW were ready to sit down and work together to fight these forces, we would see a significant decrease in terrorism in both India and Pakistan,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>He also urged the global community to remain engaged in South Asia, warning that the risk of conflict between nuclear-armed neighbours had grown, not diminished, after the recent ceasefire.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith the intervention of the international community ‚Äî and I would like to mention particularly the role played by the US President Donald Trump and his team led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio ‚Äî we did manage to achieve a ceasefire between India and Pakistan,‚Äù said Bilawal. ‚ÄúThis is a welcome first step, but it‚Äôs only a first step.‚Äù</p></p>

            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ PM Shehbaz addresses Peshawar jirga, calls on authorities to fast-track work on Bhasha dam<br />
‚Ä¢ NFC meeting in August, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to keep receiving funds to fight terrorism<br />
‚Ä¢ CM Gandapur wants tribal districts‚Äô share in finance award, KP‚Äôs input in talks with Afghanistan</p>
<p>PESHAWAR: As India‚Äôs move to place the Indus Waters Treaty into <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913184">abeyance</a> puts Pakistan‚Äôs water security in peril, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday asked authorities to speed up construction of the Bhasha Dam, while also hinting at inter-provincial consultations to increase the country‚Äôs storage capacity.</p>
<p>The premier made these remarks while addressing a jirga at the Corps Headquar¬≠ters Peshawar, in which he stressed the need for tough decisions for the development and prosperity of the country.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz, while talking about the hostile measures taken by the Modi government, said that under the Indus Waters Treaty, every drop of water was the right of the Pakistani people. He said that India had tasted its own medicine after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988">attacking</a> Pakistan and would be taught a lesson if it attacked again.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>However, the country needs to make a decision on water, he said, adding, ‚ÄúWe will invite provinces to discuss how to increase the country‚Äôs water storage capacity to defeat India‚Äôs nefarious designs.‚Äù The PM said Pakistan was building Diamer-Bhasha Dam and other reservoirs to store water, adding that there was a need to take well-considered decisions soon in this regard.</p>
<p>The premier said that KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, in his speech, took up the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award issue, saying the last award was announced in 2010. The premier said that when this issue was taken up in a meeting in Islamabad some time ago, he had formed a committee in this regard. ‚ÄúI have been told this that the provinces have given their names to represent them and the NFC meeting would be convened in August,‚Äù the premier said.</p>
<p>He said that under the 1 per cent of the divisible pool, which KP is getting for fighting the war against terrorism, Rs700 billion has been provided to the province to boost its law enforcement capacity, set up a Counter-Terrorism Department, and the safe city projects. He said that KP would continue to receive this fund till the elimination of terrorism.</p>
<p>The premier said that he would form another committee, which would meet the tribal elders, the KP governor, and the chief minister to discuss the issues raised by CM Gandapur to draft recommendations. He said that the federal government would also take the same to parliament.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄòDon‚Äôt tax ex-Fata‚Äô</strong></p>
<p>A statement issued from the KP Chief Minister‚Äôs House said that the CM urged the federal government not to impose taxes on the erstwhile Fata and Pata regions, arguing that the local population was not financially capable of bearing such burdens. ‚ÄúThese areas have been severely affected by the war on terror and require significant investment,‚Äù he stressed.</p>
<p>The CM asked the federal government to fulfil all promises made to the ex-Fata people. He demanded immediate release of compensation funds for displaced persons from these regions and called for an end to drone strikes in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, citing civilian casualties.</p>
<p>He also demanded the immediate inclusion of the merged districts‚Äô share in the National Finance Commission (NFC) award. ‚ÄúWe are not asking for another province‚Äôs share‚Äîwe‚Äôre demanding our rightful due,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The CM also urged the federal government to release all pending dues owed to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including net hydel profits and the province‚Äôs full share in the tobacco cess.</p>
<p>In his address, the CM urged the reinstatement of the traditional jirga system to sustainably resolve disputes in the merged districts. He also demanded KP‚Äôs inclusion in peace talks with neighbouring Afghanistan, warning that excluding the province would render the negotiations incomplete.</p>
<p><strong>Bhasha dam meeting</strong></p>
<p>In a separate meeting on the Bhasha dam, the PM asked the authorities to remove hurdles in the completion of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam, saying that the country‚Äôs self-reliance was linked to affordable electricity and agriculture. ‚ÄúThe country‚Äôs self-dependence is linked with affordable electricity and agriculture, which requires increased water storage and efficient water usage,‚Äù the PM was quoted as saying in a press release issued by the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office (PMO).</p>
<p>The prime minister directed prioritising the completion of projects like Diamer-Bhasha Dam to establish an effective system for energy production and abundant water storage.</p>
<p>It may be noted that the energy and the water sectors will face significant cuts in the development budget, after the government planned to reduce the energy sector‚Äôs allocations to Rs144bn from Rs169bn this year, while slashing the water sector allocation to Rs109bn from Rs135bn this year.</p>
<p>Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal had said that until 2018, the estimated construction cost of the dam was Rs479bn, and Rs120bn had already been spent on land acquisition. However, the project cost increased significantly due to delays and unnecessary postponements during the previous government.</p>
<p>He suggested the dam and power projects be separated and the financing of the power project be obtained from the private sector. He further said that even after six years, the revised PC-1 of the project still had not been prepared.</p>
<p>He also said the future projects would be completed under the public-private partnership model to avoid delays in funding and completion. Diamer-Bhasha Dam will provide storage of 6.4 million acre-feet of water.</p>
