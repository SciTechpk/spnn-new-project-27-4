            <p><p>• Unruly mob sets fire to excavator, tries to force open gates of garrison; several hurt as security men fire to disperse crowd<br />
• Security officials and KP govt announce compensation for victims<br />

<p>KHYBER: A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926949/protesters-fired-upon-in-kps-tirah-valley-says-govt-official">protest</a> over the killing of a minor girl in Tirah took a turn for the worse on Sunday, as seven people were shot after a demonstration outside a military installation took a violent turn, eye-witnesses and sources told <em>Dawn.</em></p>
<p>Following the incident, security officials met with tribal elders and announced compensation for the victims, assuring that medical treatment would be provided to the injured. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has announced separate compensation for the deceased and injured.</p>
<p>Hundreds of tribesmen had brought the body of a girl, who they claimed was killed in a mortar strike in the Darbar locality of Peer Mela in Zakhakhel a day earlier, to the Brigade Headquarters in Bagh-Maidan Markaz early on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Sources and eye-witnesses said the situation turned violent when an angry mob, comprising mostly young men,  ignored calls by local elders to remain calm.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>They first torched an excavator parked outside Brigade Headquarters, and then tried to force open the garrison’s main gate.</p>
<p>Security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly opened fire to control the crowd, according to sources.</p>
<p>At least six protesters were killed and seventeen others received bullet injuries, sources said.</p>
<p>There was no official statement from the local administration or the military about the mortar strike, or Sunday’s killings.</p>
<p>Videos circulating on social media showed an excavator on fire. Some protesters were also seen pelting stones at the Brigade Headquarters while trying to forcibly open the main gate. In the footage, protesters could be seen running for cover as gunshots rang out.</p>
<p>The injured were shifted to the Frontier Corps Hospital in Shah Kas Jamrud,  Dogra hospital in Bara and Hayatabad Medical Complex in Peshawar.</p>
<p>One of the injured is said to be in critical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Security officials meet tribal elders</strong></p>
<p>As the situation became tense, a delegation of Tirah elders held a series of meetings with security officials at Brigade Headquarters.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the protesters dispersed following the intervention of elders.</p>
<p>Security officials said the local sector commander met with elders in Tirah and assured them of his full support in meeting their legitimate demands.</p>
<p>Officials also expressed their sympathies with the relatives of those who had lost their lives on Sunday, sources told <em>Dawn.</em></p>
<p>On the elders’ demand, security forces announced compensation for the families of the deceased and the injured.</p>
<p>A statement issued from the KP chief minister’s secretariat said the provincial government was grieved over the loss of lives in Tirah.</p>
<p>The provincial government will give Rs10 million to the deceased and Rs2.5m to the injured.</p>
<p>The statement added the provincial government was committed to sustainable peace, mutual respect and public safety. The KP government had called a jirga comprising tribal elders and public representatives to address their issues.</p>
<p>“The district administration and institutions have been directed to strengthen communication with the public and maintain law and order situation,” the statement quoted the chief minister as saying.</p>
<p><strong>Protest</strong></p>
<p>Later, MNA Iqbal Afridi from NA-27 Khyber and MPA Abdul Ghani, along with their supporters, held a protest at Bab-i-Khyber in Jamrud against Sunday’s incident.</p>
<p>They demanded a transparent judicial enquiry into the incident along with adequate compensation for the victims.</p>
<p>The lawmakers opposed the military operation in Tirah valley and demanded peace without displacing the locals.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, residents in Peer Mela have claimed mortar shelling by security forces has so far killed at least three persons during the last ten days.</p>
<p>They claimed mortars were being fired as security forces conducted operations against armed militant groups in Zakhakhel, Shalobar, Adakhel and Malakdin Khel localities.</p>
<p><strong>Security officials martyred</strong></p>
<p>Separately, two security personnel embraced martyrdom in an exchange of fire with militants in the Arsoon village of Chitral, which borders Afghanistan, on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Official sources told <em>Dawn</em> that forces retaliated against the indiscriminate and unprovoked firing by militants.</p>
<p>Five personnel were also injured in the exchange.</p>
<p>According to the official sources, security forces inflicted heavy casualties on militants and forced them to pull back from their village.</p>

            <p><p>• Over 50 homes destroyed in Kondus landslide<br />
• TV anchor, family among 15 feared swept away in Babusar<br />
• Partial reopening of Babusar Road expected today</p>
<p>GILGIT: People displaced by flash floods across multiple areas of Gilgit-Baltistan have complained of severe shortages of clean drinking water, electricity, road access and communication services.</p>
<p>Survivors in the flood-stricken Babusar and Thore valleys of Diamer said they had been hit by one of the deadliest <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">floods</a> in recent memory, which left many homeless and swept away their belongings.</p>
<p>In the Gilgit region, thousands of residents in Danyor and Sultanabad areas remained without drinking water for three consecutive days after a flash flood from Danyor Nallah damaged the main supply pipeline and several irrigation channels.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters, area elders led by former GB minister Muhammad Iqbal said the government had failed to res­tore the disrupted water supply despite repeated assurances.</p>
<p>They said that although residents had managed to temporarily restore the pipeline, subsequent flooding destroyed it again. No restoration work has been initiated, they lamented and gave a one-day ultimatum to the government for action or they would launch protests.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, residents of Kondus and Haldi in Ghanche district also complained about a lack of relief supplies, electricity, drinking water and road access.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>A devastating landslide in Kondus swept away over 50 homes, leaving scores of families homeless and in urgent need of food, shelter, medical care and emergency services. Locals also lamented the unavailability of the internet, making it even harder to communicate or call for help.</p>
<p>In the Shigar district, flash floods hit the Tisar and Garchahma areas. Resident Sajid Ali said electricity had been out for the last three to four days and that many families had evacuated their homes in search of safer ground. Drinking water was also unavailable, he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>People in Jutal and other flood-affected regions of Gilgit-Baltistan also complained about the lack of basic facilities and criticised the government for its slow response and failure to deliver timely relief.</p>
<p><strong>‘15 tourists swept away’</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, a private TV anchor, her husband and their four children are also among the tourists reported missing in Babusar Valley, it emerged on Sunday.</p>
<p>Gilgit-Baltistan government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that the family of an anchorperson for a Pashto-language TV channel had contacted authorities, reporting that she, her husband and their four children had gone missing during the recent flash floods.</p>
<p>Mr Faraq said they had recovered a wallet belonging to the anchorperson, adding that the body of an unidentified woman was recovered from the Indus River in Chilas’s Minar area. The woman is believed to be among the tourists who were swept away by flash floods on Babusar Highway.</p>
<p>He said that according to eyewitness accounts, between 10 and 15 tourists were swept away by floodwaters on the Babusar Highway. So far, seven bodies have been recovered.</p>
<p>“The search for the remaining missing persons is ongoing with the help of sniffer dogs and drones and personnel from Diamer Police, Rescue 1122, the Pakistan Army and GB Scouts are participating in the operation,” he said, adding that the effort would continue until all missing individuals are located.</p>
<p>He said additional rescue operations were also underway in Ghanche, Ghizer and Gilgit. Human remains were also recovered during a search operation in the Thak Bhasha area of Diamer, and DNA testing will be required for identification.</p>
<p>Federal Secretary for Commun­ications and Works Sher Alam Masood visited the Babusar Highway site in Chilas alongside local officials to assess the damage.</p>
<p>He told the media that restoration efforts using heavy machinery were ongoing, with the road blocked in 15 locations and partial clearance achi­eved at 13 of them. He hoped that the highway would be partially reopened for traffic by Monday (today).</p>
