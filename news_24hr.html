            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday expressed satisfaction on the “cordial and productive discussion” between US President Donald Trump and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir during a call with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p>
<p>The COAS, who visited Washington earlier this week, was invited to a luncheon at the White House and discussed joint counterterrorism efforts and expanding bilateral trade during a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093/trump-coas-munir-talk-counterterrorism-and-trade-in-cordial-meeting-ispr">“cordial” meeting</a> with Trump, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir met with Trump at the White House yesterday, becoming the first serving chief of army staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. The occasion also marked the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">first time</a> a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law.</p>
<p>According to state broadcaster <em><a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvworld/newsdetail/7701" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PTV News</a></em>, the PM’s conversation with Washington’s top diplomat was described as “warm and cordial”, with the discussion revolving around key bilateral and regional issues.</p>
<p>“The prime minister expressed satisfaction over the recent meeting between President Trump and … Field Marshal Asim Munir, in Washington, terming it productive and cordial,” the report read.</p>
<p>“The prime minister conveyed his best wishes for US President Donald Trump, lauding his bold leadership and commending Secretary Rubio’s diplomatic efforts that facilitated a ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India,” <em>PTV News</em> reported. “He emphasised that this understanding averted a potential catastrophe between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.”</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The PM was also quoted as saying that Trump’s “positive remarks” about Pakistan were encouraging for lasting peace in the region and reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to resolve disputes with India — namely the Kashmir issue, the Indus Waters Treaty and counter-terrorism — through dialogue.</p>
<p>Discussing security, PM Shehbaz reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to eliminate terrorism and counter groups such as the Balochistan Liberation Army and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.</p>
<p>“Secretary Rubio acknowledged Pakistan’s efforts in combating terrorism and assured full US cooperation in addressing these threats,” <em>PTV News</em> reported.</p>
<p>Additionally, PM Shehbaz underscored the need for Pakistan and the US to enhance collaboration in sectors including trade, investment, energy, mining, rare earth minerals and information technology.</p>
<p>“Both sides agreed that their discussions should now lead to concrete action across multiple areas of mutual interest. To further strengthen ties, the prime minister emphasised the importance of frequent high-level exchanges,” <em>PTV News</em> reported, adding that the PM extended an invitation to Trump and Rubio to visit Pakistan.</p>
<p>“Secretary Rubio expressed appreciation for the call and reaffirmed the US’s commitment to enhancing cooperation with Pakistan,” <em>PTV News</em> said. “He praised Pakistan’s adherence to the ceasefire with India and its continued efforts for peace in the region, especially given its close ties with Iran.</p>
<p>“Rubio affirmed Washington’s intent to work closely with Islamabad to promote regional and global peace and stability.”</p>
<p>Pakistan has been steadily improving ties with the US.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said that Pakistan and the US will continue to strengthen their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917668/pakistan-us-agree-to-advance-talks-on-reciprocal-tariffs-aurangzeb">economic partnership</a> as both sides agreed to advance negotiations on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">reciprocal tariffs</a> through constructive engagement.</p>
<p>While speaking at an event in Islamabad, Aurangzeb said he had a constructive and positive conversation with the US Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick. He said that both countries are moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>“The government will stay the course of reforms in taxation, energy and other sectors,” he said. “We have also carried out tariff reforms to move towards [a] competitive economy.”</p>
<p>In March, it was announced that Pakistan and the US would hold a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900767">counter-terrorism dialogue</a> in June.</p>
<p>This was agreed during a meeting between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and acting US Ambassador Natalie Baker. During the meeting, Pakistan-US relations, matters of mutual interest and bilateral cooperation were discussed in detail.</p>

<p>In his remarks on the recent conflict with India, PPP chairman — who was addressing a crowd in Karachi upon his return from a foreign diplomatic tour, said, “For the first time in history, the leader of Pakistan’s army, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, has a meeting with Trump at the White House.”</p>
<p>Bilawal questioned India’s claims, saying, “If Pakistan is ‘terroristan’ [and] involved in terrorism, then what is our military leader doing in Washington?”</p>
<p>He said, “What does the Field Marshal’s meeting at the White House signify then?” adding, “Is the general of a failed nation called there? No.”</p>
<p>“This highlights that India lost the war and Pakistan won the war.
The talks were a congratulatory meeting,” he added. “I consider this a success for Pakistan by the US.”</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918495/12th-polio-case-of-this-year-reported-in-kps-bannu' target='_blank'><strong>12th polio case of this year reported in KP’s Bannu</strong></a>
            <p><p>A new case of wild poliovirus was reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district, taking the national tally to 12, the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at Islamabad’s National Institutes of Health (NIH) said in a press release on Friday.</p>
<p>Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.</p>
<p>Federal Minister for Health, Mustafa Kamal, on Thursday claimed that Pakistan has witnessed a decline of over 99 per cent in polio cases, saying that polio eradication remains a top priority of the government.</p>
<p>According to the press release, the 33-month-old boy from Bannu’s Shamsikhel Union Council is the sixth case of polio reported from KP this year.</p>
<p>“To date in 2025, Pakistan has reported a total of 12 cases of polio, including six from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, four from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan,” the laboratory said.</p>
<p>The regional laboratory noted that the southern districts of KP remain areas of concern due to limited access and challenges in conducting house-to-house vaccination.</p>
<p>“These barriers result in missed opportunities, leaving thousands of children unvaccinated and vulnerable to poliovirus,” the statement read.</p>
<p>“The Polio Eradication Programme urges all parents and caregivers to ensure their children receive every dose of polio vaccine,” it added. “Each dose strengthens immunity and offers lifelong protection. Community engagement and support remain critical to stopping the transmission of poliovirus once and for all.”</p>
<p>Polio is a paralysing disease that has no cure. Multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine and completion of the routine vaccination schedule for all children under the age of five are essential to provide children with high immunity against this terrible disease.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Polio Programme <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913239">launched</a> the third immunisation drive of the year against the crippling disease last month at the National Emergency Operations Centre in Islamabad.</p>
<p>The campaign was formally inaugurated by Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication Ayesha Raza Farooq, alongside members of the Polio Programme’s core group and representatives of partner organisations, the statement added.</p></p>
