                <h2>Pakistan slams Modi‚Äôs ‚Äòinflammatory monologue‚Äô, urges India to honour international order</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office on Wednesday condemned the ‚Äúinflammatory monologue‚Äù delivered by Indian PM Narendra Modi in Gujarat, urging India to ‚Äúreturn to the core principles of international order‚Äù.</p>
<p>The developments follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi‚Äôs allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam.</p>
<p>On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>. After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> was reached.</p>
<p>In a video <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ANI/status/1927255026990264356" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> by Indian news outlet <em>ANI</em>, Modi, addressing India‚Äôs youth, calls into question the contents of the Indus Waters Treaty. He said, ‚ÄúIf you study the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, you‚Äôll be shocked.‚Äù</p>

<p>He continued, ‚ÄúIt was decided that the dams built on the rivers of Jammu and Kashmir would not be cleaned‚Ä¶ For 60 years, these gates were never opened. Reservoirs that were supposed to be filled to 100 per cent capacity have now been reduced to only 2pc or 3pc.‚Äù</p>
<p>Stating that the treaty has only been held in abeyance as of now, he added, ‚ÄúRight now, I haven‚Äôt done anything, and people are sweating there [Pakistan].‚Äù</p>
<p>Calling Modi‚Äôs remarks ‚Äúunexpected‚Äù, the FO in its statement urged India to set aside its project of ‚Äúhistorical revisionism‚Äù.</p>

<p>The FO termed India‚Äôs approach towards the treaty as a ‚Äútroubling departure from international norms‚Äù, while drawing a contrast between Pakistan and India‚Äôs regional conduct and global ambitions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA leadership truly in pursuit of international respect might first look inward, and seek to cleanse its conscience before issuing threats to others,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>It further added, ‚ÄúPakistan urges India to return to the core principles of international order including respect for sovereign rights of others and its treaty obligations, as well as restraint in both language and action.‚Äù</p>
<p>The FO in its statement cautioned that ‚ÄúJingoism may stir applause on the campaign trail, but it undermines long-term peace and stability‚Äù. It continued that ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs youth, often the first casualty of chauvinistic nationalism, would do well to reject the politics of fear and instead work toward a future defined by dignity, reason, and regional cooperation‚Äù.</p>
<p>The statement read that such acts may serve domestic optics but cannot withstand international scrutiny or inspire India‚Äôs image as a responsible regional power, while highlighting that ‚Äúthe ideological followers of India‚Äôs current government have normalised mob violence, promoted hate campaigns and targeted religious minorities‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Indian government is linked to extraterritorial assassinations and foreign subversion.</p>
<p>India is in occupation of foreign people and territories. Its record in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir is defined by systematic repression. It is ironic that such a state now attempts to claim the mantle of victimhood.‚Äú</p></p>

            </a>
            <p><p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday hailed Pakistan‚Äôs nuclear capability as ensuring the country‚Äôs sovereignty, especially during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">recent hostilities</a> with India.</p>
<p>With a public holiday, the nation is celebrating Youm-i-Takbeer to mark the historic day of May 28, 1998 when Pakistan joined the ranks of nuclear powers after atomic tests in the hills of Chagai, Balochistan. Pakistan became the seventh nuclear nation in the world and the first Muslim state to have a nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz emphasised that Youm-i-Takbeer was more than a celebration and was a solemn reminder of Pakistan‚Äôs resolve to safeguard its sovereignty, according to his <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/on-youm-e-takbeer-pm-shehbaz-vows-economic-strength-national-unity/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> carried by the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em>.</p>
<p>He linked this year‚Äôs commemoration with what he described as Pakistan‚Äôs recent success in defending itself from ‚Äúan unjustified war imposed by India‚Äù. Appreciating the nation‚Äôs spirit during the confrontation, the premier said, ‚ÄúThe joys of Youm-i-Takbeer have further increased for a nation filled with victory.‚Äù</p>

<p>President Zardari also observed: ‚ÄúIn today‚Äôs evolving regional security situation, our nuclear capability continues to serve as a credible minimum deterrent that guarantees our peace and ensures that no one can undermine our sovereignty and national security.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://ppp.org.pk/pr/33946/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, he highlighted that the 1998 achievement was not ‚Äúmerely a demonstration of our technological advancement ‚Äî it was a calculated decision to ensure peace through strength, to maintain the strategic balance in South Asia, and to protect our nation against any external aggression‚Äù.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven years ago, a team of Pakistani scientists led by Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan and Dr Samar Mubarakmand carried out nuclear tests in the Raskoh Hills in Chagai, upon <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1369428">Nawaz‚Äôs decision</a> in response to Indian nuclear tests.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe commend our valiant armed forces for their unwavering resolve and determination to defend the nation‚Äôs frontiers against all external and internal threats.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the same spirit of unity and resolve, we pledge to build Pakistan into a strong economic power that would become the envy of the world,‚Äù the premier vowed.</p>
<p>He hailed his brother and then-PM Nawaz Sharif for making ‚ÄúPakistan‚Äôs defence invincible with his bold and courageous decision in 1998 to go ahead with a peaceful nuclear test in the face of strong opposition from many powerful countries‚Äù.</p>
<p>He also paid tribute to former president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto for his ‚Äúvisionary leadership‚Äù, as well as ‚Äúbrilliant scientists and engineers who turned the vision and aspirations of the entire nation into reality‚Äù.</p>

<p>In his statement on the occasion, PM Shehbaz urged the nation to carry the spirit of Youm-i-Takbeer beyond defence and into economic transformation.</p>
<p>Thanking patriotic Pakistanis, he said, ‚ÄúI salute the nation, which made immense sacrifices for the completion of the nuclear programme and wrote a proud story of its determination and faith.‚Äù</p>
<p>Reflecting on the historic nuclear tests conducted during Nawaz‚Äôs tenure, Shehbaz noted that the decision to respond with six nuclear tests, compared to India‚Äôs five, was a demonstration of ‚Äúiron resolve‚Äù in the face of global pressure and sanctions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMr Nawaz Sharif represented the aspirations and national interests of the entire nation ‚Ä¶ and made our geographical borders impregnable forever,‚Äù the premier stressed.</p>
<p>The premier also paid glowing tribute to the architects of Pakistan‚Äôs nuclear programme, including Bhutto and Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan. He invoked the leadership of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and said, ‚ÄúNational history is a witness that the people and political leadership of Pakistan have always made the impossible possible.‚Äù</p>

<p>In his message on the occasion, President Zardari noted that Pakistan ‚Äúdemonstrated its strategic patience and commitment to peace‚Äù in the face of recent unprovoked Indian aggression.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur calibrated response, under Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, was measured and effective, which forced the enemy to cease its hostile actions.‚Äù</p>
<p>He reaffirmed that Pakistan did not seek conflict and was committed to the principles of peaceful coexistence and respect for international law. ‚ÄúThis day serves as a reminder of our commitment to safeguarding the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of our beloved country,‚Äù the president said.</p>
<p>President Zardari also paid a rich tribute to Pakistani scientists, engineers, as civil and military leadership. He also appreciated Bhutto for laying the foundation of the nuclear programme and ex-premier Benazir Bhutto‚Äôs role in further strengthening it.</p>
