                <h2>Trump says he thinks 5 jets were shot down in India-Pakistan conflict</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Friday that up to five jets were shot down during the recent India-Pakistan conflict that began after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in India-occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam, with the situation calming after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> in May.</p>
<p>Trump, who made his remarks at a dinner with some Republican US lawmakers at the White House, did not specify which side‚Äôs jets he was referring to.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSomething I‚Äôm very proud of [is that] we stopped a lot of wars. A lot of wars. And these were serious, serious wars; would have been going on,‚Äù Trump said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou had India-Pakistan that was going, and in fact, planes were being shot out of the air. Five, five, four or five, but I think five jets were shot down actually,‚Äù Trump said while talking about the India-Pakistan hostilities, without elaborating or providing further detail.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was getting worse and worse, wasn‚Äôt it? [‚Ä¶] These are two serious nuclear countries and they were hitting each other. It seems like a new form of warfare; you saw it recently, when you looked at what we did in Iran when we knocked out their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920005">nuclear capability</a>, totally knocked out,‚Äù he said, referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">US strikes</a> on Iran‚Äôs three nuclear sites.</p>

<p>Pakistan claimed it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downed five</a> Indian planes in air-to-air combat, later stating that figure <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">as six</a>. India‚Äôs highest-ranking general said in late May that India switched tactics after suffering losses in the air on the first day of hostilities and established an advantage before a ceasefire was announced three days later.</p>
<p>As New Delhi launched deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a>, which Islamabad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">denied</a>, the Pakistan Air Force downed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">five</a> Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">strikes</a> on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>

Islamabad has denied any losses of planes but acknowledged that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186#:~:text=The%20strikes%20targeted%20Nur%20Khan%20air%20base">three air bases</a> suffered hits, while saying that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910381">26 Indian targets</a> were hit.</p>
<p>Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914608">repeatedly</a> said he prevented a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">nuclear war</a>‚Äù between Pakistan and India after Washington held talks with both sides, even <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920139">crediting</a> Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir for helping in it. India has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921534">differed</a> with Trump‚Äôs claims that it resulted from his intervention and his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911719">threats</a> to sever trade talks.</p>

<p>Most recently, on July 7, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923026/trumps-claim-on-averting-india-pakistan-war-gains-new-life">doubled down</a> on its narrative of Trump playing a central role in defusing tensions, despite India claiming otherwise.</p>
<p>Asked about Indian officials‚Äô repeated <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912153">denials</a> of Trump‚Äôs role, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce avoided taking a position. ‚ÄúSo many comments speak for themselves,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>Pressed further, Bruce added, half in jest: ‚ÄúEveryone will have an opinion. That‚Äôs an opinion. Some opinions are wrong. Mine rarely are, but other people‚Äôs opinions can be wrong.‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs statements stand in contrast to India‚Äôs official position, which maintains that New Delhi acted independently during the May crisis and that Washington did not mediate. Trump‚Äôs remarks support Pakistan‚Äôs view that quiet US diplomacy ‚Äî and direct intervention from the White House ‚Äî helped calm tensions.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs position has been that New Delhi and Islamabad must resolve their problems directly and with no outside involvement.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>India is an increasingly important US partner in Washington‚Äôs effort to counter China‚Äôs influence in Asia, while Pakistan is a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524">strong partner</a> in counterterrorism.</p>
<p>The April attack in Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">killed 26 men</a> and sparked heavy fighting between the nuclear-armed Asian neighbours in the latest escalation of a decades-old rivalry.</p>
<p>New Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">strongly denied</a> responsibility while calling for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral</a> investigation. Washington condemned the attack but did not directly blame Islamabad.</p></p>

                <h2>Business bodies divided over today‚Äôs strike call</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: Confusion gripped the business community on Friday as key trade and industry bodies appeared divided over whether the countrywide <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924204">strike</a> scheduled for Saturday would go ahead or had been postponed.</p>
<p>Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Senior Vice-President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon claimed that chambers and trade associations had agreed to defer the strike following a meeting with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Industries Haroon Akhtar Khan, attended by various chambers via Zoom.</p>
<p>The strike call was initially <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923375">issued</a> by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), backed by trade bodies, industrial area associations, petroleum dealers, transporters, and chain store operators.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have not supported the KCCI strike as it was announced by one chamber alone,‚Äù Mr Magoon said. He maintained that the FPCCI, representing chambers from across the country ‚Äî including Faisalabad, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Sialkot, Multan, Khanewal, Sheikhupura, Sargodha, Quetta, and Peshawar ‚Äî had unanimously decided to postpone the strike after the government agreed to address major concerns related to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921249">Finance Act 2025</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOnly the KCCI and the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) are not on the same page,‚Äù he added, dismissing the possibility of a decisive nationwide strike.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>FPCCI ‚Äòpostpones‚Äô strike; Karachi Chamber sticks to shutdown in absence of written commitment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, KCCI President Muhammad Jawed Bilwani insisted that a peaceful strike would be observed on Saturday, having secured backing from numerous trade and industrial organisations. ‚ÄúIf the government fails to provide written assurances following our meeting with SAPM Haroon Akhtar, we will be compelled to extend the strike. We are not satisfied with verbal commitments,‚Äù Mr Bilwani said, warning that further shutdowns could extend to multiple days or even the full week.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Criticising the bureaucracy, he noted, ‚ÄúBusinessmen work seven days a week, while government officials work only five.‚Äù</p>
<p>He warned that unresolved issues may force industries to relocate abroad, particularly to Dubai.</p>
<p>KCCI has expressed serious objections to Sections 37A and 37B of the Sales Tax Act, which it says grant sweeping and arbitrary powers to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). Mr Bilwani said the decision to go ahead with the strike was reaffirmed after an unfruitful meeting with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on July 16, during which demands to suspend five key anti-business measures remained unmet.</p>
<p>These include the immediate withdrawal of Sections 37A and 37B, repeal of Section 21(S) which penalises cash transactions above Rs200,000, scrapping of Section 40C mandating the e-Bilty system, revocation of SRO 709 introducing a disputed digital invoicing system, and restoration of the Final Tax Regime (FTR) for exporters.</p>
<p>LCCI President Mian Abu Zar Shaad stated that the chamber had decided to join the strike in solidarity with the broader business community. ‚ÄúThe problems persist despite meetings with the government. We now demand implementation rather than assurances,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, FPCCI President Atif Ikram Sheikh told the media that a charter of demands had been presented to Mr Haroon, who agreed to withdraw the contentious measures. ‚ÄúThere will be no strike on Saturday,‚Äù Mr Sheikh claimed, adding that the SAPM‚Äôs recommendations would be forwarded to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.</p>
