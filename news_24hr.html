            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Saturday said Pakistan was committed to building a secure and prosperous environment in the region with the help of partner nations.</p>
<p>Over the past week, Pakistan has made efforts to expand defence cooperation with other nations. Saudi Arabia’s naval chief <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926301/pakistan-and-saudi-arabia-stress-mutual-resolve-to-strengthen-defence-cooperation">met</a> with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza in Rawalpindi on Thursday, while COAS Munir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926523/china-appreciates-pakistans-role-for-regional-peace-in-meeting-with-coas-munir-ispr">met</a> Chinese senior political and military leadership in Beijing on Friday.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7368" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Islamabad hosted the Regional Chiefs of Defence Staff Conference under the theme of ‘Strengthening Bonds, Securing Peace’ today, attended by senior military officials from the United States, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>The ISPR said COAS Munir formally welcomed the distinguished defence delegations and reaffirmed Pakistan’s steadfast commitment to peace, stability and constructive engagement across the region.</p>
<p>“In an era defined by transnational threats and complex hybrid challenges, the imperative for deeper military-to-military cooperation, strategic dialogue and mutual trust is paramount. Pakistan remains fully committed to working with partner nations to build a secure and prosperous regional environment,” Field Marshal Munir was quoted as saying by the statement.</p>
<p>The ISPR said the session’s participants also discussed regional security dynamics, the evolving security environment in central and south Asia and the necessity of joint training initiatives, counter-terrorism cooperation and coordinated humanitarian responses.</p>
<p>“This landmark multilateral engagement marked a significant stride toward advancing regional security cooperation, military diplomacy and strategic dialogue among participating nations,” the statement said.</p>

<p>According to the ISPR, the conference sought to reinforce security collaborations, enhance training initiatives and exchange the best practices in counterterrorism and other defence and security programmes.</p>
<p>The military’s media wing added that the participants collectively reaffirmed their resolve to uphold peace, respect, national sovereignty and confront common security threats such as terrorism, cybersecurity and violent extremism.</p>
<p>“Participants commended Pakistan’s leadership, hospitality, and initiative in fostering such inclusive and forward-looking defence diplomacy,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p>It further added: “This strategic convergence reflects Pakistan’s enduring commitment to a secure, interconnected and cooperative region, anchored in shared security interests and regional solidarity.”</p>
<p>Pakistan’s role in regional peace was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926499">lauded</a> by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a meeting with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday.</p>
<p>“Pakistan has always played a positive role in global and regional peace,” the Foreign Office had quoted the US secretary of state as saying while the US State Department said he expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s continued willingness to play a constructive role in mediating conversations with Iran and its commitment to preserving regional stability.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Asia Cricket Council’s (ACC) Asia Cup 2025 tournament will be held in the United Arab Emirates from September 9-28, ACC President Mohsin Naqvi announced on Saturday.</p>
<p>In a post on X, he said: “I am delighted to confirm the dates for the ACC Men’s Asia Cup 2025 in UAE. The prestigious tournament will take place from September 9th to 28th. We look forward to a spectacular display of cricket! Detailed schedule will be out soon.”</p>

<p>Naqvi later announced the schedule for the tournament on X, with India and Pakistan set to clash on September 14. In addition to India, the Green Shirts will play Oman on September 12 and the UAE on September 17.</p>

<p>Pakistan, India, the UAE and Oman will make up Group A, while Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Hong Kong will make up Group B.</p>
<p>The group stage will be followed by a super four stage, in turn followed by the final on September 28.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman’s confirmation came after the tournament was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926436/asia-cup-set-to-be-held-in-uae">already expected to be hosted</a> in the UAE.</p>
<p>The tournament, originally scheduled to be hosted by India in September, was poised to be relocated due to logistical and political challenges, though India is expected to retain hosting rights.</p>
<p>The decision followed the ACC’s Annual General Meeting (AGM), <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926256/pcb-chief-naqvi-hails-positive-acc-agm-says-asia-cup-fate-to-be-announced-soon">held</a> in Dhaka on Thursday, which was attended by all 25 member countries either physically or virtually.</p>
<p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), after initially <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926154/bcci-makes-volte-face-decides-to-attend-acc-meeting-virtually">threatening</a> to boycott the meeting due to political tensions with Bangladesh, eventually joined the proceedings virtually. BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla represented the board at the meeting.</p>

<p>The Asia Cup must conclude before India begins its Test series against the West Indies later that month.</p>
<p>In May, Pakistan and India stepped back from an all-out war after a four-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military confrontation</a> — the worst in decades — in the aftermath of the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> in India-occupied Kashmir. New Delhi blamed Pakistan for the attack without evidence, launching Operation Sindoor. Islamabad has strongly denied the accusations.</p>
<p>During the conflict, India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir had called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908921">complete halt</a> to cricketing engagements with Pakistan at any forum.</p>
<p>Last week, a cricket match between Indian and Pakistani veteran players was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925419/pak-india-cricket-veteran-match-cancelled-after-indian-players-pull-out-of-game">called off</a> after Indian players, including Shikhar Dhawan, refused to play against Pakistan, citing recent “geopolitical tensions” between the two nations.</p>
<p>With both the BCCI and PCB reportedly unwilling to play on each other’s soil, a neutral venue such as the UAE was viewed as a practical compromise, similar to the hybrid model used during the 2025 ICC events and the 2023 Asia Cup.</p>
<p>The UAE, having <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1735351">previously hosted</a> the tournament in similar circumstances, emerged as the most feasible neutral venue, particularly in light of ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan.</p></p>

            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday that his comments in the United States about the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui were being “taken out of context” in the wake of criticism of the remarks by her lawyer.</p>
<p>FM Dar is currently on a visit to the US. Dar spoke at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC, a day ago, during which he had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926640">drawn a parallel</a> with the case of Dr Aafia, who has spent years in a US prison, when responding to a question about former prime minister Imran Khan’s incarceration.</p>
<p>He noted that Pakistan did not interfere in that process because “the Americans had followed their judicial system”. Similarly, he said, Imran was sentenced by Pakistan’s judiciary, which followed the due process of law. “When the due process is followed, others do not have the right to interfere,” he said.</p>
<p>Dr Aafia, a neuroscientist and educator, was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924527">convicted</a> by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on charges of attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan and has been serving her sentence at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Carswell in the US since 2010.</p>
<p>FM Dar’s remarks were criticised by her lawyer as being “idiotic”.</p>
<p>Subsequently, a post by FM Dar on X said: “Yesterday, in response to a question about Imran Khan’s case at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, the reference to Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s case is being taken out of context. During the tenures of PML-N governments, we have consistently provided all diplomatic and legal assistance for Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s release, and we will continue to do so until the matter of her release is resolved.”</p>
<p>He said every country had its judicial and legal procedures, which were to be respected, whether it was Pakistan or the US.</p>
<p>“Our government’s stance on the issue of Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s release is clear and unequivocal.”</p>

<p>Responding to Dar’s comments earlier in the day, Dr Aafia’s lawyer Clive Stafford Smith said: “Sorry but this is idiotic! ‘Due process’ does not equal something where Aafia had no witnesses, they lied &amp; it was all false. That’s called a miscarriage of justice not what’s ‘due’.”</p>

<p>Dar “appeared to be going out of his way to undermine Aafia’s case yesterday by acting like she got ‘due process’ when all she got was torture and a trial in New York when all the real witnesses were in Afghanistan”, he said in a separate post on X.</p>

<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, Smith said: “As you may have seen from the deputy PM’s statement, he was trying to justify what is happening to Imran Khan by using the Aafia Siddiqui case — saying her case is a result of ‘due process of law’ in the US and so therefore it is only something a judge can deal with.</p>
<p>“He goes on to say that disagreeing with a legal verdict against him does not give Imran Khan the right to provoke people to dissent, that should be done through the courts.</p>
<p>Smith said that in his opinion, “I suspect we can all disagree with what he is saying: in all of the scores of people whom I have exonerated in the US, I have used publicity to help force the system to correct its mistakes, and obviously, in Aafia’s case, I tried to do that through the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866050">clemency process</a> with Biden too.”</p>
<p>He said that FM Dar’s analogy was “unwise as well as misplaced”.</p>
<p>On the PTI founder’s incarceration and legal troubles, he said: “I suspect many people will disagree with the notion that Imran Khan has received anything that approaches ‘due process of law’ in the cases against him, just as we can agree that Aafia is where she is today due to the criminal actions of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), along with others, rather than any ‘due process’.”</p>
<p>He added that FM Dar should should not talk about Dr Aafia’s case in the context of Imran’s cases.</p>
<p>“In every instance, Pakistan’s officials need to be towing the consistent line, set out in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s excellent letter to Joe Biden, that no matter what you believe, Aafia has suffered enough,” Aafia’s lawyer added.</p>
<p>He added that he was very optimistic that Pakistan would continue with efforts to secure Dr Aafia’s release.</p>
<p>A day ago, PM Shehbaz had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926537">assured</a> Dr Fouzia Siddiqui that the government would continue to provide all possible legal and diplomatic support in the matter of her sister.</p>
<p>On July 12, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had expr­essed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923643">dissatisfaction</a> over the federal government’s failure to submit a report in the case concerning Dr Aafia’s release, health and repatriation, with Justice Ishaq threatening to “summon the entire cabinet” if the report was not presented. IHC Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq on July 21 had issued a contempt of court notice to the entire federal government, including the prime minister and all ministers, for refusing to file an amicus brief to support Dr Aafia’s case in the US.</p>
<p>However, the IHC Registrar Office had on Wednesday put on hold the processing of the contempt of court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925717/contempt-notice-to-pm-cabinet-after-unsanctioned-hearing">notices</a> issued to PM Shehbaz and his cabinet members as the dealing staff decided to ascertain its validity first.</p>
<p>In February, the IHC was told that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1496759">proposal</a> to exchange Shakil Afridi for Dr Aafia was unfeasible. The law officer representing the federal government informed the court that  Smith had suggested the swap, but Pakistan and the US did not have any agreement for such an exchange.</p>
<p>Last year in October, PM Shehbaz had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866050">requested</a> that Biden pardon and release Dr Aafia from jail.</p>
<p>In a letter dated October 13, the prime minister expressed his concerns about Dr Aafia’s “fragile mental and frail physical health” while in prison. “Now 52 years old, she has served 16 years behind bars in the US.</p>
<p>“Numerous Pakistani officials have paid consular visits to Dr Siddiqui … all of them have raised their serious concerns about the treatment she has received,” the letter read. “In fact, they fear she may take her own life.”</p>
<p>Consequently, the US State Department <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867024">declined</a> to comment on the letter written by PM Shehbaz to the Biden administration.</p></p>
