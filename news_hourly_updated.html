                <h2>Govt suspends mobile data services in Balochistan until Aug 31 for ‚Äòsecurity reasons‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Balochistan government spokesman Shahid Rind on Friday said that mobile data services in the province have been suspended until August 31 over ‚Äúsecurity reasons‚Äù.</p>
<p>In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925001">worsened</a>, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419/jaffar-express-hijacking-state-media-reports-190-rescued-2nd-day-of-operation-underway-in-balochistan">attacks</a>. In February, nearly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896269/62pc-of-deaths-from-terror-attacks-in-balochistan">62 per cent</a> of the total terrorism-related deaths in the country occurred in Balochistan.</p>
<p>The move came after a notification issued by the Balochistan Home Department on Aug 6, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, ordered the immediate suspension of data services until Aug 31, citing the ‚Äúpeculiar law and order situation‚Äù in the province.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is, therefore, requested to please direct the concerned authorities for suspension/closure of 3G and 4G services in the entire province ‚Ä¶ to avoid any untoward incident,‚Äù the notification read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe service has been suspended because they (militants) use it for coordination and sharing information,‚Äù Rind said, according to <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>The suspension follows the government announcement from last month <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927007">banning</a> Pakistani Zaireen (pilgrims) from travelling by road from Quetta to Iran and Iraq due to national security concerns.</p>

<p>On March 11, the Pesha¬≠war-bound Jaffar Express train became the target of an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897237/rescue-operation-for-hostages-underway-after-terrorists-attack-jaffar-express-in-balochistan">unprecedented hijacking</a>, when terrorists fired on the locomotive and took over 400 passengers hostage.</p>
<p>Media reports said that security forces had surrounded the area and launched a clearance operation to rescue all passengers. <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported that security forces had rescued 80 hostages held by the terrorists.</p>
<p>Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on March 12 that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419">clearance operation</a>, launched after the train‚Äôs unprecedented hijacking in Balochistan, ended with all 33 terrorists being killed.</p></p>

                <h2>2 terrorists planning to attack police killed in Mianwali operation: CTD</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Two terrorists planning to attack the police in Punjab‚Äôs Mianwali district were killed during an operation, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) said on Friday.</p>
<p>The CTD regularly carries out operations across the province to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence. Operating under the provincial police department, the Punjab CTD plays a key role in maintaining internal security and countering terrorism within the country.</p>
<p>In a statement today, the law enforcement agency said, ‚ÄúPunjab CTD killed two terrorists during an operation near Kundian in Mianwali.‚Äù</p>
<p>It said that the CTD acted on a tip-off after receiving intelligence that the terrorists were planning to attack police and other institutions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring the operation, the CTD and terrorists engaged in an exchange of fire, as a result of which two terrorists were killed by their own accomplices, while six of them managed to escape.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the statement, the CTD recovered ‚Äúexplosive materials, two rifles, hand grenades and bullets‚Äù from the terrorists.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe terrorists had completed their plans to target the police and other institutions,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>The CTD spokesperson said that the process of identifying the two terrorists was underway, while a search operation was launched to arrest the terrorists who escaped.</p>
<p>Punjab CTD was ‚Äúdiligently pursuing its goal of a safe Punjab and is committed to uprooting the menace of terrorism‚Äù, the statement added.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>The country <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">ranked</a> second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>
<p>Last month, Punjab CTD killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922297/5-terrorists-killed-as-punjab-ctd-foils-major-terror-attack-in-taunsa-sharif">five terrorists</a> and successfully thwarted a terror plot in Taunsa Sharif in a ‚Äúmajor counter-terrorism breakthrough‚Äù.</p>
<p>In April,  the law enforcement agency foiled major attacks by arresting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904191">10 terrorists</a> belonging to banned organisations during 189 operations in different areas of Punjab.</p></p>
