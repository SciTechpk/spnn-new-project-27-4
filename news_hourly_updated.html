                <h2>Indian opposition demands IoK governor step down after admitting ‚Äòsecurity failure‚Äô in Pahalgam attack</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>India‚Äôs opposition parties have called for the governor of occupied Kashmir to resign with an apology to the people of the territory after he admitted to a ‚Äúsecurity failure‚Äù in the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 people.</p>
<p>On April 22, 26 tourists were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">killed</a> at a hill station in India-occupied Kashmir‚Äôs (IoK) Pahalgam. India has blamed Pakistan for the horrific attack, an accusation the latter <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918317">denies</a>. Islamabad has called for an international independent probe into the massacre.</p>
<p>In an <a class="link--external" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jammu-and-kashmir-lg-manoj-sinha-i-take-full-onus-for-pahalgam-was-a-security-failure/articleshow/122426736.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with the <em>Times of India</em> on Monday, IoK Lieutenant Governor and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Manoj Sinha said, ‚ÄúI take full responsibility for the incident, which was undoubtedly a security failure.‚Äù</p>
<p>In response to the admission, numerous Indian politicians slammed him for negligence and for his delay in taking accountability and called for his resignation.</p>
<p>The Indian National Congress |(INC) suggested that Sinha intended to shield ‚Äúunspecified officials‚Äù in the union government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, <em>The Wire</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://thewire.in/security/resign-say-nc-congress-as-jk-lg-manoj-sinha-takes-full-responsibility-of-pahalgam" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said in a post on X, ‚ÄúHe (Sinha) finally takes responsibility for Pahalgam after 82 days of the attack. In doing so, who is he protecting in Delhi? How many days, weeks, months to also be held accountable and resign or get sacked?‚Äù</p>

<p>Similarly, INC national spokesperson, Shama Mohamed asked: ‚ÄúSince [Sinha] has taken full responsibility for the security lapse during the Pahalgam attack ‚Äî when is he resigning? In a democracy, the next step after taking the responsibility is resignation!‚Äù</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Imran Nabi Dar, spokesperson for IoK ruling party National Conference, told <em>The Wire</em> that the ‚Äúnext logical step for him (Sinha) should be to step down and apologise to the people of Jammu and Kashmir whose lives, livelihood and dignity were put at stake due to his blunders‚Äù.</p>
<p>The Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader and general secretary MY Tarigami said that his party had been demanding accountability from the union government since the attack. He called for the government to provide details about the lapses that resulted in the deaths of 26 civilians.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll those responsible should be held accountable. Acceptance means certain action against those who have committed such a grave mistake,‚Äù he was quoted as saying by the report.</p>
<p>PPP Senator Sherry Rehman also reacted to the interview today, saying the admission came ‚Äúwell after two months and after going to a whole war over it‚Äù.</p>
<p>She added, ‚ÄúThe opposition in the Lok Sabha should really take down this regime for the spectacular incompetence that jeopardised Indian lives, credibility and reputation. The momentum is right there.‚Äù</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with Indian journalist Karan Thapar last week, PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had said the Indian public was ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923094/new-delhi-lied-to-public-about-pahalgam-attack-bilawal-tells-indian-journalist">lied to</a>‚Äù by New Delhi about Pakistan‚Äôs alleged involvement in the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>In an interview with <em>The Wire</em>‚Äôs Thapar, the PPP chief said that had Pakistan been involved in the attack, evidence would have surfaced and the perpetrators identified.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs far as the Pahalgam terrorist attack is concerned, Pakistan has been willing to be part of an impartial international investigation; your government refused that,‚Äù Bilawal said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo this day, the Indian government has not shared with Pakistan, with the international community, with the Indian public ‚Ä¶ who exactly are these individuals that were involved in this terrorist attack that are from Pakistan?‚Äù</p>
<p>When pressed on the issue, Bilawal said that if Pakistan was truly involved, the international community would endorse India‚Äôs perspective.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very uncomfortable for you that I point out the truth to the Indian public, that they have been lied to ‚Ä¶ that Pakistan was involved in this attack when we were not,‚Äù he asserted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe government has been unable to provide the evidence. That‚Äôs why during this war, the Indian media and the Indian government launched a campaign of disinformation to continue to bamboozle the people of India,‚Äù he added.</p></p>
