            <p><p>Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal stressed Pakistan’s interest in benefitting from China’s technological progress for the development of electric vehicles (EVs), state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/06-08-2025/planning-minister-reaffirms-pakistans-interest-in-partnering-with-chinese-ev-firms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pakistan and China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/china-says-it-backs-pakistan-in-defending-sovereignty">share</a> a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure — with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884628">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media in Beijing during an official visit, the planning and development minister expressed Pakistan’s “desire to benefit from Chinese technological advancements”, according to <em>Radio Pakistan</em>.</p>
<p>This includes the development of next-generation batteries, such as sodium-ion batteries, which offer advantages over traditional lithium technology.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Iqbal also reaffirmed Pakistan’s interest in developing the EV sector in partnership with China, noting electric vehicles as a “key area of future cooperation between Pakistan and China”.</p>
<p>He stressed that establishing EV manufacturing in Pakistan would offer cost advantages for Chinese companies, adding that it would also help Pakistan to reduce its dependence on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923612/centres-policies-hindering-development-of-sindhs-energy-sector-murad">fossil fuels</a>.</p>
<p>The planning minister is currently on an official visit to China, where he is conducting meetings with officials to strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries and advance plans for economic cooperation and development.</p>
<p>Last week, Iqbal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928392">met</a> with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong in Beijing, where the two parties discussed the second phase of CPEC, industrial development and business-to-business cooperation.</p>
<p>On Sunday, he <a class="link--external" href="https://pc.gov.pk/web/press/get_press/1611" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">met with</a> the president of China’s Development Research Centre and Centre for International Knowledge on Development, Lu Hao. During the meeting, Iqbal stated that strong economic collaboration between Pakistan and China was key to national development.</p>

<p>Separately, the government yesterday approved a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929034/new-car-levy-to-power-ev-revolution">five-year subsidy scheme</a> for the rollout of 116,000 electric bikes and 3,170 electric rickshaws/loaders, with an estimated cost of around Rs100bn.</p>
<p>The scheme is part of efforts to encourage the adoption of EVs in Pakistan, reduce oil imports, and foster environmental sustainability. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to launch the initiative on August 14 formally.</p></p>

            <p><p>KHYBER: The leaders of banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) agreed on Tuesday that they would not use civilians as a human shield in their armed struggle against security forces, nor would they extort money from anyone in the name of Zakat and Ushr in the restive Tirah valley of Khyber tribal district.</p>
<p>Written in Pastho on the letterhead of TTP and duly stamped by its ‘supreme council’ (Rahbari Shura), a Bar Qambarkhel elder read out the five-point agreement in front of a gathering of local tribesmen in response to their demand for ending hostilities against ordinary tribesmen and a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928146/marchers-demand-peace-as-north-waziristan-under-curfew">pullout</a> from Tirah to restore peace.</p>
<p>There was, however, no mention of a pullout from Tirah in the agreement inked between local elders and TTP. The leaders banned TTP vowed to continue their armed resistance against security forces and also punish those, who supported forces or found guilty of spying against them.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Our sole purpose is an armed struggle (jihad) against anti-Islam forces and their collaborators for which we desperately need sympathies and assistance of Muslim population. We consider our involvement in internal and personal affairs of local people as inappropriate and have thus strongly refrained our volunteers from doing so,” said the agreement.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Agreement inked between local jirga and banned outfit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The agreement made it clear that TTP members would not take shelter in private houses or use it as a bunker against security forces, but they would resist any effort by forces to either capture or eliminate them at any such private building.</p>
<p>It claimed that none of TTP members was allowed to demand any type of money from locals in the name of Ushr and Zakat and would take strict action against those, who were found guilty of doing so if locals registered any complaint against them.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The TTP leaders, through the agreement, also agreed that no one would be abducted or tortured by them as they consider it an irresponsible act, which was harming their ‘sacred armed struggle’</p>
<p>It was also agreed that TTP would investigate in accordance with Sharia the killing of innocent locals and abduction or torture by unidentified armed men for which its members were blamed and local elders would be required to provide evidence of such incidents.</p>
<p>The Tuesday’s agreement was reached between TTP and a representative jirga of Bar Qamberkhel tribe of Tirah in Bar Bagh area. The first round of the parleys was held between them on July 28 during which TTP local commanders sought time till August 5 for conveying the demands of jirga to their leadership in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Captured on video footages, the Bar Qambarkhel elders explicitly demanded an end to all types of hostilities against innocent locals and a complete pullout of all the militant groups from Tirah after a girl child was killed in a firing incident after refusal of Ushr by her parents while two handicapped bothers were also critically injured in a similar incident in July.</p>
<p>Both the incidents sparked widespread <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926949">protests</a> among local tribesmen in the valley with a procession of hundreds of Bar Qambarkhel tribesmen besieging a Markaz (centre) of TTP while holding the Holy Quran in their hands and pleading them to leave their area.</p>
<p>The Bar Qambarkhel jirga had then announced a fine of Rs5 million on those, who would pay any illegal money to TTP, and another Rs500,000 on those, who would not side with it against militant groups.</p>
<p>Reacting on social media, many a Tirah and Bara residents termed the agreement an eyewash, saying there was no mention of TTP leaving its ‘ground’. Some questioned as to why security forces failed to locate TTP leaders in Tirah and launch a targeted operation against them while the Bar Qambarkhel jirga met them twice and held negotiations with them.</p>
<p>The agreement was by and large lauded by majority of Tirah residents with the hope that they would not be harmed and harassed by militant groups as was pledged in the agreement.</p>

            <p><p>The Indian army brought in sniffer dogs, drones and heavy earth-moving equipment on Wednesday to search for scores missing a day after a deadly Himalayan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928911/mudslide-engulfs-indian-village-at-least-four-dead-and-over-50-missing">flash flood</a>.</p>
<p>At least four people were killed and around 100 are unaccounted for — including 11 soldiers — after a wall of muddy water and debris tore down a narrow mountain valley, smashing into the town of Dharali in Uttarakhand state.</p>
<p>“Additional army columns, along with army tracker dogs, drones, logistic drones, earthmoving equipment etc, have been moved… to hasten the efforts”, the army said today.</p>
<p>Military helicopters were working to bring in “essential supplies, medicines and (for the) evacuation of the marooned”, it added.</p>
<p>Uttarakhand State Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the flood was caused by an intense “cloudburst” of rain, and that rescue teams had been deployed “on a war footing”.</p>
<p>Videos broadcast on Indian media showed a terrifying surge of muddy water sweeping away multi-storey apartment blocks in the tourist region on Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Several people could be seen running before being engulfed by the dark waves of debris that uprooted entire buildings.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Defence Sanjay Seth told the <em>Press Trust of India (PTI)</em> news agency late on Tuesday that he had reports of “four deaths and around 100 people missing”.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#extreme-event" id="extreme-event" title="Permalink"></a>‘Extreme event’</h2>
<p>Torrential monsoon rains continue to pour down.</p>
<p>“Residents have been moved to higher reaches in view of rising water levels due to incessant rains”, the army added.</p>
<p>Government weather forecasters said on Wednesday that all major rivers in Uttarakhand were flowing above the danger mark.</p>
<p>Images released by the army, taken from the site after the main torrent had passed, showed a river of slow-moving mud.</p>
<p>A large part of the town was swamped by mud, with rescue officials estimating it was 15 metres deep in places, swallowing some buildings entirely.</p>
<p>Deadly floods and landslides are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914966">common</a> during the monsoon season from June to September, but experts say climate change, coupled with urbanisation, is increasing their frequency and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903518">severity</a>.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>The UN’s World Meteorological Organisation said last year that increasingly intense floods and droughts are a “distress signal” of what is to come as climate change makes the planet’s water cycle ever more unpredictable.</p>
<p>Expert hydrologist Manish Shrestha said the 270 millimetres of rain within 24 hours reported in the flood zone “counts as an extreme event”.</p>
<p>Shrestha, from the Nepal-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, said such rain in mountains has a “more concentrated” impact than on flatter lowlands.</p>
<p>“Such intense rainfall events are becoming increasingly common, and could be linked to climate change”, he said.</p></p>
