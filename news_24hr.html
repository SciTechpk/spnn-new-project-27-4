            <p><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday slammed last month’s attacks by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/tel-aviv-in-smoke-as-iran-launches-missiles-under-operation-true-promise-3-after-day-long-israeli-attacks">Israel</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">United States</a> on Iran as “unacceptable” as he attended a ministerial meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in China’s Tianjin.</p>
<p>The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. The group’s foreign ministers meet as a precursor to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1864831">annual summit</a> of its leaders, which will be hosted <a class="link--external" href="https://www.chinadailyasia.com/hk/article/615887" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by China</a> this autumn in Tianjin.</p>
<p>Addressing the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers, Dar said: “We have strongly condemned the unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran and the US strikes on its nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>“Such illegal actions directed against SCO member states are unacceptable,” he asserted.</p>
<p>“We are increasingly concerned at the trends of using aggression as a tool of policy,” the foreign minister said.</p>
<p>“We emphasise the resolution of long-standing disputes through peaceful means, dialogue, diplomacy and according to the principles of international law, justice and fairness,” he added.</p>
<p>In a post on X after the meeting, Dar said: “At the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers meeting today, we reaffirmed our shared commitment to multilateralism, mutual respect and regional stability. The Shanghai Spirit continues to guide us towards dialogue, mutual trust and the pursuit of a more just and inclusive international order.”</p>

            <p><p>India’s opposition parties have called for the governor of occupied Kashmir to resign with an apology to the people of the territory after he admitted to a “security failure” in the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 people.</p>
<p>On April 22, 26 tourists were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">killed</a> at a hill station in India-occupied Kashmir’s (IoK) Pahalgam. India has blamed Pakistan for the horrific attack, an accusation the latter <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918317">denies</a>. Islamabad has called for an international independent probe into the massacre.</p>
<p>In an <a class="link--external" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jammu-and-kashmir-lg-manoj-sinha-i-take-full-onus-for-pahalgam-was-a-security-failure/articleshow/122426736.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with the <em>Times of India</em> on Monday, IoK Lieutenant Governor and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Manoj Sinha said, “I take full responsibility for the incident, which was undoubtedly a security failure.”</p>
<p>In response to the admission, numerous Indian politicians slammed him for negligence and for his delay in taking accountability and called for his resignation.</p>
<p>The Indian National Congress |(INC) suggested that Sinha intended to shield “unspecified officials” in the union government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, <em>The Wire</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://thewire.in/security/resign-say-nc-congress-as-jk-lg-manoj-sinha-takes-full-responsibility-of-pahalgam" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said in a post on X, “He (Sinha) finally takes responsibility for Pahalgam after 82 days of the attack. In doing so, who is he protecting in Delhi? How many days, weeks, months to also be held accountable and resign or get sacked?”</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Similarly, INC national spokesperson, Shama Mohamed asked: “Since [Sinha] has taken full responsibility for the security lapse during the Pahalgam attack — when is he resigning? In a democracy, the next step after taking the responsibility is resignation!”</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Imran Nabi Dar, spokesperson for IoK ruling party National Conference, told <em>The Wire</em> that the “next logical step for him (Sinha) should be to step down and apologise to the people of Jammu and Kashmir whose lives, livelihood and dignity were put at stake due to his blunders”.</p>
<p>The Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader and general secretary MY Tarigami said that his party had been demanding accountability from the union government since the attack. He called for the government to provide details about the lapses that resulted in the deaths of 26 civilians.</p>
<p>“All those responsible should be held accountable. Acceptance means certain action against those who have committed such a grave mistake,” he was quoted as saying by the report.</p>
<p>PPP Senator Sherry Rehman also reacted to the interview today, saying the admission came “well after two months and after going to a whole war over it”.</p>
<p>She added, “The opposition in the Lok Sabha should really take down this regime for the spectacular incompetence that jeopardised Indian lives, credibility and reputation. The momentum is right there.”</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with Indian journalist Karan Thapar last week, PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had said the Indian public was “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923094/new-delhi-lied-to-public-about-pahalgam-attack-bilawal-tells-indian-journalist">lied to</a>” by New Delhi about Pakistan’s alleged involvement in the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>In an interview with <em>The Wire</em>’s Thapar, the PPP chief said that had Pakistan been involved in the attack, evidence would have surfaced and the perpetrators identified.</p>
<p>“As far as the Pahalgam terrorist attack is concerned, Pakistan has been willing to be part of an impartial international investigation; your government refused that,” Bilawal said.</p>
<p>“To this day, the Indian government has not shared with Pakistan, with the international community, with the Indian public … who exactly are these individuals that were involved in this terrorist attack that are from Pakistan?”</p>
<p>When pressed on the issue, Bilawal said that if Pakistan was truly involved, the international community would endorse India’s perspective.</p>
<p>“It’s very uncomfortable for you that I point out the truth to the Indian public, that they have been lied to … that Pakistan was involved in this attack when we were not,” he asserted.</p>
<p>“The government has been unable to provide the evidence. That’s why during this war, the Indian media and the Indian government launched a campaign of disinformation to continue to bamboozle the people of India,” he added.</p></p>

            <p><p>A Lahore sessions court on Tuesday discharged an elderly man named Muhammad Sajid, involved in recently using inappropriate language against the Punjab chief minister in a viral video, in a case dating back to 2024.</p>
<p>A few days ago, a video of Sajid riding a motorcycle in the rain went viral on social media, in which he could be heard using abusive language against the chief minister.</p>
<p>A sessions court on Monday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924323/rant-against-cm-reply-sought-on-habeas-plea">sought</a> a reply from Johar Town police on a habeas corpus petition seeking his recovery. Sajid’s son Muhammad Umar had filed the petition for the recovery of his father.</p>
<p>According to the court order, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, “No incriminating evidence is present against the accused person to be sent to judicial remand.</p>
<p>“Hence, the request of the investigating officer (IO) has been turned down, the accused person is discharged from the instant case … first information report, and the IO is ordered to release the person forthwith”.</p>
<p>The Lahore court discharged Sajid after he was nominated in a June 2024 case filed by the Green Town police station. Police subsequently released the senior citizen from handcuffs.</p>
<p>Police had arrested the citizen on July 14, according to a request for his judicial remand and presented him in the Model Town court today.</p>
<p>The accused’s counsel, Advocate Noman Sarwar Dogar, argued that his client had been wrongfully nominated in the 2024 FIR by the police.</p>
<p>The court observed in its order that all the facts and circumstances of the case create doubt in the police’s version of events.</p>
<p>In the habeas corpus case, the petitioner, Advocate Sameer Khan Khattak, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924323/rant-against-cm-reply-sought-on-habeas-plea#:~:text=Sameer%20Khan%20Khattak-,alleged,-that%20Johar%20Town">alleged</a> that Johar Town police had illegally detained his client’s father for the past two days.</p>
<p>He had claimed that Sajid had been arrested without any registered case and had not been produced before any court.</p>
<p>The counsel also stated that the police had forced the petitioner’s father to record apology videos, which were later circulated on social media.</p>
<p>He asked the court to order the recovery and release of the petitioner’s father.</p>
<p>Additional District and Sessions Judge Ghulam Farid had issued a notice to the Johar Town station house officer and directed him to file a reply by July 15.</p></p>
