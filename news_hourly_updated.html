                <h2>Interior minister rebuts rumours about President Zardari ‘resigning’ from office</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Thursday rebutted rumours of President Asif Ali Zardari being asked to resign, terming it a “malicious campaign”.</p>
<p>“We are fully aware of who is behind the malicious campaign targeting President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and the chief of army staff,” Naqvi <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MohsinnaqviC42/status/1943211206371602592" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X.</p>
<p>“I have categorically stated that there has been no discussion, nor does any such idea exist about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency,” he asserted.</p>

<p>“The president of Pakistan enjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces,” the minister said.</p>
<p>He quoted President Zardari as having “clearly” stated: “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”</p>
<p>Naqvi stressed that the “sole focus” of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was Pakistan’s strength and stability, and “nothing else”.</p>
<p>“To those involved in this narrative, do whatever you wish in collaboration with hostile foreign agencies. As for us, we will do whatever is necessary to make Pakistan strong again, InshAllah,” Naqvi added.</p>
<p>Speaking on <em>Geo News’</em> programme “Geo Pakistan” today, PML-N Senator Irfanullah Siddiqui also denied reports of Zardari’s resignation.</p>
<p>“Reports that Zardari is resigning, Imran’s sons are coming, Nawaz Sharif is going to Adiala … these are not news. They are bogus, table stories.”</p>
<p>Siddiqui said, “Zardari has not created any difficulties for the government, and understands his constitutional responsibilities as head of state”.</p>
<p>He said the PML-N had “no trouble” working with the president and there was no credible reason to remove him from office.</p>
<p>“We have a coalition with the PPP. Why would we bring down this system?” he questioned.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, social media campaigns against the army have escalated, reflecting broader tensions within the country’s political and social fabric.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856908">government</a>, as well as the military, have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1876905">repeatedly</a> warned about “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=fake%20news%20and%20propaganda%20have%20become%20so%20common%20and%20there%20is%20no%20accountability%20for%20it.%E2%80%9D">fake news and propaganda</a>” proliferating on social media, with military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=theories%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20added.-,%E2%80%98Digital%20terrorism%E2%80%99,-Questioned%20about%20criticism">digital terrorism</a>” under the laws.</p>
<p>In May, President Zardari and PM Shehbaz formally decorated Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Syed Asim Munir with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912748/president-pm-decorate-coas-munir-with-rank-of-field-marshal">rank of field marshal</a> for his “sagacious leadership and exceptional strategy” during the recent conflict with India.</p>
<p>In a subsequent dinner hosted by the army chief, Field Marshal Munir lauded the political leadership for their “strategic foresight” during <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> against India.</p>

<p>The next month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who belongs to PM Shehbaz’s PML-N, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918558/whats-behind-khawaja-asifs-praise-for-hybrid-system">hailed</a> the “existing hybrid model of governance” in the country. In a separate interview, he also termed it as a “practical necessity” for Pakistan, saying the system was “doing wonders”.</p>
<p>In May 2024, the army chief and President Zardari had expressed their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1825461">concern</a> over “baseless and unsubstantiated allegations levelled by a specific political party and its few individuals” against the army for their political interests.</p></p>

                <h2>Russian minister terms Islamabad and Moscow ‘natural allies’, reaffirms bilateral cooperation</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk on Thursday said Pakistan and Russia were “natural allies”, stressing that Russian President Vladimir Putin views Islamabad as an important strategic partner in the areas of economy and energy, the Foreign Office said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/meeting-of-special-assistant-to-the-prime-minister-sapm-on-foreign-affairs-ambassador-syed-tariq-fatemi-with-deputy-prime-minister-of-the-russian-federation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>In recent years, Russia and Pakistan have engaged in strengthening bilateral ties with each other. On June 3, Russian Foreign Min­ister Sergey Lavrov, in a meeting with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Syed Tariq Fatemi, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915320/russia-pakistan-discuss-closer-ties-regional-stability">reaffirmed</a> Russia’s desire to expand cooperation with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Moscow’s growing engagement with Islamabad — including defe­nce <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1617034">deals</a>, energy cooperation and regular joint military exercises — reflects a strategic shift to diversify partnerships across the region.</p>
<p>In a high-level meeting with Ambassador Fatemi and the prime minister’s aide on Industries and Production, Haroon Akhtar Khan, in Moscow, the Russian DPM reaffirmed his country’s commitment towards deepening bilateral cooperation with Pakistan.</p>
<p>“Characterising Pakistan and Russia as natural allies, [Overchuck] stressed that President Putin considered Pakistan as an important partner in the growth and development of the economy and energy in the region,” the statement said.</p>
<p>“He also highlighted the significance of important connectivity projects between two countries, such as the railway connectivity between Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Russia, and the launching of a pilot cargo train between Pakistan and Russia in August 2025.”</p>
<p>During the meeting, Fatemi reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening relations with Russia, stressing that strong links with the country were a top priority.</p>
<p>“Pakistan views Russia as a stabilising factor in the international arena,” he added, according to the statement.</p>
<p>Speaking about the New Steel Mills project in Karachi, SAPM Haroon Akhtar — focal point for the project — said the project carries the legacy of Pakistan’s relations with Russia, hailing it as a “leap forward” for future cooperation and partnership.</p>
<p>On May 13, Pakistan and Russia signed an agreement to establish a new steel plant in Karachi, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://pid.gov.pk/site/press_detail/29048" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> from the Press Information Department (PID).</p>
<p>The two sides reviewed engagement across all areas of mutual interest, including political, trade and economic cooperation, as well as energy, connectivity, industrial and agricultural cooperation.</p>
<p>They also discussed recent geopolitical and regional issues such as the situation in South Asia, Afghanistan, and the Middle East. During the recent Indian <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988">aggression</a> against Pakistan in May, Russia had offered to mediate between the two countries.</p>
<p>DPM Overchuk shared that President Putin was in favour of strengthening cooperation with Pakistan across all relevant sectors.</p>
<p>He added that President Putin was looking forward to meeting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in August in the upcoming SCO-Council of Heads of State in Tainjin, China.</p>
<p>In September 2024, Overchuk visited Pakistan, where he met with his Pakistani counterpart, Ishaq Dar. The two <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859919">signed</a> a memorandum of understanding (MoU) formalising Pakistan and Russia’s commitment to strengthening bilateral ties.</p></p>
