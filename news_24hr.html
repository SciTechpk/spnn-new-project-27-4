            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928075/opposition-alliance-calls-for-grand-national-dialogue-between-political-parties-new-charter-of-democracy' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition alliance calls for grand national dialogue between political parties, new charter of democracy</strong></a>
            <p><p>The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Friday called for a grand dialogue between all political parties of the country and a new charter of democracy between them.</p>
<p>The TTAP had held its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927866">multi-party conference</a> on Thursday, appealing for a new social contract to restore the Constitution and democracy, claiming that government officials had blocked access to the original venue in Islamabad, forcing them to relocate. The alliance was forced to move its conference to a private farmhouse after authorities placed barriers at its intended venue, Tulip Banquet Hall.</p>
<p>The coalition of six opposition parties formed last year, had formalised its organisational structure last month and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924669">declared blanket support</a> for all anti-government protests.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference today on the second day of the conference held at his farmhouse, TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar presented the alliance’s resolution.</p>
<p>“The parties participating in the TTAP and its All-Party Conference (APC) agreed that at this time there is an urgent need for a new democratic charter among all political parties and political forces,” the resolution read, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>“As a result of the constant attacks of the hybrid system, the Constitution of Pakistan, the human rights given in it from Articles 8 to 11, and the parliamentary democratic system have become meaningless and today the social contract between the people and the state has been shattered.</p>
<p>“Therefore, for the new charter, a complete consensus should be reached among all the political forces in the country after a national dialogue.”</p>
<p>The TTAP said that political consensus was needed on the following aspects: supremacy of the Constitution and Parliament, rule of law, independence of the judiciary, appointment of a free and independent Election Commission and fair elections, the situation in Balochistan, the situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the former tribal areas, the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, inter-provincial relations and water distribution, inter-relations of political parties and investigation of all illegal administrative actions, freedom of the media, rights of women and minorities and international relations.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Criticising yesterday’s events, the TTAP strongly condemned the conference’s cancellation at the Islamabad hotel by the administration and declared that this action was a blow to the constitutional and legal rights of citizens.</p>
<p>“The APC expressed deep concern over the current constitutional, political and economic situation of the country. Today, no class or nationality living in the country is satisfied, the farmers are devastated, the salaried class is under the burden of taxes and the business class is leaving the country and transferring its capital abroad.</p>
<p>“The poverty rate in the country has increased to an alarming level and currently about 45 per cent of Pakistan is forced to live below the poverty line and the purchasing power of the middle class has decreased by 58pc. The unemployment rate has reached an alarming level of 22pc, while the same rate among the youth is more than 30pc.</p>
<p>“This has never been the case in the history of Pakistan. All the participating parties of the conference decided that a comprehensive and common strategy is needed to bring the country out of the current channels,” the resolution stated.</p>
<p>The alliance demanded an end to the “wave of fascism and political manipulation” in the country.</p>
<p>It also condemned the “unjust imprisonment” of PTI founder Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi, demanding their early release and immediate appointment of their pending cases in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and the Supreme Court for immediate hearing.</p>
<p>The opposition moot also lashed out at the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">recent sentencing</a> against scores of PTI leaders and workers, including the National Assembly and Senate opposition leaders, saying yesterday was a “dark day in the political and democratic history of Pakistan in this regard and it once again shows that this hybrid system wants the complete elimination of the opposition in the country”.</p>
<p>On constitutional supremacy, the alliance criticised the recent amendments made to the Constitution and called for their removal. The moot also called for the dismantling of the Special Investment Facilitation Council, alleging that the rights and resources of the provinces were usurped through it.</p>
<p>Regarding the rule of law, the TTAP said that corruption in civil institutions and “undue and illegal interference by political and defence institutions” had led to a loss of public trust and undermining of professional capabilities, which was causing a deterioration in the situation of law and order in the country.</p>
<p>“While the justice system needs reforms, the concept of the rule of law has been severely shaken as a result of interference in the justice system, which needs to be corrected and the public’s trust restored.”</p>
<p>In particular, the moot said that the independence of the judiciary was reduced to a mere slogan after the 26th amendment and “kangaroo courts are now busy only in the work of cleaning up the houses of the powerful”.</p>
<p>The TTAP said there was an urgent need to completely abolish the 26th amendment, take direct steps to prevent all interference in the judiciary and devise an uncontroversial system of appointment of judges to purify the judiciary and restore the reputation of the institution.</p>
<p>“The letter of six judges of the Islamabad High Court has opened the floodgates for the demands of judicial independence in Pakistan. These judges are the heroes of the Pakistani people and we strongly condemn the actions taken against them and fully support their stand,” the alliance said, referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1824028/ihc-judges-detail-brazen-meddling-in-letter-to-supreme-judicial-council">letter</a> written by six IHC judges alleging institutional interference and pressure in judicial work.</p>
<p>On the security situation in Balochistan and KP, the moot said the prevailing conditions in the former were a wound for the country that needed to be urgently addressed.</p>
<p>“The first right to the province of Balochistan and its resources belongs to its residents … We demand that the illegally missing persons across Pakistan and especially in Balochistan be immediately brought to justice. The illegal private militias present across Pakistan, especially in Balochistan and KP, who are backed by the authorities, should be immediately dismantled and the policy of extrajudicial killings should be immediately stopped and the right to a fair trial given in the Constitution should not be deviated from in any way.</p>
<p>“Political prisoners, including Dr Mahrang Baloch, should be released in full. Only civil law enforcement agencies should be given responsibility for maintaining law and order. Also, immediate steps should be taken to eliminate the harassment of Baloch students studying in educational institutions across Pakistan in the name of law and order and to eliminate the hateful prejudice against them,” the resolution said.</p>
<p>Responding to the conference, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar dismissed it as a rote development to sabotage the economy whenever important diplomatic events were due, such as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928047/iranian-president-to-visit-pakistan-on-saturday-fo">upcoming visit</a> of the Iranian president.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928059/countrys-18th-polio-case-of-this-year-reported-in-kps-tank' target='_blank'><strong>Country’s 18th polio case of this year reported in KP’s Tank</strong></a>
            <p><p>A newly confirmed case of polio in Khyber Paktunkhwa’s Tank district has brought the total number of polio cases in Pakistan this year to 18, the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad said on Friday.</p>
<p>Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879016">endemic</a>. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891351">challenges</a> such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation have slowed progress.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://www.endpolio.com.pk/media-room/media-releases/2649-new-polio-case-underscores-ongoing-risk-in-south-khyber-pakhtunkhwa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme confirmed that a 10-month-old boy from Union Council Mullazai in Tank district was confirmed as the 11th polio case from KP this year, bringing the country’s total number of cases in 2025 to 18. Last year, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891351">74 cases</a> were reported nationwide.</p>
<p>“The continued detection of polio cases underscores the persistent threat to children, particularly in areas with low vaccine acceptance,” the press release said. “It is crucial for communities to understand that poliovirus can re-emerge wherever immunity gaps persist.”</p>
<p>It added that every unvaccinated child remained vulnerable and could also contribute to the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The press release pointed out that the only effective protection for polio — a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis — was through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p>
<p>Despite “significant improvements” in the quality of polio vaccination campaigns nationwide, the laboratory said that southern districts of KP remained a key area of concern due to restricted access and operational challenges in house-to-house vaccination, leaving “thousands of children unvaccinated”.</p>
<p>According to the press release, six campaigns, including four nationwide, have each reached over 45 million children since September 2024.</p>
<p>It added that the National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) plans to conduct two nationwide and one sub-national campaign between August and December this year, as well as targeted campaigns in selected high-risk districts, to help stop transmission and protect children from the virus.</p>

<p>As part of intensified efforts to eradicate polio in South KP, the prime minister’s Focal Person on Polio Eradication, Senator Ayesha Raza Farooq and NEOC Coordinator retired Captain Anwarul Haq held a meeting with KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah in Peshawar on Tuesday to review ongoing initiatives in the province.</p>
<p>The meeting focused on “campaign performance, current challenges, and targeted strategies to interrupt poliovirus transmission”, particularly in high-risk southern districts of KP, including Tank.</p>
<p>Farooq emphasised the need to “resolve persistent access barriers and ensure the uninterrupted presence and performance of frontline vaccinators in high-risk union councils”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Anwarul Haq presented a targeted strategy to improve the quality of campaigns and strengthen routine immunisation, particularly in southern KP.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The press release added, “A special planning meeting focused on South KP is scheduled to be held at the chief secretary’s office on August 2-3.”</p>
<p>The programme called polio eradication “a collective responsibility that requires unified efforts at all levels”.</p>
<p>“While dedicated frontline polio workers continue to deliver life-saving vaccines, it is equally critical for parents and caregivers to ensure their children receive every dose of the polio vaccine,” it said.</p>
<p>“Communities must play an active role by supporting vaccination efforts, dispelling misinformation, and encouraging others to protect their children through timely immunisation.”</p>
<p>It directed citizens to the Sehat Tahaffuz Helpline at 1166 for information, as well as the Polio Helpline on WhatsApp at 0346-7776546.</p>
<p>Last Saturday, the NIH had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926915/3-new-polio-cases-confirmed-in-kp-sindh-as-nationwide-tally-climbs-to-17">confirmed</a> three new polio cases in the country in KP and Sindh.</p>
<p>In June, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918236">claimed</a> that Pakistan has witnessed a decline of over 99 per cent in polio cases, saying that polio eradication remains a top priority of the government.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928076/militant-attacks-see-slight-rise-in-july-says-think-tank' target='_blank'><strong>Militant attacks see slight rise in July, says think tank</strong></a>
            <p><p>Pakistan witnessed a slight uptick in militant violence in July after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921445">brief decline</a> last month, according to the latest monthly security report released by the Islamabad-based think tank Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss) on Friday.</p>
<p>In June, there were a total of 78 militant attacks across the country, resulting in at least 100 fatalities, including 53 security personnel, 39 civilians, six militants, and two members of peace committees, the organisation said in a press statement.</p>
<p>These attacks injured 189 people, comprising 126 security personnel and 63 civilians — marking an eight per cent decrease in attacks, a 12pc drop in fatalities, and 4pc increase in injuries compared to May 2025.</p>
<p>Friday’s report documented 82 militant attacks across the country during July, resulting in 101 fatalities and 150 injuries. According to a Picss statement, those killed in militant attacks included 47 civilians, 36 security personnel, and 18 militants. Among the injured were 90 civilians, 52 security personnel, seven militants, and a member of a peace committee.</p>
<p>“Security forces intensified their counter-militancy operations, killing 106 militants and arresting 69 suspected operatives during the same period,” the statement read, noting that these operations also claimed the lives of seven civilians.</p>
<p>Picss noted that the country saw the lowest monthly toll in actions initiated by security forces, with only one of them losing their life. However, 36 security personnel were killed in militant attacks in July.</p>
<p>“In total, militant attacks and subsequent security operations accounted for 215 deaths in July, comprising 124 militants, 54 civilians, and 37 security personnel, while 199 people were injured, including 107 civilians, 56 security personnel, 35 militants, and one peace committee member,” the think tank said.</p>
<p>“The militants also kidnapped at least 14 individuals during the month.”</p>
<p>A comparative analysis by Picss showed a 5pc rise in militant attacks compared to June 2025. However, fatalities among security forces dropped by 32pc, while civilian deaths increased by 21pc. Militant casualties surged by 49pc.</p>
<p>The report highlighted that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including its tribal districts, remained the epicentre of militancy, accounting for 53 of the 82 attacks recorded nationwide.</p>
<p>Balochistan followed with 28 attacks, while no militant incidents were reported from Punjab, Sindh, Azad Kashmir or the Islamabad Capital Territory. However, one attack was recorded in the Diamer district of Gilgit-Baltistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.</p>
<p>The government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349">labelled</a> the TTP as <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and directed the use of the term <em>khariji</em> for attackers. It later <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525">designated</a> Balochistan-based groups as <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">highlight</a> India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.</p>
<p>A day earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the government was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927838">implementing</a> a comprehensive and effective strategy to “completely eliminate” the menace posed by the proscribed <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>, <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and other terrorist outfits to the country.</p>
<p>According to a statement from his office, the prime minister said the state had adopted a “multi-pronged strategy” in the war against terrorism and made “full and effective use” of important elements such as ground operations, legislation, meaningful public communication and discouraging extremist thinking.</p>
<p>He directed the Steering Committee on Counter-Terrorism and Establishment of the State Writ to ensure effective coordination between the federal and provincial governments against terrorism and to strictly implement their recommendations.</p>
<p>In March, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075">ranked second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45pc from 2024 to 1,081.</p></p>
