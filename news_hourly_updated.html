                <h2>SBP to launch pilot for digital currency, says governor</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Jameel Ahmad said on Wednesday the institution plans to launch a pilot for a digital currency and is finalising legislation to regulate virtual assets as the government ramps up efforts to modernise the country‚Äôs financial system.</p>
<p>Central banks globally are exploring the use of digital currencies as interest in blockchain-based payments grows. Pakistan‚Äôs move follows similar steps by regulators in China, India, Nigeria and several Gulf states to test or issue digital currencies through controlled pilot programmes.</p>
<p>At the <a class="link--external" href="https://events.reutersevents.com/nextasia" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Reuters</em> NEXT Asia</a> summit in Singapore, Ahmad said Pakistan was ‚Äúbuilding up our capacity on the central bank digital currency‚Äù and hoped to roll out a pilot soon.</p>
<p>He was speaking on a panel alongside Sri Lanka‚Äôs central bank governor, P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, with both discussing monetary policy challenges in South Asia.</p>
<p>Ahmad said a new law would ‚Äúlay down the foundations for the licensing and regulation‚Äù of the virtual assets sector and that the central bank was in touch with some tech partners.</p>
<p>The move builds on efforts by the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897897">set up</a> in March by the government to drive virtual asset adoption.</p>
<p>Bilal bin Saqib, PCC chief executive officer and state minister on blockchain and crypto, said in a statement today that the government had <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/business/virtual-assets-act-2025-approved-formally/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approved</a> the  Virtual Assets Act 2025, creating an independent regulator to license and oversee the crypto sector.</p>
<p>The PCC is exploring bitcoin mining using surplus energy, has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902715">appointed</a> Binance founder Changpeng Zhao as a strategic adviser and plans to establish a state-run <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914060">Strategic Bitcoin Reserve</a>.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>It has also held talks with US-based crypto firms, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906732">World Liberty Financial</a> linked to US President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>In May, the SBP <a class="link--external" href="https://www.sbp.org.pk/press/2025/Pr-30-May-2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">clarified</a> that virtual assets were not <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914439#:~:text=informed%20the%20National%20Assembly%E2%80%99s%20Standing%20Committee%20on%20Finance%20that%20cryptocurrency%20is%20currently%20banned">illegal</a>. However, it advised financial institutions not to engage with them until a formal licensing framework was in place.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere are risks associated, and at the same time, there are opportunities in this new emerging field. So we have to evaluate and manage the risk very carefully, and at the same time not allow to let go of the opportunity,‚Äù he said on the panel.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#tight-grip-falling-interest-rates" id="tight-grip-falling-interest-rates" title="Permalink"></a>Tight grip, falling interest rates</h2>
<p>Ahmad said the SBP would continue to maintain a tight policy stance to stabilise inflation within its 5‚Äì7 per cent medium-term target.</p>
<p>Pakistan has cut its benchmark rate from a peak of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1830543">22pc</a> to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908601">11pc</a> over the past year, as inflation slumped from 38pc in May 2023 to 3.2pc in June, averaging 4.5pc in the 2025 fiscal year just ended, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921571">nine-year low</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are now seeing the results of this tight monetary policy transfer, both on our inflation as well as on the external account,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Ahmad said Pakistan was not overly exposed to dollar weakness, noting its foreign debt was mostly dollar-denominated and only 13pc comprised Eurobonds or commercial loans.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt see any major impact,‚Äù he said, adding that reserves had risen to $14.5 billion from under $3bn two years ago.</p>
<p>Ahmad said Pakistan‚Äôs three-year $7bn <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">IMF programme</a>, which runs through September 2027, was on track and had resulted in reforms in fiscal policy, energy pricing and the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are confident that after that [IMF programme], maybe we will not require an immediate [follow-up].‚Äù</p>
<p>Asked whether Pakistan had financing plans lined up for upcoming military equipment purchases, particularly imports from China, the SBP governor said he was not aware of such plans.</p></p>

            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923063/dg-ispr-brands-indian-nsa-ajit-doval-chief-architect-of-terrorism-in-pakistan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <h2>DG ISPR brands Indian NSA Ajit Doval ‚Äòchief architect‚Äô of terrorism in Pakistan</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Wednesday accused Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval of being the ‚Äúchief architect‚Äù of terrorism in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The interview comes amid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913855/pakistan-slams-modis-inflammatory-monologue-urges-india-to-honour-international-order">tensions</a> between the two nuclear-armed countries in the wake of their recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military confrontation</a>, sparked by New Delhi‚Äôs baseless allegations against Islamabad over a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam.</p>
<p>During an exclusive interview with Qatari broadcaster <em>Al Jazeera</em>, the military‚Äôs spokesperson branded Doval the ‚Äúevil chief architect of India‚Äôs terror enterprise‚Äù and accused him of being responsible for not only acts of terrorism in Pakistan, but also terrorism within the region and transnational killings.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDo you think it‚Äôs happening on its own? This terror enterprise cannot be sustained without the sponsorship of India,‚Äù the DG ISPR said. ‚ÄúWho is the chief architect? Mr Ajit Doval.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the ISPR chief, India provided funding, planning, intelligence and technical support to terrorist groups within Pakistan, such as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917495"><em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em></a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914774#:~:text=Earlier%20during%20the%20event,%20PM%20Shehbaz%20underscored%20that%20terrorist%20groups%20under%20the%20umbrella%20of%20Fitna%20Al%20Hindustan%20sought%20the%20support%20of%20locals,%20which%20must%20be%20denied%20to%20them."><em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em></a>.</p>
<p>In July last year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349">designated</a> the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em>, while mandating all institutions to use the term <em>khariji</em> (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.</p>
<p>In May this year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525">designated</a> all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna al Hindu¬≠stan</em> ‚Äî a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">new phrase</a> aimed at framing India‚Äôs alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe strategy of India is to keep Pakistan embroiled in this menace of terrorism, so that its true power ‚Ä¶ potential is not realised,‚Äù Lt Gen Chaudhry said. ‚ÄúThe power differential between the two countries keeps increasing, so that India can act as a regional hegemon, a bully and can dictate its own terms.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that this strategy of supporting terrorists in the region went as far back as 1971, when India supported the Mukti Bahini in East Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndians have acknowledged it ‚Äî PM [Narendra] Modi went on record not only acknowledging but boasting about it.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The military‚Äôs spokesperson then added that terrorist commanders who had surrendered or been captured confessed that they received support from New Delhi, citing press conferences by captured <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> commanders and the case of captured Indian Navy Officer Kulbhushan Jadhav.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis evidence is all public. It is RAW,‚Äù he said, referring to India‚Äôs spy agency, Research and Analysis Wing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd not only are they using men, they are also exploiting the Baloch women for these nefarious purposes.‚Äù</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#a-reckless-and-irresponsible-state" id="a-reckless-and-irresponsible-state" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòA reckless and irresponsible state‚Äô</h2>
<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry further said that Pakistan was ‚Äúnot a reckless and irresponsible state like India‚Äù, blaming external actors for internal issues.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe must understand that terrorism is an internal problem of India as a result of the continuous oppression which India does to its minorities as part of its policy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRather than addressing these grave injustices, inequalities, and doing soul searching, it (India) is very quick to put all the blame on Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBecause of this senseless blame game that the Indians are resorting to, it is bringing the thresholds between India and Pakistan to dangerously low levels, to such levels that where one incident of terrorism or an act of violence can be turned into an act of war.‚Äù</p>
<p>The ISPR chief warned that such an approach was putting the lives of over 1.6 billion people ‚Äúin the hands of non-state actors‚Äù who had an interest in Pakistan and India going to war.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are an established and declared nuclear power, and the world has no experience of going to or even attempting to go into a misadventure against an established nuclear power,‚Äù Lt Gen Chaudhry said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf such a misadventure is taken or attempted, then it will lead to horrific consequences which the world may not be able to endure.‚Äù</p></p>
