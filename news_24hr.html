            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921636/assistant-commissioner-among-5-killed-in-bajaur-blast' target='_blank'><strong>Assistant commissioner among 5 killed in Bajaur blast</strong></a>
            <p><p>At least five people, including an assistant commissioner, were killed and 11 others injured on Wednesday in a bomb explosion in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district.</p>
<p>Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafique told <em>Dawn.com</em> that five people, including two policemen and a civilian, were killed in the explosion targeting a government vehicle on Nawagai Road in Siddiqabad railway attack area of Khar tehsil.</p>
<p>“The blast was so intense that the vehicle targeted was completely destroyed,” he said, adding that 11 people were injured in the blast and immediately transported to Khar Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>The DPO said that security was increased in the area and relief activities were underway.</p>
<p>The deceased include Nawagai Assistant Commissioner Faisal Ismail, Tehsildar Abdul Wakil, Subedar Noor Hakim, and police constable Rashid.</p>
<p>KP Health Adviser Ihtisham Ali strongly condemned the blast and expressed grief over the demise of the assistant commissioner and others in the incident.</p>
<p>He contacted the district health officer and the medical superintendent of District Headquarters Hospital Khar Bajaur and enquired about the well-being of those injured in the attack.</p>
<p>“An emergency has been imposed in Bajaur hospitals and health department staff has been alerted for first aid,” he said.</p>
<p>The health adviser assured the pubic that medical assistance would be provided to the injured.</p>
<p>KP Inspector General of Police (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed sought a report on the blast from the Malakand regional police officer (RPO).</p>
<p>He also ordered to speed up intelligence-based operations against the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group and directed the Counter-Terrorism Department’s additional inspector general of police to send a special team to Bajaur.</p>
<p>“A special branch is obtaining intelligence related to the incident,” Hameed said, adding that according to initial information, the TTP targeted the assistant commissioner’s vehicle.</p>
<p>Hameed said that teams were formed “to arrest the elements involved in the incident while all necessary evidence is being collected from the spot”, adding that bomb disposal teams were present on site.</p>
<p>Those elements disturbing the country and province’s peace will be strictly dealt with, the KP police chief said.</p>

<p>“The KP chief minister has issued orders for an enquiry into the incident and to provide medical facilities to the injured,” Saif said.</p>
<p>“Those who are hostile elements to the country will not be allowed to succeed in their nefarious purposes and will be brought to justice.”</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921638/psx-scales-130000-barrier-as-market-climbs-by-2100-points' target='_blank'><strong>PSX scales 130,000 barrier as market climbs by 2,100 points</strong></a>
            <p><p>Bulls continued their reign over the trading floor at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday as shares scaled the 130,000-point barrier to reach a new high after climbing by 2,100 points.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index opened on a positive note, rising by 1,430.07 points (1.12 per cent) to reach 129,629.49 points at 10:07am, from the previous close of 128,199.42 points.</p>
<p>Shares then rose further to reach 130,344.03 points at close, gaining 2,144.61 points (1.67pc) from yesterday.</p>
<p>The PSX extended its record-breaking <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920553">rally</a> for the fourth consecutive session today, which analysts <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921539">attributed</a> to easing inflation and signs of macroeconomic stability.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, said the increase in tax rate on income from debt securities, along with a change in the taxation structure for mutual funds to proportionate holdings of equities and fixed income, has resulted in inflows to equities from fixed income.</p>
<p>“Significant reduction in inflation rate — fell to a low of nine years — with improved outlook has increased the odds for further reduction in policy rate, which will help in continuation of flows towards equities,” he said.</p>
<p>The annual inflation rate has dropped sharply to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921571/inflation-slumps-to-9-year-low-at-449pc">nine-year low</a> of 4.49pc during the fiscal year 2024-25 from 23.41pc in the previous year. Pakistan is currently experiencing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902445">disinflation</a>, which reflects a slowdown in the rate of inflation, as opposed to deflation, which indicates a general decline in overall price levels.</p>
<p>Optimism around fiscal reforms announced in the federal budget also contributed to the rally.</p>
<p>“Continuation of monetary easing due to falling inflation driven by fiscal discipline, strong external account and focus on structural reforms would keep equities in the limelight,” Ashraf said a day ago.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921539#:~:text=Prime%20Minister%20Shehbaz%20Sharif%20expressed%20gratitude">statement</a>, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif asserted the KSE-100’s record close reflected growing confidence in the government’s economic policies. He described the index’s performance as a testament to the strengthening and stabilising sentiment surrounding the national economy.</p></p>

            <p><p>Bangladesh on Wednesday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921441">convicted fugitive</a> ex-prime minister Sheikh Hasina of contempt of court and issued a six-month prison sentence in absentia, the first verdict since she was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245">ousted</a> last year.</p>
<p>Hasina, 77, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245">fled</a> to neighbouring India at the culmination of the student-led uprising in August 2024, and has defied orders to return to Dhaka.</p>
<p>“She will serve the sentence the day she arrives in Bangladesh or surrenders to the court,” chief prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam told reporters after the court decision.</p>
<p>The case centred around comments that prosecutors said she had made after she was ousted from power, which they said threatened witnesses in ongoing court hearings.</p>
<p>“The prosecution team believes her comment created an aura of fear among those who filed the cases and among the witnesses,” Islam said.</p>
<p>Shakil Akanda Bulbul, a fugitive leader of her <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910911">now-banned</a> Awami League, was sentenced to two months in prison in the same case.</p>
<p>Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August last year, according to the United Nations, when Hasina’s government ordered a crackdown on protesters in a failed bid to cling to power.</p>
<p>In a separate ongoing trial that began on June 1, prosecutors say that Hasina held overall command responsibility for the violence.</p>
<p>Her state-appointed defence lawyer said she has denied the multiple charges that amount to crimes against humanity under Bangladeshi law.</p></p>
