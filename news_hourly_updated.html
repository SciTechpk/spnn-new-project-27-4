                <h2>JUI-F chief Fazl advises ‚Äòchange‚Äô in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa administration</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Saturday suggested that there should be a ‚Äúchange‚Äù in the PTI-led Khyber Pakht¬≠un¬≠khwa government, adding that it would be better if the change came from within the ruling party amid reports of possible efforts afoot to bring a ‚Äúregime change‚Äù in the province.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921763">met</a> two key leaders from the province, ostensibly to get a handle on the political situation. The PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre believes that the PTI government in KP has failed to deliver for over a decade, and recent events have further cemented their conviction that the provincial government is failing to safeguard the lives of the people. Meanwhile, the PTI has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921760/pti-warns-against-attempt-to-topple-provincial-set-up">warned</a> against any attempt to topple the provincial government through constitutional means.</p>
<p>Addressing the matter at a press conference in Peshawar today, the JUI-F chief said, ‚ÄúMy advice would be that there should be a change in the province but if the PTI is in the majority, then the change should be from within the majority of the PTI. If the same people come together to bring a change in the provincial government, then it will be better.‚Äù</p>
<p>Fazl said he preferred this option rather than the opposition coming together and bringing a change in the government.</p>
<p>He added that it was his belief and that of his party that the majority of the province was ‚Äúfake‚Äù and a product of rigging but it could not tolerate any political struggle or uncertainty, thus it would be better if there was a change from within the ruling PTI.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Speaking on the prevailing security situation in the province, Fazl said, ‚ÄúThe common citizen‚Äôs life is insecure today.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf the opposition parties contact us then will we talk to them and also try to hold an all party conference to discuss this issue and come up with a strategy to deal with it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Speaking about the merger of Fata with KP, he said, ‚ÄúWe strongly opposed the merger when it was being done.‚Äù</p>
<p>Fazl said that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922671/pti-muqam-spar-over-ex-fata-jirga-committee">committee</a> formed to bring reforms in ex-Fata did not have representation from KP.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFrom all the parties, only we have been asked for representatives for the committee, but we haven‚Äôt given our representatives,‚Äù he added. The JUI-F chief said that the party would take its decision in consultation with tomorrow‚Äôs grand tribal jirga.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIs this decision an admission of the failure of the previous decision (Fata merger) or another ploy to gain access to the minerals of the area?‚Äù he asked.</p>
<p>The JUI-F chief said that if he was content with the federal government‚Äôs decisions, then he would have joined them. ‚ÄúBoth the federal and the provincial governments were a result of electoral rigging,‚Äù Fazl said.</p>

<p>Later, JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza said, ‚ÄúWe have had reservations against KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.‚Äù</p>
<p>Speaking on <em>Geo News</em> programme ‚ÄòNaya Pakistan‚Äô, Murtaza said that he had personal reservations with Gandapur and his party did as well.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe reason is his inappropriate behaviour and language; he is not a well-liked personality for us,‚Äù the senator said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, we don‚Äôt want the government to fall.  So if PTI itself takes that decision that a certain individual will not continue and will be replaced by another, JUI-F would certainly welcome that decision,‚Äù Murtaza said.</p>
<p>He added that Gandapur being from Dera Ismail Khan, the same district Fazl hailed from, was not a a factor in the decision.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi said that the ex-Fata committee was not ‚Äúabout reversing the merger of Fata and the province‚Äù.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Peshawar, he said, ‚ÄúThe committee was formed when the prime minister and Field Marshal [Asim] Munir visited and a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915208">jirga</a> was held.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe provincial government said that the jirga system that had ended in the merged districts should be revived, and this is what the committee was formed for.‚Äù</p></p>

                <h2>Islamabad court halts banning of 5 more YouTube channels</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>An Islamabad district and sessions court on Saturday suspended a lower court‚Äôs order to block 27 YouTube channels to the effect of five more channels, a day after a similar halt on channels of two journalists.</p>
<p>It emerged on Tuesday that an Islamabad court had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922836/islamabad-court-orders-blocking-of-27-youtube-channels-on-nccias-request">ordered</a> YouTube last month to block 27 channels for disseminating ‚Äúfake, misleading, and defamatory‚Äù content against the government and armed forces. The sanctioned accounts were being run by journalists, political commentators and social media in¬≠¬≠fluencers in Pakistan and overseas.</p>
<p>On Friday, an Islamabad district and sessions court admitted two revision petitions ‚Äî submitted by journalists Matiuallah Jan and Asad Ali Toor ‚Äî against the judicial magistrate‚Äôs order blocking 27 YouTube channels, suspending the ban for the two petitioners. Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Muhammad Afzal Majoka heard the two revision appeals and ordered the suspension in a one-page written order for each petition.</p>
<p>Six more of those affected had appealed against the lower court‚Äôs order today. ADSJ Majoka heard the case and granted similar relief to the following five individuals: Makhdoom Shahabuddin, Orya Maqbool Jan, Abdul Qadir, Uzair Anwar and Umair Rafique.</p>
<p>The court adjourned proceedings on Habib Akram‚Äôs application till July 14 due to the unavailability of the petitioner. As per the short orders, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, the petitioners contended that they were not even given a prior notice and that the ban violated Article 10-A of the Constitution. The judge agreed that no notices were issued to the petitioners before the blocking order was passed and the point needed further consideration.</p>
<p>The ban order sparked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923172">criticism</a> from various legal and digital rights groups.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said that the owners of these channels would face <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923067/hrcp-expresses-concern-as-govt-warns-criminal-action-against-27-youtube-channels-set-for-blocking#:~:text=Separately%2C%20Minister%20of%20State%20for%20Interior%20Talal%20Chaudhry%20said%20that%20these%20channels%20would%20also%20face%20criminal%20action.">criminal action.</a></p>
<p>The Forum for Di¬≠¬≠gital Rights and Democracy (FDRD) and the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) on Wed¬≠n¬≠esday condemned the decision, calling it a ‚Äúbla¬≠¬≠tant violation‚Äù of fundamental rig¬≠hts and an assault on press freedom.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has also expressed concern over the ban, stating, ‚ÄúThe wholesale blocking of entire channels ‚Äî rather than addressing specific instances of unlawful or hateful speech in accordance with due process ‚Äî conflates dissent with criminal activity.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe constitutional right to freedom of expression is fundamental not only for individual liberty but also for ensuring government accountability, fostering debate and enabling the public to access a diversity of viewpoints,‚Äù the HRCP said, urging ‚Äúprecise and proportionate‚Äù interventions against hate speech.</p>
<p>On March 20, Farhan Mallick, the founder of media agency <em>Raftar</em> and a former news director at <em>Samaa TV</em>, was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899186/fia-arrests-journalist-farhan-mallick-over-content-of-videos">arrested</a> in Karachi and booked under Peca as well as the Pakistan Penal Code in a case related to alleged anti-state content on his YouTube channel.</p>
<p>The arrest was met with widespread criticism from media bodies as well as rights activists.</p>
<p>He was granted <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902677/karachi-courts-grant-bail-to-journalist-farhan-mallick-in-anti-state-call-centre-cases">bail</a> in April in the many cases against him pertaining to allegedly ‚Äúanti-state‚Äù content and data theft through a call centre.</p>
<p>In May, Pakistan Telecommunication Authority <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909092">lifted</a> the ban on X after the platform was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893244">inaccessible</a> to users for more than a year. The social media platform was blocked in February 2024, around 10 days after the general elections, while the caretaker government was still in power.</p></p>
