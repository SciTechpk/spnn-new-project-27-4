            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915821/sindh-bans-four-seater-rickshaws-outsources-fitness-checks-in-traffic-law-overhaul' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh bans four-seater rickshaws, outsources fitness checks in traffic law overhaul</strong></a>
            <p><p>In a bid to tighten traffic regulation enforcement, the Sindh government on Friday approved a set of sweeping legal changes, including a ban on four-seater rickshaws, mandatory third-party vehicle fitness checks, and sharp increases in traffic violation fines, as part of an overhaul aimed at improving road safety and accountability.</p>
<p>The decision comes as Karachi grapples with a surge in traffic accidents, particularly involving dumpers and water tankers, that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data. The spate of deadly incidents triggered protests over citizens’ deaths, prompting the provincial government to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891766/govt-relaxes-timing-of-ban-on-entry-of-heavy-vehicles#:~:text=Sindh%20Information%20Minister%20Sharjeel%20Inam%20Memon,%20at%20a%20press%20conference%20held%20to%20share%20decisions%20taken%20in%20the%20meeting,%20said%20that%20the%20current%20time%20for%20dumper%20trucks%20to%20enter%20the%20city%20was%20from%2011pm%20to%206am.">ban</a> heavy vehicles during daytime hours and require them to obtain fitness certificates.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the home department, Sindh Home Minister Zia Ul Hassan Lanjar chaired the meeting to discuss necessary amendments to the Motor Vehicles Rules in light of the alarming increase in the number of accidents in the province.</p>
<p>Briefed by the secretaries of law and transport, as well as the inspector general of police and deputy inspector general of traffic police, the meeting “approved plans to outsource vehicle fitness certification to third parties and enforce a ban on four-seater rickshaws,” the statement said.</p>
<p>According to the statement, key decisions taken during the meeting included mandatory fitness certification for both commercial and non-commercial vehicles, and outsourcing vehicle fitness evaluations to third parties.</p>
<p>Lanjar stated, “The services of third parties will be engaged for issuing fitness certificates, while formal memoranda of understanding (MoUs) will be signed with them in compliance with all applicable regulations.”</p>
<p>The meeting also decided to ban the sale of tinted windows, fancy lights, and sirens, whether online or at physical shops.</p>
<p>Participants unanimously approved legal amendments to enforce a complete ban on four-seater rickshaws, the statement said, adding that Excise Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla assured full support from the excise department in enforcing traffic regulations by ensuring that no registration or route permits will be issued for four-seater or larger rickshaws like Qingqi, as many accidents have taken place due to rickshaws <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904899/ban-on-heavy-vehicles-extended-as-fresh-curbs-imposed-on-rickshaws">colliding</a> with trucks.</p>
<p>He further said that a crackdown will be launched against any such vehicles found operating on the roads. While promising a prompt completion of the vehicle fitness service structure, he asserted that strict enforcement of fitness requirements would follow.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Chawla also made it mandatory for water tankers and dumpers to install trackers and sensors. It was decided that a comprehensive draft of the new regulations would be prepared and submitted to the Sindh government for approval and ratification.</p>
<p>Minister Lanjar added that to reduce traffic congestion, accidents, and rule violations, only 1x2 seater rickshaws would be allowed on the roads. Strict fines were also approved, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rs200,000 for wrong-way driving by government vehicles,</li>
<li>Rs25,000 for motorcyclists driving against traffic,</li>
<li>Rs100,000 for four-wheelers violating one-way rules,</li>
<li>Rs25,000 for motorcyclists and PKR 50,000 for car drivers without a driving license,</li>
<li>Rs100,000 for first-time offences of one-wheeling or drifting, increasing to PKR 200,000 and PKR 300,000 for repeat offences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Lanjar approved the mandatory installation of at least five cameras in heavy/load-carrying vehicles.</p>
<p>It was decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. Vehicles with unpaid fines will not be allowed to be sold or transferred.</p>
<p>He further said that the traffic, transport, and excise systems would be interlinked and moved online, and announced the appointment of a dedicated traffic magistrate to handle traffic law offence cases, per the statement.</p></p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, currently on a two-day state visit to Saudi Arabia, performed Umrah on the night of Thursday and Friday, offering prayers for the country’s success in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909977">Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos</a>, the government said on its X account.</p>
<p>The delegation arrived in Saudi Arabia at the invitation of Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman for a visit from June 5 to 6, according to a statement from the Foreign Office. The visit is focused on strengthening bilateral cooperation in key areas between both nations.  PM Shehbaz is also expected to thank the Saudi leadership for its constructive role in de-escalating the recent Pakistan-India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">conflict.</a></p>
<p>PM Shehbaz was accompanied by Army Chief Field Marshal General Asim Munir, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Raza Naqvi, and Information and Broadcasting Minister Attaullah Tarar, who also performed the Umrah.</p>

<p>The gates of the Kaaba, the holiest site in Islam, were specially opened for the delegation, where they offered prayers for the prosperity of Pakistan and the Muslim community worldwide, particularly the Muslims in Gaza and India-occupied Kashmir. They also expressed gratitude for Pakistan’s success against last month’s Indian aggression and recent economic <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911421">growth.</a></p>
<p>“This visit underscores the deep-rooted, time-tested ties between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, anchored in shared faith, mutual respect, and strategic partnership,” the FO said.</p>
<p>The statement further added: “It reaffirms the leadership’s commitment to deepening economic and diplomatic engagement, aligning with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 and Pakistan’s development priorities.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Sharif’s visit is expected to further solidify Pakistan-Saudi Arabia relations and open new avenues for multifaceted collaboration.“</p></p>

            <p><p>The Foreign Office on Friday “unequivocally” condemned the Israeli airstrikes on Beirut and southern parts of Lebanon, urging the international community to hold Tel Aviv accountable and take immediate action against the offensive.</p>
<p>According to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/5/israel-launches-several-attacks-on-beiruts-southern-suburbs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a></em>, the attack on Thursday targeting Hezbollah marks the fourth time Israel has bombed Beirut after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875001">ceasefire</a> was signed in November 2024. The Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, in a statement after the strikes, voiced “firm condemnation of the Israeli aggression,” calling the attack — carried out on the eve of Eidul Azha — a “flagrant violation of an international accord.”</p>
<p>Israel and Hezbollah started <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1848736">trading</a> fire on Oct 8, a day after Hamas attacked communities in southern Israel and sparked the Gaza offensive. Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, says its attacks aim to support Palestinians who are under Israeli bombardment in Gaza.</p>
<p>The Foreign Office, in a statement, extending solidarity to Lebanese people during “this difficult time” and highlighted that “the reckless use of force threatens civilian lives, fuels regional instability, and undermines efforts for lasting peace.”</p>
<p>The FO noted that the attack constituted a violation of the sovereignty of Lebanon as well as the ceasefire signed between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>
<p>“We urge the international community, particularly the United Nations and ceasefire mediators, to take immediate action to hold Israeli occupying forces accountable and prevent further escalation,” the statement read.</p>
<p>“Pakistan remains firmly committed to peace, justice, and the principles of international law.”</p>
<p>On Thursday, the prime minister of Lebanon, Nawaf Salam, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915737/lebanon-dismantles-over-500-hezbollah-installations">announced</a> that the Lebanese army had dismantled “more than 500 military positions and arms depots” belonging to Hezbollah in the south of the country.</p>
<p>“There can be no security or stability while Israel’s daily violations persist, parts of our land remain occupied, and our prisoners are not freed,” Salam added.</p></p>
