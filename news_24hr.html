            <p><p>Pakistan’s envoy to the United States has called on the global community to resolve the Kashmir dispute, terming it the “core issue” of the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284/trade-ties-and-flights-off-limits-as-pakistan-retaliates-to-indias-moves">complete breakdown</a> of ties with India in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> as it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an incursion and India’s premier granting “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war">military</a> warning of a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907785/any-military-misadventure-by-india-will-be-met-with-swift-resolute-notch-up-response-coas"> resolute</a>” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907930/us-hopes-that-indias-response-to-pahalgam-attack-doesnt-lead-to-broader-regional-conflict-vance">diplomatic channels</a> have been engaged to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>“It could be an important part of President [Donald] Trump’s legacy to attend to this situation — not with a Band-Aid solution, but by addressing the core issue: the Kashmir dispute,” Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855847">Rizwan Saeed Sheikh</a> said in an interview with <em>Fox News Digital</em> published earlier today.</p>
<p>“This is one nuclear flashpoint,” the envoy said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Sheikh’s statement echoes his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907760/pm-shehbaz-thanks-china-for-endorsing-pakistans-proposal-of-neutral-probe-into-pahalgam-attack#:~:text=Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20envoy%20calls%20on%20Trump%20to%20ease%20tensions%20with%20India%3A%20report">recent call to Trump</a> to step in and help ease soaring tensions with India. He had highlighted that as a president “standing for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration”, there was no “higher or flashier flashpoint” than the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>Trump, in his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=Overseas%20wars%20and%20plans%20for%20peace">inaugural speech</a> as the US president, had said: “My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.”</p>
<p>A ceasefire — which has since been broken — was secured between <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886289">Israel and Hamas</a> following Trump’s election, and he has also been engaging with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906950">Ukraine and Russia</a> to halt their war.</p>
<p>During his interview with <em>Fox News</em>, Sheikh also called on nations around the globe to help with a lasting settlement to the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>He said: “Previously, when the situation has been at this level or the tensions have escalated, the international community has attended to the situation, but taken their eyes [and] attention away, even before the situation could fully diffuse.</p>
<p>“This time, perhaps it would be […] timely in terms of the situation elsewhere on the globe, with similar instances, […] to perhaps not afford a Band-Aid solution, but to address the broader problem.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Any misadventure or miscalculation can lead to a nuclear interface,” the ambassador was quoted as saying. “That is certainly not desirable in such a densely populated region.”</p>
<p>“We want a peaceful neighbourhood,” Sheikh emphasised, adding that Pakistan did not want any instability in the region.</p>
<p>However, he stressed, Pakistan’s desire for peace “should not in any way be misconstrued as a sign of weakness”. “We want peace with dignity.”</p>
<p>Sheikh described India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">response</a> to the Pahalgam attack as dangerously premature and inflammatory, according to the report.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The envoy reiterated Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s offer to hold a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral and transparent</a>” probe into the Pahalgam attack. He pointed out that both the investigation offer and Pakistan’s request for evidence linking it to the attack had gone “unanswered”.</p>
<p>“Within minutes of the attack, India began levelling accusations against Pakistan,” he said, noting that a post-investigation report was filed just 10 minutes after the incident occurred, despite the remote and rugged terrain near the scene.</p>
<p>The ambassador warned that the region was once again being held “hostage to the war of hysteria” by India’s government and media, who immediately “began beating war drums”.</p>
<p>On the allegations implied by India, which has not yet named Pakistan or any entity directly, Sheikh said the suspects were reportedly Indian nationals whose homes have already been raided.</p>
<p>He questioned why India is looking outside its borders rather than addressing “administrative inadequacies” in occupied Kashmir. He slammed India’s broader policies in held Kashmir, including the alleged settlement of non-residents into the region.</p>

<p>Speaking about India’s <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unilateral suspension</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>, Ambassador Sheikh said: “That is as grossly illegal as it can get. This is one treaty that has withstood wars between India and Pakistan.”</p>
<p>Law Minister Azam Naz­eer Tarar said yesterday that Pakistan’s final response to India’s letters on the IWT <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908128/multiple-ministries-to-craft-pakistans-response-on-iwt">would be crafted</a> in consultation with all relevant ministries, including foreign affairs, water resources and law.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik has also said Islamabad would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907454">approach international forums</a>, including the World Bank that brokered it, regarding the treaty’s suspension.</p></p>

            <p><p>India said it has banned the import of goods originating from or transiting via Pakistan as diplomatic tensions between the two nuclear-armed nations flared in the wake of a deadly attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">killed 26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000.

<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing</a> its forces and India’s premier granting “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>” to the military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of April 30, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an Indian incursion within 24–36 hours, diplomatic channels have been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension">engaged</a> to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>India’s Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.dgft.gov.in/CP/?opt=notification" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a> said the ban will take effect immediately.</p>
<p>“This restriction is imposed in the interest of national security and public policy,” it said.</p>
<p>In response to India’s slew of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">aggressive measures</a> against the country in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan announced <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284">retaliatory measures</a> that have included halting all border trade, closing its airspace to Indian carriers and expelling Indian diplomats.</p>
<p>However, Pakistan on May 1 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907774/govt-allows-150-stranded-afghan-trucks-to-cross-wagah-border-for-goods-delivery">allowed</a> 150 stranded Afghan trucks carrying goods for India to cross the Wagah Border, easing a weeks-long bottleneck, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.</p>
<p>Trade between the two nations has dwindled over the last few years.</p>
<p>In August 2019, Pakistan had already <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1499076">formally downgraded</a> its trade relations with India to the level of Israel, with which Islamabad has no trade ties at all — in reaction to New Delhi’s decision to revoke Article 370 of its constitution that granted occupied Kashmir a special status.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908068/india-continues-blocking-social-media-channels-tries-to-undercut-imf-deal' target='_blank'><strong>India continues blocking social media channels; tries to undercut IMF deal</strong></a>
            <p><p>NEW DELHI: As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470">handed</a> the defence of the country back to the military and busied himself with economic management, the strategy to deal with Pakistan appeared to be shaping into an imitation of what the government does with critics at home — shutting their finances and media outlets.</p>
<p>Modi was inaugurating a port in Kerala on Friday, and mocking the opposition when the Indian government also blocked access to the official YouTube channel of Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for users in India, invoking concerns over national security and public order, Kolkata-based <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/india-blocks-shehbaz-sharifs-youtube-channel-expands-crackdown-on-social-media-accounts-post-pahalgam-attack/cid/2097175" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Telegraph</a></em> newspaper said on Friday.</p>
<p>It said the move was part of a wider crackdown on Pakistani digital content, following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam that left 26 civilians dead, most of them tourists.</p>
<p>Users trying to access PM Shehbaz’s YouTube profile are now met with a standard message: “This content is currently unavailable in this country because of an order from the government related to national security or public order.”</p>
<p>This is the most high-profile block since similar action was taken against the YouTube channels of Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the paper said.</p>
<p>India’s ministry of information and broadcasting has invoked emergency provisions under the Information Technology Act to direct major social media platforms to geo-restrict several Pakistani accounts that were allegedly involved in spreading anti-India narratives and misinformation.</p>
<p>Officials say the restrictions are part of a “coordinated counter-disinformation effort” in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>A notable segment of the crackdown has been directed at high-profile Pakistani cricketers, whose social media accounts enjoy massive Indian viewership.</p>
<p>“The Instagram handles of current and former players including Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf have been blocked for Indian users,” according to the report.</p>
<p>Attempts to access these profiles in India, it said, now return a message stating: “Account not available in India. This is because we complied with a legal request to restrict this content.”</p>
<p>The YouTube channels of Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Akhtar, and Basit Ali have also been geo-restricted, making their content inaccessible to Indian audiences.</p>
<p>The action, officials say, is based on concerns that these public figures were either directly sharing or amplifying content that could be used to spread anti-India sentiment, particularly in the wake of the Kashmir attack.</p>
<p>Former players including Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Afridi (on Instagram) continue to have visible accounts, although, according to the report, more profiles could be under review.</p>
<p>Earlier, the YouTube channels of Shoaib Akhtar, Syed Muzammil Shah, and Arzoo Kazmi, channels such as <em>Duniya Merey Aagay</em>, <em>Ghulam Nabi Madni</em>, <em>HAQEEQAT TV</em> and <em>HAQEEQAT TV 2.0</em> were also blocked for Indian users.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Olympic javelin silver medallist Arshad Nadeem’s Instagram account has also been blocked in India. The tenth edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL), currently underway, is not being broadcast or streamed in India. Broadcasters <em>Sony Sports Network</em> and <em>FanCode</em> suspended telecast of the tournament following the Pahalgam strike, <em>The Telegraph</em> said.</p>
<p>The restrictions go beyond politics and sport. Earlier, the Instagram profiles of leading Pakistani actresses Mahira Khan and Hania Aamir were blocked for Indian users. Other celebrities, including Ali Zafar and Fawad Khan, have also faced similar action in recent days.</p>
<p>Officials in the ministry said that the government would continue to monitor and act against digital assets that pose a threat to India’s sovereignty, particularly in the context of terrorism, defence and foreign affairs.</p>
<p><strong>IMF programme</strong></p>
<p>Separately, India has also asked global multilateral agencies, including the IMF, to review funds and loans <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845536">provided</a> to Pakistan, as New Delhi seeks “to corner the neighbouring state diplomatically”.</p>
<p>“We will be asking all multilateral agencies to review the loans and support to Pakistan,” <em>Reuters</em> quoted a government source as saying.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Pakistan secured a $7 billion bailout programme from the IMF last year and was granted a new $1.3 billion climate resilience loan in  March.</p>
<p>Although the IMF and India’s finance ministry did not immediately respond to a <em>Reuters</em> request for comment, an adviser to Pakistan’s finance minister said the IMF programme is  “well on track”.</p>
<p>“The latest review has been done well and we are completely on  track,” Khurram Schehzad told Reuters, adding that Pakistan had  very productive spring meetings with financial institutions in  Washington.</p>
<p>“We did about 70 meetings … interest has been very  high for investing and supporting Pakistan as the economy turns around,”  Schehzad said.</p>
