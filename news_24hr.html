            <p><p>Pakis­tan Air Force (PAF) Chief Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu held a series of high-level meetings with senior military and political leadership of the United States in a landmark visit to the country, it emerged on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Last month, Field Marshal Asim Munir became the first serving chief of army staff to have a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044">face-to-face meeting</a> with a sitting US president when he met Donald Trump for talks at the White House. The occasion also marked the first time a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law. The two had discussed joint counter-terrorism efforts and expanding bilateral trade during their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093">“cordial” meeting</a> in Washington.</p>
<p>Today, PAF’s Directorate General of Public Relations (DGPR) said that in a “significant development” aimed at strengthening bilateral defence cooperation and advancing mutual interests, the air chief undertook an official visit to the US, adding that it was the “first by a serving PAF air chief in over a decade”.</p>
<p>It said the high-profile visit marked a “strategic milestone” in Pakistan-US defence cooperation and “proved instrumental in deepening institutional ties” in addition to addressing key regional and global security issues.</p>

<p>The DGPR said that at the Pentagon, the air chief called on US Air Force (International Affairs) Secretary Kelli L Seybolt and  Chief of Staff of the US Air Force General David W Allvin.</p>
<p>“The discussions centred around advancing bilateral military cooperation, enhancing interoperability and exploring avenues of joint training and technology exchange. Chief of the air staff highlighted the historic and multifaceted relationship between Pakistan and US, particularly in the domains of defence and security cooperation.</p>
<p>“He reiterated his resolve to further enhance the existing ties in the realms of military-to-military cooperation and training between the air forces of the two countries. The two sides also agreed upon the continuation of high-level military engagements in future through senior-level interactions,” the DGPR said.</p>
<p>It said these interactions were deemed crucial for maintaining momentum in ongoing cooperative endeavours in the areas of joint training, operational exercises and military exchange programmes between the two nations.</p>
<p>At the US State Department, the air chief met Brown L Stanley from the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and Eric Meyer from the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs. The DGPR said the meetings served as a forum to “underscore Pakistan’s constructive role in promoting regional stability, its firm commitment to counter-terrorism efforts and its nuanced perspective on the evolving geopolitical dynamics of South and Central Asia”.</p>
<p>As part of his engagements at Capitol Hill, the air chief held “substantive dialogues with prominent members” of the US Congress, including Mike Turner, Rich McCormick and Bill Huizenga.</p>
<p>“These interactions reinforced the importance of robust engagement in strengthening bilateral relations and provided a valuable opportunity to share Pakistan’s views on strategic challenges, regional security frameworks and the impact of emerging technologies on defence cooperation.</p>
<p>“Emphasising Pakistan’s status as a peace-loving nation, the air chief reaffirmed the country’s enduring sacrifices and notable operational achievements in the global war on terror, while also outlining Pakistan’s evolving security calculus in response to the rapidly shifting regional geopolitical landscape.”</p>
<p>The DGPR said the “landmark visit” not only reaffirmed PAF’s commitment to promoting regional and global peace, but also laid the groundwork for renewed institutional collaboration, strategic dialogue and enhanced interoperability between it and the US Air Force.</p></p>

            <p><p>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Wednesday said that the party was standing together and presenting a “message of unity” amid rumours of rifts while warning the federal government against toppling the party’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa administration.</p>
<p>Background briefings revealed a complete <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920889/lack-of-trust-sparks-fissures-within-pti#:~:text=Background%20briefings%20revealed%20a%20complete%20lack%20of%20trust%20among%20PTI%20leaders,%20with%20doubts%20about%20each%20other%E2%80%99s%20sincerity%20and%20intentions,%20particularly%20regarding%20Imran%20Khan%E2%80%99s%20messages.">lack of trust</a> among PTI leaders, with doubts about each other’s sincerity and intentions, particularly regarding messages from party founder Imran Khan, who has been behind bars since August 2023.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Islamabad and flanked by senior PTI leaders, the party chairman outlined the issues discussed in a high-level meeting and maintained that the PTI would continue efforts to try and free Imran.</p>

<p>“We discussed the aftermath of the reserved seat ruling, which was the first time that the party formed a strategy together,” Gohar said. “It is our decision that we will stand up together for Imran Khan. We have no personal conflict, we are and will remain united and a message of unity needed to be sent in today’s meeting.”</p>
<p>Gohar added that the meeting discussed Imran’s plan for the party to launch a protest movement, stating: “Whatever Khan <em>sahib</em> decides, we will execute it.”</p>

<p>Gohar said that PTI MNAs, MPAs and senators all attended today’s meeting, which discussed a wide range of issues from the reserved seats verdict and the party’s direction to addressing dialogue with the government.</p>
<p>“Whatever direction will be announced, you will see it in due course.”</p>
<p>Discussing the letter from jailed PTI leaders suggesting dialogue with the government, Gohar noted that the media would often infer that the government extended offers for talks, which were rejected by the PTI.</p>
<p>“This is incorrect, from the beginning, Khan <em>sahib</em> said that there should be dialogue,” Gohar said. “Even after our mandate was stolen, he said that. You have taken our seats, but you have registered cases against three of our MNAs, yet Khan <em>sahib</em> says that dialogue needs to be meaningful,” the party chairman added.</p>
<p>Gohar said that there was no delay on the PTI’s part, but said that the government was “not sincere” since it refused to grant the party access to Imran.</p>
<p>Talking about the reserved seats, he noted that there were 25 seats from KP. “Even if these seats go to the opposition … then they are 35 members short. We will protect the KP government at all costs,” Gohar stated. “Those who want to bring a no-confidence motion do not have the required numbers to move even a resolution.”</p>
<p>PTI KP President Junaid Akbar said that all of the provincial political leadership was also present at the meeting and stressed that within the party, decisions by the founder were respected by all members, with “discord set to one side”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur challenged other parties and institutions to topple the PTI’s government in KP.</p>
<p>“If you have it in you, I challenge your strength and I challenge the state … if you are able to topple our government, then I will leave politics,” he stated.</p>

<p>He criticised the government, saying that it was a “disgraceful stain on the state and its institutions” within the country’s political history, but “they are not ashamed”.</p>
<p>“We are time-tested people who have given sacrifices … So this is a challenge to your powers to try anything only without any conspiracies or unconstitutional ways. But you cannot do it. You cannot topple Khan’s people.”</p>

<p>Speaking on the Feb 8 elections, PTI Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja said that they would always be remembered as the most “democratic day” in history, along with the “attack on Pakistani people”, referring to the election results.</p>
<p>“We will continue to struggle for the public. We will succeed. Do not think that by stealing seats, suppressing the judiciary, the people will step back. We are with the people.”</p>
<p>He further said, “We stand with Imran’s struggle for the public. We will continue to struggle for the public.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, party spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram said the assembled leadership passed a unanimous resolution against the Constitutional Bench’s verdict on reserved seats and stated that the party would work to ensure the release of Imran and other jailed PTI leaders.</p>
<p>“Legal action, peaceful protest and negotiation are steps we are willing to take,” Akram said, quoting the resolution. He too said the party was united under Imran’s leadership and would remain so.</p></p>

            <p><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Wednesday that its foreign exchange reserves rose to $14.51 billion by June 30.</p>
<p>Last month, the central bank’s reserves <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916829">increased</a> by $167 million to $11.675bn during the week ending June 6, though it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920443">failed</a> to reach its target of $14bn by the end of the 2024-25 fiscal year.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://www.sbp.org.pk/press/2025/Pr-02-JuL-2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> issued by the SBP today said its reserves rose by $5.12bn to reach $14.51bn, as compared to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845306">$9.39bn</a> on June 30 last year.</p>
<p>“This reflects a noticeable improvement in the country’s current account balance and realisation of planned inflows during the year,” the SBP said.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921174/china-rolls-over-34-billion-loans-to-pakistan">rolled over</a> $3.4bn in loans, two senior Pakistani government officials told <em>Reuters</em>, in a move that was expected to help boost the country’s foreign exchange reserves, a requirement of the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>Beijing rolled over $2.1bn, which has been in the SBP’s reserves for the last three years, and refinanced another $1.3bn commercial loan, which Islamabad had paid back two months ago, the sources said.</p>
<p>Another $1bn from Middle Eastern commercial banks and $500m from multilateral financing have also been received, one of the officials had said.</p></p>
