<p>He said there was a pressing need to support the underprivileged and marginalised segments of our society. ‚ÄúAlong with the act of animal sacrifice, Eid calls upon us to make a solemn pledge to always care for those in need.‚Äù</p>
<p>Zardari said as a nation, we must support each other, share in each other‚Äôs sorrows, and work together to build a prosperous and great Pakistan.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said, ‚ÄúThe message of Eidul Azha is not limited to the sacrifice of animals alone, it also teaches us to sacrifice our ego, desires, and personal interests for higher purposes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs our beloved homeland, Pakistan, moves forward on the path of development, we must embrace the spirit of unity, sacrifice, and selflessness.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said this Eid teaches us not only the importance of sacrificing life and wealth but also that nations achieve greatness when they work for collective welfare and selflessness alongside individual development.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz continued, ‚ÄúToday, we must especially remember our Palestinian brothers and sisters who are enduring ruthless and inhumane oppression and hunger.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added: ‚ÄúLikewise, we reaffirm our unwavering solidarity with the brave people of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, who have been engaged in a just and courageous struggle for their right to self-determination for decades.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>UK and India discuss ‚Äòcounter-terrorism‚Äô cooperation after South Asia tensions</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The United Kingdom and India on Saturday discussed expanding their ‚Äúcounter-terrorism‚Äù collaboration following recent fighting between the latter and Pakistan, Britain‚Äôs foreign minister told <em>Reuters</em> after meeting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>British FM David Lammy is the highest-profile Western official to have visited both New Delhi and Islamabad since the two agreed to a ceasefire last month after their worst fighting in nearly three decades.</p>
<p>The latest tensions began in April after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">killing</a> of 26 men in Indian-occupied Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù it alleged were backed by Pakistan, a charge Islamabad denied. India then attacked what it claimed was ‚Äúterrorist infrastructure‚Äù in Pakistan, leading to escalation from both sides until a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910113/world-community-hails-ceasefire-decision-between-pakistan-and-india">May 10 ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe want the situation to be maintained, but of course we recognise fragility, particularly in the backdrop of terrorism, terrorism designed to destabilise India,‚Äù Lammy said in an interview at the residence of the British high commissioner in New Delhi.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are keen to continue to work with our Indian partners on counter-terrorism measures.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said he discussed the next steps with both Modi and Indian FM S. Jaishankar, but gave no specifics.</p>
<p>Last year, India and Britain discussed combatting the financing of terrorism, cooperation between law enforcement and judicial bodies and information sharing.</p>
<p>Lammy said he also discussed boosting trade between the world‚Äôs fifth and sixth largest economies. The countries concluded talks for a free trade deal early last month.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI know that Prime Minister Keir Starmer is very much looking forward to coming to India very soon to sign the free trade agreement,‚Äù Lammy said. ‚ÄúThere is so much that our two nations can continue to do together.‚Äù</p></p>
