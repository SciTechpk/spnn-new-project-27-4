                <h2>COAS Munir back in US to meet senior political and military leadership</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir is undertaking an official visit to the United States and has engaged in high-level interactions with senior political and military leadership, as well as members of the Pakistani diaspora, the military‚Äôs media wing said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The visit comes shortly after he went to the US in June on a five-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917414">official visit</a>, where he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093/trump-coas-munir-talk-counterterrorism-and-trade-in-cordial-meeting-ispr">met</a> with US President Donald Trump over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">luncheon</a>, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.</p>
<p>During the trip in June, Field Marshal Munir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918382">stressed</a> the ‚Äúimmense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect‚Äù with Washington.</p>
<p>Today‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7386" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said: ‚ÄúIn Tampa, COAS attended the Retirement Ceremony of outgoing Commander United States Central Command (Centcom), General Michael E. Kurilla, and the Change of Command Ceremony marking the assumption of command by Admiral Brad Cooper.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCOAS lauded General Kurilla‚Äôs exemplary leadership and his invaluable contributions to strengthening bilateral military cooperation, and extended his best wishes to Admiral Cooper, expressing confidence in continued collaboration to address shared security challenges.</p>
<p>In June, Gen Kurilla hailed Pakistan as a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524/us-centcom-chief-lauds-phenomenal-partner-pakistan-in-counter-terrorism-efforts">phenomenal partner</a>‚Äù in the arena of counter-terrorism, citing their struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State.</p>
<p>The field marshal also met with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine, where matters of mutual professional interest were discussed and Munir extended an invitation to General Caine to visit Pakistan.</p>
<p>The army chief also interacted with the chiefs of defence from friendly nations on the sidelines of the meeting, ISPR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring an interactive session with the Pakistani diaspora, COAS urged them to remain confident in Pakistan‚Äôs bright future and to actively contribute to attracting investments.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe diaspora reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Pakistan‚Äôs progress and development.‚Äù</p></p>

                <h2>2 killed in accident as mob torches 7 dumper trucks in Karachi</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Two siblings were killed and their father injured in a road accident involving a dumper on Karachi‚Äôs Rashid Minhas Road near Lucky One Mall early Sunday, sparking mob violence and protests that disrupted traffic on key city routes, officials said.</p>
<p>In recent months, Karachi has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891767">rise</a> in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.</p>
<p>Central Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi said that around 3:15am, a dumper truck hit a motorcycle carrying a family, killing Mahnoor, 22, and her 14-year-old brother Ahmed Raza, and injuring their 48-year-old father, Shakir.</p>
<p>Following the incident, transporters staged a protest by blocking Rashid Minhas Road and the Superhighway near Sohrab Goth, causing traffic jams.</p>
<p>Both inbound and outbound roads on Rashid Minhas Road from Sohrab Goth towards Gulshan-i-Iqbal were closed, while traffic on Al-Asif Square towards the city and towards Hyderabad was also halted in both directions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA mob gathered and set fire to a total of seven dumpers on both sides of the road within the limits of Yusuf Plaza and Federal B Area police stations,‚Äù the SSP told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe police reached the spot to apprehended the driver and took the dumper in custody.‚Äù</p>
<p>The police cordoned off the area, set up diversions, and called fire tenders to put off the fire, Siddiqi said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFurthermore, police have arrested 14 suspects on charges of torching the dumpers, and more arrests are being made with the help of videos and technical evidence.‚Äù</p>
<p>Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told <em>Dawn.com</em> the siblings were brought dead to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, while their father was injured. Quoting relatives, she said the deceased girl was to get married soon.</p>
<p>Dr Summaiya said police brought in two drivers with critical injuries after they were beaten by the mob. She said the alleged errant driver was critically injured but stable, while a driver of another burnt dumper was also in critical condition with head injuries.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan confirmed that seven dumpers were torched near Lucky One Mall in Gulshan-i-Iqbal, adding that the fire tenders controlled the fire. ‚ÄúThe heavy vehicles were badly damaged in arson acts,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a high-speed trailer truck <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928663">crashed</a> in Karachi‚Äôs Defence Housing Authority (DHA), injuring two people.</p>
<p>In July, a 59-year-old milk supplier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924967">was killed</a> when a dumper ran over his motorcycle in Karachi‚Äôs Saudabad.</p></p>
