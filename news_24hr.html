            <p><p>Security forces eliminated two “India-backed” terrorists after an attack on government offices in Balochistan’s Mastung district that killed a teenager and injured seven others on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Terrorists in Balochistan, previously engaged in a low-level insurgency, have recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896269">intensified</a> their attacks. The banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) emerged as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1882568">key perpetrator</a> of terrorist violence in Pakistan in 2024.</p>
<p>“Two terrorists were killed while another three were injured in an intense fire exchange between the security forces and the terrorists,” Balochistan spokesperson Shahid Rind said in a statement.</p>

<p>“<em>Fitna al Hindustan</em> attacked the tehsil office, government offices and a bank. A 16-year-old boy died while seven individuals were injured by the terrorists’ firing,” the statement read.</p>
<p>The term “<em><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357#:~:text=state%2Dsponsored%20proxies%20of%20India%20(Fitna%20al%20Hindustan)">Fitna al Hindu­stan</a></em>” is a new phrase coined by Pakistan’s military, aimed at framing India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">alleged role</a> in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>
<p>“The Frontier Constabulary, Counter-Terrorism Department and Levies immediately cordoned off the area, crushing the terrorists,” Rind asserted. An intense fire exchange occurred after the security forces “encircled” the terrorists, he added.</p>
<p>Mastung Deputy Commissioner Athar Abbas Raja also confirmed the attack to <em>Dawn.com</em>, adding, “Heavy firing and blasts [were] heard in the small town at around 11am.”</p>

<p>Action against the perpetrators was ongoing while an “organised” clearance operation was also underway at the site of the incident, according to the government statement.</p>
<p>It added that search efforts to trace the facilitators of the attackers had also been initiated. The operation to “protect citizens and arrest terrorists” was based on intelligence input, Rind said.</p>
<p>“The immediate response by the security forces was effective in preventing further loss of lives,” the government official highlighted.</p>

<p>Militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in the country last month, according to data <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914847/militant-attacks-increased-to-85-in-may-pakistan-institute-for-conflict-and-security-studies">released</a> by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, which recorded 85 attacks in May compared to 81 in April.</p>
<p>In one of the recent major attacks, a school bus in Balochistan’s Khuzdar was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357">targeted</a> on May 21, leaving eight children among <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913363">10 dead</a>.</p>
<p>In April, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904388">three policemen</a> were martyred and at least 16 others were injured as a blast targeted a vehicle of the Balochistan Constabulary on Mastung’s Dasht Road.</p>
<p>Last month, security forces killed two “Indian sponsored terrorists” in Balochistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921014/2-terrorists-killed-2-arrested-in-balochistans-duki-district-ispr">Duki district</a> and another two in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915835">Kachhi</a>.</p>

<p>On June 18, a man and a woman were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918035">shot dead</a> when unknown gunmen opened fire at them in the Surgaz area, a locality on the outskirts of Mastung town. Another woman and a child sitting in the car were injured in the firing.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>The country ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>

            <p><p>The federal government has decided to deploy Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel outside the residence of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan city due to security concerns, it emerged on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a letter dated June 29 to the FC commandant in Peshawar, the interior ministry issued orders to deploy “one platoon” of FC personnel at the residence of the JUI-F chief “to avoid any untoward situation”.</p>
<p>The decision has been taken on the prime minister’s directives for security purposes and recent incidents involving the JUI-F’s chief son, Asjad Mahmood.</p>
<p>Earlier last month, Mahmood’s vehicle was intercepted on the main highway by armed men when he was on his way from DI Khan to Lakki Marwat.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently visited Fazl’s residence in Islamabad and expressed concern over the alleged attack and attempted kidnapping of the JUI-F chief’s son, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/20-06-2025/pm-vows-to-bring-asjad-mahmoods-attackers-to-justice" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The prime minister expressed deep concern over the assault and foiled kidnapping attempt on Mahmood and inquired about his health, according to a statement from the PM’s Media Office.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz issued immediate directives to arrest those involved in the attack and ensure swift legal action.</p>
<p>JUI-F leaders have come under attack in recent years in Balochistan and KP. On May 15, a powerful explosion <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911191">targeted</a> the vehicle of local JUI-F leader Maulana Noorullah near a seminary in South Waziristan.</p>
<p>Police said the bomb attack was carried out to target Maulana Noorullah, who remained unharmed. The JU-F leader was accompanied by local party leaders Maulana Ishaq and Maulana Amanullah when the blast occurred.</p>
<p>On April 25, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906374/jui-f-leader-among-three-killed-in-kalat-blast">local leader</a> of the JUI-F and two women were killed and five others were injured in a roadside explosion near the Kalat district.</p>
<p>The incident occurred in the Kapootu area when a pickup vehicle carrying eight people was hit by an improvised explosive device planted on the roadside near Killi Kapootu, according to Levies officials.</p>
<p>The vehicle was coming from Kalat when the blast took place. The pickup was driven by JUI-F local leader and union council member Maulana Abdullah Nachari.</p>
<p>On March 14, a bomb <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897859">exploded</a> at a mosque in South Waziristan district during Friday prayers, injuring JUI district chief Abdullah Nadeem and three others. Nadeem was seriously wounded, while three others, also belonging to the JUI, sustained minor injuries.</p>
<p>In another incident on March 2, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895225">two leaders</a> of JUI-F Balochistan were killed in Zehri area of Khuzdar district.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921440/over-14-million-people-could-die-from-us-foreign-aid-cuts-study' target='_blank'><strong>Over 14 million people could die from US foreign aid cuts: study</strong></a>
            <p><p>More than 14 million of the world’s most vulnerable people, a third of them small children, could die by 2030 because of the Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894626">dismantling</a> of US foreign aid, research projected on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The <a class="link--external" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01186-9/fulltext" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> in the prestigious <em>Lancet</em> journal was published as world and business leaders gather for a United Nations conference in Spain this week, hoping to bolster the reeling aid sector.</p>
<p>The US Agency for International Development (USAID) had provided over 40 per cent of global humanitarian funding until US President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, Trump’s then-close advisor — and the world’s richest man — Elon Musk boasted of having put the agency “through the woodchipper”.</p>
<p>The funding cuts “risk abruptly halting — and even reversing — two decades of progress in health among vulnerable populations”, warned study co-author Davide Rasella, a researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal).</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“For many low- and middle-income countries, the resulting shock would be comparable in scale to a global pandemic or a major armed conflict,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Looking back over data from 133 nations, the international team of researchers estimated that USAID funding had prevented 91.8m deaths in developing countries between 2001 and 2021.</p>
<p>That is more than the estimated number of deaths during World War II, history’s deadliest conflict.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#hiv-malaria-to-rise" id="hiv-malaria-to-rise" title="Permalink"></a>HIV, malaria to rise</h2>
<p>The researchers also used modelling to project how funding being slashed by 83pc — the figure announced by the US government earlier this year — could affect death rates.</p>
<p>The cuts could lead to more than 14m avoidable deaths by 2030, the projections found.</p>
<p>That number included over 4.5m children under the age of five — or around 700,000 child deaths a year.</p>
<p>For comparison, around 10m soldiers are estimated to have been killed during World War I.</p>
<p>Programmes supported by USAID were linked to a 15pc decrease in deaths from all causes, the researchers determined. For children under five, the drop in deaths was twice as steep, at 32pc.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>USAID funding was found to be particularly effective at staving off preventable deaths from disease.</p>
<p>There were 65pc fewer deaths from HIV/AIDS in countries receiving a high level of support compared to those with little or no USAID funding, the study found.</p>
<p>Deaths from malaria and neglected tropical diseases were similarly cut in half.</p>
<p>Study co-author Francisco Saute of Mozambique’s Manhica Health Research Centre said he had seen on the ground how USAID helped fight diseases such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis.</p>
<p>“Cutting this funding now not only puts lives at risk — it also undermines critical infrastructure that has taken decades to build,” he stressed.</p>
<p>A recently updated <a class="link--external" href="https://pepfar.impactcounter.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tracker</a> run by disease modeller Brooke Nichols at Boston University estimates that nearly 108,000 adults and more than 224,000 children have already died as a result of the US aid cuts.</p>
<p>That works out to 88 deaths every hour, according to the tracker.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#time-to-scale-up" id="time-to-scale-up" title="Permalink"></a>‘Time to scale up’</h2>
<p>After USAID was gutted, several other major donors, including France, Germany and the UK, followed suit in announcing plans to slash their foreign aid budgets.</p>
<p>These aid reductions, particularly in the European Union, could lead to “even more additional deaths in the coming years”, study co-author Caterina Monti of ISGlobal said.</p>
<p>But the grim projections are based on the current amount of pledged aid, so they could rapidly come down if the situation changes, the researchers emphasised.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Dozens of world leaders are meeting in the Spanish city of Seville this week for the biggest aid conference in a decade.</p>
<p>The United States, however, will not attend.</p>
<p>“Now is the time to scale up, not scale back,” Rasella said. Before its funding was slashed, USAID represented 0.3pc of all US federal spending.</p>
<p>“US citizens contribute about 17 cents per day to USAID, around $64 per year,” said study co-author James Macinko of the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>“I think most people would support continued USAID funding if they knew just how effective such a small contribution can be to saving millions of lives.”</p></p>
