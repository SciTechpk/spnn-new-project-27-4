            <p><p>President Asif Ali Zardari hosted Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian at the Presidency on Sunday, where they had a meeting during the latter’s two-day visit to Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Iran share close ties and have signed multiple <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1829340">agreements</a> across sectors such as energy and trade.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Presidency, both sides “reaffirmed their commitment to further broaden bilateral cooperation in diverse fields” and “emphasised the importance of enhancing bilateral ties in wide-ranging and mutually beneficial areas”.</p>
<p>President Zardari was quoted as saying that Pakistan and Iran enjoy brotherly relations rooted in shared religion, culture and mutual respect.</p>
<p>“The two leaders exchanged views on major regional and international developments and stressed the need for coordinated diplomatic efforts to prevent the escalation of conflicts and to promote peace, security, and stability in the region,” the statement added.</p>
<p>The president appreciated Iran’s positions on regional issues and acknowledged the Islamic republic’s consistent support for regional cooperation.</p>
<p>He expressed gratitude for Iran’s solidarity during critical moments, such as the war with India and reaffirmed Islamabad’s commitment to working closely with Tehran for a peaceful and prosperous future.</p>
<p>President Zardari also thanked Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for his consistent support for the people of Indian-occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>“President Zardari strongly condemned the unprovoked Israeli aggression against Iran and lauded the bravery and unity of the Iranian nation during the recent 12‑day war,” the statement added. “He expressed hope that President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian’s visit would further solidify the brotherly relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>“President Pezeshkian thanked the leadership and people of Pakistan for their support during the 12‑day war and appreciated Pakistan’s constructive role in advocating de‑escalation, dialogue, and diplomacy for the peaceful resolution of disputes,” the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that the Pakistani and Iranian leadership were eager to raise bilateral trade volume between the two countries to $10 billion at the earliest, according to a joint statement.</p>
<p>The announcement was made as the two countries signed 12 agreements and memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with PM Shehbaz and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian addressing a joint press briefing.</p>
<p>“Both countries signed a number of documents to transform them into agreements and to realise the potential of $10bn trade target, adding that the respective delegations from the two sides would further hold detailed meetings to move forward in this regard,” according to the state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/global/pakistan-iran-keen-to-boost-bilateral-trade-volume-to-10bn-pm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)</a></em>.</p>
<p>During the bilateral meeting, which took place before the joint press briefing, both sides discussed the broad aspects of their bilateral ties, brotherly relations, religious and cultural ties, and held comprehensive talks to further boost them.</p>
<p>Speaking during the joint press briefing, PM Sharif condemned how Israel, on June 13, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/israel-iran-conflict">attacked</a> Iran’s nuclear sites. According to the Iranian government, 610 people were killed during the war, while rights groups put the figure at 974.</p>
<p>“Israel, without any rhyme or reason, unleashed aggression against Iran, which was not only strongly condemned by the government of Pakistan but by the entire 240 million Pakistani people, as there was no reason for Israel to stoke war,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>According to the report, the prime minister also expressed his condolences on the martyrdom of Iranian generals, scientists and civilians during the conflict and prayed for the departed souls and the injured for their early recovery.</p>
<p>He also lauded the Iranian leadership for showing bravery and wisdom during the Israeli aggression and said the Iranian forces and the people faced the aggression and exposed the Israeli defence system with volleys of retaliatory missile attacks.</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s principled stance over Iran’s right to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925977/iran-rules-out-giving-up-its-nuclear-programme">nuclear programme</a> for peaceful purposes under the UN charter, saying that Pakistan would stand by its stance.</p>
<p>In the fight against terrorism, he said both sides shared views that it could not be tolerated at any cost. “If anyone in Iran was affected by terrorism, it was akin to a victim of terror in Pakistan,” he said.</p>
<p>The premier further said that the two brotherly countries would take effective measures to eliminate terrorism.</p>
<p>The prime minister, on behalf of the people and the government of Pakistan, welcomed the president on his maiden visit to Pakistan.</p>
<p>In his remarks, President Pezeshkian expressed gratitude for the position adopted by the parliament, government and the people of Pakistan for supporting Iran during the 10-day Israeli aggression.</p>
<p>He said the bonds of affinities and affection between the two countries and nations were deeply rooted in religion, culture and history, citing poetic verses of Allama Muhammad Iqbal, in which he stressed upon unity among the Muslim countries.</p>
<p>“Advancing the neighbourhood policy is among the priorities of Iran’s foreign policy, as Pakistan is not only our neighbour but also a brotherly country,” he added.</p>
<p>The president expressed his satisfaction that, fortunately, serious and sincere efforts were being initiated by both sides for cooperation in diverse fields, and to take their current trade volume of $3bn to the projected target of $10bn.</p>
<p>President Pezeshkian said that his government was determined to take steps to implement these agreements, while the development of land, sea and air routes would facilitate trade.</p>

<p>“Welcoming the Iranian president, the deputy prime minister/foreign minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s deep commitment to its historic and brotherly ties with Iran, emphasising their strong foundations in shared history, common cultural heritage, faith, and mutual respect,” the statement said.</p>

<p>Separately, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal and the Iranian Minister for Industry, Mines and Trade, Mohammad Atabak, also had a high-level discussion on Sunday, where the two sides agreed to accelerate trade, remove border bottlenecks, and build trust-based partnerships across priority sectors, according to a statement from the commerce ministry.</p>
<p>Minister Kamal suggested organising targeted trade delegations that include representatives from federal and provincial chambers of commerce, enabling focused discussions on market access and regulatory facilitation, according to the statement.</p>
<p>“We’ve done this model successfully in Belarus and elsewhere,” he was quoted in the statement as saying. “Let’s do the same for Iran, starting with sectors that show the greatest potential for mutual benefit.”</p>
<p>The ministers also expressed a shared commitment to increasing the use of existing trade corridors and border facilities. Emphasis was placed on maximising the potential of neighbourhood trade, with Kamal highlighting how ASEAN countries have benefited enormously by trading within their region.</p>
<p>“Geography is an advantage. Pakistan and Iran must utilise this discount of distance. If we don’t, we lose both time and cost benefits,” he stated.</p>
<p>Atabak also highlighted ongoing discussions about increasing Pakistani exports to Iran and encouraged swift follow-up on newly signed agreements.</p>
<p>“Traders and industrialists in both countries are ready. They trust each other. What they need now is a clear and consistent facilitation mechanism from our side,” he noted.</p>
<p>Kamal said that beyond bilateral gains, such connectivity could expand to Turkey, Central Asia, Russia, and even parts of the Middle East, creating an economic bloc of substantial power and resilience.</p>
<p>Atabak supported the idea of holding a dedicated business-to-business (B2B) day during every high-level visit and offered to bring Iranian business groups to Pakistan for in-depth meetings, the statement said.</p>
<p>The two ministers acknowledged the historic depth of Pakistan-Iran relations, expressing that recent regional and global developments have pushed both nations closer together.</p>
<p>“Without the rapid engagement and determination from you and your team, we wouldn’t have reached this stage. The momentum we’ve built must now be translated into structured trade outcomes,” Minister Atabak said while praising the Pakistani government’s proactive role in facilitating bilateral trade progress.</p>
<p>Kamal echoed similar sentiments, noting that both governments, as well as the private sector, had shown strong will and passion to work together.</p>
<p>“There’s a moment in diplomacy when the iron is hot — and this is that moment. We must act swiftly. Delays only complicate things,” he said.</p>
<p>He emphasised that formalities follow passion and political will, and highlighted that Pakistan is ready to deepen its economic relationship with Iran through structured channels like the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/global/pakistan-iran-keen-to-boost-bilateral-trade-volume-to-10bn-pm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joint Economic Commission (JEC)</a>, regular B2B exchanges, and sector-focused delegations.</p>
<p>Both ministers agreed on the importance of identifying specific sectors such as agriculture, livestock, services, energy, and cross-border logistics for future collaboration.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the human element of bilateral ties, both sides underscored the cultural and linguistic commonalities between the people of Pakistan and Iran.</p>
<p>The ministers agreed to fast-track the next session of the JEC, ensure participation from both public and private stakeholders, and prioritise border facilitation and trade logistics.</p>
<p>“With high-level political alignment and mutual trust, Pakistan and Iran appear poised to enter a new phase of strategic economic partnership that could reshape regional trade dynamics,” the statement said.</p></p>

            <p><p>A top aide to United States President Donald Trump on Sunday accused India of effectively financing Russia’s war in Ukraine by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927843">purchasing oil</a> from Moscow, after the US leader <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927587">escalated pressure</a> on New Delhi to stop buying Russian oil.</p>
<p>“What he (Trump) said very clearly is that it is not acceptable for India to continue financing this war by purchasing the oil from Russia,” said Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff at the White House and one of Trump’s most influential aides.</p>
<p>Miller’s criticism was some of the strongest yet by the Trump administration about one of the United States’ major partners in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>“People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil. That’s an astonishing fact,” Miller said on <em>Fox News</em> programme ‘Sunday Morning Futures’.</p>
<p>The Indian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Indian government sources told <em>Reuters</em> on Saturday that New Delhi will keep purchasing oil from Moscow despite US threats. A 25 per cent tariff on Indian products went into effect on Friday as a result of its purchase of military equipment and energy from Russia.</p>
<p>Trump has also threatened 100pc tariffs on US imports from countries that buy Russian oil unless Moscow reaches a major peace deal with Ukraine.</p>
<p>Miller tempered his criticism by noting Trump’s relationship with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which he described as “tremendous”.</p></p>

            <p><p>The former prime minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi, was arrested on Sunday over violations of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance (MPO), a police official told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>Niazi in 2022 tendered his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1684990">resignation</a> from his office to defuse the move by his parliamentary party, the PTI, to replace him with regional president Sardar Tanveer Ilyas through a vote of no-confidence.</p>
<p>The MPO law in Pakistan allows authorities to detain individuals without trial for up to 90 days to prevent threats to public peace and safety.</p>
<p>Mirpur Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Dr Liaqat Ali told <em>Dawn.com</em> that Niazi was arrested under Section 16 (dissemination of rumours) of the MPO.</p>
<p>“Under the orders of the Mirpur deputy commissioner, he was arrested under Section 16 of the MPO,” the DIG said.</p>
<p>“He is being held at the industrial area guest house in Mirpur, which has been declared a sub-jail,” he said.</p>
<p>The Mirpur DIG added that plainclothes policemen from Islamabad came to detain the ex-PM under a first information report (FIR) — seen by <em>Dawn.com</em> — filed at the Karachi Company police station in the federal capital, but “we did not allow them to take him into custody”.</p>
<p>The FIR against Niazi in Islamabad was filed under the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment),</li>
<li>149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object)</li>
<li>186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions)</li>
<li>188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant)</li>
<li>341 (punishment for wrongful restrain)</li>
<li>353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty)</li>
<li>395 (punishment for dacoity)</li>
<li>440 (mischief committed after preparation made causing death or hurt)</li>
<li>506 ii (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code</li>
</ul>
<p>He was also booked under Sections 7 (punishment for terrorism) and 11X (responsibility for creating civil commotion) of the Anti-Terrorism Act and Section 8 (punishment) of the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act.</p>
<p>DIG Dr Ali added that Niazi left Mirpur last night and headed to Bhimber to attend rallies.</p>
<p>Niazi’s nephew, Sardar Moteeb, said that the former PM was arrested when he was heading to Bhimber city from Samahni to attend a PTI rally related to the campaign demanding the release of party founder Imran Khan from prison.</p>
<p>“He was arrested under Section 16 of the MPO,” Moteeb said. “A team of plainclothes personnel had arrived from Islamabad to take his possessions, but local officials refused to hand them over to them and sent them back.”</p>
<p>Moteeb added that Niazi obtained bail from the Islamabad High Court on July 13, which was further extended on July 26 until August 17.</p>
<p>Niazi’s press secretary, who was accompanying him at the time of the arrest, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the former PM was arrested on the way to a rally and alleged that police “snatched” his mobile phone.</p>
<p>“Apart from Niazi, two other PTI office bearers from Kotli district, Malik Nisar and Dr Shahnawaz, were also taken into custody,” he added.</p></p>
