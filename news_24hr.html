            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915197/cm-murad-notes-faint-tremors-good-thing-as-seismic-activity-continues-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>CM Murad notes faint tremors ‘good thing’ as seismic activity continues in Karachi</strong></a>
            <p><p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Tuesday said low-intensity tremors helped prevent major earthquakes as he attempted to allay <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915165/sindh-ig-says-78-of-213-escaped-prisoners-from-karachis-malir-jail-recaptured">panic</a> caused by the recent seismic activity that continued for the third day in Karachi.</p>
<p>The metropolis continued to witness faint tremors today, taking the tally since Sunday to 20, according to data provided by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD). Experts have previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say">pointed out</a> that such minor seismic activities “preempt” high-intensity earthquakes by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates.</p>
<p>“I have also studied engineering […] these (low-scale tremors) are a good thing. The earth is releasing its energy,” CM Shah said, responding to reporters’ queries about yesterday’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915165/sindh-ig-says-78-of-213-escaped-prisoners-from-karachis-malir-jail-recaptured">jail break incident</a> in Karachi.</p>
<p>He explained that if the earth releases its seismic energy altogether, it could result in a major earthquake. “But if it releases in bits, then it is better — nothing is actually better — but saves us from a big disaster,” Murad added.</p>
<p>The most recent tremor occurred at 11:52am and measured 2.0 on the Richter scale, with its <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/WKp4SfRW8Va3WHG36" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">epicentre</a> located 23 kilometres east of Malir, according to the PMD’s data.</p>
<p>Since Sunday — when the series of minor quakes <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914834/karachi-experiences-36-magnitude-quake-with-quaidabad-as-epicentre">began</a> — the total of tremors recorded near <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/tWkP5ThpLy3m5iDY6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Malir</a> is nine, five near the Defence Housing Authority, three near <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/f3E8rzVKFY8BwcbR6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quaidabad</a>, along with one each near <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/9jxYCPXSRymYrGTa7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gadap Town</a>, <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rocRpWYWyMR7GGUd9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Korangi</a> and <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/2Us67F7ygbKS7aAT9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DHA City</a> on the outskirts of Karachi.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914834/karachi-experiences-36-magnitude-quake-with-quaidabad-as-epicentre">3.6-magnitude jolt</a> from Sunday evening was the most significant, while the lowest measured was of 2.0 magnitude from today morning.</p>
<p>Karachi Chief Meteorologist Amir Hyder Laghari <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915067">pointed out</a> yesterday that there was a historical fault line which has become activated, causing frequent earthquakes in the city.</p>
<p>He said the fault is releasing its seismic energy, and when it’s spent, the tremors’ magnitude will reduce. Laghari added he expected the small-scale jolts to end within a week.</p>
<p>Murad’s remarks today echoed opinions voiced by Laghari and other experts, who have said that the chances of a major quake in Karachi are low.</p>
<p>Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Eurasian and Indian — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say#:~:text=Tectonic%20positioning">according to</a> geological engineer Muhammad Rehan, creating five seismic zones within the country.</p>
<p>Dr Imran Ahmed Khan of Karachi University’s Department of Geography said an imbalance between the Indian, Eurasian and Arabian plates may be causing the tremors in the city. He added that the quakes will likely stop when a balance between the plates has been achieved.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Dr Adnan Khan, associate professor at the KU’s Department of Geology, noted that a huge earthquake was unlikely in Karachi as the city was situated far from active plate boundaries.</p>
<p>“Karachi lies on what’s called a ‘passive margin’, so the chances of a big earthquake happening there are low. Small earthquakes do happen sometimes, usually between 3 and 4 on the Richter scale, but they are not dangerous,” he added.</p>
<p>Dr Imran explained that the Indian tectonic plate is moving upward by about 4 to 5 centimetres every year in the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Eurasian plate is pushing against it. As these two plates press against each other, they build up pressure, and when the pressure becomes too much, it rebounds and is released as energy, causing earthquakes.</p>
<p>The country had witnessed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say">around 20</a> low-intensity earthquakes in the first half of February — an average of more than one tremor each day.</p>
<p>In April, jolts were felt in parts of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905258">Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab</a> — including Peshawar, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903840">twice</a> that month.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved $800 million programme to strengthen fiscal sustainability and improve public financial management in Pakistan, according to a statement issued by the Philippines-based lender.</p>
<p>The statement read that subprogramme 2 of the “Improved Resource Mobilisation and Utilisation Reform Programme” includes a policy-based loan of $300m, and ADB’s “first ever policy-based guarantee” of up to $500m, which is expected to mobilise financing of up to $1 billion from commercial banks.</p>
<p>“Pakistan has made significant progress in improving <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903106">macroeconomic</a> conditions,” said ADB country director for Pakistan, Emma Fan.</p>
<p>“This programme backs the government’s commitment to further policy and institutional reforms that will strengthen public finances and promote sustainable growth.”</p>
<p>The programme supports far-reaching reforms to improve <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912734">tax policy</a>, administration, and compliance, while enhancing public expenditure and cash management.</p>
<p>“It also promotes digitalisation, investment facilitation, and private sector development. These measures aim to reduce Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911133">fiscal deficit</a> and public debt, while creating space for social and development spending,” the Manila-headquartered institution said.</p>
<p>The programme is underpinned by a comprehensive support package —including technical assistance and close coordination with development partners — designed to help Pakistan build long-term fiscal resilience and stability, it added.</p>
<p>Khurram Schehzad, adviser to the finance minister, confirmed that the financial institution has approved the programme. “Diplomacy led by Economic Affairs &amp; Ministry of Finance secures majority support at ADB Board,” he said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/kschehzad/status/1929815577738027202" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X.¶

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915195/nccia-busts-german-led-child-sexual-exploitation-gang-in-muzaffargarh' target='_blank'><strong>NCCIA busts German-led child sexual exploitation gang in Muzaffargarh</strong></a>
            <p><p>National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA) has exposed a child sexual exploitation gang operating in Punjab’s Muzaffargarh district, leading to the arrest of two suspects and the recovery of ten children.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry made the revelation during a press conference in Islamabad, saying the NICCIA has uncovered a “huge network” during an operation conducted on May 23.</p>
<p>He said an international gang masterminded by a German citizen was operating a child sexual <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1851068">exploitation</a> group in Muzaffargarh where children were groomed.</p>
<p>“They set up a small club where children aged 6-10 years were taught games. They provided state-of-the-art facilities and modern cameras,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that children from disadvantaged families were “brought there, given money, and then blackmailed” to exploit them, and “their videos were uploaded on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867711">dark web</a> daily and sold for thousands of dollars.”</p>
<p>“Some videos were live-streamed and seen around the world from Muzaffargarh,” the state minister said. “The network was run by a German national and all efforts will be made to arrest him.”</p>
<p>Providing further information, he said fifty children had been victimised by the grooming gang, while “ten children were recovered and six were handed over to the child protection bureau.”</p>
<p>He mentioned that on May 23, the NCCIA launched an operation lasting five hours with assistance from other agencies, as a result of which two suspects were arrested.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, the families and parents of some children were also involved in the nefarious crime and action has been initiated against them as well,” Chaudhry said.</p>
<p>He said the NCCIA had been working diligently against <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893081">financial scams</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1820853">harassment</a>, and other cybercrime, adding that financial scams had become common due to the easy availability of mobile phones and the agency had been taking action after receiving complaints.</p>
<p>The minister went on to say that the workforce of the agency should be increased threefold and a branch should be set up in every district. “The interior minister and prime minister have been requested to increase funds for the NCCIA in the budget,” he said.</p>
<p>Chaudhry added that an international organisation, the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), provides information and the NCCIA takes prompt action.</p>
<p>He detailed that 178 first information reports have been lodged against child exploitation, 198 suspects have been arrested, and fourteen were jailed between four to ten years.</p>
<p>As many as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908682/over-3350-child-abuse-cases-reported-across-pakistan-in-2024-report">3,364 child abuse cases</a> were reported from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the year 2024, according to the civil society report <a class="link--external" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BiZQB4r46gbIYR88plzov08iuLzJ606_/view" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">‘Cruel Numbers 2024’</a> by Sahil that was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.</p>
<p>These included reported cases of child sexual abuse, abduction, missing children, and child marriages. It shows that nine children were abused per day during the year. A gender-divide analysis indicates that out of the total reported cases, 1,791 (53 per cent) victims were girls and 1,573 (47pc) boys.</p></p>
