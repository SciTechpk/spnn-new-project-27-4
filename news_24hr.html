            <p><p>Three wanted terrorists and “key operatives” of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed during a joint operation of the police and the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) in the Barikot tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swat district on Friday.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — particularly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773/3-terrorists-killed-during-joint-operation-in-kps-bannu-police">Bannu</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923956/one-killed-2-others-injured-in-explosion-in-kps-lakki-marwat-police">Lakki Marwat</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921636">Bajaur</a> — have seen a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a> targeting police stations and posts. In response, the state has also intensified its counterterrorism <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925443/9-terrorists-killed-8-captured-in-malakand-joint-action-by-military-leas-during-four-days">operations</a>.</p>
<p>“Three wanted terrorists have been killed in Barikot in a major win for Swat CTD. Eliminating the enemies of regional peace, the CTD has killed three important operatives of the <em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em>,” KP Police said in a statement today.</p>
<p><em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em> is a term the state uses to refer to the banned TTP.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Among the terrorists was Ajmal, also known as Waqas, a resident of Malook Abad who was reportedly involved in at least nine terrorism-related cases. He was also involved in the killing of Village Defence Council members and carried a bounty of Rs2 million.</p>
<p>The second individual was identified as Matiullah, also known by the aliases Ishaq and Junaid, son of Ibrat Shah from Dabb Sar Martung in Shangla district, who was wanted in two terrorism cases.</p>
<p>The third slain terrorist was Rahimullah Rehmani, alias Rohullah, son of Amanullah, a resident of Sheray in Afghanistan’s Nuristan province. He, too, was wanted in two separate terrorism cases.</p>
<p>“The terrorists were involved in attacks on security forces and assassinations of police personnel,” said the KP police statement. “A network spreading terrorism with external funding was destroyed, and the terrorists were also wanted in improvised explosive device (IED) attacks and extortion cases.”</p>
<p>“This CTD operation is a blow to the operational wings of <em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em> in Swat and adjacent areas,” Malakand Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sher Akbar Khan was quoted as saying. “We are determined to uproot <em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em>.”</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Speaking to reporters, Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Umar Khan said that search and strike operations against militants would continue across the district. He added that security has been intensified at all entry and exit points of Swat to prevent any possible infiltration of miscreants.</p>
<p>“We will not allow the peace and stability of Swat to be disturbed at any cost,” the DPO asserted.</p>
<p>KP Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed praised the regional police and Swat CTD for striking the “operational command wing” of <em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em>, according to the police statement.</p>
<p>“Operations against terrorists will be further intensified to establish lasting peace and order in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” he said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">surge</a> in terrorist activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. Attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces.</p>
<p>In a series of incidents in KP yesterday, a police official was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926664/cop-martyred-in-karak-attack-on-bannu-police-station-foiled">martyred</a> in the Karak district while police thwarted a separate late-night terrorist assault on a police station in Bannu’s Basyakhel area.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP’s Tipu Gul group <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922269">were killed</a> in a joint operation by the CTD and the police in Lakki Marwat. This came nearly a week after the leader of a peace committee and two of his companions <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921018">were shot dead</a> by terrorists in the same district.</p>
<p>Three terrorists <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916076/3-terrorists-killed-one-cop-martyred-in-gun-battle-with-lakki-marwat-police-local-peace-committee">were also killed</a> in Lakki Marwat’s Kot Kashmir area during a gun battle with the police and local peace committee, in which a cop was martyred as well.</p>
<p>A total of 670 terror incidents were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881856">recorded in 2024</a>, while 212 militants were killed in counter-terrorism operations, according to a report issued by the CTD.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926600/sindh-govt-abolishes-roadside-charged-parking-across-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt abolishes roadside charged parking across Karachi</strong></a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: The Sindh government on Friday officially abolished all <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921269/parking-fee-on-46-kmc-controlled-roads-ends">roadside charged parking</a> across Karachi — a practice that had long been seen by Karachiites as a gross exploitation of taxpayers, carried out on city roads for the past 25 years. The decision comes into effect at once.</p>
<p>The Sindh local government department, acting on the directives of the chief minister of Sindh, issued a notification announcing the end of parking fees on public roads throughout the city’s 25 Town Municipal Corporations (TMCs).</p>
<p>As per the new policy, no municipal body or private entity is allowed to collect any parking fee from vehicles parked on roads anywhere in Karachi.</p>
<p>However, the move also granted the councils of the TMCs the authority to designate any ‘specified area’ within their remit as a charged parking space.</p>
<p>According to the notification, the Sindh chief minister “imposed a ban on charged parking fees from roads. The charged parking fees can be collected only on plots / plazas / areas specifically maintained by the specific Councils for such purposes”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>TMCs given authority to designate ‘specified area’ as charged parking space; fee collection will continue in cantonment board areas</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Effective immediately, all Town Municipal Administrations (TMAs) have been ordered to stop the collection of parking fees and begin implementation of the policy without delay.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The local government department has also launched a formal campaign to enforce this directive, with warnings of strict action against violators. Importantly, the ban applies strictly to public roads.</p>
<p>Parking fees will now only be legally permissible in designated parking plazas, private plots, or specific council-approved zones. These areas are expected to be clearly marked to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>“This step has been taken purely in public interest,” said City Mayor Murtaza Wahab.</p>
<p>“Karachi’s residents have long demanded and at times suffered at the hands of illegal and arbitrary parking fee collection. This administration has delivered on its promise of transparency and accountability, ensuring that public roads remain public spaces — free to use.”</p>
<p>However, an official clarified that the charged parking would continue within the jurisdiction of six cantonment boards in Karachi. The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) sources revealed that the concept of charged parking in Karachi was first introduced in the year 2000.</p>
<p>The initiative was envisioned by the then director general of the Karachi Development Authority (KDA), retired brigadier Abdul Haq, as part of a broader strategy to generate municipal revenue. At that time, he was overseeing the city’s infrastructure development and urban planning, and saw paid parking as a potential tool to fund civic services and manage growing vehicular congestion in the metropolis.</p>
<p>In February 2025, Mayor Mrtaza Wahab hinted at abolishing the charged parking across Karachi as part of his broader vision to ease the financial burden on citizens.</p>
<p>However, the initiative faced delays due to existing contractual obligations, as several entities held valid charged parking agreements, which were set to expire in June.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>During this period, the KMC continued to generate an average yearly revenue of Rs40 to 50 million from parking fees.</p>
<p>The abolition has been hailed by citizens and commuters as one of the most significant urban relief measures in recent years.</p>
<p>For decades, unauthorised contractors and so-called “parking mafias” had monopolised prime city spots, often charging arbitrary fees without any legal basis or standardised rate.</p>
<p>The KMC, which previously managed parking on 46 main roads, had already suspended such fees under a citywide policy revamp. Now, all 25 TMCs fall under the same directive, having a level playing field across the city.</p>
<p>The decision, the officials say, also reflects growing confidence in the financial stability of the KMC and other urban bodies, who are now able to carry out their operations without resorting to street-level revenue generation tactics that burdened citizens.</p>
<p>“No institution other than KMC in designated areas, and that too under regulation, can now engage in fee collection. The days of extortion in the name of parking are over,” said a KMC spokesperson, adding that the government had also directed all municipal commissioners to ensure compliance, with a clear warning that failure to implement the order would result in immediate disciplinary measures.</p>

            <p><p>The White House is seeking fines from several universities it says failed to stop antisemitism on campus, including Harvard University, in exchange for restoring federal funding, an official of US President Donald Trump’s administration said on Friday.</p>
<p>The administration is in talks with several universities, including Cornell, Duke, Northwestern and Brown, the source said, confirming a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-columbia-trump-white-house-fines-payment-deal-settlement-d61aa9c6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>.</p>
<p>The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the administration is close to striking deals with Northwestern and Brown and potentially Cornell.</p>
<p>A deal with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908798/trump-administration-freezes-future-grants-to-harvard">Harvard</a>, the country’s oldest and richest university, is a key target for the White House, the official added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>A spokesperson for Cornell declined to comment. Other universities did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Trump and his team have undertaken a broad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904659">campaign</a> to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901589/princetons-us-grants-frozen-becoming-latest-school-to-face-trumps-actions">leverage</a> federal funding to force change at US universities, which the Republican president says are gripped by antisemitic and “radical left” ideologies.</p>
<p>Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904389">targeted</a> several <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897841">universities</a> since returning to office in January over the pro-Palestinian student protest movement that roiled college campuses last year.</p>
<p>Columbia University said on Wednesday that it will pay more than <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926220">$200 million</a> to the US government in a settlement with the administration to resolve federal probes and have most of its suspended federal funding restored.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has welcomed the Columbia deal, with officials believing the university set the standard on how to reach an agreement, the official said.</p>
<p>Harvard has taken a different approach, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906337">suing</a> the federal government in a bid to get suspended federal grants restored.</p></p>
