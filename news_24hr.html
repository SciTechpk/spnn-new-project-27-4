<p>“The day dawned with special prayers in mosques for the well-being of the Muslim Ummah and peace, progress and prosperity of the country,” the report said.</p>
<p>Eid prayers’ congregations were held at mosques, Eidgahs and open places in all cities, towns and villages across the country.</p>
<p>The municipal administrations in cities and towns made special arrangements for the disposal of offal and other post-<em>qurbani</em> solid waste during the three days of Eidul Azha, and to ensure cleanliness, it added.</p>

<p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have extended heartfelt congratulations to the entire Pakistani nation and the Muslim Ummah around the world on the occasion of Eidul Azha.</p>
<p>They emphasised the importance of promoting values of sacrifice, love, brotherhood, and unity in our behaviour.</p>
<p>In his message, the president said that the day revives in people the spirit of faith, sacrifice, selflessness, and brotherhood.</p>
<p>“He called for drawing lessons from the spirit of sacrifice and selflessness shown by Prophet Ibrahim (AS) and integrating them into our lives,” <em>Radio Pakistan</em> said.</p>
<p>He said there was a pressing need to support the underprivileged and marginalised segments of our society. “Along with the act of animal sacrifice, Eid calls upon us to make a solemn pledge to always care for those in need.”</p>
<p>Zardari said as a nation, we must support each other, share in each other’s sorrows, and work together to build a prosperous and great Pakistan.</p>
<p>In his message, the prime minister said, “The message of Eidul Azha is not limited to the sacrifice of animals alone, it also teaches us to sacrifice our ego, desires, and personal interests for higher purposes.</p>
<p>“As our beloved homeland, Pakistan, moves forward on the path of development, we must embrace the spirit of unity, sacrifice, and selflessness.”</p>
<p>He said this Eid teaches us not only the importance of sacrificing life and wealth but also that nations achieve greatness when they work for collective welfare and selflessness alongside individual development.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz continued, “Today, we must especially remember our Palestinian brothers and sisters who are enduring ruthless and inhumane oppression and hunger.”</p>
<p>He added: “Likewise, we reaffirm our unwavering solidarity with the brave people of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, who have been engaged in a just and courageous struggle for their right to self-determination for decades.”</p>
<p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Chief of Air Staff  Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu extended their profound felicitations to the people of Pakistan, according to <em>Radio Pakistan</em>.</p>
<p>“On this day of reverence, they also honoured the noble families of Shuhada-e-Pakistan, whose loved ones made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of peace and the nation,” the statement said.</p></p>

            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has thanked the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed Bin Salman, for his role in ending the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914500">conflict</a> between Pakistan and India last month.</p>
<p>The prime minister, acco­mpanied by his delegation, including the army chief, deputy PM and federal ministers, also performed Umrah on Friday when pilgrims performed the last major ritual of Haj — the “stoning of the devil”.</p>
<p>The PM, who is on a two-day official visit to Saudi Arabia, met the Saudi crown prince in Makkah, according to an official press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, former prime minister and PML-N President Nawaz Sharif offered Eid prayer at the Regents Park mosque in London.</p>
<p>According to media reports, he prayed for the country’s development and prosperity.</p>
<p>He also urged the United Nations to play its role in resolving the Kashmir issue.</p>

<p>More than 1.6 million pilgrims performing Haj ‘<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915803/pilgrims-stone-the-devil-as-haj-nears-end-in-saudi-arabia">stoned the devil</a>’ on Friday, as Muslims around the globe celebrated Eidul Azha.</p>
<p>Starting at dawn, the pilgrims threw seven stones at each of three concrete walls symbolising the devil in the Mina valley, on the outskirts of Makkah.</p>
<p>This year’s Haj saw noticeably thinner crowds as authorities implemented a wide-ranging crackdown on illicit pilgrims with a heavy security presence at holy sites in Makkah and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The measures, including heat mitigation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915198">efforts</a>, were aimed at preventing a repeat of last year’s Haj that saw 1,301 people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1840835">die</a> in temperatures that hit 51.8 degrees Celsius.</p>

            <p><p>• Ex-foreign minister says threshold for war in South Asia ‘lowest it’s ever been’; his stark assessment highlights tenuous nature of ceasefire<br />
• Calls on US to help bring New Delhi to negotiating table after Trump acknowledges presence of ‘strong leadership’ in Islamabad</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: Warning that the current <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> between India and Pakistan was quite tenuous, former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has said that the world is now a less safe place than it was before the crisis in the Subcontinent.</p>
<p>The statement comes a day after US President Donald Trump acknowledged the presence of “very strong leadership” in Islamabad as being one of the contributing factors to a recent de-escalation of tensions with India.</p>
<p>In meetings with US lawmakers and think tanks, the PPP chief, who is currently heading a high-powered Pakistani <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911617/pm-tasks-bilawal-with-presenting-pakistans-case-for-peace-on-global-arena">delegation</a> to the US, said the ceasefire was “a welcome start”, but cautioned that “South Asia, India, and Pakistan, and by extension, the rest of the world, are less safe today than when we started this crisis.”</p>
<p>In contrast with efforts of India’s national security <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2129254" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">caucus</a>, the Pakistani delegation currently in Washington pursued a focused but quieter diplomatic effort on Capitol Hill this week.</p>
<p>The delegation’s meetings with senior US lawmakers — members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and key senators — underscored Pakistan’s effort to sustain a credible narrative amid a tilt towards New Delhi in US policy circles.</p>
<p>Mr Bhutto-Zardari held candid and constructive meetings with US Congressman Brian Mast, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; Congressman Gregory Meeks, Ranking Member; Congressman Bill Huizenga, Chair of the Subcommittee on South and Central Asia; and senior lawmaker Brad Sherman.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Central to the delegation’s message was the unilateral <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">suspension</a> of the Indus Waters Treaty by India, described by Mr Bhutto-Zardari as “a dangerous precedent and a violation of international law.”</p>
<p>The potential weaponisation of water resources adds a new and alarming dimension to the already fragile peace framework between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, he said.</p>
<p>“The threshold for all-out war between India and Pakistan is the lowest it has ever been in our history,” he stated, adding: “As it stands today, if there’s a terrorist attack anywhere in India, proof or no proof, it means war”.</p>
<p>This reality underscores the urgency for sustained diplomatic engagement to prevent miscalculations that could lead to full-scale conflict.</p>
<p>He urged the United States to leverage its influence, stating, “The United States, if it puts its might behind peace, can speak to India and explain how it’s in all our interests to resolve our issues, including the core issue of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.”</p>

<p>This aligns with President Trump’s messaging as well. Speaking to reporters after an interaction with German leader Freidrich Merz in the Oval Office a day earlier, Trump had categorically claimed credit for talking India and Pakistan back from the brink by threatening to pull out of trade talks, which he claimed both countries were currently engaged in with the US.</p>
<p>“They don’t give me credit for anything, but nobody else could have stopped it,” he said, referring to the recent escalation in the Subcontinent.</p>
<p><strong>Pakistan House reception</strong></p>
<p>The Pakistani delegation also engaged with a bipartisan group of US legislators at a dinner reception hosted by Ambassador Rizwan Saeed Sheikh at Pakistan House.</p>
<p>The event saw the attendance of members of Congress, including Representatives Jack Bergman, Tom Suozzi, Ryan Zinke, Maxine Waters, Al Green, Jonathan Jackson, Hank Johnson, Stacey Plaskett, Henry Cuellar, Mike Turner, Riley Moore, George Latimer, and Cleo Fields, among others.</p>

<p>Addressing them, Mr Bhutto Zardari presented a compelling case for regional peace and stability, characterizing the delegation’s visit as a “mission for peace.”</p>
<p>“Our Prime Minister, Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, gave this delegation a mission, and the mission is peace — to engage in dialogue and diplomacy with India to resolve our issues,” stated Mr Bhutto-Zardari.</p>
<p>Appreciating the crucial role played by the United States in facilitating a ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed nations, the former foreign minister urged US legislators to continue their efforts in maintaining peace and stability in South Asia.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>“We’re here to appeal to you, requesting the United States to aid us in this pursuit for peace. The United States, if it puts its might behind peace, can speak to India and explain how it’s in all our interests to resolve our issues, including the core issue of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK),” the Chairman noted.</p>
<p>“Just as urgently as we needed the United States government’s help to achieve the ceasefire, we need your assistance today to help engage India and prevent policies that lead to regional and global insecurity,” he said.</p>
<p>The US Congress members assured their full support for regional peace and stability in South Asia, commending the delegation for their comprehensive briefing on the ongoing crisis.</p>
