                <h2>PM Shehbaz calls National Security Committee meeting after US strikes</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p><strong>‚Ä¢ Pakistan condemns attack on nuclear facilities<br />
‚Ä¢ Premier holds call with Iranian president; call US action ‚Äòviolation of international law‚Äô<br />
‚Ä¢ Iranian envoy hints at retaliatory strikes on American bases</strong></p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: An emergency meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) will be held today (Monday) to discuss the regional situation after the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842/trump-says-irans-key-nuclear-facilities-obliterated-by-us-airstrikes">airstrike on three nuclear facilities</a> in Iran.</p>
<p>The NSC, chaired by the prime minister and comprising the top brass of both civil and military leadership, is the highest forum for security deliberations.</p>
<p>Sources in the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office (PMO) told <em>Dawn</em> that the NSC meeting will be held on Monday evening. Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir will also attend the meeting.</p>
<p>The field marshal, who recently returned from a trip to the US, will brief the committee on the details of his meeting with US President Donald Trump.</p>
<p><strong>Pakistan condemns strikes</strong></p>
<p>The US strikes on Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities, which came four days after COAS Munir‚Äôs meeting with Trump, have been condemned by Pakistan.</p>
<p>In a phone call with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Prime Minister Shehbaz condemned the US attack and Israeli aggression.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prime minister conveyed Pakistan‚Äôs condemnation of the US attacks, which followed Israel‚Äôs unprovoked and unjustified aggression over the past eight days,‚Äù said an official press release issued by the PMO.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The PM reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs unwavering solidarity with the people and government of Iran and expressed condolences on the loss of lives.</p>
<p>He expressed concerns that the US struck facilities that were under the protection of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese attacks constituted a serious violation of international law and the IAEA statute,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>While noting Iran‚Äôs right to self-defence, as enshrined under Article 51 of the UN Charter, Prime Minister Shehbaz stressed the need for swift dialogues and called diplomacy ‚Äúthe only viable path forward‚Äù. He also called for urgent collective efforts to de-escalate the situation, and said Pakistan was ready to play a constructive role in this regard. According to the PMO, President Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan‚Äôs support of Iran.</p>
<p>He thanked the prime minister and people of Pakistan for standing in solidarity with Iran.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, the Foreign Office also condemned the US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are gravely concerned at the possible further escalation of tensions in the region,‚Äù the Foreign Office spokesman said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The attacks ‚Äúviolate all norms of international law,‚Äù the spokesperson said, adding Iran has the right to defend itself under the UN Charter.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAny further escalation of tensions will have severely damaging implications for the region and beyond.‚Äù</p>
<p>The FO urged all parties to ‚Äúadhere to international law‚Äù and hold dialogues to resolve the crises.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄòIran can hit US bases‚Äô</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Dr Reza Amiri Moghadam has said his country could target US facilities and interests in the region.</p>
<p>While addressing a press conference here at the National Press Club on Sunday, Mr Moghadam said the US has a ‚Äúpresence in the region‚Äù and that Iran ‚Äúwill see that where we hit the US‚Äù.</p>
<p>Responding to a question about US bases in the region, the ambassador said it was shameful that the US has military facilities in Muslim states.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>However, he added that Iran ‚Äúdoes not want to bring any other Islamic state into this war‚Äù.</p>
<p>Asked about the damages during the US airstrike on Iran‚Äôs nuclear sites, he said Iran has the capability to make a nuclear arsenal but the country was using the technology for energy and medical purposes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur nuclear technology is not a physical thing but it‚Äôs in the minds of our nuclear scientists, so therefore the US strikes have not made any significant harm to our nuclear programme,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>He also appreciated Pakistan‚Äôs support for Iran during the conflict.</p>
<p><strong>President worried</strong></p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari also expressed concern over the escalating tensions in the Middle East.</p>
<p>In a statement on Sunday, the president urged all parties involved in the conflict to exercise maximum restraint and to choose the path of peace , dialogue and diplomacy to ensure enduring peace and stability in the region.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>President Zardari also called upon the international community to play its part in de-escalating the crisis in the interest of regional stability as well as the well-being of its people.</p>

                <h2>Threshold for war in South Asia ‚Äòdangerously low‚Äô, warns Bilawal</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>PAKISTAN and India are closer to war than ever before despite a fragile ceasefire, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has warned, calling the situation in the region ‚Äúincredibly perilous‚Äù and the threshold for full-scale conflict ‚Äúdangerously low‚Äù.</p>
<p>Mr Bhutto-Zardari, also a former foreign minister, said that on the final day of last month‚Äôs deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">clashes</a>, India deployed a dual-use cruise missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, forcing Pakistan to make a split-second decision on whether it was under nuclear attack.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn that atmosphere you‚Äôve got only a few seconds to decide looking at an image: is this missile going to be used within the nuclear connotation or not? And in those split seconds, decisions are made,‚Äù he <a class="link--external" href="https://www.thetimes.com/world/asia/article/pakistan-india-missile-nuclear-x0z9jw3x8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>The Sunday Times</em> during a visit to London.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve achieved a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>, but we haven‚Äôt achieved peace. And that‚Äôs problematic because following this recent conflict, we have lowered the threshold for full-blown military conflict to the lowest it has ever been, to what I believe are dangerously low levels,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

    </figure></p>
<p>Mr Bhutto-Zardari‚Äôs warning came as the United States <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842/trump-says-irans-key-nuclear-facilities-obliterated-by-us-airstrikes">entered</a> Israel‚Äôs war with Iran while managing another potential conflict in South Asia.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, Mr Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093">hosted</a> Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir for a closed-door lunch at the White House ‚Äî the first time a US president has hosted a Pakistani military chief who was not also head of state.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe reason I had him (COAS) here was that I wanted to thank him for not going into the war [with India],‚Äù said Mr Trump. ‚ÄúAnd I want to thank PM [Narendra] Modi as well, who just left a few days ago.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pakistan has said that although outright war between the two nuclear-armed rivals was narrowly averted by US intervention last month ‚Äî after the deadliest fighting in decades ‚Äî the conflict is far from resolved.</p>
<p>The PPP chairman arrived in London at the head of a nine-member parliamentary delegation sent by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to ‚Äúpitch for peace‚Äù and push for international talks to resolve the Kashmir dispute.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan agreed to the ceasefire because it was promised such a summit, which has yet to take place.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt a time where the Pakistani army believes that we had a military upper hand in the conflict, we agreed to a ceasefire because we believed there was a commitment from the United States that we‚Äôd go on to have a dialogue in a neutral location on all friction points,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNow that isn‚Äôt happening. We don‚Äôt want the international community to get a false sense of ease as a result of the ceasefire. There‚Äôs still a very real threat,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Mr Bhutto-Zardari also insisted Pakistan had no role in the Pahalgam attack, which was initially claimed ‚Äî then retracted ‚Äî by a little-known group, the Resistance Front, which India claims is linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba. ‚ÄúTo this day, they [the Indian government] haven‚Äôt provided the Indian public, their allies, or us, or the media, with names of the individuals involved in this attack,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He admitted Pakistan has ‚Äúa credibility problem‚Äù but argued things have changed. ‚ÄúThis credibility and perception problem is rooted in deep biases, tainted by Islamophobia, and obfuscates our actual effort to combat terrorism,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He also accused the West of worsening Pakistan‚Äôs security situation by abandoning Afghanistan and ‚Äúleaving a vacuum‚Äù there.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe rest of the world may have moved on from Afghanistan and exited Kabul, but we‚Äôre fighting terrorism from there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe single largest number of terrorist attacks anywhere in the world is in Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
