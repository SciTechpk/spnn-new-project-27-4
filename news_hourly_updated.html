                <h2>Pakistan‚Äôs envoy calls on Trump to ease tensions with India: report</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan‚Äôs envoy to the United States has asked President Donald Trump to step in and help ease soaring tensions with neighbouring India in the wake of a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir, according to an <a class="link--external" href="https://www.newsweek.com/exclusive-pakistan-calls-trump-help-prevent-nuclear-war-india-2066116" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exclusive report</a> by <em>Newsweek</em>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">civilian</a> and military leadership have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">rejected</a> the accusation and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> and India‚Äôs premier granting ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>‚Äù to his military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an incursion from India within the next 24-36 hours, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension">diplomatic channels</a> from other countries have been engaged to prevent a possible military confrontation.</p>
<p>Pakistan‚Äôs Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh told <em>Newsweek</em> yesterday that for a president ‚Äústanding for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration‚Äù ‚Äî referring to Trump ‚Äî there was no ‚Äúhigher or flashier flashpoint‚Äù than the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf we have a president who is standing for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration, to establish a legacy as a peacemaker ‚Äî or as someone who finished wars, defied wars and played a role in de-confliction, resolving the disputes ‚Äî I don‚Äôt think there is any higher or flashier flash point, particularly in nuclear terms, as Kashmir,‚Äù Pakistan‚Äôs Ambassador to the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855847">Rizwan Saeed Sheikh</a> told <em>Newsweek</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are not talking about one or two countries in that neighbourhood who <em>[sic]</em> are nuclear-capable. So, that is how grave it is,‚Äù he said in an interview with the US magazine.</p>
<p>According to <em>Newsweek</em>, Sheikh contended that the Trump administration would need to pursue a more comprehensive and sustained initiative than in past US attempts to defuse crises that have erupted between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think with this threat that we are facing, there is a latent opportunity to address the situation by not just [focusing] on an immediate de-escalatory measure, or a de-escalatory approach,‚Äù the envoy said.</p>
<p>He called for a more durable and lasting solution to the Kashmir dispute, ‚Äúrather than allowing the situation to stay precarious and pop up again and again at the next drop of a hat on this side or that side‚Äù.</p>
<p>During his interview, Sheikh emphasised that the Kashmir issue was the root cause of all troubles between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUntil and unless that final settlement is made and the resolutions dictate the prescribed solution is allowed to play out, we will all keep having these problems,‚Äù Sheikh said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we insist on the United States and others playing a role in this situation and getting the de-confliction part activated,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>If the long-standing dispute was resolved, the ambassador said, the population of South Asia could live in peace. ‚ÄúAll the other issues between Pakistan and India are not major issues,‚Äù he noted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe do not want to fight, particularly with a bigger country,‚Äù Sheikh said. ‚ÄúWe want peace. It suits our economic agenda; it suits our nationhood. It suits every objective that we have currently. But we want peace with dignity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe would not want to do it, but if it is imposed, then we would rather die with dignity than survive with indignity,‚Äù Sheikh asserted.</p>
<p>The call for Trump to play a role in reducing the tensions came the same day as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was expected to speak to top Pakistani and Indian leaders.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>In his phone call with Rubio yesterday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif urged the US to press India to ‚Äúdial down the rhetoric and act responsibly‚Äù.</p>
<p>In a readout of the call with PM Shehbaz, issued by the US State Department, Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said: ‚ÄúBoth leaders reaffirmed their continued commitment to holding terrorists accountable for their heinous acts of violence.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe secretary (Rubio) urged Pakistani officials‚Äô cooperation in investigating this unconscionable attack. He also encouraged Pakistan to work with India to de-escalate tensions, re-establish direct communications, and maintain peace and security in South Asia,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile conversation with India‚Äôs External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Rubio ‚Äúencouraged India to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia‚Äù.</p>

<p>Sheikh, reiterating Pakistan‚Äôs stance, rejected any involvement of his country in the Pahalgam attack, arguing that the fallout of such an operation could only serve to harm rather than benefit Pakistan‚Äôs interests.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan is focusing on a matter of a deliberate, considered, pronounced shift of our foreign policy, a pivot from geopolitics to geoeconomics,‚Äù the envoy told <em>Newsweek</em>.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are focused on the geoeconomics side of our geography and our foreign policy. We are currently economically ascendant,‚Äù the official said, stressing that Pakistan only needed a ‚Äúpeaceful neighbourhood‚Äù in terms of the broader region.</p>
<p>Terming it ‚Äúso outlandish, so far-fetched, to blame Pakistan‚Äù for the Pahalgam attack, Sheikh said Islamabad was awaiting evidence from New Delhi to prove a link between the incident and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Moreover, the envoy said the attack could be a ‚Äúfalse flag operation‚Äù conducted to intentionally lay the blame on Pakistan. He acknowledged he could not yet back up the claim, but there was ‚Äúenough circumstantial evidence, history, [‚Ä¶] immediate backdrop and setting [‚Ä¶] to entertain that possibility.</p>
<p>Speaking about India‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">unilateral suspension</a> last week of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a> (IWT), Sheikh warned that if there was ‚Äúeven an attempt or a semblance of an attempt‚Äù to stop or hold water, then it would be a declaration of war.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>While contending that it was ‚Äúphysically impossible‚Äù to hold water, the envoy said ‚Äúall bets are off if it‚Äôs about food security of 250 million people‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf you threaten me with this kind of a situation which is existential, what is your expectation of response?‚Äù he asked.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Indian Embassy in Washington <a class="link--external" href="https://www.newsweek.com/indian-embassy-terrorists-behind-attack-will-brought-justice-2066403" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Newsweek</em></a> in a statement: ‚ÄúThe terrorists behind the attack will be brought to justice.‚Äù It termed Sheikh‚Äôs remarks a ‚Äúcrude attempt to rewrite history and gloss over facts‚Äù.</p>

            <p><p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday reaffirmed the government‚Äôs commitment to the welfare and uplift of workers, state-media <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/01-05-2025/intl-labour-day-being-observed-today" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>As the world commemorated International Labour Day, the president and the premier issued separate messages to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>According to the <a class="link--external" href="https://normlex.ilo.org/dyn/nrmlx_en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:11210:0::NO::P11210_COUNTRY_ID:103166" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Labourers Organisation (ILO)</a>, Pakistan has yet to ratify 55 conventions and protocols. While labour laws <a class="link--external" href="https://www.riaabarkergillette.com/usa/wp-content/uploads/Labour-law-in-Pakistan.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exist</a> but enforcement is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881963">weak</a>, and despite government promises to create millions of jobs, issues like low pay, lack of social protection, and poor representation remain unresolved.</p>
<p>President Zardari paid tribute to the men and women labourers in the country and highlighted their struggles around the world, according to state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1917782980673823022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pakistan Television</a> (PTV)</em>.</p>

<p>In his statement, he said: ‚ÄúWe reiterate our commitment to workers‚Äô autonomy, fair wages, a safe environment and social security. Workers and the working class are the driving force of our economy and national development.‚Äù</p>
<p>He highlighted the role of workers ‚Äúin building our infrastructure, developing industries, agriculture, and the economy‚Äù.</p>
<p>He added: ‚ÄúOur workers are our pride. Our national development is due to the hard work and character of workers. In a rapidly changing world, we must focus on skilling our youth and workers for a bright future. We need to equip our workers and youth with modern skills.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOur hardworking workforce is the driving force behind our nation‚Äôs progress and our resilience,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe protection of fundamental rights of workers is enshrined in the Constitution of Pakistan and is fully consistent with the core conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), to which Pakistan is a committed signatory,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>The premier highlighted that the country has undertaken legislative and administrative reforms to strengthen labour and workforce protection, including key international labour conventions, such as the Forced Labour Convention and the 2014 Protocol to the Maritime Labour Convention.</p>
<p>He stated, ‚ÄúFor the first time, every worker in Pakistan is benefiting from a national occupational safety and health profile, ensuring safe and healthy workplaces across the country.‚Äù</p>
<p>He urged workers, activists, civil society and the government to play their role for ‚Äúa society that respects workers, upholds their rights, and creates opportunities for decent work‚Äù.</p>

<p>Senate Chairman Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907618/president-promises-fair-wages-safe-working-conditions-for-labourers">paid tribute</a> to all hardworking individuals of the nation, stating that May 1 is a shining symbol of determination, sacrifice, and human dignity.</p>
<p>Gilani said workers were the backbone of any nation. He emphasised that as a nation, we must realise that unless the labour class is provided with social, economic, and legal protection, the dream of sustainable development will remain incomplete.</p></p>
