            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925022/fo-says-pakistan-has-dismantled-terrorist-outfits-amid-us-designation-of-group-blamed-for-pahalgam-attack' target='_blank'><strong>FO says Pakistan has ‘dismantled’ terrorist outfits amid US designation of group blamed for Pahalgam attack</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday reaffirmed Pakistan’s stance against terrorism, saying that the country has “effectively and comprehensively dismantled” terrorist outfits.</p>
<p>The statement follows the US State Department’s decision on Thursday to <a class="link--external" href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/07/terrorist-designation-of-the-resistance-front/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">designate</a> a little-known group  called The Resistance Front (TRF) — responsible for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> — as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) and specially designated global terrorist (SDGT) group.</p>
<p>The April 22 attack — which resulted in the deaths of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a> — sparked a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military confrontation</a> between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan as New Delhi blamed it on Islamabad, which strongly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">denied</a> the allegations while calling for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral investigation</a>.</p>
<p>According to a <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36xe95g06zo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BBC News</a></em> report in June, the group had initially said it was behind the attack, but later disowned it.</p>
<p>The US State Department claimed that the little-known group was a “front and proxy” of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).</p>
<p>“TRF has also claimed responsibility for several attacks against Indian security forces, including most recently in 2024,” the State Department said in a statement.</p>
<p>In a statement today, the FO said, “Any linkage with LeT, a defunct organisation <a class="link--external" href="https://nacta.gov.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/proscribed-organizations-06-oct-2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">banned</a> in Pakistan, belies ground realities.</p>
<p>“Pakistan has effectively and comprehensively dismantled concerned outfits, arrested and prosecuted the leadership, and deradicalised its cadres,” it added.</p>
<p>“Pakistan condemns terrorism in all forms and manifestations; zero tolerance, and international cooperation against terrorism are cornerstones of our policy.”</p>
<p>The FO highlighted Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896143">apprehension</a> of Mohammad Sharifullah, who was the “mastermind” of the 2021 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1642871">Abbey Gate bombing</a> at Kabul airport.</p>
<p>The statement further said that the investigations into the Pahalgam incident were “still inconclusive”.</p>
<p>“While the issue under consideration pertains to US domestic laws, India has a track record of exploiting such designations to push anti-Pakistan propaganda with a view to divert international attention from its irresponsible and rogue behaviour, including ongoing human rights atrocities, especially in occupied Kashmir,” it added.</p>
<p>The FO’s statement also urged the international community to “adopt objective and non-discriminatory policies” to address terrorism.</p>
<p>“Terrorist organisations like Majeed Brigade must also be listed as [an] alias of BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army),” the FO asserted.</p>
<p>In 2022, an anti-terrorism court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1684132">awarded</a> a combined sentence of 33 years imprisonment to LeT chief Hafiz Saeed in two cases of terror financing registered by the Counter Terrorism Depart­ment.</p>
<p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global money laundering and terrorism financing watchdog, in 2022 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1716183">removed</a> Pakistan from a list of countries under “increased monitoring”, also known as the “grey list”, after four years.</p>
<p>“It has two concurrent action plans. After a lot of work by Pakistani authorities, they have largely addressed all of the action plan items,” then-FATF president Raja Kumar said.</p></p>

            <p><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Friday announced that Pakistan recorded a current account surplus of $2.1 billion during the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>Due to the widening trade gap and higher external debt servicing, the country <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917759">posted</a> a current account deficit of $103 million in May compared to a $47m surplus in the preceding month and $1.2bn in March.</p>
<p>According to SBP <a class="link--external" href="https://easydata.sbp.org.pk/apex/f?p=10:211:::NO:RP:P211_DATASET_TYPE_CODE,P211_PAGE_ID:TS_GP_BOP_BPM6SUM_M,210&amp;cs=1B25722420322956C75438ADD306E4B0A" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data</a>, the current account saw a surplus of $2.1bn, compared to a deficit of $2.1bn during the previous fiscal year.</p>

<p>Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad highlighted the developments in a post on X, stating that the surplus was the highest in 22 years.</p>
<p>“[The] country’s current account for June 2025 closes in $328m surplus, taking full-year surplus to over $2.1bn,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Schehzad added that remittances surged by 27 per cent year-on-year to reach a “historic” $38bn.</p>
<p>He added that in the current fiscal year, textile exports increased by 7.4pc year-on-year to $17.9bn, while IT (information technology) and IT-enabled services exports climbed to $4.6bn — a year-on-year increase of 44pc.</p>
<p>“Last, but not the least, [the] Pakistan Equities Market (KSE-100) crossed 140,000 points, making a historic mark in its history, with market value crossing Rs 16.8 trillion (close to $60bn),” he wrote.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed gratitude for the current account surplus, calling it “very welcome”.</p>
<p>“Foreign exchange reserves have exceeded $19bn due to government measures,” he was quoted as saying in a statement from his office.</p>
<p>“The main reason for the stability in current account surplus is a significant increase in remittances and exports,” he added. “Improving financial and economic indicators show that the country’s economy is on the path of stability.”</p>
<p>Commending his team, the PM said that the government is taking priority steps to provide a business and investment-friendly environment in the country, according to the statement.</p></p>

            <p><p>A Balochistan Constabulary acting deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and a constable were martyred and two others suffered injuries on Friday when unidentified gunmen opened fire on their vehicle on National Highway in the Mastung district, provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind said.</p>
<p>There has been an increase in the frequency of attacks against security forces in Balochistan in recent times. In April, three policemen were martyred and at least 16 others were injured in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904388">blast</a> that targeted a vehicle of the Balochistan Constabulary on Mastung’s Dasht Road.</p>
<p>According to Rind’s statement, “A police convoy coming from Kalat to Quetta was targeted by terrorists.”</p>
<p>“Acting DSP Inspector Abdul Razzaq and Constable Raza Muhammad Jam were martyred in the attack, while Constable Taj Muhammad and Constable Khursheed Ahmed were injured,” he said.</p>
<p>Rind further said that the dead bodies and injured personnel were transferred to Quetta by helicopter.</p>
<p>He continued, “Terrorist incidents are a manifestation of the despair of the enemies of peace. The morale of the people of Balochistan and the security forces cannot be diminished.”</p>
<p>“A formal investigation into the attack has been launched, and the elements involved will be brought to justice,” he added.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MOIofficialGoP/status/1946184457519612385" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from his office, extending his condolences and assailing <em>Fitna-Al-Hindustan</em> — a term the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525#:~:text=Govt%20designates%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20for%20terrorist%20groups%20in%20Balochistan">uses</a> for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan.</p>

<p>Earlier today, the spokesperson said that one Balochistan Constabulary officer was martyred and three others were injured in the incident.</p>
<p>“According to initial reports, the acting DSP’s vehicle was targeted,” Rind said in a statement.</p>
<p>The assailants opened fire on the vehicle near the Choto area of Mastung on the National Highway, the statement elaborated.</p>
<p>Rind stated that “a search operation is underway to apprehend the assailants, and security forces have been dispatched to the site of the attack”.</p>
<p>The injured officers were immediately rushed to Shaheed Nawab Ghaus Bakhsh Hospital in Quetta, he added.</p>
<p>On July 16, three people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924597">killed</a> and seven others were injured as a passenger bus was fired upon in Balochistan’s Kalat. Earlier this month, three cops were injured in an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922575/3-cops-injured-in-blast-on-highway-police-vehicle-in-balochistans-nasirabad">attack</a> on a highway police vehicle in Balochistan’s Nasirabad District.</p>
<p>In a separate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923165">incident</a> on July 9, unknown attackers hurled a grenade at a police checkpoint at the Sibi-Harnai railway crossing gate. The grenade exploded at the post, but no injuries were reported.</p>
<p>On June 21, two personnel of the Frontier Corps were martyred and four were injured in a bomb attack in Kalat’s Mongochar area.</p></p>
