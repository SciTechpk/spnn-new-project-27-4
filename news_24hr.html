            <p><p>United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio lauded Pakistan’s role in “global and regional peace” in his first meeting with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday, the Foreign Office (FO) said.</p>
<p>The deputy prime minister arrived in Washington, DC, on Thursday night, on the second leg of his eight-day visit to the US. He had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925622">arrived</a> in New York on Monday to attend “high-level signature events” of Pakistan’s United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency, including a conference on Palestine.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the FO today said that Dar held his first meeting with Rubio. The two have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902727">previously talked</a> over the telephone.</p>
<p>The FO said Rubio acknowledged Pakistan’s “everlasting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1381731">sacrifices</a> in the war on terror”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan has always played a positive role in global and regional peace,” the FO quoted the US secretary of state as saying.</p>
<p>The FO said that detailed discussions were held on bilateral relations and potential cooperation in various sectors.</p>
<p>“Discussions were held on promoting bilateral trade and economic relations, cooperation in important sectors, including investment, agriculture, technology [and] minerals. Counter-terrorism and regional peace were also discussed.”</p>

<p>FM Dar paid tribute to the efforts of President Donald Trump and the US leadership in promoting global peace, adding that their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">role and efforts</a> regarding the recent Pakistan-India tension were “commendable”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan and the US seek further expansion and stability in bilateral relations,” he said.</p>
<p>The FO said FM Dar was optimistic about the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925309">positive progress</a> in the ongoing trade dialogue between the two countries</p>
<p>“Pakistan is an attractive destination for the American business community and investors. The two countries have a common approach and interests regarding regional peace. The Pakistani community in the US is playing a bridge role between the two countries,” the FO quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to promoting bilateral relations and working together in various fields</p>

<p>Dar said the two had a “comprehensive discussion on the full spectrum of bilateral relations”.</p>
<p>He added that both reaffirmed their commitment to the long-term bilateral partnership, with renewed focus on economic, trade, investment, information technology, artificial intelligence and counter-terrorism cooperation.</p>
<p>We also exchanged views on key regional and global developments. I appreciated the U.S. constructive role in facilitating the recent Pakistan-India ceasefire.</p>
<p>“We reaffirmed the importance of close coordination at multilateral fora, including at the UN Security Council. With continued dialogue and mutual respect, I am confident we can build a more stable, prosperous, and mutually beneficial future for both our nations.”</p>

<p>Upon arrival in the US capital, FM Dar was received by Ambassador of Pakistan to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh and senior embassy officials.</p>
<p>Dar’s visit comes as Pakistan holds the presidency of the UNSC this month. Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921308">assumed</a> the UNSC presidency for July, marking its first presidency since 2013. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026.</p>
<p>Addressing a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926068">reception</a> hosted by Pakistan’s Mission in New York on Wednesday, Dar called for an inclusive dialogue and cooperative diplomacy over confrontation amid growing turbulence across the world.</p>
<p>The deputy PM asserted that Pakistan’s leadership has been guided by “these very principles in both deliberations and concrete actions taken during its tenure”.</p>
<p>The UNSC unanimously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925923">adopted</a> Pakistan-sponsored <a class="link--external" href="https://press.un.org/en/2025/sc16125.doc.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Resolution 2788</a>, calling for the strengthening of international mechanisms to settle disputes through peaceful means.</p>
<p>Dar also announced Pakistan was seeking a seat at the UN Human Rights Council for the 2026-2028 term, with the Asia-Pacific Group endorsing its candidacy. Pakistan last <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1584934">held</a> the membership from 2020 to 2023.</p></p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif assured Dr Fouzia Siddiqui on Friday that the government would continue to provide all possible legal and diplomatic support in the matter of her sister, Dr Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist serving a prison sentence in the United States, the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-meets-dr-aafia-siddiquis-sister-assures-all-possible-legal-diplomatic-support/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) Registrar Office <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924527">put</a> on hold the processing of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925717/contempt-notice-to-pm-cabinet-after-unsanctioned-hearing">contempt of court notices</a> issued to PM Shehbaz and his cabinet members as the dealing staff decided to ascertain its validity first.</p>
<p>IHC Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq on July 21 had issued a contempt of court notice to the entire federal government, including the prime minister and all ministers, for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921306">refusing</a> to file an amicus brief to support Dr Aafia’s case in the US.</p>
<p>“The government is in no way negligent regarding the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui,” the prime minister was quoted as having said by <em>APP</em> in a meeting today with Dr Fouzia.</p>
<p>On the instructions of PM Shehbaz, the government has previously provided diplomatic and legal assistance in the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui, a statement issued by the PM Office said.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, the prime minister not only wrote a letter to then-US president Joe Biden regarding this issue but also formed a committee headed by Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar to ensure further progress in the matter,” the statement added.</p>
<p>“The committee will remain in contact with Dr Fouzia and work to provide the necessary support in this regard.”</p>

<p>Dr Aafia, a neuroscientist and educator, was convicted by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on charges of attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan and has been serving her <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924527">sentence</a> at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Carswell in the US since 2010.</p>
<p>On July 12, the IHC expr­essed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923643">dissatisfaction</a> over the federal government’s failure to submit a report in the case concerning Dr Aafia’s release, health and repatriation, with Justice Ishaq threatening to “summon the entire cabinet” if the report was not presented.</p>
<p>In February, the IHC was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893509">told</a> that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1496759">proposal</a> to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1384547">exchange</a> Shakil Afridi for Dr Aafia was unfeasible.</p>
<p>The law officer representing the federal government informed the court that Dr Aafia’s American lawyer Clive Smith had suggested the swap, but Pakistan and the US did not have any agreement for such an exchange.</p>
<p>Last year in October, PM Shehbaz had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866050">requested</a> that Biden pardon and release Dr Aafia from jail.</p>
<p>In a letter dated October 13, which has been seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, the prime minister expressed his concerns about Dr Aafia’s “fragile mental and frail physical health” while in prison. “Now 52 years old, she has served 16 years behind bars in the US.</p>
<p>“Numerous Pakistani officials have paid consular visits to Dr Siddiqui … all of them have raised their serious concerns about the treatment she has received,” the letter read. “In fact, they fear she may take her own life.”</p>
<p>Consequently, the US State Department <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867024">declined</a> to comment on the letter written by PM Shehbaz to the Biden administration.</p>
<p>When a journalist inquired about the letter, spokesperson Vedant Patel had stated: “Certainly, we would not get into private diplomatic communications,” seemingly confirming receipt of the correspondence.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926546/ecc-okays-pakistans-green-taxonomy-intiative' target='_blank'><strong>ECC okays Pakistan’s ‘Green Taxonomy’ intiative</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet on Friday approved Pakistan’s Green Taxonomy, as proposed by the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, in a “major step towards environmental sustainability”.</p>
<p>“The chair appreciated the initiative, noting that it was long overdue and would play a vital role in facilitating access to financing for green projects in the country,” a statement issued by the Finance Division read.</p>
<p>During a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899074">meeting</a> of the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change and Environmental Coordination in March, State Bank Governor Jameel Ahmad said the taxonomy will allow financial and non-financial companies to share a common definition of economic activities that can be considered environmentally sustainable.</p>
<p>The statement issued today noted that the ECC meeting was held under the chairmanship of Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to deliberate on a range of important agenda items concerning industrial growth, environmental policy, skill development, housing finance, and telecommunications.</p>
<p>The meeting was attended by Federal Minister for Power Sardar Awais Ahmed Khan Leghari, Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik, Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, along with senior officials from relevant ministries, divisions, departments, and authorities.</p>
<p>It added that the ECC reviewed and endorsed a report presented by the Ministry of Commerce on industrial competitiveness and export-led growth of the steel sector, in alignment with the National Tariff Policy 2025–30, aimed at reducing production costs and enhancing export competitiveness.</p>
<p>The committee also approved a summary by the Ministry of Commerce for filing an appeal in the Supreme Court against the decision of the Lahore High Court regarding the grant of gas and Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas tariff concessions to Ghani Glass Limited. The Committee found the appeal untenable in light of the fact that concessionary energy tariffs for five export-oriented sectors have already been withdrawn and are no longer available to any sector.</p>
<p>To support skills development through outcomes-based financing, the ECC approved a government guarantee of Rs1 billion for the issuance of the Pakistan Skill Impact Bond (PSIB), as moved by the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training.</p>
<p>In the housing sector, the ECC approved a markup subsidy and risk-sharing scheme for affordable housing finance, with the objective of expanding access to low-cost housing.</p>
<p>The committee also urged the ministry to develop a comprehensive, integrated database of the housing sector in coordination with relevant federal and provincial stakeholders, in order to ensure better targeting and effective implementation of the scheme.</p>
<p>The ECC was briefed by the Ministry of Industries and Production on the status of availability and pricing trends in the vegetable ghee and oil market. While noting the ministry’s assurance regarding adequate national stock levels, the committee expressed concern over the limited pass-through of declining international prices to domestic consumers.</p>
<p>It advised vigilant monitoring to prevent price distortions and potential cartelisation and emphasised the need for active coordination with the Competition Commission of Pakistan, National Price Monitoring Committee (NPMC), and provincial governments through the Ministry of Industries and Production.</p>
<p>The ECC also approved a proposal by the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication for the revision of charges for Radio-Based Services (RBS). The committee directed the ministry to ensure periodic revision of RBS charges every three to five years, aligned with ongoing economic changes and technological advancements in the sector.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the committee endorsed a revised composition of the advisory committee overseeing the release of IMT spectrum, which is critical for improving next-generation mobile broadband services in Pakistan.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the ECC approved the formal declaration of ship breaking and recycling as a recognised industry, as recommended by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs.</p>
<p>Last month, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920726/ecc-okays-up-to-50pc-hike-in-gas-charges">increased</a> the price of gas by 50 per cent in an apparent move to meet the demand of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>The ECC of the federal cabinet approved the hike in fixed gas charges for all consumers from July 1.</p>
<p>The committee instructed the ministry to coordinate with the Power Division and share relevant data on power consumption patterns in the sector, to enable an accurate assessment of the implications of applying industrial power tariffs in place of the existing commercial rates.</p></p>
