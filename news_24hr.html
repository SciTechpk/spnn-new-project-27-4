            <p><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Thursday rebutted rumours of President Asif Ali Zardari being asked to resign, terming it a “malicious campaign”.</p>
<p>“We are fully aware of who is behind the malicious campaign targeting President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and the chief of army staff,” Naqvi <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MohsinnaqviC42/status/1943211206371602592" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X.</p>
<p>“I have categorically stated that there has been no discussion, nor does any such idea exist about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency,” he asserted.</p>

<p>“The president of Pakistan enjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces,” the minister said.</p>
<p>He quoted President Zardari as having “clearly” stated: “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”</p>
<p>Naqvi stressed that the “sole focus” of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was Pakistan’s strength and stability, and “nothing else”.</p>
<p>“To those involved in this narrative, do whatever you wish in collaboration with hostile foreign agencies. As for us, we will do whatever is necessary to make Pakistan strong again, InshAllah,” Naqvi added.</p>
<p>Earlier today, PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui also denied reports of Zardari’s resignation.</p>
<p>Speaking on <em>Geo News’</em> programme “<a class="link--external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzXtjUbD19E&amp;t=719s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Geo Pakistan</a>”, he said: “Reports that Zardari is resigning, Imran’s sons are coming, Nawaz Sharif is going to Adiala … these are not news. They are bogus, table stories.”</p>
<p>He further said, “Zardari has not created any difficulties for the government, and understands his constitutional responsibilities as head of state”.</p>
<p>The PML-N leader said his party had “no trouble” working with the president, who leads the PPP, and there was no credible reason to remove him from office.</p>
<p>“We have a coalition with the PPP. Why would we bring down this system?” he questioned.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, social media campaigns against the army have escalated, reflecting broader tensions within the country’s political and social fabric.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856908">government</a>, as well as the military, have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1876905">repeatedly</a> warned about “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=fake%20news%20and%20propaganda%20have%20become%20so%20common%20and%20there%20is%20no%20accountability%20for%20it.%E2%80%9D">fake news and propaganda</a>” proliferating on social media, with military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=theories%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20added.-,%E2%80%98Digital%20terrorism%E2%80%99,-Questioned%20about%20criticism">digital terrorism</a>” under the laws.</p>
<p>In May, President Zardari and PM Shehbaz formally decorated Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Syed Asim Munir with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912748/president-pm-decorate-coas-munir-with-rank-of-field-marshal">rank of field marshal</a> for his “sagacious leadership and exceptional strategy” during the recent conflict with India.</p>
<p>In a subsequent dinner hosted by the army chief, Field Marshal Munir lauded the political leadership for their “strategic foresight” during <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> against India.</p>

<p>The next month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who belongs to PM Shehbaz’s PML-N, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918558/whats-behind-khawaja-asifs-praise-for-hybrid-system">hailed</a> the “existing hybrid model of governance” in the country. In a separate interview, he also termed it as a “practical necessity” for Pakistan, saying the system was “doing wonders”.</p>
<p>In May 2024, the army chief and President Zardari had expressed their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1825461">concern</a> over “baseless and unsubstantiated allegations levelled by a specific political party and its few individuals” against the army for their political interests.</p></p>

            <p><p>Four people died and 40 were injured in rain-related incidents across Punjab over the past 24 hours as more heavy showers were expected across the province, according to rescue officials and local authorities.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1852031#:~:text=Monsoon%20rains%20across%20the%20region%20from%20June%20to%20September%20offer%20respite%20from%20the%20summer%20heat%20and%20are%20crucial%20to%20replenishing%20water%20supplies.%20They%20are%20also%20vital%20for%20agriculture%2C%20and%20therefore%20the%20livelihoods%20of%20millions%20of%20farmers%20and%20food%20security%20for%20South%20Asia%E2%80%99s%20nearly%20two%20billion%20people.">fall across</a> the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat. They are crucial to replenishing water supplies and agriculture, and therefore, the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security. However, they also wreak havoc by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>At least nine people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923183/11-killed-as-rains-continue-to-batter-punjab-balochistan">lost their lives</a> and many others sustained injuries as heavy monsoon rains lashed Lahore on Wednesday. The downpours caused widespread flooding and disrupted daily life in several areas.</p>
<p>“Over the last 24 hours, four people died and 40 were injured due to rain and winds across the province,” Rescue 1122 Punjab Spokesperson Farooq Ahmed said in a statement.</p>
<p>Those who sustained serious injuries were immediately transported to a hospital, the spokesperson said.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N leaders issue conflicting statements on allowing Imran’s sons to enter Pakistan</strong></a>
            <p><p>PML-N leaders have issued differing statements on whether PTI founder Imran Khan’s sons would be allowed entry into Pakistan to run a political movement for their father’s release, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they “can stage protests but within legal limitations.”</p>
<p>Imran’s sons — Suleman Khan (28) and Kasim Khan (26) — had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910789">called attention</a> to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May.</p>
<p>Imran, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a> since August 2023 in a case related to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878307/imran-khan-bushra-bibi-indicted-in-new-toshakhana-case">state gifts</a>, is also serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831">£190 million</a> graft case and and faces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845818">pending trials</a> related to the May 9, 2023 riots.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">said</a> the two brothers would come to Pakistan as part of an upcoming PTI protest movement.</p>
<p><a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part2.ch1.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Article 16</a> of the Constitution says that “every citizen shall have the right to assemble peacefully and without arms, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interest of public order.”</p>
<p>Speaking on <em>Geo News</em>’ programme ‘Geo Pakistan’ today, Irfan Siddiqui said: “In my personal opinion — as the government has so far not taken any official stance — they should be allowed to come. They should come and carry out their activities.”</p>
<p>He noted that the sons have spent their entire lives abroad, so they would be “well-aware of what a protest is, how it is staged, and what the boundaries are that we cannot cross”.</p>
<p>“In my opinion, they should not be deprived of this right. If they want to run a movement for their father, then they should,” Siddiqui reiterated.</p>
<p>However, he also hinted at their potential arrests: “If they come here and cross the limitations of laws […] They will also come prepared for that, knowing that ‘if we are fighting the laws, then the law will take its course’.”</p>

<p>While Kasim recently <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/Kasim_Khan_1999/status/1942262324158685297" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on X about his father being “fully cut off” from the sons, he has not addressed the matter of joining Pakistan’s politics.</p>
<p>Although the government has not officially commented on the matter, Minister of State for Law and Justice <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923089">Barrister Aqeel Malik</a> took a different stance than Siddiqui, stating last night that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals.</p>
<p>Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said the sons could face arrest if they led a violent movement, while Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said they “should come” to Pakistan.</p>
<p>Siddiqui downplayed the matter altogether, saying that the government was not considering it a “serious issue”. “This will not cause any political upheaval […] there will be no storm if his children come to Pakistan,” he said.</p>
<p>“Why these kids now?” he asked, giving an allegory of taking out two cards that were lying in a pocket deep inside.</p>
<p>He listed that neither <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920141/gandapur-seeks-sc-help-to-gain-access-to-imran">Ali Amin Gandapur</a> — the PTI’s only chief minister currently — could do anything for the PTI, nor their protests, or “revolt”, or the call to overseas Pakistanis to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879439">halt remittances</a>.</p>
<p>“This card that they are playing will not succeed either. It will aggravate their difficulties because, in the end, politics is to be discussed at the table,” the PML-N senator asserted, referring to the PTI’s demand for Imran’s release.</p>
<p>Regarding talks, the PML-N leader said the only obstacle was Imran himself.</p>
<p>Siddiqui also highlighted various skill challenges that Imran’s sons would face in Pakistan’s political arena.</p>
<p>“Those children have not grown up in Pakistan’s environment at all. They might even melt if you leave them in Karachi’s heat on I.I. Chundrigar Road; those poor kids’ nature is such,” he quipped.</p>
<p>The lawmaker added: “They are maybe not able to speak in Urdu either, so they do not have a language to address this nation.”</p>
<p>However, he acknowledged that their faces were recognisable as they were Imran’s sons. “They are sensible, educated and must be politically well-aware as well.”</p>
<p>Siddiqui termed the potential entry of Imran’s sons into politics as a move to employ emotional appeal.</p>
<p>“They (the sons) are being called because [PTI’s] options within the land of Pakistan have been exhausted,” the lawmaker said, recalling the 2022 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1732679">mass resignations</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9, 2023 riots</a>.</p>
<p>He also pointed out that such a move would go against Imran’s “philosophy that has been against family politics very clearly”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Asked by the show hosts whether he was underestimating the sons, given that the PPP’s Bilawal-Bhutto Zardari and his sisters entered politics despite having stayed abroad, Siddiqui replied that the latter had still not “gotten a chance to run a movement as the scenario had changed entirely” compared to the dictatorships in the 1900s.</p>
<p>The PML-N leader noted that ex-president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s wife Nusrat and daughter Benazir used to speak in Urdu and participated in a movement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Imran’s former spouse, Jemima Goldsmith, assailed the government for potential plans to arrest her sons if they visited Pakistan.</p>
<p>“My children are not allowed to speak on the phone to their father. He has been in solitary confinement in prison for nearly two years,” she wrote on X.</p>
<p>“Pakistan’s government has now said if they go there to try to see him, they too will be arrested and put behind bars,” she noted.</p>
<p>“This doesn’t happen in a democracy or a functioning state. This isn’t politics. It’s a personal vendetta,” Goldsmith lamented.</p>
