                <h2>Trump says Pakistani representatives coming to US next week for trade talks</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump said on Friday that representatives from Pakistan are coming to the United States next week as Islamabad seeks to make a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">deal on tariffs</a>.</p>
<p>Pakistan faces a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">potential 29 per cent tariff</a> on its exports to the US due to a $3 billion trade surplus with the world‚Äôs biggest economy, under tariffs announced by Washington last month on countries around the world.</p>
<p>Pakistan‚Äôs formal <a class="link--external" href="https://pakungeneva.pk/un-resolutions-on-jammu-kashmir/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">negotiations</a> with the United States on reciprocal tariffs started earlier in the day with a phone call between Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, a press release from the finance ministry said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan representatives are coming in next week,‚Äù Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews after departing Air Force One.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd India, as you know, we‚Äôre very close to making a deal with India. And I wouldn‚Äôt have any interest in making a deal with either (Pakistan and India) if they were going to be at war with each other. I went that and I let them know,‚Äù the US president stressed.</p>
<p>The developments follow a recent military confrontation between Pakistan and India over New Delhi‚Äôs allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam.</p>
<p>New Delhi, based on the allegations, launched a series of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> in Pakistan in early May, killing civilians. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>. After intercepting drones sent by India on May 8 and tit-for-tat strikes on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.</p>

<p>Indian Trade Minister Piyush Goyal visited Washington recently to advance trade talks, with both sides aiming to sign an interim agreement by early July.</p>
<p>India faces 26pc tariffs on shipments to the US.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> reported last week that India is likely to allow US firms to bid for contracts worth over $50 billion, mainly from federal entities, as it negotiates a trade deal with Washington.</p>
<p>The increase in trade tariffs on Pakistani products, amongst a global tariff announcement by US President Donald Trump, which were paused, could have a devastating impact on Pakistan‚Äôs important exports and serve as a wake-up call for diversification, according to a state-owned think tank.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics warned that these tariffs could have a ‚Äúdevastating impact‚Äù on the country‚Äôs export sector, translating into an annual loss of $1.1-1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810/trumps-tariffs-stoke-global-trade-war-as-china-eu-hit-back">tariffs</a>, implemented on April 2, introduced a 10 per cent baseline tariff for every country the US trades with, and additional reciprocal tariffs on rivals and allies alike.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump also reaffirmed his claim of having brokered the May 2025 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">Pakistan-India ceasefire</a> ‚Äî a statement that continues to irk New Delhi but is quietly welcomed in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Speaking at a White House press conference on Friday, President Trump said his intervention ‚Äústopped India and Pakistan from fighting‚Äù, adding that the conflict could have ‚Äúturned out into a nuclear disaster‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe talk trade and we said we can‚Äôt trade with people that are shooting at each other and potentially using nuclear weapons,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre great leaders in those countries. And they understood and they agreed and that all stopped.‚Äù</p>
<p>This marks the fifth time President Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">publicly cited his role</a> in halting the conflict. He underscored America‚Äôs power to both wage and prevent wars, stating, ‚ÄúUltimately, we can fight better than anybody,‚Äù but added, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre stopping others from fighting also.‚Äù</p>
<p>He also expressed gratitude to the leaders of both South Asian nations, as well as his own diplomatic team. ‚ÄúI want to thank the leaders of India, the leaders of Pakistan, and I want to thank my people also,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p>A Pakistani delegation, led by PPP chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, will arrive in New York on Sunday. It is expected to meet UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres, the current president of the UN General Assembly, and ambassadors of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. The delegation will also address a joint session of OIC envoys during its two-day stay in New York.</p>
<p>The group will travel to Washington on June 3, where it hopes to meet Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other senior US officials. The visit also includes meetings with congressional lawmakers, policy experts from major think tanks, and US media representatives.</p>
<p>While Pakistani officials have been cautious in public, they privately acknowledge that President Trump played a significant role in defusing the recent conflict. In contrast, India has repeatedly rejected the notion of outside involvement, claiming that the ceasefire was initiated by Pakistan and achieved without US mediation.</p>
<p>Curiously, Islamabad denies making such a request and instead credits President Trump ‚Äî creating an unusual diplomatic convergence between Pakistani officials and the current US president.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs latest comments are seen in Islamabad as a timely morale booster for the visiting delegation. Pakistani diplomats say they not only endorse his claim but would welcome a broader US role in South Asia, particularly in resolving the <a class="link--external" href="https://pakungeneva.pk/un-resolutions-on-jammu-kashmir/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kashmir dispute</a>. Trump had earlier underscored the need to resolve this issue, calling it a ‚Äúfestering wound‚Äù that must be addressed to ensure lasting peace in the region.</p>
<p>President Trump‚Äôs remarks were part of a broader narrative positioning his second term as one focused on restoring global stability. ‚ÄúWhen I left, we had no wars, we had no problems. We defeated ISIS, we rebuilt our military, and we had no inflation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd when I came back, we had a lot of inflation. We had wars all over the place.‚Äù</p>
<p>Listing current global crises ‚Äî including the war in Ukraine, the Israeli invasion of Gaza, and tensions in the Indo-Pacific ‚Äî President Trump cited South Asia as another region where US leadership has made a difference. ‚ÄúAnd now we have something where we‚Äôre really healing a lot of that,‚Äù he said, casting himself as a stabilising force in a turbulent world.</p>
<p>His assertion of having averted a ‚Äúnuclear disaster‚Äù is likely to prompt strong reactions in diplomatic circles, particularly in New Delhi, which has consistently rejected third-party involvement in its disputes with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Yet, the timing of his remarks is significant. The Pakistani delegation‚Äôs visit to Washington aims to focus on trade, regional security, and reshaping US-Pakistan ties amid shifting global alliances and domestic political transitions. President Trump‚Äôs comments may complicate the diplomatic tone ‚Äî or, for Islamabad, provide an opening to highlight its international relevance and US engagement.</p>
<p>Analysts say even if the president‚Äôs role in the ceasefire is exaggerated, the fact that hostilities ceased suggests that diplomatic pressure ‚Äî including from Washington ‚Äî was a factor. Given President Trump‚Äôs preference for direct engagement and bold claims, his involvement cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>For Pakistan, the ceasefire remains a rare instance where a US president publicly acknowledged playing a role in reducing South Asian tensions ‚Äî something successive governments in Islamabad have long sought.</p>
<p>As one Pakistani official noted privately: ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter who claims the credit, as long as the firing stops.‚Äù</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Christine Fair, a US scholar once seen as aligned with pro-Indian perspectives, challenged New Delhi‚Äôs narrative of success in the recent Pakistan-India conflict.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndians who fail to see the victories that Pakistan snatched from the latest skirmish will fail to understand just why India has not and will not deter Pakistan,‚Äù she wrote in a post on X.</p></p>

<p>KARACHI: Business leaders have advised the government to avoid surprises in the upcoming federal budget by proposing significant relief for the salaried class, including a reduction in the general sales tax (GST) and the phasing out of the super tax.</p>
<p>In addition to balancing the external account and managing the fiscal deficit, Pakistan Business Council CEO Ehsan Malik stated that there is now an urgent need to augment <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913055">defence spending</a> through higher export earnings.</p>
<p>The PBC‚Äôs budget proposals aimed to fiscally incentivise the rapid growth of exports and the indigenisation of inputs. Given the constraints on the fiscal account, the council sought a gradual reduction in corporate and super taxes, as well as the withdrawal of multiple taxation on inter-corporate dividends.</p>
<p>Relief was requested for salaried employees, as was a reduction in GST, which at 18pc incentivised evasion. He emphasised that a higher tax-to-GDP ratio should be the result of business growth, not the outcome of further taxes on those already taxed.</p>

<p>Overseas Investors Chambers of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) Chief Executive/Secretary General M.

<p>He also proposed tax relief for the salaried class and the rationalisation of industry taxes in line with regional norms.</p>
<p>He sought a gradual reduction in corporate and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899088">sales tax rates</a>, along with the phasing out of the super tax in three years.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe urge the government not to throw in surprises and engage all the stakeholders for tax reforms along with ensuring policy consistency,‚Äù Aleem added.</p>

<p>Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Senior Vice-President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon said the focus should be on boosting exports as the government has been claiming it would not go to International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the future after the completion of the ongoing $7bn Extended Fund Facility.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn this scenario, the government should frame policies to develop the export sector,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>He urged the government to avoid ‚Äúnew taxes‚Äù on export-oriented sectors as they would increase production costs and make goods uncompetitive globally.</p>

<p>Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Jawed Bilwani stressed the need to enhance industrial competitiveness, promote exports, broaden the tax base, and eliminate structural inefficiencies in the economic framework.</p>
<p>The past fiscal year has seen significant macroeconomic improvements, offering an opportunity to implement targeted policy interventions that can drive sustained economic growth.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe strongly advocate for a broad-based, transparent, and predictable tax framework that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910790">expands the tax net</a>, removes distortions, and fosters a fairer distribution of the tax burden,‚Äù he said, adding that rationalising aggressive tax regimes, eliminating inefficiencies, and simplifying tax procedures will be essential in ensuring a pro-growth fiscal environment.</p>
<p>Mr Bilwani noted that the SME sector, which serves as a backbone of economic activity and employment, continues to struggle due to limited access to finance and an unsupportive regulatory framework.</p>

<p>Site Association of Industry (SAI) President Ahmed Azeem Alvi urged the government to prioritise industrial growth and exports in the budget for FY26 by widening the tax base, capping business income tax at 25pc, abolishing the Super Tax, and reversing recent controversial amendments to the Income Tax Ordinance.</p>
<p>He called for a harmonised GST system, faster refunds, gradual reduction of sales tax to 15pc, and abolition of the additional sales tax to reduce informality.</p>
<p>He demanded an end to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1839346">Fata/Pata tax exemptions</a>, overhauling welfare schemes, and adopting digitalisation, and a one-window operation. Ahmed also urged the restoration of zero-rated status for export sectors and essential goods.</p>
