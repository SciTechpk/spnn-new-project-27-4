<p>ISLAMABAD: Norma­lity returns to the Sub­continent after Pakistan and India agreed on Saturday to a full and immediate ceasefire after days of deadly jet fighter, missile, drone and artillery attacks — news surprisingly announced by US President Donald Trump, who congratulated them on using “common sense”.</p>
<p>Officials from Islam­abad and New Delhi confirmed the development mi­­n­utes after Mr Trump posted the ann­ouncement on his Truth Social net­work, as the conflict bet­ween the nuclear-armed neighbours appeared to be spiralling towards a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">full-blown war</a>.</p>
<p>“After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congra­tulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,” Mr Trump posted.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MIshaqDar50/status/1921175494633943541" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on X, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said: “Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire with immediate effect. Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he added.</p>

<p>Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri <a class="link--external" href="https://twitter.com/PTI_News/status/1921180471033295068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1921180471033295068%7Ctwgr%5E9f5c948ab57568f9fb7a4e49ee0b2afed14b4f52%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dawn.com%2Flive%2Fpakistan-india-tensions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the two countries’ military operations chiefs had spoken to each other and agreed that all fighting would stop at 5pm Indian time (1130 GMT), without using the word “ceasefire”. He said the two DGMOs would speak to each other again on May 12.</p>
<p>Mr Dar told <em>Geo News</em> that military channels and hotlines between India and Pakistan had been activated, and three dozen countries had actively helped to facilitate the agreement.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked US Presi­dent Donald Trump for his “leadership and proactive role” in helping Pakistan and India achieve peace in the region. “Pakistan appreciates the US for facilitating this outcome, which we have accepted in the interest of regional peace and stability,” he said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/CMShehbaz/status/1921220993101525318" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X.</p>

<p>The ceasefire comes after four days of attacks and counter-attacks by both sides that killed at least 60 people and saw thousands of civilians flee their homes along their border as well as in Azad and occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>The fighting was touched off by an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> last month in the India-held Kashmir town of Pahalgam that killed 26 tourists, which Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack%20were%20brought%20out">blamed</a> on Islamabad.</p>
<p>Pakistani military sources said armed forces had shot down <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909700/pakistan-has-shot-down-77-indian-drones-so-far-state-media">at least 77</a> Israeli-made high-tech drones, while Indian officials claimed they had destroyed hundreds of Pakistani drones, many Turkish-made.</p>
<p>Pakistan also says it downed five Indian warplanes — including three French Rafale fighter jets — although New Delhi has not confirmed any losses.</p>
<p>This was the first time the two nations used drone attacks on a large scale against each other. Both countries have been developing their own drones, and they also import them.</p>
<p><strong>Punitive measures in place</strong></p>
<p>Despite the truce, two Indian government sources told Reuters that the punitive measures announced by India and reciprocated by Pakistan, such as trade suspension and visa cancellations, would remain in place for now.</p>
<p>The sources also said the 1960 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>, a critical water-sharing pact that India suspended after the Pahalgam attack, would continue to remain in abeyance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in contradiction to Mr Misri’s statement that the Directors General of Military Operations (DGMOs) of Pakistan and India would “talk again on May 12 at 12pm (11:30am Pakistan time)”, the Indian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting reported that “there is no decision to hold talks on any other issue at any other place”.</p>
<p>Quoting its Ministry of External Affairs, the Indian information ministry tweeted that the “stoppage of firing and military action between India and Pakistan was worked out directly between the two countries”.</p>
<p>“The Pak DGMO initiated the call this afternoon after which discussions took place and understanding reached,” it added.</p>
<p><strong>Positive step</strong></p>
<p>“The ceasefire is a positive step,” said Bilal Shabbir, an IT consultant in Muzaffarabad. “In war, it’s not just soldiers who die, it’s mostly civilians — and in this case, it would have been the people of Kashmir.”</p>
<p>Ehsan Malik, CEO of the Pakistan Business Council, said both Pakistan and India “need to lift their large populations on virtually every measure of socio-economic development. We are happy that a ceasefire will help both governments to focus on this priority”.</p>
<p>Shuja Nawaz, distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council’s South Asia Centre, said the Indus treaty would figure prominently in the impending talks “after a decent interval, which allows both governments to claim credit for what they’ve achieved until now”.</p>
<p>However, within hours after the ceasefire, violations were reported from both sides of the Line of Control (LoC).</p>
<p>Blasts were heard in Srinagar and Jammu and projectiles and flashes were seen in the night sky over Jammu, similar to the events of the previous evening, according to authorities, residents and <em>Reuters</em> witnesses.</p>
<p>Residents in the city of Barnala, in Azad Kashmir, reported hearing exchan­ges of fire along the line dividing the region, according to the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/10/world/pakistan-india-kashmir" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New York Times</a></em>.</p>
<p>Military spokespeople in both countries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Separately, occupied Kashmir’s chief minister Omar Abdullah <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/OmarAbdullah/status/1921224682159661251" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted on X</a>: “What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar!!!”</p>

<p>There were also reports from different border regions of skirmishes. Some reports also said that drones were spotted hovering over Bahawalpur.</p>
<p><em>Dawn</em> learnt that the drones were spotted after Isha prayers, prompting citizens to come out of their homes. However, sources said the presence of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is not a matter of concern as it may happen for a few days after a truce is brokered.</p>
<p>When contacted the district emergency officer, Police Emergency 15, Rescue 1122 Emergency Office and other security institutions, it was told that the situation was being cleared.</p>
<p>Deputy Commissioner Bahawalpur Dr Farhan Farooq told this scribe, via WhatsApp message, that “all intercepted” and no damage so far, Alhamdolillah“.</p>
<p><strong>Rubio lauds PMs</strong></p>
<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio later revea­led that he and Vice President JD Vance had been in direct contact with senior Pakistani and Indian officials, including Prime Ministers Shehbaz Sharif and Narendra Modi, over the past two days.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/SecRubio/status/1921175185836708140" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> released by his office, Mr Rubio said: “Over the past 48 hours, Vice President Vance and I have engaged with senior Indian and Pakistani officials, including Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif, External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishan­kar, Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir, and National Security Advisors Ajit Doval and Asim Malik.”</p>

<p>He also commended PMs Sharif and Modi on “their wisdom, prudence, and statesmanship in choosing the path of peace.”</p>
<p>Mr Vance, who had earlier said the conflict was “fundamentally none of our business”, also endorsed the deal by reposting Mr Trump’s <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1921174163848401313" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on X.</p>
<p>“Great work from the president’s team, especially Secretary Rubio,” Mr Vance wrote. “And my gratitude to the leaders of India and Pakistan for their hard work and willingness to engage in this ceasefire.”</p>

<p><strong>PM calls for dialogue</strong></p>
<p>Hours after the ceasefire was announced, PM Shehbaz on Saturday expressed hope that a process of peace dialogue would take place to resolve all contentious issues between the two nuclear states, including fair distribution of water resources and the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>In his address to the nation, the prime minister said Pakistan responded positively to the option of ceasefire for international and regional peace and for the sake of millions of people in the subcontinent.</p>
<p>He thanked opposition parties, political forces and friendly nations, including the United States, for their constructive and effective role in de-escalating tensions.</p>

<p>“We responded positively to the option of ceasefire for the sake of international and regional peace and millions of people,” PM Shehbaz said.</p>
<p>The premier extended special thanks to China and President Xi Jinping, saying, “China stood by Pakistan without concern for any personal gain or loss.”</p>
<p>He also expressed gratitude to other world leaders, including the US President Donald Trump, Turkiye President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, Qatar Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad, and UN Secretary General António Guterres.</p>
<p>The prime minister congratulated the whole nation and armed forces for the victory in the standoff with India and said: “Today we got a historic victory. It is the victory of our principles.”</p>
<p>The premier said India played a shameful role in these days and Pakistani nation and armed forces gave a befitting response to the enemy what it deserved.</p>
<p>“In the pretext of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam incident</a>, India imposed war on us and attacked our civilian population through drones and missiles. Then we decided that the issues which should have been resolved through dialogue, will be settled in battlefield,” he added.</p>
<p><strong>Dar engages counterparts</strong></p>
<p>Foreign Minister Dar also talked to his counterparts in China, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye and apprised them of the current situation in the region following last night’s Indian aggression and Pakis­tan’s subsequent response.</p>

<p>Pakistan has targeted key Indian military installations in a “befitting response” as part of its retaliatory operation, the federal government said in a statement.</p>
<p>“These actions are being carried out in response to India’s initial attack, which was an assault on our homeland, people and sovereignty,” the statement said, referring to Indian missile strikes at three PAF airbases.</p>
<p>The retaliatory attacks targeted “more than 26” locations and damaged “equipment and personnel” at at least five airbases, according to Colonel Sophia Qureshi of India’s Army Signal Corps.</p>
<p>The damage was sustained at air force bases in Udhampur, Pathankot, Adampur, Bhuj and Bathinda, Col Qureshi said, according to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-shows-time-stamped-pictures-to-dismiss-pakistans-claims-about-air-force-stations/articleshow/121050824.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Times of India</a></em>.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910189/pakistan-dictates-the-pause-with-india' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan dictates the pause with India</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Any enduring resolution demands good faith, addressing root causes including Kashmir<br />
• Ex-NSA says Pakistan has re-established deterrence, stability and balance in region</p>
<p>In the latest round of hostilities between India and Pakistan, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">US-brokered ceasefire</a> has sought to pause what risked spiralling into a catastrophic conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.</p>
<p>But make no mistake: this was no negotiated compromise between equals in the conflict. Pakistan agreed to the ceasefire after securing a calculated victory by firmly denying a much stronger India the military edge and diplomatic narrative it sought to dominate.</p>
<p>The crisis began in the wake of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam, which India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack%20were%20brought%20out">swiftly blamed</a> on Pakistan-based militants <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">without</a> providing evidence. Islamabad’s call for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral investigation</a> was brushed aside. Instead, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">escalated</a> — launching missile and drone strikes into Pakistani territory beginning May 7. The most intense exchanges came on the night of May 9-10, one of the tensest nights in decades, when Indian forces targeted Pakistani military installations, only to face <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">swift and strategic retaliation</a> from Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s military response during the entire crisis was measured and decisive. Retaliating to India’s Operation Sindoor, Pakistan’s forces on May 7 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">took down five Indian jets</a>, including <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909560">advanced Rafales</a>, using <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909714">Chinese-supplied</a> J-10Cs and PL-15E missiles — an undeniable blow to India’s air superiority pretensions. And then on May 10, in a rare and calculated action, Pakistan neutralised Indian S-400 missile systems using hypersonic missiles fired from JF-17 aircraft. These kills — Rafales and S-400 system — sent a message not only across the border but across the globe.</p>

<p>“This week’s India-Pakistan conflict has marked a turning point, with modern conventional weaponry reshaping the battlefield and expanding the scope for the conventional use of force,” Muhammad Faisal, South Asia research analyst at the University of Technology Sydney, said.</p>
<p>India’s ambitions to dominate the escalation ladder — long a cornerstone of its regional strategy — collapsed under the weight of these setbacks. The Rafale and S-400, icons of India’s defence modernisation, became symbols of its miscalculation. For the first time in years, Pakistan demonstrated not just parity but deterrent credibility that undermined India’s claims of military primacy.</p>
<p>Former national security adviser Gen Nasser Janjua said, “Pakistan has successfully re-established the deterrence, stability and balance in the region. Pakistan has also successfully buried the concept of limited war under a nuclear environment.”</p>
<p>Diplomatically, too, the tide turned. As the spectre of escalation loomed, the United States intervened — not out of favour to one side, but out of alarm. With India’s air force facing serious attrition and risk of deeper military degradation, Washington acted to cap the conflict.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Mark Rubio’s diplomacy made the leadership of both warring countries, including Army Chief Gen Asim Munir, negotiate. Crucially, the resulting agreement was not just about ceasing hostilities; it included Pakistan’s long-standing demand: that future talks take place at a neutral venue. This was not a face-saving gesture, it was rather a strategic vindication.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the G7’s restrained <a class="link--external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/g7-foreign-ministers-statement-on-india-and-pakistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> of May 10, notably avoiding any blame on Pakistan and instead urging dialogue and de-escalation, marked a diplomatic win for Islamabad. India’s narrative — that it was the aggrieved party reacting to terrorism—failed to gain traction. Instead, New Delhi found itself incr­easingly portrayed as the aggressor, its unilateral actions and refusal of an independent probe into Pahalgam casting doubt on its intentions.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“India overassessed and miscalculated its newfound relevance while eyeing to become a counterweight to China and being part of the Indo-Pacific strategy. The whole conflict till May 10 exposed India’s exaggerated and inflamed strategic relevance,” Gen Janjua maintained.</p>
<p>Pakistan, for its part, played the moment with clarity and restraint. By upholding Article 51 of the UN Charter, it positioned its response as legitimate self-defence. It neither overreached nor sought escalation for escalation’s sake. This is what separates a state seeking resolution from one seeking hegemony.</p>
<p>And yet, challenges remain. The ceasefire, while welcome, is tenuous. Hours after it took effect at 16:30 hrs on Saturday, there were reports of breaches from various locations.</p>
<p>Trust is scarce and for good reason. India’s post-ceasefire messaging has been muddled and, at times, deliberately dismissive. Indian officials privately propagated the impression that the agreement was merely an “understanding” devoid of commitments or international mediation.</p>
<p>Even more concerning, Indian officials suggested to their domestic audiences that hostile measures — such as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">April 23 decision</a> to suspend the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a> remain in force. This selective reinterpretation of the deal aims to pro­ject strength at home, but it raises serious doubts about New Delhi’s sincerity.</p>
<p>“India must cease its threats, stop externalising its internal security issues, and engage in meaningful dialogue with Pakistan. A backchannel between the two NSAs should be established to lay the groundwork for talks. As a first step, India must reverse its suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty to address a key Pakistani concern,” former foreign minister Jalil Abbas Jilani said.</p>
<p>Pakistan cannot be expected to buy into an illusion of peace while India reserves the right to provoke again. Any enduring resolution demands good faith and that means addressing root causes, above all the Kashmir dispute. India’s consistent refusal to engage meaningfully on Kashmir and its habit of painting all Kashmiri dissent as terrorism perpetuate the cycle of violence and instability.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Pakistan hopes that India will stop its march to the follies and learn from the outcome of conflict and will come to terms for a peaceful coexistence by resolving all its disputes with Pakistan including Kashmir and Indus Waters Treaty, which was unilaterally and illegally suspended despite the World Bank being a guarantor,” Gen Janjua said and added that Delhi should stop misperceiving that it is above international law.</p>
<p>“Despite ceasefire and commitment to talks, Pakistan needs to remain ready for another round of military confrontation,” Mr Faisal warned.</p>
<p>The international community, particularly those who helped defuse the crisis, must now hold India to account. Ceasefires cannot function if they merely reset the clock until the next provocation.</p>
<p>Dialogue must be real, not rhetorical. And India must show that it values peace more than posturing.In the final accounting, Pakistan has walked away from this round not as a state that bent to pressure, but one that stood firm, exposed its adversary’s miscalculations, and steered the crisis toward de-escalation on its own terms. It restored deterrence, secured diplomatic recognition, and reframed the regional narrative.</p>
