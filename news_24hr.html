            <p><p>Hundreds of ballistic missiles were launched from Iran towards Israel, marking the start of Tehran’s response to intensive Israeli strikes as part of “Operation True Promise 3”, Iranian media reported on Friday after a day of attacks on the Islamic Republic’s nuclear and missile facilities.</p>
<p>Iranian media outlet <em>Tehran Times</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/514278/Iran-starts-legitimate-missile-attacks-on-Israel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that 100 missiles were fired at Israel from Shiraz in the initial phase.</p>
<p>“TV footages show that Israel’s capital Tel Aviv is in disarray and people seeking shelter as ballistic missiles are raining down on the occupied territories. The legitimate retaliatory attacks by Iran’s military is called ‘Operation True Promise 3’,” the report added.</p>

<p>It said the attack was launched as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was addressing the nation. Khamenei said that Israel initiated a war and said it will not be allowed to do “hit and run” attacks without grave consequences.</p>
<p>“The Zionist regime (Israel) will not remain unscathed from the consequences of its crime. The Iranian nation must be guaranteed that our response will not be half-measured,” Khamenei said in a statement</p>

<p>Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said they launched an attack on dozens of targets in Israel.</p>
<p>“The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps … has executed its decisive and precise response against tens of targets, military centres and airbases of the usurping Zionist regime in the occupied territories,” the Guards said in a statement carried by state media.</p>
<p>The United States is helping Israel intercept Iranian missiles, <em>Axios</em> reported, citing a senior US official.</p>
<p>Israeli rescuers said that seven people were injured in the centre of the country.</p>
<p>Speaking on Israel’s <em>Channel 12</em>, Eli Bin, the spokesman for the Magen David Adom rescue service, said that seven people were lightly injured in central Israel. Images on <em>Channel 12</em> showed what appeared to be a building hit by a missile.</p>

<p>“A short while ago, sirens sounded in several areas across Israel following the identification of missiles from Iran toward the State of Israel,” the military said in a statement, with <em>AFP</em> journalists reporting booms over Jerusalem, similar to those heard during past interceptions.</p>

<p>Iranian outlets <em><a class="link--external" href="https://en.mehrnews.com/news/233090/Iran-detains-Israeli-female-fighter-jet-pilot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mehr</a></em> and <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/06/13/3334885/iran-s-air-defenses-down-2-israeli-warplanes-female-pilot-captured" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tasnim</a></em> reported that a female Israeli pilot was captured. However, <em>Al Jazeera</em> reported that Avichay Adraee, the Arabic spokesperson of the Israeli military, denied the reports.</p>
<p>Israel launched widescale strikes against Iran earlier today, saying it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders, and that this was the start of a “prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon”.</p>
<p>Iran promised a harsh response and the Israeli military said Iran launched around 100 drones, with air defences intercepting them outside Israeli territory, while neighbouring Jordan said it targeted drones and missiles that violated its airspace.</p>
<p>But around 0800 GMT (1pm PKT), Israeli media said an order to citizens to remain near protected areas had been lifted, suggesting that most or all the drones had been neutralised.</p>
<p>In a letter to the United Nations, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the attack as a “declaration of war” and called on the UNSC to immediately address the issue, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Araghchi requested the meeting in a letter to the 15-member body, saying Israel “has now crossed every red line, and the international community must not allow these crimes to go unpunished”.</p>
<p>He wrote: “Iran reaffirms its inherent right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter and will respond decisively and proportionately to these unlawful and cowardly acts.”</p>
<p>Article 51 of the UN Charter covers the individual or collective right of states to self-defence against armed attack.</p>
<p>An Israeli security source said Israeli Mossad commandos had operated deep inside the Islamic Republic before the attack and the Israeli spy agency and military had led a series of covert operations against Iran’s strategic missile array.</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#evening-attacks-by-israel" id="evening-attacks-by-israel" title="Permalink"></a>Evening attacks by Israel</h2>
<p>The Iranian retaliation came some time after Tehran’s defence system intercepted fresh projectiles as several explosions were heard in the city and its surrounding areas in the evening, more than 12 hours after a massive wave of Israeli attacks on the country.</p>
<p>“There were reports of explosions heard in the west of Tehran province,” in the cities of Shahriar and Malard and around the neighbourhood of Chitgar in Tehran city, state news agency <em>IRNA</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/IRNA_1313/status/1933553891947192715" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>, while <em>Mehr</em> agency reported a blast in Pakdasht southeast of the capital.</p>

<p><em>IRNA</em> said Tehran’s defences were activated. “News received indicates that enemy projectiles have been intercepted by Tehran’s defences,” it said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/IRNA_1313/status/1933569268806816020" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <em>Mehr</em> news agency said a “massive explosion” was heard in Isfahan, a major city in central Iran, in a province that is home to several nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>“A few minutes ago, a massive explosion was heard in Isfahan,” <em>Mehr</em> said without immediately elaborating.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said it struck Iran’s nuclear facility in Isfahan as it pressed on with its strikes on the Islamic Republic’s military and nuclear sites. “I can now confirm that we struck the nuclear facility in Isfahan. The operation is still ongoing,” military spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin told journalists.</p>
<p>He said Israel had so far struck more than 200 targets across Iran since it began the wave of air strikes. “We are continuing to strike,” Defrin added.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said its strike on Iran’s nuclear facility in Isfahan dismantled infrastructure for reconverting enriched uranium.</p>
<p>Israeli “fighter jets completed a strike on the Iranian regime’s nuclear site in the Isfahan area”, a military statement said, adding that “the strike dismantled a facility for producing metallic uranium, infrastructure for reconverting enriched uranium, laboratories, and additional infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Israel’s army chief said the military was keeping up “full force” to achieve its goals after launching the wave of strikes.</p>
<p>“We are continuing with full force, at a high pace, in order to meet the goals we have set for ourselves,” Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir said in a statement.</p>
<p>“There will be difficult moments, we need to be prepared for the range of scenarios we have planned for, very high readiness and discipline are required on the home front. “</p>
<p>The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting at 1900 GMT (12am PKT) following Israel’s wave of airstrikes, current presidency Guyana announced.</p>
<p>The meeting was requested by Iran, and supported by Russia and China, a diplomatic source told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Iran said Israel’s deadly strikes on its military and nuclear facilities were a “declaration of war” and called on the UNSC to act.</p>

<p>Pakpour threatened to open “the gates of hell” in retaliation for Israel’s attacks that killed his predecessor.</p>
<p>“In retribution for the blood of our fallen commanders, scientists and citizens, the gates of hell will soon be opened upon this child-killing regime,” Pakpour said of Israel in a message carried by state news agency <em>IRNA</em>.</p>
<p>A senior adviser to Khamenei was wounded during the attack, state media reported.</p>
<p>“Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to the supreme leader… was injured in today’s attack by the Zionist regime,” according to state TV.</p>
<p>Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a recorded video message: “We are at a decisive moment in Israel’s history.</p>
<p>“Moments ago, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival. This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.”</p>

<p>Khamenei said in a statement that Israel had “unleashed its wicked and bloody” hand in a crime against Iran and that it would receive “a bitter fate for itself”.</p>
<p>An Israeli military official said Israel was striking “dozens” of nuclear and military targets, including the facility at Natanz in central Iran. The official claimed Iran had enough material to make 15 nuclear bombs within days.</p>

<p>The United States said it had no part in the operation, which raises the risk of a fresh escalation in tensions in the Middle East, a major oil-producing region.</p>
<p>Iran’s foreign ministry summoned the ambassador of Switzerland, which represents US interests in Tehran, state media said.</p>
<p>“During the meeting, the Islamic Republic of Iran conveyed its deep outrage and strong protest over this act of aggression by Israel and the support extended to it by the United States,” <em>IRNA</em> reported.</p>
<p>Alongside extensive air strikes, Israel’s Mossad spy agency led a series of covert sabotage operations inside Iran, <em>Axios</em> reported, citing a senior Israeli official. These operations were aimed at damaging Iran’s strategic missile sites and its air defence capabilities.</p>
<p>At least six nuclear scientists were killed in Israel’s attacks, media outlets in the Islamic Republic reported.</p>
<p>Iran’s <em>Tasnim</em> news agency named the six scientists, including Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, who was the president of the Islamic Azad University of Iran. Fereydoun Abbasi, a former head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, was also among the scientists killed, it added.</p>
<p>The organisation added that most of the damage from Israeli air strikes targeting its underground uranium enrichment facility at Natanz was at ground level.</p>
<p>“Most of the damage is on the surface level,” said the organisation’s spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi, adding that there had been “no casualties” at the facility where the enrichment centrifuges are housed underground.</p>
<p>A fresh round of explosions was heard in northwestern Iran, state television reported, following Israel’s wave of early morning strikes on multiple cities.</p>
<p>“A few minutes ago, new explosions were heard in East Azerbaijan,” the broadcaster said, as the <em>Tasnim</em> news agency said an earlier wave of strikes had hit 10 sites in the province, killing at least three people.</p>
<p>The death toll from Israeli strikes in northwestern Iran increased to 18, state media reported, revising an earlier figure of eight dead.</p>
<p>“So far, as a result of this brutal aggression, 18 individuals have attained martyrdom and 35 of our fellow citizens have been injured,” IRNA quoted East Azerbaijan provincial authorities as saying, reporting attacks on 11 locations in the province.</p>
<p>A loud blast was heard later in the afternoon near a military airbase in Iran’s western Hamedan province, state media reported.</p>
<p>“A few hours ago, a loud blast was heard near Hamedan,” more than 300 kilometres from Tehran, the <em>IRNA</em> state news agency said, adding that “it was heard near the Nojeh airbase”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Israel’s embassy to Sweden said that Israel would close its diplomatic missions around the world in light of recent developments and that consular services would not be provided. It did not say how long the missions would be closed.</p>

<p>The administration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has released a statement, announcing that Iran will avenge the blood of every single individual killed in Israeli strikes, <em>IRNA</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85861499/Pezeshkian-administration-Iran-will-write-the-ending-to-this" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>“With a savage regime as this,” the statement read, referring to Israel, “one shall not speak but with the language of power.”</p>
<p>“As of this moment, the Islamic Republic of Iran’s government has begun the necessary defensive, political and legal measures to make the illegitimate Israel regret [its aggression] and will deny the Israelis a moment’s rest,” it said.</p>
<p>“The world now better understands Iran’s insistence on its right to enrichment and nuclear technology and missile power.”</p>
<p>Iran has in the past 200 years never started a war, the statement said, but would not hesitate for a second to defend itself.</p>
<p>“The ending to this story will be written by Iran.”</p>
<p>Pezeshkian said that Iran would make Israel “regret” its deadly attack.</p>
<p>“The Iranian nation and the country’s officials will not remain silent in the face of this crime, and the legitimate and powerful response of the Islamic Republic of Iran will make the enemy regret its foolish act,” Pezeshkian said in a video statement aired on state TV.</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump urged Iran to “make a deal”, warning that there will be more “death and destruction” after Israel launched the deadly strikes.</p>
<p>“There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>He said there was still time for the country to prevent further conflict with Israel.</p>
<p>“There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>ABC News,</em> Trump added the Israeli attack on Iran was “excellent” and warned there was much more to come.</p>
<p>“I think it’s been excellent. We gave them a chance and they didn’t take it. They got hit hard, very hard. They got hit about as hard as you’re going to get hit. And there’s more to come. A lot more,” Trump was quoted as saying by an <em>ABC</em> reporter on X.</p>

<p>Trump told <em>Reuters</em> in a phone interview that it was unclear if Iran still has a nuclear programme following Israeli strikes on the country.</p>
<p>Trump told <em>Reuters</em> the US still has nuclear talks planned with Iran on Sunday, but that he is not sure if they will still take place. He said it was not too late for Iran to make a deal.</p>
<p>“I tried to save Iran humiliation and death,” Trump said.</p>
<p>He said he is not concerned about a regional war breaking out as a result of Israel’s strikes.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Trump said that Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb and that the US was hoping to get back to the negotiating table, in an interview with <em>Fox News</em> after the start of the Israeli air strikes on Iran.</p>
<p>“We will see,” <em>Fox News</em> reporter Jennifer Griffin quoted Trump as saying in a post on X.</p>
<p>Trump would convene a meeting of the National Security Council on Friday morning, the White House said. He had said on Thursday that an Israeli strike on Iran “could very well happen” but reiterated his hopes for a peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>The US military is planning for the full range of contingencies in the Middle East, including the possibility that it might have to help evacuate American civilians, a US official told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>Iran’s armed forces spokesperson said Israel and its chief ally, the US, would pay a “heavy price” for the attack, accusing Washington of providing support for the operation.</p>
<p>While the US tried to distance itself from Israel’s military operation, an Israeli official told public broadcaster <em>Kan</em> that Israel had coordinated with Washington on Iran.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the country was not involved in the strikes and Tel Aviv had acted unilaterally for self-defence.</p>
<p>“We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” Rubio said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Let me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel,” he added.</p>

<p>The State Department issued an advisory saying that all US government employees in Israel and their family members should “shelter in place until further notice”.</p>
<p>Lebanese group Hezbollah condemned Israel’s wave of strikes, warning that they threaten to “ignite the region”.</p>
<p>“This enemy adheres to no logic or laws and knows only the language of killing, fire, and destruction,” Hezbollah said in a statement that condemned the strikes as a “brutal” aggression.</p>

<p>UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said he was ready to travel to Iran to assess the situation there after Israel’s strikes hit the sprawling nuclear complex at Natanz.</p>
<p>In a statement to a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Board of Governors, Grossi said the other main enrichment centre in Iran, Fordow, was not hit, and neither was another nuclear facility in Esfahan, citing Iranian authorities.</p>
<p>There are no elevated radiation levels at Natanz, he added.</p>
<p>“I call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid further escalation. I reiterate that any military action that jeopardises the safety and security of nuclear facilities risks grave consequences for the people of Iran, the region, and beyond,” Grossi said in his statement.</p>
<p>“I have indicated to the respective authorities my readiness to travel at the earliest to assess the situation and ensure safety, security and non-proliferation in Iran.”</p>
<p>He did not say what the extent of the damage at Natanz was or what parts of the site were hit. The site includes a vast underground uranium enrichment plant and a smaller, above-ground pilot enrichment plant.</p>
<p>Iran is enriching to up to 60 per cent purity, close to the roughly 90pc of weapons-grade, at the pilot plant, but it is producing smaller quantities of that material there than at Fordow, a site dug into a mountain that military experts have said would be difficult for Israel to destroy through bombardment.</p>
<p>“Despite the current military actions and heightened tensions, it is clear that the only sustainable path forward — for Iran, for Israel, the entire region, and the international community — is one grounded in dialogue and diplomacy to ensure peace, stability, and cooperation,” Grossi said.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Grossi said that nuclear facilities “must never be attacked”.</p>
<p>The UN nuclear watchdog said that Iranian authorities told it that no increase in radiation levels was observed at the Natanz uranium enrichment site following Israeli strikes.</p>
<p>“Iranian authorities have informed the IAEA … that no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a post on X, after earlier confirming that the facility was “among targets” of the strikes.</p>

<p>It added that Iran’s only nuclear power plant in the southern port city of Bushehr had not been targeted.</p>
<p>An exceptional meeting of the watchdog’s Board of Governors will be held on Monday to discuss Israel’s strikes after at least one country on the board requested one at Friday’s regular, quarterly session of the body, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Any country on the board of the IAEA can call a meeting under its rules.</p>
<p>Iran, which is not on the board, requested a meeting and its call was supported by board members Russia, China and Venezuela, diplomats said. The diplomats gave differing accounts as to which board member was the first to clearly make the request.</p>
<p>The meeting will start at 10am (0800 GMT) on Monday, diplomats at Friday’s closed-door meeting said before any public announcement of the emergency meeting.</p>
<p>There was no sign of any push for a resolution or other action on Monday by the 35-nation board, said the IAEA’s top policymaking body.</p>
<p>However, Iran’s atomic energy organisation confirmed in a statement that its nuclear facility in Natanz had been damaged, but investigations had not shown any radioactive or chemical contamination outside the site.</p>
<p>“The attack has damaged several parts of the facility. Investigations are ongoing to assess the extent of damages,” the statement said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Israel’s neighbouring country Jordan’s military said it intercepted drones and missiles that had violated the kingdom’s airspace.</p>
<p>“Royal Air Force aircraft and air defence systems intercepted on Friday morning a number of missiles and drones that entered Jordanian airspace,” a military statement said.</p>
<p>Air raid sirens sounded in the Jordanian capital after Israel’s attack on Iran, while the public security directorate urged people to stay at home.</p>
<p>“Adhere to the guidelines and stay in your homes,” said an announcement on loudspeakers in Amman.</p>
<p>Jordan had earlier said it would not allow its airspace to be violated and vowed not to become a “battleground” in any regional conflict. “Jordan has not and will not allow any violation of its airspace, reaffirming that the Kingdom will not be a battleground for any conflict,” government spokesperson Mohammad Momani told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>The government condemned Israel’s attack, with foreign ministry spokesperson Sufian Qudah warning of “the consequences of such escalatory actions”.</p>
<p>Jordan also called the attack “a blatant violation of the sovereignty of a United Nations member state and a clear breach of international law and the UN Charter”.</p>
<p>Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport was closed until further notice, and Israel’s air defence units stood at high alert for possible retaliatory strikes from Iran.</p>
<p>“Following the pre-emptive strike by the State of Israel against Iran, a missile and UAV (drone) attack against the State of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate time frame,” Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.</p>
<p>Israeli military Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir said tens of thousands of soldiers had been called up and “prepared across all borders”.</p>
<p>“We are amidst a historic campaign unlike any other. This is a critical operation to prevent an existential threat, by an enemy who is intent on destroying us,” he said.</p>
<p>Israeli Minister Gideon Saar was holding a “marathon of calls” with counterparts around the world regarding Israel’s attack on Iran, the foreign ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Pakistan was among several countries and international actors which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916907/world-reacts-to-israeli-strike-on-iran-over-nuclear-activity">condemned</a> Israel’s strikes, with the Foreign Office calling it “unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel.”</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned “in the strongest possible terms today’s unprovoked attack on Iran by Israel”.</p>
<p>“I convey my deepest sympathies to the Iranian people on the loss of lives in this attack. This grave and highly irresponsible act is deeply alarming and risks further destabilising an already volatile region,” he <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/CMShehbaz/status/1933418673362120803" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a post on X.</p>
<p>“We urge the international community and the United Nations to take urgent steps to prevent any further escalation that could imperil regional and global peace.”</p>

<p>German airline Lufthansa also said it had suspended all flights to and from Tehran.</p>
<p>“Lufthansa Group flights to and from Tehran will be suspended until further notice due to the current situation,” the company said in an emailed statement, adding it would also avoid Iranian, Iraqi and Israeli airspace for now.</p>
<p>Air France said it was suspending its flights to and From Tel Aviv “until further notice” and was “closely monitoring the situation in the Middle East in real-time,” a spokesman for the French airline told <em>AFP</em>, adding that “the safety of its customers and crews is its absolute priority.”</p>
<p>Air India diverted or called back 16 flights between India and London and cities in Canada and the United States “due to the emerging situation in Iran”.</p>
<p>The New Delhi-Vienna and Mumbai-London flights were about to enter Iranian airspace when Israel launched its attack, forcing the planes to turn back to their origin, according to aircraft tracker Flight Aware.</p>
<p>Iraq also closed its airspace. “The ministry of transport closes Iraqi airspace and suspends air traffic at all Iraqi airports,” the <em>Iraq News Agency</em> reported.</p>
<p>It filed a complaint later with the UN Security Council over Israel’s “violation of Iraqi airspace” in a major attack on Iran, Baghdad’s foreign ministry said.</p>
<p>“These practices constitute a flagrant violation of Iraq’s sovereignty,” the ministry said, calling on “the Security Council to assume its responsibilities” and act to “prevent the recurrence of such violations”.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said that it was forced to act based on new intelligence information showing that Iran was “approaching the point of no return” in the development of a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>“In recent months, this programme has accelerated significantly, bringing the regime significantly closer to obtaining a nuclear weapon,” it said in a statement, without disclosing the purported evidence.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916940/gilani-says-no-connection-with-massive-hike-in-salaries-of-senate-chairman-na-speaker' target='_blank'><strong>Gilani says ‘no connection’ with massive hike in salaries of Senate chairman, NA speaker</strong></a>
            <p><p>Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani on Friday distanced himself from the massive hike in the salaries of senior parliamentarians including himself, saying he was not consulted before the raise was approved.</p>
<p>The government recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916120">approved</a> a fivefold increase in the salaries of the Senate chairman and National Assembly speaker, taking it to Rs1.3 million a month. A May 29 notification revealed that the Senate chairman and NA speaker’s salaries have been raised from Rs205,000 to Rs1.3m, besides 50pc of the revised salary (Rs650,000) as the sumptuary allowance. The hike will take effect from January 2025.</p>
<p>“I have full respect for the defence minister. I have nothing to do with my salary increase,” Gilani told reporters at the Senate building when asked about the hike amid an economic crisis and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s criticism of the move.</p>
<p>The PPP stalwart said the decision regarding the raise will be made by the government. When asked if he would refuse the salary hike, he replied, “I didn’t say about withdrawing. I have no connection with it.”</p>
<p>Gilani added he was not consulted when the hike was approved.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has taken <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916897/pm-thanks-uae-for-role-in-defusing-tensions-with-india">notice</a> of the increase in the salaries of the National Assembly speaker and Senate chairman and sought a report from the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.</p>
<p>The decision has drawn criticism from within the ruling PML-N as Defence Minister Khawaja Asif publicly criticised the move. In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KhawajaMAsif/status/1932846121933799902" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the senior PML-N leader termed the massive hike in salaries a “financial obscenity, urging lawmakers to “keep in mind the life of a common man.”</p>
<p>During an <a class="link--external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJZgMbsHQzU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appearance</a> on <em>Geo TV</em> show ‘Capital Talk’ hosted by Hamid Mir, the defence minister defended his stance, saying that while the hike will not have a significant financial impact, it reflected poorly on the image of the ruling elite and the parliament.</p>
<p>He said the salary hike was approved by the National Assembly’s finance committee despite government resistance. When asked if the prime minister opposed the move, Asif said it was “logical” to assume so. He added that the salary increase was not included in the budget.</p>
<p>The defence minister said the ruling elite should practice austerity and simplicity, noting that the prime minister does not receive a salary and poses no burden on the exchequer. However, Asif defended the increased expenditures of the President’s House and PM’s Office.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916663">defended</a> the steep hikes in the salaries of parliamentarians.</p>
<p>During the post-budget press conference on Wednesday, he insisted the hikes should be seen in the context that the salaries were last adjusted in 2016, compared to annual increases in the wages of employees in public and private sectors in line with inflation and other factors.</p>
<p>“Had these been adjusted on an an­­n­ual basis, there would have been no sudden jump,” he said.</p>
<p>Senior PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique had earlier slammed the pay raise, calling it “incomprehensible” and lacking moral justification.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KhSaad_Rafique/status/1931430451916218602" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Rafique said: “A sudden increase of many times in the salaries of the Chairman Senate and Speaker National Assembly and a 50 per cent increase in allowance is an incomprehensible move.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Israel sent Mossad commandos deep into Iran to destroy Iranian weapons systems during Israel’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/tehran-intercepts-fresh-enemy-projectiles-hours-after-israeli-strikes-on-iranian-nuclear-missile-factories">attack</a> on nuclear and military targets, an Israeli security source said, while another official said Israel used a ploy to suggest the strike was not imminent.</p>
<p>The Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the clandestine nature of the operations, described secret and lengthy preparations that went into an attack that sent oil prices sharply higher on fears of regional escalation.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> could not independently verify the accounts.</p>
<p>Iranian officials who spoke to <em>Reuters</em> shortly before the attack had been dismissive about any imminent action and repeatedly said <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916888">talk of strikes</a> was just “psychological pressure” to influence US-Iranian nuclear <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">negotiations</a> that were due on Sunday.</p>
<p>Iran has not given a detailed account of what its Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called “unlawful and cowardly attacks”, but it has promised a harsh response. Iran’s mission at the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Israel’s covert operation and other subterfuge related to the attacks.</p>
<p>Ahead of the strike, Israel gave the impression its focus was still on US diplomacy towards a nuclear deal with Iran, briefing journalists that its spy chief would go to Washington before the next negotiations.</p>
<p>Instead, Israel said it sent 200 warplanes to conduct a wave of air strikes across Iran before dawn on Friday, hitting nuclear facilities and missile factories, and killing military commanders and nuclear scientists, in a culmination of its efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>Iran says its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913429">nuclear programme</a> is purely civilian.</p>
<p>The Israeli security source said Israel’s military and Mossad had worked for years on the intelligence needed for the strikes, which killed the commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps among others.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The security source said Mossad commandos had covertly deployed weapons across Iran, including explosive drones that were launched at a surface-to-surface missile base near Tehran.</p>
<p>The Mossad commandos also fired precision-guided weapons systems at Iranian surface-to-air missile systems as the Israeli attack got underway, reducing the threat to Israeli warplanes.</p>
<p>A grainy black and white video distributed by Mossad showed what it said was the organisation’s operational force — two camouflaged figures crouched in what looks like desert terrain, deploying the precision weapons system meant to destroy Iran’s air defence systems.</p>
<p>Some of the operation’s components would have taken years to be put together, said Sima Shine, a former chief Mossad analyst and now a researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS).</p>
<p>The decision to strike Iran was made on Monday, the same day Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump spoke by phone, when Netanyahu, Defence Minister Israel Katz and military chief Eyal Zamir decided the operation would begin on Friday, said a second source, an Israeli defence official.</p>
<p>Their discussion was held after the conversation between Trump and Netanyahu, a third official, close to Netanyahu, said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#press-briefings" id="press-briefings" title="Permalink"></a>Press briefings</h2>
<p>The final green light was given by Netanyahu’s security cabinet, which convened on Thursday night.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to the strikes, Israel played out a ploy to create the impression an attack was not imminent, according to a fourth source, also an Israeli official.</p>
<p>False reports suggesting that a rift between Israel and the United States had emerged during Netanyahu and Trump’s phone call on Monday were not denied, the fourth source said.</p>
<p>A press release about a visit by Katz, Zamir and the head of Israel’s Air Force Tomer Bar to an air force base mentioned Gaza, Yemen and Lebanon — but not Iran.</p>
<p>The fourth source said that the ruse included misleading information given in press briefings. As the attack unfolded in the early hours of Friday, some Israeli journalists pointed to one such briefing, according to which Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and Mossad Head David Barnea were to be sent to Washington ahead of the next round of nuclear talks on Sunday.</p>
<p>Dermer later appeared seated with Netanyahu at Israel’s defence headquarters bunker in Tel Aviv, in a video distributed by the prime minister’s office.</p>
<p>A fifth, military source said that Israel had been able to surprise Iran but since the operation was not over, there could be “difficult days” ahead.</p>
<p>Iran, which fired ballistic missiles at Israel when they traded blows last year, has promised “harsh punishment” in response to the attack. Israel said it had intercepted many of the 100 drones launched towards Israeli territory in retaliation.</p></p>
