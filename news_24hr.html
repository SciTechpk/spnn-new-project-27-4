            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will undertake an official visit to Beijing from May 19 to 22 to hold in-depth discussions with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability, a statement from the Foreign Office said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The visit comes as tensions remain high in the region following last week’s ceasefire between Pakistan and India after a tense military standoff over the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> in Occupied Kashmir — which India blamed on Pakistan without evidence.  On May 6–7, Indian air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir killed civilians, prompting Islamabad to shoot down <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909794/watch-paf-shares-locations-of-5-downed-indian-fighter-jets">five Indian jets.</a> After drone <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">interceptions</a> and airbase strikes, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">US intervention</a> on May 10 led to a ceasefire. India has maintained its aggressive stance, while Pakistan has warned against further escalation and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911473/islamabad-delhi-gained-nothing-but-miseries-from-wars-pm-shehbaz">offered dialogue</a>.</p>
<p>China had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586/china-reaffirms-support-for-pakistan-amid-escalation-with-india">reaffirmed</a> its support for Pakistan amid escalation with India in a meeting with President Asif Ali Zardari on May 5.</p>
<p>According to today’s statement, FM Dar will travel to China tomorrow (Monday) at the invitation of the Chinese FM Yi and will hold in-depth discussions there.</p>
<p>“The pair will discuss the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability,” the FO said.</p>
<p>“The two sides will also review the entire spectrum of Pakistan-China bilateral relations and exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest.”</p>
<p>It added that the visit was part of the ongoing high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China.</p>
<p>Pakistan has held strong bilateral relations with China which has supported it through many investments and development projects such as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884628">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> (CPEC), which was termed as a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855392">lifeline</a>” for the country’s economy.</p>
<p>In March, China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896697">extended</a> the repayment period of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1818228">$2 billion loan</a> to Pakistan by one year, offering much-needed financial relief and helping stabilise the country’s foreign exchange reserves.</p></p>

            <p><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has said Pakistan “will never bow down to Indian hegemony” as the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> with India holds.</p>
<p>“The truth is that India is not the US and Pakistan is not Afghanistan. India is not Israel and Pakistan is not Palestine. Pakistan will never be deterred. It can never be coerced.</p>
<p>“We will never bow down to Indian hegemony. The sooner they realise this, the better it will be for regional peace and the world,” Lt Gen Chaudhry <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/dunya/pakistan-ordu-sozcusu-chaudhry-aaya-konustu-asla-hint-hegemonyasina-boyun-egmeyecegiz/3572052" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> to <em>Anadolu Agency.</em></p>

<p>He argued that terrorism, extremism and hatred were India’s internal problems and that the New Delhi government was cracking down on groups including Muslims and Sikhs in the country, which was fuelling more anger, extremism and terrorism.</p>
<p>Earlier, the DG ISPR had said Pakistan is not a violent nation, reaffirming that the country’s top priority was peace as the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> with India holds.</p>
<p>New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating last month’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">strongly denied</a> the allegations and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>. As the situation turned into a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military confrontation</a> between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>“We are not a violent nation, we are a serious nation. Our first priority is peace,” Lt Gen Chaudhry told <em>RT Arabic</em> in an interview, according to <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1923968916050657408" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>PTV News</em></a>.</p>
<p>“Great and sensible powers like the United States understand better what the spirit of Pakistan’s people is,” he added.</p>

<p>Detailing the ceasefire process, the DG ISPR said the Indian defence ministry’s spokesperson “personally requested a ceasefire”. It was unclear if the request was made to the US, which acted as a mediator, or Pakistan.</p>
<p>“We desire peace and stability, so we said, why not?” the military spokesman was quoted as saying by <em>PTV News</em>.</p>
<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry hailed the “tremendous work” done by diplomats by “engaging the international community with great wisdom and in an extraordinary manner”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan, with great maturity, responded promptly, firmly and effectively, forcing the enemy to face reality,” the DG ISPR asserted, referring to the downing of five Indian air jets in response to New Delhi’s deadly strikes on the night of May 6-7.</p>
<p>On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, killing over 30 civilians. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a> and later also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepted</a> dozens of its <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drones</a>.</p>

<p>“The nation and the Pakistan armed forces stood united like an unbreakable wall,” he said.</p>
<p>Recalling the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">events of May 9-10</a>, when the tensions between the two neighbours reached their peak amid airstrikes, the DG ISPR stated: “The enemy fired more missiles on the night of May 9 and 10 to scare us. India forgot that Pakistan’s nation and its forces neither bow nor can be made to bow.</p>
<p>“On the morning of May 10, we responded, targeting only their military objectives with utmost responsibility and caution,” he added.</p>
<p>The military spokesperson stressed, “Not a single civilian target was harmed; it was an appropriate, just and balanced response.”</p>

<p>During his conversation reported by <em>PTV News</em>, Lt Gen Chaudhry emphasised that to understand the Pak-India tensions, it was “essential to look into its background”.</p>
<p>“India is hiding behind a false narrative to conceal the truth,” the ISPR official said. He noted that while the Indian media started blaming Pakistan “within minutes of the Pahalgam incident”, its foreign ministry spokesperson admitted two days later that the investigation was underway.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>“Where is the wisdom in making allegations without investigation and evidence?” Gen Chaudhry asked rhetorically.</p>
<p>He highlighted that the government had taken a clear stance that if there was any evidence, it should be given to an impartial institution, and Pakistan was ready to cooperate.</p>
<p>“India rejected this logical offer and, acting unilaterally, fired missiles at our mosques, martyring children, women, and elders,” the DG ISPR said.</p>
<p>“The sacred responsibility entrusted to the Pakistan armed forces is to protect the country’s sovereignty and borders,” Lt Gen Chaudhry stated, adding that forces had fulfilled the duty and would “continue to do so at all costs”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>The DG ISPR reiterated the military’s stance that India was “sponsoring terrorism in this region, particularly in Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“India is the real sponsor of ongoing terrorism in Pakistan, whether it is the <em>khawarij</em> or terrorist groups active in Balochistan,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said, referring to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) that the state refers to as <em><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna">Fitna Al Khawarij</a></em>.</p>
<p>Last month, the military’s chief spokesperson had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">detailed</a> that a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India was arrested in Punjab’s Jhelum.</p></p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday decided to send a “high-level diplomatic delegation to important world capitals to expose Indian propaganda” in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India, state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/18-05-2025/pakistan-to-send-diplomatic-delegation-to-expose-indian-propaganda-pm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between New Delhi and Islamabad came as tensions over last month’s Pahalgam attack continued to build up, as India —without evidence — blamed Pakistan for the attack. On the night of May 6-7, India launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting</a> drones sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat</a> strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns and declare a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911473/islamabad-delhi-gained-nothing-but-miseries-from-wars-pm-shehbaz">offered talks</a>.</p>
<p>In light of the situation, PM Shehbaz decided to send a high-level diplomatic delegation to important world capitals to counter Indian propaganda related to the escalation and the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>“In a telephonic conversation with Chairman Pakistan People’s Party Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the prime minister has entrusted the leadership of the delegation to him,” the report said.</p>
<p>The delegation comprises Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Senator Sherry Rehman, Hina Rabbani Khar, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua and Jalil Abbas Jilani, it added.</p>
<p>“The delegation will visit London, Washington, Paris, and Brussels to highlight India’s disinformation campaign and its attempts to destabilise regional peace,” the report added.</p>
<p>“It will also underscore Pakistan’s sincere efforts for peace and stability in the region.”</p>
<p>Yesterday, former foreign minister Bilawal, in a post on X, announced that he was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911617/pm-tasks-bilawal-with-presenting-pakistans-case-for-peace-on-global-arena?_gl=1*syx5iw*_ga*NTVFQWNLM2RPd1F0dFhZamlxZVQ1dllmVVBkVmdDVjQySUt0QUZ5Wll5MjQwUTFvMjIwT1Vic2txUUdmZzRoSg..*_ga_C521GRS8DF*MTc0NzU2ODE3MC4xNy4wLjE3NDc1NjgxNzAuMC4wLjA.">appointed</a> by the premier to “lead a delegation to present Pakistan’s case for peace on the international stage”.</p>
<p>“I am honoured to accept this responsibility and remain committed to serving Pakistan in these challenging times,” he wrote.</p>
