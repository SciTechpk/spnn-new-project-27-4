                <h2>12th body swept away in Swat River flash flood recovered from Charsadda</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The body of a child who was swept away in the Swat River on Friday has been recovered from Charsadda, rescue officials said on Sunday, making this the 12th body recovered from the incident.</p>
<p>At least 19 people have been killed and six others injured in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa amid heavy rains and the consequent flash floods and landslides, according to data from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).</p>
<p>KP Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Bilal Faizi said the child‚Äôs body was recovered from Charsadda and shifted to a hospital.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe will be shifted to his native area in an ambulance,‚Äù Faizi said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOne person remains missing and a search operation is underway.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to Faizi, a total of 17 people were reported missing on Friday when torrential flash floods triggered by heavy rains affected several areas in Swat and Malakand divisions.</p>
<p>Four people were rescued, while 11 bodies had been recovered. Today, a 12th body was recovered, leaving one person who remains missing.</p>
<p>Separately, the body of a young man who drowned in a flooded river in Lower Dir two days ago has been recovered in Charsadda, according to Faizi.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe rescue team had been conducting continuous search operations for the past two days, after which the body was found,‚Äù Faizi said.</p>
<p>In yet another incident, two youth drowned in the Indus River in Balyani Akazai in KP‚Äôs Hazara division.</p>
<p>According to rescue spokesperson Rabnawaz Yousufzai, one youth jumped into the river to cool off from the heat. A second youth saw him drowning and jumped in to rescue him, but both were swept away by the strong current.</p>
<p>A third youth also jumped in to save his companions but was unsuccessful and barely managed to return to the river bank.</p>
<p>Following the incident, locals are helping search for the missing bodies.</p>

            </a>
            <p><p>Israel‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/920700">attack</a> on the Evin prison in Iran‚Äôs capital, Tehran on June 23 killed 71 people, Iranian judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir said on Sunday.</p>
<p>At the end of an air war with Iran, Israel struck Tehran‚Äôs jail for political prisoners, in a demonstration that it was expanding its targets beyond military, civilian and nuclear sites to aim at symbols of Iran‚Äôs ruling system. According to Iranian health ministry figures, 610 people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920790">killed</a> on the Iranian side in the 12-day war, 13 of them children and 49 women, before a ceasefire went into effect last week.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the attack on Evin prison, 71 people were martyred, including administrative staff, youth doing their military service, detainees, family members of detainees who were visiting them and neighbours who lived in the prison‚Äôs vicinity,‚Äù Jahangir said in remarks carried on the judiciary‚Äôs news outlet <em>Mizan</em>.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Jahangir had previously said that part of Evin prison‚Äôs administrative building had been damaged in the attack, and people were killed and injured. The judiciary added that the remaining detainees had been transferred to other prisons in Tehran province.</p>
<p>Evin prison holds a number of foreign nationals, including two French citizens detained for three years.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe strike targeting Evin prison in Tehran, put our citizens Cecile Kohler and Jacques Paris in danger. It is unacceptable,‚Äù France‚Äôs Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot had said on social media X after the attack.</p>
