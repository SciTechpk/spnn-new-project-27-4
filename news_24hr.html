            <p><p>Over 200 trapped tourists have been rescued in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer district after flash floods triggered by heavy rain swept through the district, the local government spokesperson said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued a landslide alert amid floods triggered by heavy rains.</p>
<p>A day ago, at least four tourists were killed, two others injured, and 15 went missing due to the floods in GB’s Babusar area in Diamer district. The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge have become more visible in GB as cloudburst-induced floods wreaked havoc across the region.</p>
<p>The provincial government spokesperson, Faizullah Faraq, said in a statement,  “More than 200 rescued tourists have been shifted to Chilas and provided shelter in hotels and guest houses.”</p>
<p>He added that the tourists were now able to contact their families after being stranded for hours.</p>
<p>Faraq detailed that rescue operations were still underway to look for missing tourists, while the deceased ones have been identified.</p>
<p>“The military is participating in the rescue operation and evacuating tourists to safer places,” he said, adding that helicopters will be brought in for rescue, if necessary,“ he said in the statement.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, the GB govt spokesperson said, “Babusar road was still blocked due to heavy mud on the road, but authorities have been instructed to reach the area”.</p>
<p>On Monday, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abdul Hameed told <em>Dawn</em> that 20 to 30 tourists from different parts of the country might be missing.</p>
<p>According to rescue authorities in Skardu’s WhatsApp channel, three people were injured due to the flood in Sadpara, while the deluge has also hit the Kharmang district.</p>
<p>“The rescue operation was launched again at 6am today,” <em>AFP</em> reported the spokesperson as saying.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, spokesperson for the Baltistan Division Police Department Ghulam Muhammad said in a statement that “In Deosai, 413 tourist vehicles were stranded on the road connecting Sapara and Deosai, after it was closed at ten different points due to the floods.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson said, “Heavy rain in Skardu triggered flash floods in Barge Nullah, Dhagyol Nullah and Shagri Bala Nullah on the outskirts of the city.”</p>
<p>“The flood water entered homes and caused severe damage to public infrastructure and crops,” he added.</p>
<p>According to his statement, the stranded people have been rescued by the police and shifted to Skardu in the morning after the damaged roads were restored overnight.</p>
<p>Outlining the damage, the GB govt spokesperson said that “more than 50 houses have been damaged in the flood since yesterday.”</p>
<p>In Babusar, a wheat depot, a girls’ school, a police checkpoint, a tourism police shelter, and four bridges have been washed away, while two mosques and a windmill have also been damaged.“</p>
<p>A local social worker, Muhammad Ali, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that, “Thirty vehicles were swept away by the floods, and most people have been rescued by the locals.”</p>
<p>Faraq shared that construction has begun on the restoration of highways and connecting roads, after the floods damaged a portion of the Karakoram Highway (KKH), leaving thousands of tourists and passengers stranded on both sides.</p>

            <p><p>At least five people, including children, lost their lives in rain-related incidents across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swat district on Monday as torrential rains triggered flash floods and landslides in various parts of the region.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning. According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), at least 180 people have been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925323">killed</a> and more than 500 injured since the rains began early in July.</p>
<p>According to Rescue 1122 spokesperson Shafiqa Gul, a woman and her two sons drowned while attempting to cross a stream in the Sur Dherai area of Malam Jabba.</p>
<p>“The mother, holding her 10-month-old baby in her arms, was trying to guide her seven-year-old son across the stream when a flash flood struck. In the chaos, she lost control, and the child in her arms was swept away,” Gul said.</p>
<p>Rescue teams, along with locals, launched a search and rescue operation and recovered the bodies after hours of coordinated effort.</p>
<p>In a separate incident in Gujar Band Shanko area of Madyan, a house collapsed due to heavy rainfall, claiming the lives of three children and seriously injuring a woman.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the emergency call, Rescue 1122 teams rushed to the scene and retrieved the victims from the rubble with assistance from local volunteers, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>They were later taken to the Civil Hospital Madyan, where the injured woman was placed under critical care.</p>
<p>Authorities have issued advisories urging residents, particularly those living in mountainous or low-lying areas, to exercise extreme caution during the ongoing monsoon season.</p>
<p>The district administration said it was closely monitoring weather patterns and has mobilised emergency services to respond to any further incidents caused by the relentless rains.</p>

<p>A new spell of monsoon rains on Monday hit several parts of the province, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1925692">damaging</a> houses and crops and suspending traffic.</p>
<p>The high flood in Chitral River triggered by the fast melting of glaciers washed six houses and a large chunk of the farmlands of Junali Koch village near Booni town.</p>
<p>In Yarkhon Valley of Upper Chitral, heavy rains wreaked havoc in Arakhan village in Mirgram and severely damaged dozens of houses. According to residents of the affected villages, a large number of livestock were washed away by the flash floods.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Chitral River was flooded, leaving houses and infrastructure in Ayunand and other low-lying areas of Lower Chitral at risk of damage.</p>
<p>In Bajaur tribal district, authorities closed the Jar Bypass Road, which connects the district to the rest of the country via the main Bajaur-Munda Road, to traffic after heavy rains triggered flooding.</p>
<p>District authorities urged people to use Khar-Qazfi Bypass Road to avoid any potential incidents. Rescue 1122 stated that rescuers have been deployed to deal with any emergency eventuality.</p>
<p>The downpour damaged road infrastructure and bridges in some areas and caused suspension of traffic on Darra Tang Road. Goods and public transport vehicles travelling between KP and Punjab were stranded, adding to the troubles of transporters and commuters.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925842/visiting-the-us-will-soon-require-a-250-visa-integrity-fee-says-report' target='_blank'><strong>Visiting the US will soon require a $250 ‘visa integrity fee’, says report</strong></a>
            <p><p>The United States will soon require international visitors to pay a “visa integrity fee” of at least $250, a new addition to existing visa application costs, according to a provision in the Trump administration’s recently enacted domestic policy bill, <em>CNN</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/07/21/travel/visa-integrity-fee-usa-international-travelers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the fiscal year 2024, the US issued nearly 11 million non-immigrant visas according to the State Department. These encompass international students, many leisure and business travellers and other temporary visitors.</p>
<p>The new fee will apply to all visitors requiring non-immigrant visas to enter the US. This does not include tourists and business travellers from countries that are included in the Visa Waiver Programme — including Australia and many European countries — that do not need visas for stays of 90 days or less.</p>
<p>The fee is to be paid at the time visas are issued. Although there will be no fee waivers for the payment, the provision states that travellers who comply with the terms of their visa can have the fee reimbursed after their trip.</p>
<p>Houston-based Reddy Neumann Brown PC law firm’s immigration attorney, Steven A. Brown, said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.rnlawgroup.com/new-immigration-fees-coming-soon-what-employers-and-foreign-nationals-need-to-know/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a>, “The intent behind this refund provision is to incentivise compliance with US immigration laws by treating the $250 as a refundable security deposit — essentially rewarding those who follow the rules.”</p>
<p>However, he added that the refund is not automatic and that “the burden will likely fall on the visa holder to prove compliance” in an as-yet-undefined refund application process.</p>
<p>“Until those procedures are announced, employers and foreign nationals should treat the $250 visa integrity fee as a non-refundable upfront cost and plan accordingly. If a refund becomes viable in the future, it may provide an added benefit — but for now, it remains a theoretical incentive awaiting implementation guidelines.”</p>
<p>In an email to <em>CNN</em>, Brown noted that the purpose of the fee was unclear, saying that in general, immigration fees were meant to cover adjudication or issuance expenses, but that theoretically, all visa integrity fees could be refunded in a “perfect world” with no overstays or violations.</p>
<p>No specific information has been provided by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding the refund process or other aspects of the policy, including when it will be rolled out.</p>
<p>“The visa integrity fee requires cross-agency coordination before implementation,” a DHS spokesperson told <em>CNN</em>.</p>
<p>A State Department spokesperson said that details of the change, implemented by DHS, would be posted on the State Department’s visa information page.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said that the purpose of the fee was to “support the administration’s priorities of strengthening immigration enforcement, deterring visa overstays, and funding border security.”</p>
<p>The initial fee for the 2025 fiscal year has been outlined as either $250 or “such amount as the Secretary of Homeland Security may establish, by rule”, whichever amount is greater. The fee is subject to annual adjustments for inflation.</p>
<p>The bill provision added that fees that were not reimbursed would be “deposited into the general fund of the treasury”.</p>
<p>The US Travel Association, a nonprofit organisation, called the new visa fee “a giant leap backwards” despite praising other aspects of the domestic policy bill.</p>
<p>The senior vice president of government relations for the association, Erik Hansen, said in a statement that the fee “adds an unnecessary financial barrier for international visitors”.</p>
<p>The association calculated that the fee would boost the upfront costs of visiting the US by 144pc.</p>
<p>“Even if it is technically reimbursable, the added complexity and cost will discourage visitors,” Hansen said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the CEO of the association, Geoff Freeman, called the fee a “foolish” move that undercut otherwise smart investments in travel infrastructure and security, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/sharedSummary/index.jsp?briefId=AB0D8A3F-84BA-40EA-8CB6-1A293ED34E23&amp;issueId=BB53E14D-A811-4219-A0F0-6F4558FFFE0E&amp;copyId=3E93DFED-1F84-4335-BD62-2484214733CB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on US Travel SmartBrief.</p>
<p>He argued that imposing new costs on travellers “undermines efforts to attract international visitors and support the US economy”, the statement said.</p></p>
