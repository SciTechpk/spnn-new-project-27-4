            <p><p>• Steps up efforts to ensure two-month flour reserves in vulnerable regions<br />
• Food depots being relocated from exposed areas to safer zones<br />
• Officials asked to develop contingency plans to ensure uninterrupted food supply</p>
<p>MUZAFFARABAD: The Food Department of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) has accelerated efforts to replenish wheat flour stocks in vulnerable areas along the Line of Control (LoC), amid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war">heightened tensions</a> with India and fears of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">possible incursion</a> from across the divide.</p>
<p>In snowbound and remote areas of AJK — many of which lie adjacent to the LoC — the Food Department traditionally stocks specially treated wheat flour with an extended shelf life to sustain local populations from December through May. In comparatively safer areas, routine storage is limited to a 15-day supply due to easier accessibility.</p>
<p>However, in response to fresh directives from AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, the department has begun increasing reserves in forward locations to meet the needs of residents for at least two months.</p>
<p>“In accordance with the prime minister’s instructions, we have launched an intensive operation to ensure wheat flour stocks are available for a full two months in the entire LoC belt,” AJK’s Minister for Food Chaudhry Akbar Ibrahim told <em>Dawn</em>.</p>
<p>He said the government was simultaneously working on relocating food depots from areas exposed to potential shelling or military activity to relatively safer zones without disrupting access for residents.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The minister added that he had also instructed officials to prepare contingency plans to maintain uninterrupted food supply chains to vulnerable settlements, especially those that were frequently cut off during winter or during episodes of Indian shelling.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the AJK premier had informed the Legislative Assembly that he had constituted a special ‘Emergency Response Fund’ with an initial allocation of Rs1 billion.</p>
<p>The fund would cater to urgent needs such as replenishment of wheat flour, procurement of lifesaving medicines, and provision of other essential services in the 13 constituencies situated along the volatile LoC, spanning six districts — Neelum, Jhelum Valley, Haveli, Poonch, Kotli and Bhimber.</p>
<p>When contacted, AJK Food Department Director Abdul Hameed Kiani said sufficient wheat flour stocks had already been secured in all depots along the LoC.</p>
<p>“However, in light of the prime minister’s instructions and the uncertain situation, we are now increasing our storage capacity to meet a two-month demand,” he said.</p>
<p>“All contractors engaged by the department have been mobilised to use the maximum number of vehicles to deliver wheat flour in the shortest possible time,” he said, adding that department officials were supervising dispatches directly — both at the flour mills and in the delivery zones.</p>
<p>According to Mr Kiani, nearly 70 per cent of the target had so far been achieved.</p>
<p>On Saturday, around 250 tonnes of flour were dispatched from a single mill on the outskirts of Muzaffarabad.</p>
<p>Food Inspector Syed Zawar Haider, who was overseeing operations at the mill, said the consignments were being sent to various parts of Neelum Valley and forward areas of Jhelum Valley district.</p>
<p>“We are executing the task without interruption and expect to complete the operation within the next two days,” he said.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908279/high-value-target-among-7-terrorists-killed-in-kp' target='_blank'><strong>‘High-value target’ among 7 ‘terrorists’ killed in KP</strong></a>
            <p><p>PESHAWAR: Seven terrorists, including a high-value target, were killed and two other militants were arrested in separate encounters in Khyber Pak­htunkhwa (KP), official sources said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Also, a security official embraced martyrdom in a bomb attack on a convoy of security forces.</p>
<p>In separate clashes bet­ween security agencies and militants, two terrorists were killed in North Wazir­istan, three were shot dead in Bajaur, while two others were gunned down in retaliation by police after they atta­cked a security post on Bannu-Dera Ismail Khan Road in Lakki Marwat district.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908178/security-forces-kill-5-terrorists-arrest-2-in-kp-operations-ispr">Five terrorists</a>, including a high-value target, were killed and two others, inc­luding one wanted by po­l­ice, were arrested in sep­arate operations carried out by security forces in KP on April 30 and May 1, according to a statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the military’s media wing.</p>
<p>The ISPR said during an intelligence-based operation (IBO), troops effectively engaged militants’ hideout in Bajaur. In an intense exchange of fire between security forces and terrorists, a high-value target, Fareedullah, and two other terrorists were neutralised.</p>
<p>In the Dossali area of North Waziristan district, security forces killed two terrorists during an IBO, according to the ISPR.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>It added that troops successfully busted a hideout of terrorists during a third encounter with militants in Mohmand district and arrested two of them. One of them was later identified as Lal Ameer alias Ibrahim, who was wanted by the police for his active role in terror activities.</p>
<p>Security forces seized weapons, ammunition and explosives from the terrorists, according to the ISPR.</p>
<p>The military’s media wing said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area.</p>
<p><strong>Security official martyred</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, a security official was martyred in an explosion in the Garhiom area on the outskirts of South and North Waziristan districts on Saturday, sources said.</p>
<p>An improvised explosive device went off near a convoy of the security forces, the sources said, adding that the explosion claimed the life of a security official.</p>
<p>A curfew was later imposed in the area due to security concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Two killed in Lakki</strong></p>
<p>In Lakki Marwat district, a security checkpoint near Gandi Chowk on Bannu-D.I. Khan Road came under attack at 2am on Saturday, prompting the police to retaliate, officials said.</p>
<p>A heavy gunfire panicked locals as some of them came out of their houses to assist the police.</p>
<p>“The militants used light and heavy weapons in a bid to take over the police post building, but failed as police fought gallantly forcing them to retreat under the cover of fire,” the officials said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>A rocket shell fired by the terrorists hit and damaged the main gate and the boundary wall of the police post, they said, adding that an area resident, Ahmad Khan, who along with others had come out of his house to assist police, lost his life in the ambush.</p>
<p>“A police official, Naseer Khan, and a watchman of a local market, Mujeebur Rehman, were also injured and taken to nearby hospital,” officials maintained, adding an effective response by law enforcers forced the militants to flee the place.</p>
<p>After the attack, a large contingent of police led by SP Investigation Murad Khan Wazir and backed by armoured personnel carriers reached the area and launched a search for the assailants.</p>
<p>Subsequently, police surrounded some militants hiding the forest locally called ‘darga’, near Shah Tora, Takhtikhel area of Lakki Marwat. After a fierce gun battle, two of them were killed, police said, adding that advanced weapons including M-4 rifles and 9MM pistols were seized from the area.</p>
<p>Later, Bannu RPO Sajjad Khan visited the site, met police personnel and praised them for repelling the attack bravely.</p>
<p>Bannu DPO Saleem Abbas Kulachi and SP Wazir accompanied him.</p>
<p>Mr Khan said the cops stood against the menace firmly and thwarted the malicious designs of militants.</p>
<p><strong>President, PM hail forces</strong></p>
<p>Later, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded security forces for operations against terrorists in North Waziristan and Bajaur.</p>
<p>The president reiterated the resolve of continuing actions against terrorists and appreciated the security forces’ operations for eliminating these elements.</p>
<p>He said their determination for the eradication of terrorism and the defence of the motherland was resolute.</p>
<p>The prime minister said that they would continue foiling the nefarious designs of the enemies of humanity.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also reaffirmed continuing the fight against terrorism till its complete elimination from the country.</p>
<p><strong>Funeral</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, funeral prayers were offered for a martyred police official, Imranullah, at the Iqbal Shaheed police lines with full state honour.</p>

<p>Imranullah of the counterterrorism department of police was seriously injured in an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907814">armed clash with terrorists</a> in the Domel Chashmi area of Bannu district on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>He remained under treatment at a local hospital but his condition deteriorated after which he was being shifted to a hospital in Peshawar when he breathed his last.</p>
<p>His body was later shifted to Bannu where RPO Sajjad Khan, DPO Saleem Abbas Kulachi, SP CTD Fazal Wahid and other police officials attended his funeral.</p>
<p><strong>Arrests</strong></p>
<p>Also on Saturday, police claimed to have arrested scores of suspects and anti-state elements during an operation and snap checking in Bannu and Lakki Marwat district.</p>
<p>“The offensives were launched after a surge in militant attacks on police installations in both southern districts,” officials said.</p>

            <p><p>LONDON: A large pro-Pakistan demonstration was held on Saturday outside the Indian High Commission in Aldwych, London, under the aegis of Pakistan Muslim League-N’s UK chapter.</p>
<p>The protest came in the wake of the deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam, Occupied Kashmir, which left <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a> dead and reignited <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907785/any-military-misadventure-by-india-will-be-met-with-swift-resolute-notch-up-response-coas">tensions</a> between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>India has accused Pakistan of involvement in the attack, an allegation Islamabad has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">firmly denied</a>, instead calling for an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">independent</a> and impartial investigation into the incident.</p>
<p>Waving Pakistan flags and placards, demonstrators chanted slogans including, “Gen Asim Munir <em>Zindabad</em>”, “Pakistan <em>Zindabad</em>”, “Kashmir belongs to Pakistan” and “We condemn Indian terrorism”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The protesters also denounced India Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Hindutva ideology, with chants of “Modi is terrorist” and “Down with Hindutva ideology” echoing through the streets.</p>
<p>PML-N UK President Ahsan Dar addressed the protesters, saying:“ This huge show is a reflection of the sentiment Pakistani overseas have for their motherland. Today, Pakistanis from across the UK have gathered outside India House to express their support for the civilian and military leadership of Pakistan.</p>
<p>He added that India had hastily blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack without presenting any evidence. “It’s clear this was a false flag operation aimed at maligning Pakistan.”</p>
<p>Dar also highlighted the unity among the diaspora community. “We countered Indian protesters on April 25 in large numbers. We are glad that activists of PTI, PML-N and other parties joined us against Indian aggression. The whole nation is united.”</p>
<p>The demonstration remained peaceful but drew significant attention from passersby and local media.</p>
<p>London Police maintained a visible presence to ensure order.</p>
