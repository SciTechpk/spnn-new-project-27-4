            <p><p>US President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810">tariffs</a> are increasingly clogging up the wheels of a world economy which for decades were greased by predictable and relatively free trade.</p>
<p>Big-name multinationals, right down to niche e-commerce players last week cut sales targets, warned of job cuts and reviewed their business plans, while major economies revised down growth prospects amid bleak data read-outs.</p>
<p>While financial markets are betting that US and China will pull back from an all-out trade war and that Trump will cut deals to avert higher tariffs on others, the sheer uncertainty of where this ends has become a major drag factor in itself.</p>
<p>“US tariff policy is a serious negative shock for the world in the near term,” said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, group chief economist at French bank BNP Paribas.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>“The US tariffs end-game may be further away and at a higher level than previously thought,” she said of blanket US tariffs currently set at a baseline of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901770/trump-unveils-sweeping-liberation-day-tariffs">10 per cent</a> alongside higher, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891039">sector-specific</a> charges on products such as steel, aluminium and autos.</p>
<p>Beijing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907942">said</a> on Friday it was evaluating an offer from Washington to hold talks over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903391">145pc</a> US tariffs, to which it has responded with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903545">125pc</a> levies. Trump’s administration has also suggested it is close to deals with countries including India, South Korea and Japan to avert more tariffs in weeks to come.</p>
<p>In the meantime, companies such as Swedish appliances maker Electrolux  slashed its outlook while Volvo Cars, computer gadget maker Logitech and drinks giant Diageo abandoned their targets on the uncertainty.</p>
<p>Last week’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908122">removal</a> of the “de minimis” duty-free treatment of e-commerce packages worth less than $800 for products from China is a hammer-blow for many smaller players.</p>
<p>“We’re going from zero to 145pc, which is really untenable for companies and untenable for customers,” said Cindy Allen, CEO of Trade Force Multiplier, a global trade consultancy.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen a lot of small to medium-sized businesses just choose to exit the market altogether.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#silver-lining" id="silver-lining" title="Permalink"></a>Silver lining</h2>
<p>The tariff outlook prompted the Bank of Japan to cut its growth forecasts last week, while trade tensions were cited by forecasters in growth outlook downgrades for the Netherlands and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.</p>
<p>While the official measures of activity in top economies are still catching up with the downbeat mood, it is surfacing in the closely-watched surveys of purchasing managers at factories around the world.</p>
<p>China’s factory activity contracted at the fastest pace in 16 months in April, one such survey showed last week, while a similar UK readout showed British factory exports last month shrinking at their sharpest pace in almost five years.</p>
<p>Economists were quick to caution that a stronger-looking read-out from export-focused Germany might largely be due to factories front-loading business to get it out of the door before the tariffs took effect.</p>
<p>“[This] means that there might be a backlash in the coming months,” warned Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank AG.</p>
<p>However, while front-loading may also have helped India to a 10-month high in manufacturing growth in April, analysts noted the country — which faces lower tariffs than China and towards which Apple has shifted some output — could end up a genuine winner.</p>
<p>“India is well positioned to be an alternative to China as a supplier of goods to the US in the immediate term,” emerging markets economist Shilan Shah at Capital Economics said, predicting punitive tariffs on China were “here to stay”.</p>
<p>For now, most economists are calling the Trump tariff gambit a “demand shock” to the world economy, which by making imports more expensive for American businesses and consumers, will sap activity elsewhere.</p>
<p>The silver lining could be that this reduces inflationary pressures and so will give central banks elsewhere greater scope to boost the economy with interest rate cuts — something the Bank of England is seen taking advantage of this week.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>But what is yet to play out is whether Trump’s bid to re-balance the trading system in America’s favour finally prompts others to revamp their own economies: for example, if China moves to raise stimulus for its domestic economy, or euro zone countries remove the barriers that still hold back their single market.</p></p>

            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: All mainstream political parties, except PTI, on Sunday vowed that Pakistan would give a robust response to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907663">India</a> if it resorted to any ‘misadventure’ against the backdrop of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam incident</a>, in which 26 civilians were gunned down.</p>
<p>The political leaders made this pledge during an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908387/dg-ispr-says-armed-forces-ready-to-give-befitting-reply-to-enemys-aggression-state-media">in-camera briefing</a> by the civil and military leadership on Sunday, in which the army spokesperson apprised the mainstream political parties about the latest situation in the region and the preparedness of the country’s armed forces to avert any misadventure by the neighbouring country.</p>
<p>The in-camera briefing was given by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar. However, the main opposition party, PTI, did not attend the huddle.</p>
<p>A source privy to the huddle proceedings told <em>Dawn</em> that the political parties were of the view that they stood by the armed forces to foil any attempt by India to spoil regional peace. Before the briefing, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the main objective of the huddle was to get feedback from the political forces in light of tensions with India.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Participants told India wanted to divert water, intensify Kashmir oppression using Pahalgam</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another source told <em>Dawn</em> that the participants were briefed about how India “prepared and implemented its false flag operation” in Pahalgam. The meeting was informed that India could not sell its narrative to the world and that Pakistan’s stance had emerged stronger in the aftermath of the attack. The participants were also apprised of the preparedness of the armed forces to foil any kind of misadventure by India.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Senator Muhammad Abdul Qadir, who attended the briefing, said that the meeting was informed about how and why India conducted the attack in Pahalgam. Senator Qadir said, as per information shared with the political leaders, the primary objective of the operation was to further divert Indus water, intensify aggression in held Kashmir, and camouflage Indian terrorism with the help of the Afghan Taliban.</p>
<p>With the help of video clips, the participants were given a briefing about Indian involvement in terrorism in Pakistan, especially Balochistan, he added.</p>
<p>PPP leaders Raja Pervez Ashraf, Qamar Zaman Kaira, and Shazia Marri; PML-N’s Barrister Aqeel and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Tallal Chaudhry; PM’s aide Pervez Khattak; MQM-P’s Farooq Sattar; and Kashmiri leader Shah Ghulam Qadir, among others, were in attendance.</p>
<p>Tension between the two nuclear states escalated soon after the Pahalgam attack in which 26 tourists were killed on April 22.</p>
<p>Soon after the attack, India blamed Pakistan for being involved in the attack. On the other hand, Pakistan termed the attack a false flag operation by India and called for a neutral probe.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908493/cotton-prices-witness-surge-courtesy-international-market' target='_blank'><strong>Cotton prices witness surge, courtesy international market</strong></a>
            <p><p>LAHORE: After a hiatus of nearly two months, cotton prices in the country have witnessed a significant upswing, accompanied by a renewed purchasing interest from textile mills.</p>
<p>This development has brought relief to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907884">cotton ginners</a> are grappling with a prolonged period of low demand and declining prices.</p>
<p>The recent slump in local cotton prices was primarily due to record imports of sales tax-free cotton, cotton yarn and grey cloth under the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS). This influx of imported material severely hampered local cotton sales, pushing numerous ginning factories and textile mills towards inactivity due to a severe financial crunch.</p>
<p>However, the tide seems to have turned in the past week. Reports of restored trade relations between China and the United States, coupled with a sharp decline in the US Dollar Index, triggered a substantial surge in cotton prices in international markets. Notably, the New York Cotton Exchange saw its July futures contract jump by a record 2.75 cents per pound in a single day, reaching a multi-month high of 68.41 cents per pound.</p>
<p>The upward trend is expected to continue this week, subsequently impacting domestic prices.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, this global rally has translated into a price increase of approximately Rs500 per maund (40kg), bringing the current cotton price to around Rs17,500 per maund. The renewed buying interest from textile mills has instilled a sense of optimism among cotton ginners.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, despite a consistent failure to achieve cotton cultivation and production targets in recent years, the Federal Committee on Agriculture (FCA) has, once again, set an ambitious and seemingly unattainable production target of 10.18 million bales for the Cotton Year 2025-26. For the first time, however, the FCA has not yet specified the production targets for individual provinces.</p>
