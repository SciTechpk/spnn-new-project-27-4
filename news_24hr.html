<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz said Pakistan came out of the crisis with India as victorious because of the “brave actions of our outstanding armed forces, strongly supported by the people of Pakistan”.</p>
<p>He added, “We want peace and will work for peace in the region thro­ugh talks on the table and resolve our outstanding iss­ues, including the Kash­mir dispute, according to the United Nations Secu­rity Council resolutions, which were acknowledged even by the Indian Lok Sabha when Nehru was the prime minister of India.”</p>
<p>He said Pakistan is ready to talk for the sake of peace on different issues, including water, trade and counterterrorism, “if India is serious”. However, he reaffirmed that if India remained aggressive, Pakistan would defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
<p>The prime minister said he had a productive and useful meeting with the Iranian president, covering all areas of mutual interest and cooperation.</p>

<p>“There was total agreement that the two brotherly neighbouring countries must enhance cooperation in diverse fields, including trade, investment and economy,” he added.</p>
<p>Stressing that Pakistan and Iran had deep-rooted cultural and historical relations, he said, “We have decided to transform these relations into a very productive cooperation in various fields of life.”</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also thanked the Iranian president for calling him and showing his concern on the evolving situation in the subcontinent a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>“I deeply appreciate your concern and brotherly feelings for the people of Pakistan and your ardent desire that this crisis comes to a grinding halt instead of escalating further,” he told the president.</p>
<p><strong>Israeli actions condemned</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz said Pakistan condemned Israeli actions causing untold misery for the people of Gaza, where Israel murdered more than 50,000 Palestinians, and the bloodshed continues.</p>
<p>“It is high time that the international community used its influence to bring a lasting ceasefire in Palestine. Pakistan stands by its brothers and sisters in Iran to promote peace, progress and prosperity,” he said.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan fully supported Iran’s right to have a civilian nuclear programme. He assured that Pakistan would work with Iran on all issues of mutual concern.</p>
<p>The Iranian president stressed that Pakistan and Iran shared a common stance on important regional and international issues on different platforms, including the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).</p>
<p>President Pezeshkian said the two countries should cooperate on making their borders secure from the activities of terrorists and criminal groups.</p>
<p>“Peace and stability in Pakistan are in the interest of Iran. We believe that sustaining security and maintaining friendly and peaceful relations with neighbouring countries is in the interest of the two countries,” he added.</p>
<p>He said Iran welcomed the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, adding that settling issues through dialogue was essential for stability in the region.</p>
<p>“We believe that to ensure security and stability in the region, neighbouring countries should hold dialogue and have positive consultations with each other and the international partners,” he added.</p>
<p>He said the two sides discussed issues facing the Islamic world and the top priority was the issue of Palestine.</p>
<p>“As always, we support the cause of Palestine and condemn the atrocities carried out by Israel,” he added.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to Prime Minister Tariq Fatimi accompanied the prime minister.</p>
<p><strong>PM meets Khamenei</strong></p>
<p>Later, Prime Minister Shehbaz made a courtesy call to Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran.</p>

<p>According to the PM Office, the prime minister briefed the supreme leader about the recent conflict with India and its hegemonistic and revisionist designs. He thanked the Iranian leadership for supporting Pakistan against Indian aggression.</p>
<p>The premier underlined that Pakistan always desired peace to prevail in the region leading to economic development and prosperity.</p>

            <p><p>• Govt activates emergency protocols; orders desilting of waterways<br />
• PDMA calls for standardised fitting of solar panels to withstand inclement weather<br />
• Official says 70pc deaths resulted from falling solar panels</p>
<p>LAHORE: Heavy rain and thunderstorms are set to batter Punjab, days after similar weather <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913072">killed</a> around 20 people across the province.</p>
<p>The Provincial Disaster Man­agement Authority (PDMA) Punjab has issued a province-wide alert of severe weather from today (Tuesday).</p>
<p>A westerly wave combined with moist currents is likely to bring intense windstorms, thu­nderstorms, and heavy rainfall across the region from May 27 to 31, said the Met department forecast.</p>
<p>Upper and central Punjab districts, including Rawal­pi­ndi, Murree, Galliyat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mianwali, Sargodha, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Sialkot, Narowal, Okara, Lahore, Faisalabad, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Gujranwala, Gujrat and Sheikhupura will experience heavy rains with hailstorms and lightning from the evening of May 27 through May 31.</p>
<p>Southern districts of DG Khan, Rajanpur, Multan, Bhakkar, Layyah, Bahawalpur, Sahiwal, Pakpattan and Vehari are expected to receive light to moderate rain and thunderstorms during the same period.</p>
<p>The authorities warned people to stay away from loose stru­ctures, including electric poles, trees, vehicles and solar panels during thunderstorms and stay indoors as much as possible.</p>
<p>The warning was issued as a PDMA assessment showed 70pc of casualties during the thunderstorm three days ago were caused by falling solar panels which were not installed properly.</p>
<p><strong>Emergency protocols</strong></p>
<p>In light of the fresh forecast, the Punjab government has activated emergency protocols across all districts.</p>
<p>The district administrations and all relevant departments, including health, education, irrigation, local government and Rescue 1122, have been put on alert to maintain round-the-clock staffing at emergency operation centres.</p>
<p>The provincial cabinet committee on disaster management also convened an emergency meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>Health Minister Khawaja Salman Rafiq chaired the mee­ting attended by senior officials and divisional commissioners.</p>
<p>The meeting focused on a comprehensive five-point age­nda to strengthen the province’s response to the upcoming monsoon season.</p>
<p>PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia briefed the committee on the relief body’s preparations. The commissioners and deputy commissioners shared progress reports on ongoing desilting of waterways and mock emergency exercises.</p>
<p>Mr Rafiq issued directives for enhanced measures in Gujranwala and Lahore, where above-average monsoon rains are predicted.</p>
<p>The meeting approved a special grant for desilting operations in Waha (Rajanpur) and urgent measures to address potential hill torrents in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>The minister stressed the importance of field visits by officers to ensure proper arrangements before monsoon rains.</p>
<p>Rawalpindi’s Leh Nullah was specifically identified for priority desilting operations.</p>
<p>The meeting also reviewed the Flood Risk Management Survey. Officials revealed plans to survey over 100,000 structures in Dera Ghazi Khan division, with all hill torrent area surveys scheduled for completion by June 22.</p>
<p>The committee also approved a crucial model study on river erosion patterns.</p>
<p><strong>PDMA helpline</strong></p>
<p>The PDMA has also established a communication system to disseminate weather updates and warnings through SMS alerts, mosque announcements and through local representatives.</p>
<p>PDMA DG Kathia urged citizens to contact the PDMA helpline at 1129 in case of any emergency. The authority can also be reached on WhatsApp +923178371900 and landline 042-9922135/6 for assistance.</p>
<p>PDMA has also directed local authorities to submit daily situation reports.</p>
<p><strong>Solar panel regulations</strong></p>
<p>The PDMA has taken action against substandard fitting of solar panels after falling plates resulted in the deaths of most of the 19 people who were killed during the windstorm in central and southern Punjab on Saturday.</p>
<p>The authority has issued directives to the energy and local government departments and divisional and district administrations for comprehensive guidelines for the installation of solar panels so that they could withstand inclement weather.</p>
<p>According to PDMA’s findings, poorly installed solar panels and mounting structures were uprooted during the recent storm, causing fatal accidents across Punjab.</p>
<p>Poorly fitted panels and mounts fell from rooftops, resulting in significant loss of life and property.</p>
<p>PDMA DG Kathia confirmed that 70pc of the accidents that occurred due to windstorms in the past few days were caused by fallen solar panels or their mounts.</p>
<p>He said solar panels installed on rooftops or in open areas should follow proper installation guidelines.</p>
<p>He stressed the installation of solar panels should be standardised and certified in the future.</p>
<p>The PDMA has instructed district administrations to conduct thorough surveys of existing solar installations to identify and repair dangerous fittings.</p>
<p>The installation of all existing and future solar panels must meet strict engineering standards, including the key requirements like use of certified material and mounting equipment, structural approval by relevant authorities and implementation of regular maintenance and inspection protocols, the relief body directed.</p>
<p>It also stressed the need to devise standard operating procedures (SOPs) for repairs and periodic safety checks.</p>
<p>The energy and local government departments were directed to create a regulatory framework for solar panel installations.</p>
<p>The framework would enforce mandatory safety standards and certification processes for all solar energy systems, especially those installed on rooftops and open structures.</p>
<p>The PDMA warned that failure to comply with the new guidelines could result in similar tragedies during future extreme weather events.</p>
<p>All deputy commissioners have been directed to immediately launch awareness campaigns to educate the public about safe solar panel installation practices while the formal regulations were being developed.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913572/legality-of-ptis-relief-in-reserved-seats-case-contested' target='_blank'><strong>Legality of PTI’s relief in reserved seats case contested</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Senior Counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan on Monday informed the Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court that Article 187 of the Con­stitution — the basis for the July 12, 2024 majority <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">judgement</a> which granted relief to the PTI in the res­e­rved seats case — does not em­p­ower the apex co­urt to grant relief to a party that was not before it.</p>
<p>“Article 187 is a provision which allows the Sup­r­eme Court to decide a mat­ter in a complete sense, but not to settle a dispute or grant relief to a party which is not before the court,” argued the counsel representing the candidates who were denied res­erved seats after the Ele­ction Commission of Pak­is­tan (ECP) quashed a not­ification that had allocated special seats for women to them.</p>
<p>“At times, in a dispute, the court can mould relief for one of the contesting parties, since there can be a situation where a party is entitled to more relief,” the counsel added.</p>
<p>Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, a member of the 11-judge CB hearing a set of review petitions against the July 12 majority judgement, questioned, “If a matter relates to public importance, should the Supreme Court not exercise this provision in exceptional circumstances or remain restricted like a civil court from exercising its jurisdiction?”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He further asked whether the Supreme Court could “shut its eyes” when presiding officers failed to perform their duties according to law. He noted that, irrespective of whether someone was a party or not, people should not be disenfranchised merely because they failed to approach the court.</p>
<p>The counsel cited Justice Yahya Afridi — now Chief Justice of Pakistan — who in his note stated that while the Supreme Court has the power to interpret the Constitution, it does not have the authority to rewrite it.</p>
<p>Justice Afridi had cautioned that relying on Article 187 to grant relief to a party not before the court could create a dangerous and far-reaching precedent. It risked undermining due process and potentially led to judicial overreach. Therefore, such powers must be exercised only in compelling and exceptional cases to bolster the rights of an aggrieved party, while remaining within constitutional bounds, he emphasised.</p>
<p>The counsel further argued that no party can directly file a petition under Article 187 of the Constitution before the Supreme Court, and reminded that the jurisdictional requirements of Articles 184, 185, 186, 186A or 188 must be satisfied for the Supreme Court to act.</p>
<p>He pointed out that the Supreme Court has consistently held that election disputes should be treated like civil disputes, where the burden of proof lies on the challenger.</p>
<p>Justice Musarrat Hilali observed that the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) likely had only one member in the National Assembly and questioned on what grounds the PTI was granted reserved seats through the July 12 judgement. She asked whether the court acted on some kind of suo motu basis.</p>
<p>Justice Hilali also recalled that the majority judgement had taken an independent stance to provide relief to a party — PTI — that was not before the Peshawar High Court, and which had only moved an application before the Supreme Court to act as an intervener for assistance.</p>
<p>The counsel argued that Article 187 was referenced 10 times in the majority verdict as the basis for invoking the doctrine of constitutional fidelity and for doing complete justice.</p>
<p>However, he emphasised that Article 187 is not a jurisdictional provision, but rather a procedural one that enables the court to do complete justice in matters already pending before it. Accordingly, the case must first be brought before the Supreme Court under Articles 184 to 185, 186, 186A or 188. Article 187, he said, merely allows the court to overcome procedural hurdles and technicalities in such matters.</p>
<p>Justice Hilali also questioned the status of the PTI, which was not permitted to contest the general elections under a common election symbol, asking whether it remained a political party despite the restrictions it faced.</p>
<p>Justice Aminuddin Khan, who is heading the 11-judge CB, reminded that the dispute over reserved seats was based on the number of seats procured.</p>
<p>The counsel argued that none of the 80 candidates in question had approached the Supreme Court, yet the majority judgement granted reserved seats to all 80 PTI candidates — after the legal and constitutional deadline had passed — even though PTI was not a petitioner before any legal forum.</p>
<p>He pointed out that those candidates could have joined the PTI or approached the court, but instead they <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1815498/pti-backed-independents-to-join-sunni-ittehad-council-barrister-gohar">chose</a> to affiliate with the SIC. Therefore, they were not petitioners, and allocating seats to them was clearly against constitutional provisions.</p>
<p>He also noted that all 13 judges of the July 12 judgement had unanimously held that a political party which did not contest the general elections or secure any seat was not entitled to reserved seats.</p>
<p>The SIC, the counsel argued, did not contest the general elections for any seat. Its chairman ran as an independent candidate. The 80 candidates in question joined the SIC, which although a registered political party, did not contest or win any seats in the general elections.</p>
<p>The counsel also reminded that under Article 225 of the Constitution, election disputes must be raised only through an election petition — yet the ECP’s notification allocating reserved seats to the petitioners was quashed.</p>
<p>Faisal Siddiqi, the counsel for the SIC, will begin his arguments on Tuesday.</p>
