                <h2>Ruling coalition given two-thirds majority as ECP distributes reserved seats</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The ruling coalition was handed its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly on Wednesday with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) distributing the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621">reserved seats</a> to the PML-N, PPP and the opposition Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) following the Supreme Court’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920721/ptis-hopes-dashed-as-rivals-set-to-receive-reserved-seats">verdict</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, the Constit­utional Bench overturned the Supreme Court’s earlier judgement in the reserved seats case — effectively taking away reserved seats from the PTI and handing them to their rival parties in the national and provincial legislatures. The decision, handed down by a majority of seven judges, supersedes the July 12, 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">majority judgement</a> by eight judges, which had declared the PTI eligible for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the assemblies.</p>
<p>The Constitutional Bench’s decision effectively meant the PTI was no longer a parliamentary party.</p>
<p>Acting on the court’s verdict, the ECP issued an order today withdrawing its July 24 and 29 notifications from last year that had declared returned candidates against general seats of the National Assembly and the Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies as returned candidates of the PTI.</p>
<p>In another order today, the ECP notified the names of the returned candidates under various categories of reserved seats with immediate effect, distributing 13 seats to the PML-N in the National Assembly, four to the PPP and two to the opposition JUI-F.</p>
<p>After this process, the ruling coalition ach­ieves a two-thirds majority; in a house of 336, the mag­ic number required to at­­tain a two-thirds majority is 224. The ruling coalition now has 233 seats.</p>
<p>The ECP also distributed reserved seats in the provincial assemblies.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#reserved-seats-case" id="reserved-seats-case" title="Permalink"></a>Reserved seats case</h2>
<p>Through its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1821427">March 25, 2024</a> order, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) had deprived the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — the party <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1816169">joined</a> by PTI-backed independents after the Feb 8, 2024 polls — of reserved seats.</p>
<p>On the date of the first hearing of this case, Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908809/two-judges-object-as-sc-accepts-review-pleas-on-reserved-seats-for-hearing">rejected</a> outright the review petitions filed by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1846084">PML-N</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850678#:~:text=ECP%20files%20review%20plea">ECP</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847508/ppp-takes-cue-from-pml-n-files-review-petition-on-sc-reserved-seats-verdict">PPP</a>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, their names were excluded from the strength of the Constitutional Bench, even though they were considered part of the bench.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail had partly allowed the review petitions and maintained his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531#:~:text=Chief%20Justice%20Qazi%20Faez%20Isa%20read%20out%20the%20minority%20judgement%2C%20written%20by%20Justice%20Jamal%20Khan%20Mandokhail">original order</a> of giving 39 seats to PTI, but reviewed the majority judgment to the extent of 41 seats.</p>
<p>In his July 12 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866985#:~:text=Justice%20Jamal%20Khan%20Mandokhail%2C%20in%20his%20dissenting%20note">dissenting order</a>, Justice Mandokhail had declared PTI a parliamentary party consisting of 39 members, and thus entitled to reserved seats. Therefore, the ECP should recalculate and reallocate the reserved seats amongst the political parties, including PTI, he held.</p>
<p>The July 12 majority judgement had asked the rest of the 41 independent candidates to file signed and notarised statements before the commission within 15 days — explaining that they contested the Feb 8 general elections as a candidate of a particular political party. Consequently, the ECP had notified them as PTI members, in light of the judgement.</p>
<p>Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, who were part of the earlier majority judgement, also reviewed their positions and allowed the review petitions.</p>
<p>However, they posited that since the controversy at hand could not be resolved, either by the PHC or the Supreme Court, the ECP should examine and consider afresh the nomination papers/declaration and other relevant documents of all <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621#:~:text=the%20verdict%20stated.-,List%20of%2080%20MNAs,-The%20verdict%20listed">80 returned candidates</a>, with regard to their affiliation, and take a decision on the allocation of reserved seats within 15 days from receiving a copy of their short order.</p></p>

                <h2>Assistant commissioner among 5 killed in Bajaur blast</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least five people, including an assistant commissioner, were killed and 11 others injured on Wednesday as a government vehicle was targeted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district.</p>
<p>Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafique told <em>Dawn.com</em> that five people, including two policemen and a civilian, were killed in an explosion targeting the vehicle on Nawagai Road in Siddiqabad railway attack area of Khar tehsil.</p>
<p>“The blast was so intense that the vehicle targeted was completely destroyed,” he said, adding that 11 people were injured in the blast and immediately transported to Khar District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>The DPO said that security was increased in the area and relief activities were underway.</p>
<p>The deceased include Nawagai Assistant Commissioner Faisal Ismail, Tehsildar Abdul Wakil, Subedar Noor Hakim, and police constable Rashid.</p>
<p>KP Health Adviser Ihtisham Ali strongly condemned the blast and expressed grief over the demise of the assistant commissioner and others in the incident.</p>
<p>He contacted Khar DHQ’s district health officer and the medical superintendent to enquire about the well-being of those injured in the attack.</p>
<p>“An emergency has been imposed in Bajaur hospitals and health department staff have been alerted for first aid,” he said.</p>
<p>The health adviser assured the public that medical assistance would be provided to the injured.</p>
<p>KP Inspector General of Police (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed sought a report on the blast from the Malakand regional police officer (RPO).</p>
<p>He also ordered to speed up intelligence-based operations against the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group and directed the Counter-Terrorism Department’s additional inspector general of police to send a special team to Bajaur.</p>
<p>“A special branch is obtaining intelligence related to the incident,” Hameed said, adding that according to initial information, the TTP targeted the assistant commissioner’s vehicle.</p>
<p>Hameed said that teams were formed “to arrest the elements involved in the incident while all necessary evidence is being collected from the spot”, adding that bomb disposal teams were present on site.</p>
<p>Those elements disturbing the country and province’s peace will be strictly dealt with, the KP police chief said.</p>
<p>KP government spokesperson Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif strongly condemned the incident and said the loss of lives was regrettable.</p>
<p>“The KP chief minister has issued orders for an enquiry into the incident and to provide medical facilities to the injured,” Saif said.</p>
<p>“Those who are hostile elements to the country will not be allowed to succeed in their nefarious purposes and will be brought to justice.”</p>
<p>KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah also condemned the incident. He directed the district administration and health department to remain on full alert, provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and utilise all available resources to deal with the emergency situation.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#condemnations" id="condemnations" title="Permalink"></a>Condemnations</h2>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the bomb blast and expressed his grief over the deaths.</p>
<p>The president also extended his condolences and sympathies to the victims’ families and offered prayers for the deceased.</p>
