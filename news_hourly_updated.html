<p>China signed a convention setting up an international organisation for mediation in Hong Kong that Beijing hopes will be on par with the International Court of Justice and bolster the city‚Äôs international credentials, <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>
<p>Pakistan, Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia and Serbia were among the countries attending the signing ceremony, while representatives from 20 international bodies, including the United Nations, were also expected to join, public broadcaster <em>RTHK</em> said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDeputy Prime Minister [and] Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar, today signed, on behalf of Pakistan, the convention on the establishment of the International Organisation for Mediation in Hong Kong,‚Äù the statement by the FO read.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Dar appreciated the Chinese leadership for its wisdom in developing and consistently leading efforts in establishing the IOMed and fostering a global community with a shared future, the statement added.</p>
<p>He added that the creation of IOMed underscores the indispensability and significance of multilateralism as the centrepiece for international peace, stability, and development.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIOMeD also offers new opportunities and fresh hopes to build a more inclusive, more just and more equitable world. As one of the founding members of IOMed, Pakistan would continue to be an active voice in this noble mission,‚Äù the statement quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>The deputy PM underlined Pakistan‚Äôs strong commitment to the promotion of peace and security as well as development. He elaborated on the critical importance of advancing and preserving multilateralism through faithful adherence to the principles of the UN Charter, full implementation of UN Security Council resolutions, as well as international law.</p>
<p>He also drew attention to India‚Äôs violation of international law through its acts of aggression against Pakistan and its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914001/fo-slams-modis-censure-of-iwt">unlawful holding in abeyance</a> of the Indus Waters Treaty. He also highlighted the occupation of Jammu and Kashmir and the occupied Palestinian Territories as drivers of conflict to regional peace and security.</p>
<p>Dar called for the resolution of the longstanding Jammu and Kashmir dispute under the UN Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>The idea for the establishment of the IOMed was one of the key outcomes of the 2nd Belt and Road Forum held in Beijing in April 2019. China initiated discussions for the establishment of IOMed in 2021, and invited Pakistan to join negotiations as one of its founding members, the statement added.</p>
<p>The organisation is open to all countries; is based on respect for the sovereignty, core interests and legitimate concerns of every country; aims to promote dialogue and trust between parties concerned based on equality; and desires inclusion of various legal systems, and their mediators, the FO said.</p>

<p>Noting Hong Kong‚Äôs growing significance in international mediation efforts, FM Dar highlighted the region‚Äôs role as a ‚Äúglobal hub, linking east and west‚Äù.</p>
<p>The pair discussed measures to ‚Äúdeepen economic investment and trade cooperation‚Äù between Pakistan and the administrative region of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHailing the launch of IOMed as a milestone inspired by President Xi Jinping‚Äôs vision, the DPM/FM noted its alignment with Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to dialogue-driven diplomacy and UN Charter‚Äôs principles,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>The foreign minister acknowledged the chief executive and SAR government for their ‚Äúimpressive economic and social development strides under the ‚ÄòOne Country, Two Systems‚Äô framework‚Äù while recalling Pakistan and Hong Kong‚Äôs ‚Äúlong-standing friendship.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>Pakistan, India close to completing border troop reduction: CJCSC Gen Mirza</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan and India are close to reducing the troop build-up along their border to levels before conflict erupted between the nuclear-armed neighbours this month, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee told <em>Reuters</em> on Friday, although he warned the crisis had increased the risk of escalation in the future.</p>
<p>The developments follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi‚Äôs allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam. New Delhi, based on the allegations, launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Pakistan in early May, killing civilians. Islamabad retaliated by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>. After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>Gen Mirza said the two militaries had started the process of drawing down troop levels.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have almost come back to the pre-22nd April situation‚Ä¶ we are approaching that, or we must have approached that by now,‚Äù said Mirza, the most senior Pakistani military official to speak publicly since the conflict.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs ministry of defence and the office of the Indian chief of defence staff did not immediately respond to <em>Reuters</em>‚Äô requests for comment on the remarks by Mirza.</p>
<p>Mirza, who is in Singapore to attend the Shangri-La Dialogue forum, said while there was no move towards nuclear weapons during this conflict, it was a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNothing happened this time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut you can‚Äôt rule out any strategic miscalculation at any time, because when the crisis is on, the responses are different.‚Äù</p>
<p>He also said the risk of escalation in the future had increased since the fighting this time was not limited to the Indian-occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned Pakistan this month that New Delhi would target ‚Äúterrorist hideouts‚Äù across the border again if there were new attacks on India.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis (conflict) lowers the threshold between two countries who are contiguous nuclear powers‚Ä¶in the future, it will not be restricted to the disputed territory. It would come down to (the) whole of India and (the) whole of Pakistan,‚Äù Mirza said. ‚ÄúThis is a very dangerous trend.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mirza warned that international mediation might be difficult in the future because of a lack of crisis management mechanisms between the countries.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe time window for the international community to intervene would now be very less, and I would say that damage and destruction may take place even before that time window is exploited by the international community,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Pakistan was open to dialogue, he added, but beyond a crisis hotline between the directors general of military operations and some hotlines at the tactical level on the border, there was no other communication between the two countries.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs foreign ministry spokesperson said on Thursday ‚ÄúTalks and terror don‚Äôt go together‚Äù in response to a question on the possibility of dialogue with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Mirza said there were no backchannel discussions, or informal talks, to ease tensions. He also said he had no plans to meet General Anil Chauhan, India‚Äôs chief of defence staff, who is also in Singapore for the Shangri-La forum.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese issues can only be resolved by dialogue and consultations, on the table. They cannot be resolved on the battlefield,‚Äù Mirza said.</p>

<p>India will use the firepower of its ‚Äúnavy in response to any future aggression by Pakistan,‚Äù India‚Äôs defence minister said on Friday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf Pakistan resorts to anything evil or unethical, it will, this time, face the firepower and ire of the Indian Navy,‚Äù Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on the aircraft carrier INS Vikrant off the coast of the western Indian state of Goa.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Pakistan‚Äôs military referred <em>Reuters</em> to a May 12 statement, which said there would be a ‚Äúcomprehensive and decisive‚Äù response whenever Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty was ‚Äúthreatened and territorial integrity violated‚Äù.</p>
<p>Singh said ‚ÄòOperation Sindoor‚Äô, under which India launched the strikes on Pakistan, was paused, but not yet over.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe stopped our military actions on our own terms. Our forces had not even started showing their might,‚Äù he said.</p>
