                <h2>Trump says ‚Äòhonoured‚Äô to meet Field Marshal Munir; Iran discussed in talks</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that he was ‚Äúhonoured‚Äù to meet Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir for talks at the White House ‚Äî also marking the first time a US president has hosted Pakistan‚Äôs army chief at the White House unaccompanied by senior civilian officials.</p>
<p>The meeting, listed on the president‚Äôs official schedule, was held in the Cabinet Room and closed to the press.</p>
<p>The lunch is being seen in Islamabad as a major diplomatic win, particularly because earlier this month, an Indian delegation met US Vice President JD Vance and Indian media depicted it as a diplomatic success, contrasting it with the apparent inability of the Pakistani delegation to secure a similar meeting. Gen Munir‚Äôs invitation to the White House is now being projected by officials in Islamabad as a diplomatic counterpoint to those narratives.</p>
<p>When questioned about the meeting in an interaction with the media later, Trump said, ‚ÄúI was honoured to meet him (Field Marshal Munir) today.‚Äù</p>
<p>Asked whether the talks included the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917867/i-may-do-it-i-may-not-do-it-trump-says-on-us-striking-iran-as-khamenei-rules-out-surrender">current Iran-Israel conflict</a>, Trump said: ‚ÄúThey (Pakistan) know Iran very well, better than most, and they‚Äôre not happy about anything. It‚Äôs not that they‚Äôre bad with Israel. They know them both, actually, but they know Iran better.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe (Field Marshal Munir) agreed with me. The reason I had him here was that I wanted to thank him for not going into the war [with India]. And I want to thank PM [Narendra] Modi as well, who just left a few days ago. We‚Äôre working on a trade deal with India and Pakistan. These two very smart people decided not to keep going with a war that could have been a nuclear war. Pakistan and India are two big nuclear powers.‚Äù</p>

<p>Trump‚Äôs lunch with Field Marshal Munir represented a major boost in US-Pakistan ties, which had largely languished under Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, as both assiduously courted India as part of efforts to push back against China.</p>
<p>Earlier, when questioned by reporters on the White House lawn about the diplomatic outcomes expected from the meeting with Field Marshal Munir, Trump remarked, ‚ÄúThis man was extremely influential in stopping it (India-Pakistan fighting) from the Pakistan side.‚Äù</p>

<p>Trump also once again claimed credit for the Pakistan-India ceasefire despite Modi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917877/modi-maintains-there-was-no-us-mediation-in-ceasefire-with-pakistan">maintaining</a> in a conversation with him late on Tuesday that the breakthrough was achieved through talks between the two militaries and not US mediation.</p>
<p>Former foreign minister and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had earlier praised the development as a ‚Äúpositive step for bilateral relations.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúToday, Pakistan‚Äôs Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir will meet with Donald Trump over lunch, a positive step in Pakistan-US relations. Especially given the president‚Äôs role in mediating a ceasefire.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFollowing Pakistan‚Äôs decisive victory in the recent five-day war, India has regrettably resisted all efforts toward a permanent peace,  including US-led diplomacy.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said Pakistan neither sought conflict nor was it ‚Äúdesperate for dialogue‚Äù. However, Bilawal said Pakistan recognised that peace was in the interest of both nations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is no military solution to our disputes. India‚Äôs weaponisation of water, repression in Kashmir, and politicisation of terrorism are unsustainable positions. The path forward lies in honest diplomacy ‚Äî not denial.‚Äù</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst, emphasised that the meeting should not be seen only in the context of the Iran-Israel conflict.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been US-Pak engagement on critical minerals, crypto, counterterrorism. Trump takes a deep personal interest in all of these. And Munir is empowered to talk about it all. Also, Kashmir.‚Äù</p>

<p>This development also marks a notable success for Pakistan in the ongoing diplomatic contest that followed last month‚Äôs air combat with India ‚Äî a confrontation that brought South Asia dangerously close to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">nuclear conflict.</a> Munir is in the US on a five-day official visit.</p>

<p>Field Marshal Munir, who was elevated to Pakistan‚Äôs rare <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912277">five-star rank</a> last month ‚Äî the first such promotion since Ayub Khan in 1959 ‚Äî has made headlines during his trip, urging India to engage with Pakistan ‚Äúas a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917734/army-chief-asks-india-to-engage-with-pakistan-like-a-civilised-nation">civilized nation</a>,‚Äù rather than attempting to impose regional hegemony.</p>
<p>Speaking to members of the Pakistani American community on Monday evening, he strongly rejected Indian claims that Pakistan was behind the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, calling it a ‚Äúpretext for cross-border aggression.‚Äù</p>
<p>He accused India of seeking to establish a dangerous ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù of violating international borders, which Pakistan had forcefully rejected. ‚ÄúWe would rather embrace martyrdom than accept this dishonour,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The interaction at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington‚Äôs Georgetown neighbourhood drew a large and enthusiastic crowd, with supporters showering the army chief with rose petals and chanting slogans in his praise. Protesters aligned with the opposition PTI party demonstrated outside, calling for democratic reforms and the release of jailed leaders, but their voices were largely drowned out inside the venue.</p>
<p>In his remarks, Munir also addressed the broader regional landscape, declaring Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúclear and strong‚Äù support for Iran in its war with Israel while also backing US efforts to de-escalate the situation. ‚ÄúWe want this war to end immediately,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>One of the most consequential developments during Munir‚Äôs visit, however, has been Pakistan‚Äôs strengthened counterterrorism partnership with the US ‚Äî particularly against the militant Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) group. Last week, Gen Michael Kurilla, head of US Central Command, had described Pakistan as a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524">phenomenal partner</a>‚Äù in the fight against IS-K, praising Islamabad‚Äôs operations along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.</p>
<p>Gen Kurilla revealed to the House Armed Services Committee that Pakistani operations, supported by US intelligence, had killed dozens of IS-K militants and captured multiple high-value individuals, including Mohammad Sharifullah, one of the masterminds of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1642871">Abbey Gate bombing</a> in Kabul that killed 13 American troops.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe first person Munir called was me,‚Äù Gen Kurilla said. ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve caught him ‚Äî ready to extradite him back to the US. Please tell the secretary of defence and the president‚Äô.‚Äù Sharifullah was promptly extradited.</p>
<p>In a separate statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Kurilla noted that Pakistan had conducted ‚Äúdozens of operations‚Äù to dismantle IS-K‚Äôs presence in the border regions and continues to play a pivotal role in countering terrorism in Central and South Asia.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The Centcom chief‚Äôs comments reflect a growing acknowledgement in Washington that Pakistan remains essential to regional stability. As Kurilla noted, while the Taliban have pushed IS-K militants into the tribal areas, these sanctuaries still allow the group to plan and plot attacks not just against regional allies, but also the US homeland.</p>
<p>Despite the security challenges Pakistan faces ‚Äî including over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075">1,000 terrorist attacks</a> last year alone, which claimed the lives of some 700 security personnel and 2,500 civilians ‚Äî Gen Kurilla said Pakistan ‚Äúhas been a phenomenal partner in the counterterrorism world‚Äù.</p>
<p>During his interaction with the diaspora community, Gen Munir emphasised Pakistan‚Äôs gratitude for the role overseas Pakistanis play in bolstering the national economy. He dismissed concerns over brain drain, describing it instead as a ‚Äúbrain gain.‚Äù</p>
<p>He avoided discussing domestic politics directly, and when one attendee attempted to criticise former prime minister Imran Khan, Munir discouraged it. When another guest jokingly suggested that political opponents might need their ‚Äúsoftware fixed,‚Äù the general responded that democratic societies must protect the right to dissent.</p>
<p>The evening concluded with pledges of renewed commitment from both the army chief and the diaspora to work toward a stronger, more resilient Pakistan.</p></p>

            <p><p>President Donald Trump left the question of whether the United States will join Israeli strikes on Iran up in the air on Wednesday, as he said that Tehran had reached out to seek negotiations.</p>

<hr />
<p>Addressing reporters about whether the US would enter the fray after his earlier comments, Trump said: ‚ÄúI can tell you this, Iran‚Äôs got a lot of trouble and they want to negotiate.‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump said Iran had even suggested sending officials to the White House to negotiate on Tehran‚Äôs nuclear program to end Israel‚Äôs air assault, but added that it was ‚Äúvery late‚Äù. ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs very late to be talking. We may meet. There‚Äôs a big difference between now and a week ago, right? Big difference,‚Äù Trump added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey‚Äôve suggested that they come to the White House. That‚Äôs, you know, courageous, but it‚Äôs, like, not easy for them to do.‚Äù</p>
<p>He reiterated his demand for an ‚Äúunconditional surrender‚Äù from Iran, saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had it. I give up. No more. Then we go blow up all the nuclear stuff that is all over the place there [in Iran].‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump said the next week would be ‚Äúvery big‚Äù without elaborating. When asked if it was too late for negotiations, he said: ‚ÄúNothing is too late.‚Äù</p>
<p>Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said, even as he declined to confirm preparations of strike options on Iran, that the US military was ‚Äúprepared to execute‚Äù any decision Trump might make on matters of war and peace.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf and when those decisions are made, the Department [of Defence] is prepared to execute them,‚Äù Hegseth told the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p>
<p>Iran later denied it had offered to send officials to Washington.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo Iranian official has ever asked to grovel at the gates of the White House,‚Äù Iran‚Äôs mission to the UN said in a post on X.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe only thing more despicable than his lies is his cowardly threat to ‚Äòtake out‚Äô Iran‚Äôs supreme leader.‚Äù</p>

<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also spoke to <em>Al Jazeera</em> about reports of a negotiating team dispatched to Oman and said: ‚ÄúThis report is not true and Iran has not sent any negotiating team to Muscat.‚Äù</p>
<p>Israeli newspaper <em>Haaretz</em> had reported that three Iranian government planes, including the presidential plane, had landed in Oman for ‚Äúreasons unknown‚Äù.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Khamenei said: ‚ÄúThis nation will not surrender to anyone in the face of imposition,‚Äù according to <em>Tasnim</em> news agency.</p>
<p>The Iranian leader also pointed out to statements made by Trump, saying that those who know Iran and its history ‚Äúknow that Iranians do not answer well to the language of threat‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd the Americans should know that any US military intervention will undoubtedly be accompanied by irreparable consequences.‚Äù</p>
<p>Earlier, Iran claimed firing hypersonic missiles at Israel as Khamenei vowed his country would show ‚Äúno mercy‚Äù to its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916920/a-timeline-of-the-long-standing-conflict-between-israel-and-iran">longtime</a> archfoe, hours after Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917651/in-dramatic-escalation-trump-says-wont-kill-khamenei-for-now-demands-irans-unconditional-surrender">demanded</a> Tehran‚Äôs ‚Äúunconditional surrender‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe must give a strong response to the terrorist Zionist regime. We will show the Zionists no mercy,‚Äù Khamenei posted on X, hours after Trump‚Äôs escalatory remarks.</p>

<p>Iran‚Äôs ambassador to the United Nations, Ali Bahreini, said his country had conveyed to Washington that it will respond firmly to the United States if it becomes directly involved in Israel‚Äôs military campaign.</p>
<p>Bahreini told reporters that he saw the US as ‚Äúcomplicit in what Israel is doing‚Äù. Iran would set a red line, and respond if the US crosses it, he said, without specifying what actions would provoke a response.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will not show any reluctance in defending our people, security and land ‚Äî we will respond seriously and strongly, without restraint,‚Äù Bahreini told reporters.</p>
<p>The Iranian envoy called Trump‚Äôs remarks ‚Äúcompletely unwarranted and very hostile‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe cannot ignore them. We are vigilant about what Trump is saying. We will put it in our calculations and assessments.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am confident that [Iran‚Äôs military] will react strongly, proportionally and appropriately. We are closely following the level of involvement in the US [‚Ä¶] We will react whenever it is needed,‚Äù he asserted.</p>
<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also said  Iran had the ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù right to defend itself in the face of Israel‚Äôs ongoing bombing campaign.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is a very natural, legitimate and legal right for Iran to defend itself against Israel‚Äôs thuggery and state terrorism,‚Äù the Turkish leader said, a day after he referred to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as ‚Äúthe biggest threat to the security of the region‚Äù.</p>
<p>The US has so far only taken indirect actions in the current conflict with Iran, including helping to shoot down missiles fired toward Israel. It is deploying more fighter aircraft to the Middle East and extending the deployment of other warplanes, three US officials told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>Trump met with his National Security Council earlier today to discuss the conflict, ending after an hour and 20 minutes with no immediate public statement.</p>
<p>While he has repeatedly vowed to avoid wading into the ‚Äúforever wars‚Äù of the Middle East, Trump ordered the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier to the region along with a number of US military aircraft.</p>
<p>US officials stressed he has not yet made a decision about any intervention, according to <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Thomas Massie from Trump‚Äôs Republican Party said that he introduced an Iran War Powers Resolution with fellow lawmaker Ro Khanna to prohibit US involvement in the Israel-Iran war.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is not our war. Even if it were, Congress must decide such matters according to our constitution,‚Äù he said.

<p>The most likely option under consideration by Trump would be the use of giant US ‚Äúbunker-buster‚Äù bombs against Iran‚Äôs deeply buried Fordow nuclear facility that Israel‚Äôs bombs cannot reach.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBunker buster‚Äù is a broad term used to describe bombs that can penetrate about 61 metres below the surface before exploding, according to the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://apnews.com/article/bunker-buster-bomb-israel-iran-fordo-fordow-b2-nuclear-8a612cbf16aa0f99bd9992334ffc93d7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press</a></em>. Therefore, the precision-guided bombs are used to attack ‚Äúdeeply buried and hardened bunkers and tunnels‚Äù.</p>

<p>Israeli military strikes have hit two facilities in Iran that made parts for centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium, the UN‚Äôs International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today, identifying them as the Tesa Karaj workshop and the Tehran Research Centre.</p>

<p>Hypersonic missiles travel at more than five times the speed of sound and can manoeuvre mid-flight, making them harder to track and intercept.</p>

<p>Iran also sent a ‚Äúswarm of drones‚Äù towards Israel, where the army said it intercepted two over the Dead Sea area. The Israeli military said two barrages of Iranian missiles were launched toward Israel in the first two hours of Wednesday morning. Explosions were heard over Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>Israel told residents in the area of Tehran to evacuate so its air force could strike Iranian military installations.</p>
<p>Iranian news websites said Israel was also attacking a university linked to the IRGC in the country‚Äôs east, and the Khojir ballistic missile facility near Tehran, which was also targeted by Israeli airstrikes last October.</p>
<p>An Israeli military official claimed 50 fighter jets struck around 20 targets in Tehran overnight, including sites producing raw materials, components and manufacturing systems for missiles.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs semi-official <em>Mehr</em> news agency reported clashes earlier today between security forces and unidentified gunmen in the city of Rey, south of Tehran, adding the assailants may be linked to Israel and intended to carry out ‚Äúterrorist operations in densely populated areas of the capital‚Äù.</p>

<p>He then posted ‚Äúunconditional surrender‚Äù, an apparent demand addressed at Tehran.</p>

<p>Trump also made a veiled threat against Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying ‚Äúwe know exactly where the so-called ‚ÄòSupreme Leader‚Äô is hiding ‚Ä¶ We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now‚Äù.</p>

<p>Trump‚Äôs sometimes contradictory and cryptic messaging about the conflict between close US ally Israel and longtime foe Iran has deepened the uncertainty surrounding the crisis. His public comments have ranged from military threats to diplomatic overtures, not uncommon for a president known for an often erratic approach to foreign policy.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-moving-fighter-jets-middle-east-israel-iran-war-rages-2025-06-17/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> yesterday that the US military was deploying more fighter aircraft to the Middle East and extending the deployment of other warplanes.</p>
<p>The deployments include F-16, F-22 and F-35 fighter aircraft, and officials said had so far been used to shoot down drones and projectiles targeting Israel.</p>
<p>Four US Stratofortress bombers are currently stationed at a remote US base in the Indian Ocean, an <em>AFP</em> analysis of satellite imagery indicated. The four B52H bombers, which can carry nuclear weapons or other precision-guided munitions, were spotted on a southern tarmac at Diego Garcia on Monday at 2:22pm PKT.</p>
<p>US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also described the deployments as defensive in nature. A White House official said Trump spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The US already has a sizeable force in the Middle East, with nearly 40,000 troops in the region, including air defence systems, fighter aircraft and warships that can detect and shoot down enemy missiles.</p>

<p>British PM Keir Starmer, speaking at the Group of Seven nations <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917316">summit</a> in Canada that Trump left early, said there was no indication the US was about to enter the conflict.</p>
<p>The US said that it will close its embassy in Jerusalem until Friday amid the growing military conflict between Israel and Iran, as speculation mounts about possible American intervention.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGiven the security situation and in compliance with Israel Home Front Command guidance, the US Embassy in Jerusalem will be closed tomorrow (Wednesday, June 18) through Friday (June 20),‚Äù the embassy said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://il.usembassy.gov/security-alert-u-s-embassy-jerusalem-june-17-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> posted on Tuesday to its website.</p>

<p>Khamenei‚Äôs main military and security advisers have been killed by Israeli strikes, hollowing out his inner circle and raising the risk of strategic errors, according to five people familiar with his decision-making process.</p>
<p>With Iranian leaders suffering their most dangerous security breach since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the country‚Äôs cybersecurity command banned officials from using communications devices and mobile phones, <em>Fars</em> news agency reported.</p>
<p>State television appealed to Iranians on Tuesday to delete WhatsApp from their phones, charging that the messaging app gathers users‚Äô location and personal data and ‚Äúcommunicates them to the Zionist enemy‚Äù.</p>

<p>Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916909">launched</a> its air war, its largest ever on Iran, on Friday after saying it concluded Iran was on the verge of developing a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and has pointed to its right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, including enrichment, as a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
<p>Israel, which is not a party to the NPT, is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has stressed that he will not back down until Iran‚Äôs nuclear development is disabled, while Trump says the Israeli assault could end if Iran agrees to strict curbs on enrichment.</p>
<p>Before Israel‚Äôs attack began, the 35-nation board of governors of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in almost 20 years.</p>
<p>However, a US intelligence assessment found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was ‚Äúyears away from producing one‚Äù, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917691/us-assessment-finds-iran-years-away-from-nuclear-weapon-refutes-israeli-claims">report</a> from <em>CNN</em> released on Tuesday said.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The IAEA said on Tuesday that an Israeli strike directly hit the underground enrichment halls at the Natanz facility.</p>
<p>Israel says it now has control of Iranian airspace and intends to escalate the campaign in coming days. But Israel will struggle to deal a knock-out blow to deeply buried nuclear sites like Fordow, which is dug beneath a mountain, without the US joining the attack.</p>
<p>Global oil markets are on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917009">high alert</a> following strikes on sites including the world‚Äôs biggest gas field, South Pars, shared by Iran and Qatar.</p></p>
