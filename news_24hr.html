            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923309/india-doubling-down-on-proxy-war-after-clear-defeat-by-pakistan-says-coas-munir' target='_blank'><strong>India doubling down on proxy war after clear defeat by Pakistan, says COAS Munir</strong></a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir said on Thursday that India was doubling down on its “nefarious agenda” against Pakistan through the use of proxies after facing a “manifest defeat” in the recent military conflict between the two countries.</p>
<p>India blamed Pakistan for the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> without evidence, triggering a military escalation. On May 6–7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">missile exchange</a>. A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">US-brokered ceasefire</a> ended the war.</p>
<p>A day earlier, Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923063/dg-ispr-brands-indian-nsa-ajit-doval-chief-architect-of-terrorism-in-pakistan">accused</a> Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval of masterminding terrorism in Pakistan, alleging Indian support for terrorist groups.</p>
<p>Echoing similar sentiments, Field Marshal Munir said, while chairing the 271st Corps Commanders’ Conference (CCC) at the General Headquarters (GHQ), said today: “Following its manifest defeat in direct aggression against Pakistan, post-Pahalgam incident, India is now doubling down to further its nefarious agenda through its proxies of <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>.”</p>
<p>In July last year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349">designated</a> the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em>, while mandating all institutions to use the term <em>khariji</em> (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.</p>
<p>In May this year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525">designated</a> all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna-al-Hindu­stan</em> — a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">new phrase</a> aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>
<p>A statement from the ISPR said the CCC participants offered prayers for the martyrs of recent terrorist attacks by “Indian-sponsored proxies”.</p>
<p>“Taking stock of recent successes against terrorist proxies, forum resolved that blood of our martyrs will not go waste and the safety and security of people of Pakistan remain topmost priority for the armed forces of Pakistan. Forum strongly asserted that it is imperative to take decisive and holistic actions at all levels against the Indian-backed and sponsored proxies.”</p>

<p>The ISPR said the forum also noted the Indian military’s “baseless insinuations to offset its comprehensive defeat”, in an apparent reference to the deputy Indian army chief alleging last week that China gave Islamabad “live inputs” on key Indian positions during the conflict.</p>
<p>“Invoking third parties in what is unmistakably a bilateral military confrontation reflects a disingenuous attempt at bloc politics aimed at falsely projecting India’s self-assigned role as a net security provider to accrue benefits in a region that is visibly growing disillusioned with Indian hegemonic ambitions and Hindutva-driven extremism,” the ISPR quoted Field Marshal Munir as saying on the matter.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The army brass also conducted a holistic review of the prevailing internal and external security dynamics, with particular emphasis on the recent developments in the Middle East and Iran, noting the “growing propensity for ‘use of force’ as a preferred policy tool”, saying it warranted “persistent development of self-reliant capabilities as well as national unity and resolve”.</p>
<p>The forum’s members were further briefed on the military’s ongoing drive with quick adaptation towards the “evolving threat spectrum and changing character of war”. The army chief also appreciated the leadership of the Pakistan Navy and the Pakistan Air Force for “further strengthening tri-services synergy”.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir also shared details of the country’s “proactive and successful” diplomatic manoeuvres, including recent visits to Iran, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where he had accompanied Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Forum was also briefed on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044">historic and unique visit</a> of the COAS to US, where meetings with top-tier leadership afforded an opportunity to share first hand Pakistan’s objective perspective on bilateral, regional and extra-regional developments.”</p>
<p>The ISPR said that in his concluding remarks, the army chief expressed “full confidence in the operational readiness of Pakistan Army against complete threat spectrum”.</p></p>

            <p><p>Four people died and 40 were injured in rain-related incidents across Punjab over the past 24 hours as more heavy showers were expected across the province, according to rescue officials and local authorities.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1852031#:~:text=Monsoon%20rains%20across%20the%20region%20from%20June%20to%20September%20offer%20respite%20from%20the%20summer%20heat%20and%20are%20crucial%20to%20replenishing%20water%20supplies.%20They%20are%20also%20vital%20for%20agriculture%2C%20and%20therefore%20the%20livelihoods%20of%20millions%20of%20farmers%20and%20food%20security%20for%20South%20Asia%E2%80%99s%20nearly%20two%20billion%20people.">fall across</a> the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat. They are crucial to replenishing water supplies and agriculture, and therefore, the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security. However, they also wreak havoc by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>At least nine people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923183/11-killed-as-rains-continue-to-batter-punjab-balochistan">lost their lives</a> and many others sustained injuries as heavy monsoon rains lashed Lahore on Wednesday. The downpours caused widespread flooding and disrupted daily life in several areas.</p>
<p>“Over the last 24 hours, four people died and 40 were injured due to rain and winds across the province,” Rescue 1122 Punjab Spokesperson Farooq Ahmed said in a statement.</p>
<p>Those who sustained serious injuries were immediately transported to a hospital, the spokesperson said.</p>

            <p><p>Awami National Party (ANP) politician Maulana Khan Zeb and a policeman were shot dead on Thursday by unidentified suspects in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district, according to the police.</p>
<p>Bajaur District Police Officer (DPO) Waqas Rafiq told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the politician was shot dead in Shindai Mor while campaigning for the July 13 peace parade, adding that a policeman was also killed in the attack.</p>
<p>“Three other people were injured in the shooting,” DPO Rafiq said. “This was a targeted killing carried out by unidentified shooters on motorcycles.”</p>
<p>DPO Rafiq added that evidence had been collected from the crime scene.</p>
<p>Khan Zeb was a member of the ANP’s central cabinet and held the office of secretary of ulema affairs, according to the party <a class="link--external" href="https://anp.org.pk/leadership-database" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>ANP President Senator Aimal Wali Khan issued a statement condemning the killing, stating that the party would file a first information report against the state.</p>
<p>“State institutions are complicit in this incident because they have maintained criminal silence,” the ANP chief was quoted as saying. “After consulting with Khan Zeb’s elder brother, Sheikh Jahanzada, an FIR for the killing will be registered against the state.”</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/AimalWali/status/1943280322512326835" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Wali Khan posted photos of himself and Khan Zeb with the caption “devastated”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ANP KP President Mian Ifitkhar Hussain strongly condemned the incident and declared three days of mourning in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ANPMarkaz/status/1943281443934761187" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> shared on X.</p>
<p>“This attack is not only an attack on the Awami National Party but also on the Pashtun consciousness and peace,” Hussain was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>According to the statement, Hussain announced that the ANP’s KP chapter would observe three days of mourning, suspend all activities, and hoist black flags alongside party flags.</p>
<p>The statement added that Hussain was leaving for Bajaur and urged the party to maintain “morale, unity, and organisational discipline”.</p>
<p>Similarly, the office of KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur issued a statement condemning the incident and vowed to bring the suspects to justice.</p>
<p>According to the statement, the CM condemned the shooting and ordered the relevant authorities to investigate the incident and promptly arrest the shooters.</p>
<p>“Those involved in the incident will not be able to escape the grip of the law,” Gandapur was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Politicians in KP have been targeted in attacks in the past.</p>
<p>This year, the home of Bajaur MNA was attacked twice, with an improvised explosive device <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910961">exploding</a> outside his house in May and suspects launching a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917148/mna-mubarak-zebs-house-in-bajaur-sustains-second-attack">rocket</a> at the residence in June.</p>
<p>Mubarak Zeb Khan was not home during the IED attack and was unharmed in the second incident.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in March, the brother of former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896829">shot dead</a> in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swabi.</p>
<p>The former senator confirmed on social media late on Saturday night that his elder brother, Shakeel Ahmad Khan, was shot dead in front of his house by unidentified gunmen in the village of Ahad Khan in Swabi.</p>
<p>“He was brutally killed in front of his home in an innocent village,” Mushtaq wrote. “My brother was very dear to me, he was my greatest help. It (his murder) is the greatest atrocity.”</p>
