            <p><p>At least two more people died in a rain-related incident in Punjab on Saturday, taking the province’s death toll for the past four days to 14, according to rescue officials and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).</p>
<p>Monsoon rains across the region offer respite from the summer heat and are vital for agriculture and food security. Weather-related <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1497024">incidents</a> are common during the season, but experts say climate change is increasing their frequency and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1852031">severity</a>.</p>
<p>Two people died while four were wounded in a roof collapse incident reported at 3:20am in the Abbas Nagar area of Lahore’s Shahdara Town, Rescue 1122 said in a statement today.</p>
<p>It noted that the house was single-storied and the roof was made of mud. The bodies were taken to Shahdara Hospital, where some of the injured were also taken, while others wounded were brought to Mayo Hospital.</p>

<p>Separately, eight children were among 12 dead while 39 others were injured in various rain-related incidents across Punjab since Wednesday, according to a PDMA report issued today.</p>
<p>From Wednesday to Friday, 25 incidents were reported in various cities, which rose to 28 today, a statement by the PDMA spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Most of the cases involved wall and roof collapses due to torrential rains, accounting for nine out of 12 lives lost during the four-day period, according to the report.</p>
<p>In Kasur, two children died from a roof collapsing while another two lost their lives in a wall collapse incident. One child each died in roof collapse incidents in Okara, Bahawalnagar and Faisalabad.</p>
<p>In Wazirabad, a wall collapsing killed a man and a child, along with injuring a woman and another minor.</p>
<p>In Jhelum, the PDMA report said, two men “drowned in a rainwater nullah”. A recent report <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920476#:~:text=In%20Jhelum%2C%20two%20persons%20died%20after%20a%20loader%20rickshaw%20fell%20into%20a%20storm%20drain%20on%20an%20inundated%20road.">detailed</a> that a loader rickshaw fell into a storm drain on an inundated road.</p>
<p>The PDMA report also mentioned a lightning incident <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920476#:~:text=lightning%20strike%20while%20working%20in%20fields%20in%20Khanewal">in Khanewal</a> that took the life of a man.</p>
<p>Other districts where casualties were reported were Mandi Bahauddin, Sahiwal, Chiniot, Multan, Sheikhupura and Nankana Sahib. Separately, a cow perished in Rahim Yar Khan after a tree fell due to a windstorm.</p>

<p>Irfan Ali Kathia, the PDMA director general, issued directives to provide medical assistance to the injured as well as financial aid to their relatives.</p>
<p>In a statement, he also requested citizens to avoid non-essential travel during inclement weather conditions.</p>
<p>“Do not live in dilapidated houses,” he advised. “Take care of the children [and] do not let them go near the rainwater drains, electric wires and poles.”</p>
<p>Monsoon rains have commenced in Punjab and the first spell will <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919360#:~:text=Mianwali%20from%20June%2025%20to%20July%201.">continue</a> till July 1, the PDMA said earlier this week, adding that rainfall with strong winds and thunderstorms are predicted in most districts of the province.</p>
<p>Punjab is predicted to receive 25 per cent more monsoon rains this year, Kathia <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920014/punjab-predicted-to-receive-25pc-more-monsoon-rains-this-year-pdma">said</a> on Wednesday.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920702/rs75tr-black-hole-soes-losses-and-pensions-outpace-development-defence' target='_blank'><strong>Rs7.5tr black hole: SOEs’ losses and pensions outpace development, defence</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Losses of Rs342bn in six months seen as ‘Rs1.9bn daily drain’ on public finances<br />
• Circular debt crosses Rs4.9tr; unfunded pensions, weak governance deepen fiscal strain</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: With relentless financial haemorrhaging of nearly Rs342bn in just six months, the cumulative losses and unfunded pension liabilities of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have crossed Rs7.5tr — almost three times the country’s defence allocation of Rs2.55tr for FY26, and over seven times the upcoming year’s Public Sector Develop­ment Programme (Rs1tr).</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance informed the Cabinet Commit­tee on State-Owned Enterprises (CCoSOEs) on Friday that total SOE losses now exceed Rs5.8tr — nearly one-third of the recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920477">passed</a> Rs17.5tr federal budget for 2025-26.</p>
<p>Presided over by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurang­zeb, the meeting was briefed by the Central Monitoring Unit of the Finance Division on the biannual performance of federal SOEs for the period July to December 2024.</p>
<p>The report outlined the worsening state of SOEs, including cumulative losses of Rs5.8tr, with Rs342bn incurred in just six months.</p>
<p>Despite repeated <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878236">increases</a> in electricity and gas tariffs over the past three years, circular debt in the oil, gas and power sectors has surged to over Rs4.9tr — almost double the defence budget — severely affecting cash flows and asset valuations.</p>
<p>The committee was told that government fiscal support to SOEs — via grants, subsidies, loans and other injections — also exceeded Rs600bn in just six months, equivalent to nearly 10pc of total revenue receipts.</p>
<p>Unfunded pension liabilities in power distribution companies (Discos) and other SOEs, estimated at Rs1.7tr, remain off the government’s books, as do the pension obligations of Pakistan Railways.</p>
<p>Government guarantees currently stand at Rs2.2tr, while costs related to debt rollovers and financial restructuring further tighten fiscal space. The meeting was informed of persistent governance issues, particularly weak transparency in beneficial interest disclosures under IFRS Section 30, and other regulatory compliance gaps. A lack of strategic alignment and operational inefficiencies were identified as urgent areas for reform.</p>
<p>The cabinet committee noted with concern the staggering Rs5.8tr in cumulative losses, including Rs342bn in just six months — a daily average loss of Rs1.9bn, according to an official statement.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Aurangzeb deplored inefficiencies in Disco operations, delays in grid upgrades by NTDC, and ballooning pension obligations. He warned that weak governance standards are undermining fiscal space and deterring investor confidence.</p>
<p>He stressed the need for urgent reform in the power and energy sectors, where circular debt has crossed Rs4.9tr, and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to enhancing transparency, financial discipline, and accountability across SOEs.</p>
<p>He vowed to push through governance and operational reforms to ensure the financial sustainability of public sector entities.</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb also directed that all government-nominated directors on SOE boards exercise due diligence and actively contribute to improving financial and operational performance through informed decision-making.</p>
<p>Ironically, each SOE board includes at least one senior official from the finance ministry — alongside representatives from relevant line ministries — who receive generous remunerations for attending quarterly board meetings, yet the financial bleeding remains unchecked.</p>
<p>The finance minister underscored the importance of aligning business plans with national priorities and tackling operational challenges in a coordinated and timely fashion. The meeting was also attended by ministers from the ministries of Power, Maritime Affairs, and Science and Technology.</p>
<p>The committee approved the appointment of chairpersons for Quetta Electric and Gujranwala Electric, as well as the constitution of the Board of Directors for the Independent System Market Operator (ISMO) and an independent director for GENCO Holding Company Ltd (GHCL), as proposed by the Power Division.</p>
<p>It also approved the nomination of independent directors for the boards of Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO), Power Information Technology Company (PITC), and the formation of the board for Energy Infrastructure Development and Management Company (EIDMC).</p>
<p>Additionally, the committee approved a summary from the Ministry of Railways seeking the winding up of three railway subsidiaries — RAILCOP, PRACS, and PRFTC.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920716/dar-rules-out-pakistan-joining-abraham-accords' target='_blank'><strong>Dar rules out Pakistan joining Abraham Accords</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Reiterates firm support for two-state solution to Israel-Palestine conflict<br />
• Insists Trump’s Nobel nomination a joint civil-military decision<br />
• Dismisses claim Islamabad sought ceasefire</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Foreign Mini­ster Ishaq Dar on Friday ruled out the possibility of Pakistan joining the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910973">Abraham Accords</a>, stating that such a move would effectively mean abandoning the country’s longstanding support for a two-state solution to the Palestinian conflict and recognising Israel.</p>
<p>Speaking at a news conference at the Foreign Office, Mr Dar, who also serves as deputy prime minister, reiterated Pakistan’s firm support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
<p>His comments came in response to recent remarks by US Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff, who suggested that more countries, which were not previously “contemplated”, were preparing to join the US-brokered accords, which normalise ties with Israel.</p>
<p>Witkoff had joined President Donald Trump at the White House <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917868">lunch</a> for Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir.</p>
<p>“We are not ready to recognise Israel until the two-state solution to the Palestine conflict is accepted,” Mr Dar said. “There is no change in our stated policy on the Palestine issue.”</p>
<p>He added that signing the Abraham Accords would be tantamount to abandoning Pakistan’s long-standing demand for a Palestinian state with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, based on pre-1967 borders. “Let it be clear to everyone that our seven-decades-long policy rem­ains unchanged,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Trump’s Nobel nomination</strong></p>
<p>Addressing criticism over Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514">nomination</a> of President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, Mr Dar said the decision was made jointly by the country’s civilian and military leadership.</p>
<p>He emphasised that the nomination, submitted prior to the start of the Israel-Iran <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">conflict</a>, was based on Trump’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914608">role</a> in de-escalating tensions between India and Pakis­tan and his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916758">remarks</a> regarding the Kashmir dispute.</p>
<p>The foreign minister recalled that Trump “tweeted 15 or 16 times about that”.</p>
<p>Trump’s repeated cla­i­ms on social media about his role in facilitating the May 10 ceasefire between Pakistan and India have irritated New Delhi.</p>
<p>“The decision to nominate President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize was in the context of his role in the India-Pakistan conflict and his statements on the Kashmir issue,” Mr Dar said.</p>
<p>“It was a collective decision by the civil-military leadership. I signed the letter on June 11, days before the Iran-Israel war began. The prime minister’s approval was obviously part of the process.”</p>
<p>Mr Dar referred to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s remarks at a June 4 event at the US Embassy, where he reportedly called Trump “a man of peace”.</p>
<p>The nomination has stirred controversy within Pakistan, with many questioning the rationale behind the move.</p>
<p><strong>Indian ceasefire claims</strong></p>
<p>Responding to Indian officials’ statements that claimed Pakistan had sought a ceasefire, FM Dar dismissed the assertions and reiterated Islamabad’s position that dialogue must be based on equality.</p>
<p>“We didn’t ask anyone for a ceasefire, nor would we ask anyone for dialogue,” he said.</p>
<p>“If India wants talks, we are ready. But we are a dignified nation, we won’t beg. Pakistan is prepared to talk on all outstanding issues, including Kashmir and terrorism, at any venue, but in a respectful manner. The ball is in their court. It takes two to tango.”</p>
<p>His remarks directly challenge New Delhi’s narrative and reaffirm Pakistan’s readiness for dialogue grounded in mutual respect and national dignity.</p>
