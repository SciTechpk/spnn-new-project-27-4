            <p><p>The death toll from floods in Gilgit-Baltistan stood at 10 as search and rescue operations continued across the region and stranded tourists were moved to safer locations, officials said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">heat­­waves</a>, erratic weat­her patterns and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660">glacial melting</a> have triggered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a> and intense floods across the region.</p>
<p>Floods <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> across GB on Monday, causing landslides, leaving many <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926193">stranded</a>, and damaging more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure.</p>
<p>In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said flood-related incidents in the region have claimed 10 lives since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719">Monday</a>, when four were killed and 15 went missing in Babusar.</p>
<p>The toll in Babusar has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20so%20far%2C%2010%20fatalities%20and%20four%20injuries%20have%20been%20reported.%20Seven%20deaths%20were%20reported%20from%20Babusar%2C%20two%20from%20Thore%20Valley%20(Dia%C2%ADmer)%20and%20another%20from%20Astore%20district.">risen</a> to seven, while two deaths were reported from Diamer’s Thore Valley and another from the Astore district, Faraq added.</p>
<p>The body of an unidentified woman was recovered from the Indus River in Chilas’s Minar area. “The body could be that of one of the tourists swept away at the Babusar Highway,” he said.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926705/karakoram-highway-reopened-as-rescue-aid-efforts-continue-in-flood-hit-gb#:~:text=Speaking%20about%20the%20search%20operation%20in%20Babusar%2C%20Faraq%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CThere%20may%20be%2010%20to%2012%20missing%20tourists%20at%20the%20Babusar%20valley%20as%20a%20search%20operation%20was%20ongoing.%E2%80%9D">speaking</a> about the search operation yesterday, Faraq had said there may be 10 to 12 missing tourists at Babusar valley.</p>
<p>“Search operations are underway on Babusar Highway by personnel of the Pakistani Army, district administration and other institutions,” he said, adding that rescue and relief operations were also underway in Ghanche, Ghizer and Gilgit.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Most tourists trapped in Ferry Meadows have been rescued and moved to a safe place, Faraq said, adding that the Silk Road had been restored for all types of traffic.</p>
<p>“At least Rs20 billion worth of damage has been caused by flooding in Gilgit-Baltistan,” he said.</p>
<p>“The province runs on grants and aid; it will be difficult redressal for the provincial government alone. The federal government should announce a separate reasonable grant for the relief of flood disasters.”</p>
<p>A day earlier, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan appe­aled to the federal government for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab">Rs7bn in emergency funds</a> to deal with climate-induced disasters that approximately “caused damages exceeding Rs20bn across the region.”</p>
<p>He said unprecedented floods had impacted seven districts, with Diamer being the worst affected. “People in GB are facing daily flood events. At least one flood occurs every day,” he said.</p>
<p>The chief minister said that 300 homes were destroyed, 200 were partially damaged, 40 water channels in 30 villages were swept away and 15 kilometres of roads, bridges, agricultural land, crops and public and private infrastructure were severely damaged.</p>
<p>He noted that only Rs1bn was allocated in the GB budget for emergencies and that the local government is also burdened with Rs3bn in liabilities from past disaster rehabilitation efforts.</p></p>

            <p><p>Nine passengers died and 30 others were injured after the bus they were travelling on fell into a ditch near Balkassar Interchange in Punjab’s Chakwal district on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson of Chakwal Rescue 1122, the bus was heading to Lahore from Islamabad when one of its tyres burst near the Balkassar Interchange on the Islamabad-Lahore Motorway (M2).</p>
<p>The driver lost control of the bus, causing the vehicle to fall into a ditch and overturn.</p>
<p>“Nine people died in the accident and 30 were injured,” Dr Saeed Akhter, chief executive officer of the Chakwal District Health Authority (DHA), said in a statement.</p>
<p>It added that Chakwal Deputy Commissioner Sarah Hayat and Assistant Commissioner Zeeshan Sharif also visited the injured at the District Healthquarters (DHQ) Hospital.</p>
<p>DC Hayat, who was briefed on the accident’s details, directed that all possible medical facilities be provided to the wounded.</p>
<p>Eight passengers died on the spot, while one succumbed to her injuries at the hospital, according to an earlier police statement. The bus driver was among the deceased.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>According to the Rescue 1122 statement, there were over 40 passengers on the bus.</p>
<p>As per the list issued by the rescue service, an eight-month and a one-year-old infant were among four children who lost their lives. The eldest person among the deceased was 45 years old, while the injured were aged between 16 and 55 years.</p>
<p>Two sisters aged 14 and two years were among the dead, while their mother was injured. A woman from Philippines, identified as Emy Dela Cruz and married in Lahore, was also among the wounded.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 had dispatched six rescue vehicles to the crash site, while personnel of National Highways and Motorway Police, the Chakwal police and a team of the Frontier Works Organisation also reached the incident site.</p>
<p>Some of the injured were rushed to Kallar Kahar Tehsil Headquarters Hospital, while others and the bodies were taken to the Chakwal DHQ Hospital.</p>
<p>Dr Mukhtar Sarwar Niazi, medical superintendent at the DHQ Hospital, told <em>Dawn.com</em> earlier today that four out of 12 injured persons brought there were “critically injured” and were being referred to Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>Chakwal District Police Officer Ahmed Mohiuddin took notice of the incident and sent a team comprising senior police officials. “The site has been cordoned off and police are acting as per law”, a spokesperson of Chakwal Police said.</p>
<p>Chakwal Rescue and Safety Officer Shaukat Ali said: “Our rescue teams responded with professional expertise, providing immediate medical aid to the injured and transporting the deceased to the hospital.”</p>
<p>He urged the public to ensure complete vehicle fitness checks — especially tyre, brake and steering system inspections — before embarking on long journeys to prevent such tragic incidents.</p>
<p>Fatal road accidents on highways <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906089">occur frequently</a> in Pakistan, mainly due to overspeeding, hazardous overtaking and disregard for traffic rules.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926915/3-new-polio-cases-confirmed-in-kp-sindh-as-nationwide-tally-climbs-to-17' target='_blank'><strong>3 new polio cases confirmed in KP, Sindh as nationwide tally climbs to 17</strong></a>
            <p><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Islamabad on Saturday confirmed three new polio cases in the country, taking the total number of cases detected this year to 17.</p>
<p>Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.</p>
<p>The latest cases include one each from the Lakki Marwat and North Waziristan districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and one from Sindh’s Umerkot district, a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.endpolio.com.pk/media-room/media-releases/2648-new-polio-cases-in-kp-and-sindh-reinforce-need-for-every-child-s-vaccination" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme (PPEP) said.</p>
<p>A 15-month-old girl from Takhtikhel in Lakki Marwat, a six-month-old girl from North Waziristan’s Mir Ali tehsil and a five-year-old boy from Umerkot’s Chajro were the latest polio cases confirmed by the NIH’s Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication.</p>
<p>With these new detections, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has risen to 17 — including 10 from KP, five from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914951">Gilgit-Baltistan</a>.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>A special vaccination campaign was held from July 21-27 in the bordering area of KP and Balochistan to coincide with Afghanistan’s sub-national polio campaign.</p>
<p>In addition, a fractional vaccination campaign began in Chaman on July 21 and will roll out in six districts of Balochistan from July 28.</p>
<p>“Despite substantial progress in polio eradication efforts, the continued detection of polio cases underscores the persistent risk to children, especially in areas where vaccine acceptance remains low.</p>
<p>“It is crucial for communities to understand that poliovirus can resurface wherever immunity gaps exist. Every unvaccinated child is at risk and can also pose a risk to others,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921935">reaffirmed</a> Pakis­tan’s commitment to eradicating polio, vowing to intensify efforts with the support of international, provincial and local teams.</p></p>
