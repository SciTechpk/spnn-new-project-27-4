                <h2>6 killed, 12 injured as bus overturns in Sindh‚Äôs Thatta: rescue service</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least six people were killed and 12 others were injured when a bus overturned and fell into a ditch near Makli in Sindh‚Äôs Thatta district on Sunday morning, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>According to the Edhi rescue service, the bus overturned near the Thatta Bypass, following which a rescue team reached the site of the incident and transported the injured to a hospital.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe bodies of the six victims were initially taken to a mortuary in Orangi Town,‚Äù the service said in a statement, adding that they were later transported to Edhi‚Äôs morgue in Karachi‚Äôs Sohrab Goth.</p>
<p>The bus was carrying a group of picnickers from Karachi to Keenjhar Lake when it overturned while taking a sharp turn, killing six passengers and injuring dozens others, state-owned <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLocal authorities and rescue teams were quick to respond, reaching the crash site within minutes. The injured were rushed to Karachi hospitals, with several reported to be in critical condition,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>In another incident, at least one person was killed and several others, including women and children, were critically injured when a passenger bus overturned on the Gambat National Highway in Sindh‚Äôs Khairpur district.</p>
<p>According to <em>APP</em>, the incident took place while the bus was en route from Karachi to Swabi. Rescue teams, along with local police, reached the incident site and rushed the injured to nearby hospitals for medical aid.</p>

<p>Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah expressed deep sorrow over the loss of lives in the bus accidents, according to a statement issued by his spokesperson Abdul Rashid Channa.</p>
<p>Expressing sympathy with the Makli incident victims, he issued directives to the Thatta deputy commissioner (DC) to ensure the provision of immediate medical assistance to the injured. The chief minister further told him to immediately contact their families and fully cooperate.</p>
<p>Expressing sorrow over the Khairpur coach accident, CM Murad issued similar instructions to the Khairpur DC to ensure medical treatment of the wounded. He urged people to drive carefully to protect precious lives.</p>
<p>Accidents are common on highways and motorways across Pakistan, caused by reckless driving, speeding, driver fatigue, and poor vehicle maintenance. Poor road conditions contribute to mishaps, while weak enforcement of traffic laws allows violations to go unchecked, worsening the situation.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, four people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924364">lost</a> their lives and another six were injured ‚Äî all from the same family ‚Äî after their speeding car crashed into a wall next to a drain on Hawkes‚Äô Bay Road in Karachi‚Äôs Mauripur area.</p>
<p>South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said the family was returning from the Hawke‚Äôs Bay beach, and the accident most likely happened as a result of speeding.</p>
<p>In an incident on July 15, a collision between a trailer and a truck left one dead and three injured near Karachi‚Äôs New Sabzi Mandi on the Super Highway.</p>
<p>On June 19, a speeding dumper truck overturned on a 4x4 vehicle on Rashid Minhas Road, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918288">killing</a> a woman and an accompanying five-year-old girl.</p>
<p>On June 11, a young man was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916541">killed</a> and his wife injured in an accident after an unknown vehicle hit their bike on the Super Highway. The same day, two boys were killed after a water tanker hit them near Abdullah College in North Nazimabad.</p></p>

                <h2>Pak-India cricket veteran match cancelled after Indian players pull out of game</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A cricket match between Indian and Pakistani veteran players ‚Äî part of the World Championship of Legends (WCL) ‚Äî was called off after Indian players, including Shikhar Dhawan, refused to play against Pakistan, citing recent ‚Äúgeopolitical tensions‚Äù between the two nations, according to a statement issued by WCL on Sunday.</p>
<p>The WCL is an international cricket league where retired, non-contracted international players return to competitive T20 cricket, according to the league‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://edgbaston.com/wcl/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website.</a> The tournament commenced on July 18 and is being held in Birmingham, England.</p>
<p>In a statement posted on X, WCL organisers announced that, ‚ÄúWe have decided to call off the India vs Pakistan match,‚Äù saying that the match between the two countries was planned in light of recent positive development between India and Pakistan, indicating improved bilateral sporting ties.</p>

<p>The statement cited a recent volleyball match between the rival nations and speculations around Pakistan‚Äôs hockey team touring India later this year.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <em>Press Trust of India</em> (PTI) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923823">reported</a> that Pakistan is to review the security situation in India before taking a call on sending its hockey teams to the neighbouring country for the Asia Cup and Junior World Cup to be held later this year.</p>
<p>The decision to cancel the WCL match came after Indian veteran cricketer Shikhar Dhawan refused to play against Pakistan, according to a statement posted on his X account, showing a screenshot of an email sent to notify the player‚Äôs withdrawal from the match.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

    </figure></p>
<p>The statement cited ‚Äúcurrent geopolitical situation and prevailing tensions between India and Pakistan‚Äù as the reason for withdrawal.</p>
<p>WCL, in its statement, apologised for ‚Äúhurting‚Äù people‚Äôs sentiments and causing discomfort to Indian players for WCL‚Äôs decision to hold the match in the first place.</p>
<p>The match ‚Äî scheduled for Sunday (today) ‚Äî was to be the first between the two nations in the tournament. The Pakistani team is being led by Mohammed Hafeez, while Yuvraj Singh is leading the Indian side.</p>
<p>According to WCL‚Äôs website, the tournament is set to run until August 2 with participation from England, India, Pakistan, Australia, West Indies, and South Africa.</p>
<p>WCL will be held across four English cities ‚Äî Birmingham, Northampton, Leeds, and Leicester.</p>
<p>In May, Pakistan and India stepped back from an all-out war after a four-day military <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">confrontation</a> ‚Äî the worst in decades ‚Äî in the aftermath of the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack </a> in India-occupied Kashmir. New Delhi blamed Pakistan for the attack without evidence, launching <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988">Operation Sindoor.</a> Islamabad has denied the accusations.</p>
<p>The recent tensions also briefly cast a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915285">shadow</a> on this year‚Äôs Asia Cup, with speculation that India would pull out of the Asia Cup. However, the two teams are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921620">expected</a> to face each other in the tournament in September this year.</p>
<p>Meamwhile, India‚Äôs head coach Gautam Gambhir has called for a complete <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908921">halt</a> to cricketing engagements with Pakistan at any forum.</p></p>
