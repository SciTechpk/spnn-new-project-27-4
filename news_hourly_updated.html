                <h2>Dar fears ‚Äòanother Indian ploy‚Äô on Jammu statehood</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p><strong>‚Ä¢ Following meeting of top Indian leaders, media from across the border has been speculating about possible change in disputed region‚Äôs status<br />
‚Ä¢ Foreign minister says internationally recognised dispute can‚Äôt be settled through amendments to local laws</strong></p>
<p>KARACHI: Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has expressed the apprehension that India is likely to make occupied Jammu a separate state, adding that any such move would be in violation of international conventions and UN Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p>He expressed the fear while addressing a rally at Islamabad‚Äôs D-Chowk on Tuesday, held to mark six years since India unilaterally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1498227">changed</a> the special status of occupied Kashmir and bifurcated the region into the union territories of Jammu and Kash¬≠mir, and Ladakh.</p>
<p>The move allowed the BJP government in New Delhi to control the disputed region through its lieutenant governor.</p>
<p>In recent days, the Indian media has been reporting a plan by the BJP government to give the occupied region of Jammu the status of a state.</p>
<p><em>The Hindustan Times</em> reported that a meeting of top Indian government functionaries, including the president, prime minister and home minister, took place recently, leading to speculation about an impending move on the region‚Äôs statehood.</p>
<p>The paper quoted a senior BJP leader as saying that statehood for Jammu and Kashmir was ‚Äúa promise that the government has already made‚Ä¶ and it will be done when the time is right‚Äù.</p>
<p>However, he refused to comment on speculation that a decision will be taken in the next few days.</p>
<p>Amid the speculation, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said in a post on X: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard every possible permutation &amp; combination about what to expect in J&amp;K tomorrow so let me stick my neck out and say nothing will happen tomorrow ‚Äî fortunately nothing bad will happen but unfortunately nothing positive will happen either.‚Äù</p>

<p>Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated into two union territories after the Indian parliament, on August 5, 2019, passed the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill and abrogated Articles 370 and 35 (A) that gave special powers to the region.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄòSubservient govt‚Äô</strong></p>
<p>In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr Dar said that New Delhi may take another rash step in the next few hours, or days. He called the Aug 5, 2019, measures India‚Äôs attempt to ‚Äúusurp Kashmir‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and took it under the direct control of New Delhi,‚Äù he said, adding that the move was further <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1796946">consolidated</a> by the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision in 2023, which gave ‚Äústamp of approval‚Äù to the con¬≠troversial decision. Mr Dar said Jammu and Kashmir was an internationally recognised dispute and it can‚Äôt be settled through amendments in local laws.</p>
<p>In the last six years, he said, the BJP government had amended local laws governing Kashmir; the powers of the lieutenant governor have been increased and the delimitation of the region‚Äôs legislative assembly changed to ‚Äúinfluence the representation of Muslims in Kashmir‚Äù.</p>
<p>He said non-Kashmiris have been allowed to obtain domicile, purchase properties and become part of the voter list.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll these steps were taken to make Kashmir a separate state and form a government in Srinagar which is subservient to New Delhi.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is unacceptable to Pakistan and its people,‚Äù the foreign minister warned.</p>

                <h2>NAB gets go-ahead to sell off Bahria Town assets</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday dismissed petitions filed against the planned <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913654">auction</a> of five Bahria Town properties in Rawalpindi and one in Islamabad, enabling the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to proceed with the sale, scheduled for Aug 7.</p>
<p>Shortly after the issuance of a short order by the division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Asif, NAB Rawalpindi announced fresh auction of six properties of Bahria Town at NAB office in Islamabad‚Äôs Sector G-6/1.</p>
<p>The properties are being auctioned after Malik Riaz was declared an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1803717">absconder</a> in the ¬£190 million Al-Qadir Trust case.</p>
<p>Reacting to the development, Bahria Town Chairman Malik Riaz Hussain said they were willing to participate in any arbitration and implement its decision, if they are granted a chance to ‚Äúreturn to serious dialogue and a dignified solution‚Äù.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MalikRiaz_/status/1952732889071673567" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on his official X account, he claimed government agencies had been exerting unprecedented pressure over the past few months, which included the arrest of dozens of staff members, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918907/nab-freezes-457-properties-over-btk-land-scam">freezing</a> of the company‚Äôs bank accounts, seizure of vehicles and other stringent measures, which had paralysed all of the Bahria Town‚Äôs operations across the country.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe situation has reached a point where we are being forced to completely shut down all Bahria Town activities across Pakistan,‚Äù said the statement attributed to Malik Riaz.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTrillions of rupees of investment by millions of Pakistanis in Bahria Town from Karachi to Lahore and Islamabad have been frozen,‚Äù he claimed.</p>

<p><strong>Court proceedings</strong></p>
<p>Representing Bahria Town in court, senior lawyer Farooq H. Naik earlier argued that NAB‚Äôs auction notice was ‚Äúillegal, deceptive, and issued with mala fide intent‚Äù.</p>
<p>He said the properties were being wrongfully targeted as Bahria Town was not a party to a plea bargain agreement. He said Bahria Town was also not named as an accused in any reference related to the ¬£190 million case. He warned that the auction would set a dangerous precedent, undermining due process and investor confidence.</p>
<p>However, NAB prosecutor Rafay Maqsood contended that Bahria Town‚Äôs chairman and his son Ali Riaz defaulted on payments after entering into a plea bargain under the ¬£190 million settlement. As a result, NAB initiated steps to recover the outstanding amount under Section 33E of the NAB Ordinance, 1999, by auctioning the pledged properties.</p>
<p>Mr Maqsood said the petitioners approached the IHC after a trial court had dismissed a similar plea. He said the high court had initially stayed the auction on June 12, the same day when the sale was scheduled. Subsequently, NAB filed an application to vacate the stay against the auction.</p>
<p>Bahria Town‚Äôs legal team had consistently argued that the company was not involved in the ¬£190 million corruption case, which originated from a 2019 settlement between the UK‚Äôs National Crime Agency (NCA) and Malik Riaz.</p>
<p>With the verdict now issued, the auction will go ahead as planned on Aug 7.</p>
<p><strong>Auction tomorrow</strong></p>
<p>After the vacation of the stay order issued by the IHC against the auction in June, the NAB announced the auction of the six properties on Thursday.</p>
<p>According to the anti-graft watchdog, successful bidders would have to pay 5pc of the value of the properties on the auction day, 10pc in a month and remaining 85pc in three months.</p>
<p>In a notification issued on Tuesday, NAB listed the six properties including corporate offices on Plots 7-D (having estimated value of Rs871m) and 7-E (estimated value of Rs881m) in Bahria Town‚Äôs Phase-II, Rawalpindi; Rubaish Marquee and Lawn in Islamabad (Rs488m), Arena Cinema (Rs1.1bn), Bahria Town International Academy (Rs1.07bn) and Safari Club (Rs1.2bn), in Bahria Town, Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>The accountability watchdog also filed a reference against Malik Riaz, some Sindh politicians and others in February over the transfer of land to Bahria Town.</p>
