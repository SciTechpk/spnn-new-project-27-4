            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistani security sources said on Monday that India has once again begun “fake encounters” under the guise of countering terrorism, with an alleged plan to “use” detained Pakistanis in them, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/28-07-2025/india-starts-fake-encounters-under-guise-of-operation-mahadev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The statement came after the Indian Army’s Chinar Corps said they killed three alleged “terrorists” under ‘Operation Mahadev’ in occupied Kashmir’s Srinagar.

<p>India had launched <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913085">Operation Sindoor</a> in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, which included the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">deadly strikes</a> launched on Pakistan on May 7.</p>
<p>“After the failure of Operation Sindoor, India has once again initiated fake encounters under the guise of Operation Mahadev,” security sources said today.</p>
<p>Operation Mahadev has been “launched to conceal the setbacks of Operation Sindoor”, the security sources said, adding that the “Indian regime is allegedly preparing to use innocent Pakistanis, illegally and forcibly detained, in staged encounters, falsely portraying them as cross-border terrorists”.</p>

<p>India has seen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1176289/forest-killings-put-indias-fake-encounters-in-spotlight">fake encounters</a> as far back as 2015. The National Human Rights Commission of India — a quasi-judicial body — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1176289/forest-killings-put-indias-fake-encounters-in-spotlight#:~:text=Fake%20encounters%20rising">identified</a> 555 instances between 2008 and 2013, but activists say the actual count is even higher.</p>

<p>The objective of Operation Mahadev is to suppress the “growing freedom movement” in India-occupied Kashmir and to restore the “waning political credibility” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, the security sources added.</p>
<p>They said India was attempting to present Operation Mahadev as a “successful military initiative to erase the embarrassment of Operation Sindoor”.</p>
<p>The security sources highlighted that “immediately following the Pahalgam false flag operation, the Indian Army reportedly began a series of staged encounters”.</p>
<p>The sources further said that on April 24, two citizens of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Muhammad Farooq and Muhammad Deen, were “martyred in a brutal encounter by Indian forces after mistakenly crossing the border”.</p>
<p>Indian forces in occupied Kashmir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906955">arrested</a> more than 2,000 Kashmiris and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906600">demolished</a> several homes of pro-freedom Kashmiris in a sweeping <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075#:~:text=post%20on%20X.-,India%20hunts%20gunmen,-AFP%20journalists%20near">crackdown</a> following the Pahalgam incident.</p>

<p>The <em>Radio Pakistan</em> report, recalling the press briefings held on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">April 29</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907576">April 30</a> by military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, read that he “revealed details of 723 Pakistani nationals illegally detained in various Indian jails”.</p>
<p>“Additionally, 56 Pakistanis are said to be held in secret custody by Indian intelligence agencies.”</p>
<p>The security sources noted: “As is customary, following these alleged fake encounters, videos and photographs of the deceased, alongside planted weapons, are circulated in Indian media to support the official narrative.</p>
<p>“Reliable reports suggest that these detainees may be coerced into making anti-Pakistan statements and confessions before the media,” they added.</p>
<p>“Operation Mahadev appears to be a continuation of the Indian Army’s long-standing practice of fake encounters in IIOJK (Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir), where it has gained notoriety as a ‘fake encounter specialist’,” the sources said.</p>
<p>“India, having faced humiliation in the Pahalgam false flag operation and the failure of Operation Sindoor, now seems completely disoriented,” the security sources added.</p>

<p>“Three terrorists have been neutralised in an intense firefight,” the Indian army claimed in a statement on X.  “Operation continues,” it added.</p>

<p>The incident took place near the major Hindu shrine of Amarnath, to which more than 350,000 people from across India have travelled as part of an ongoing pilgrimage.</p>
<p>The army did not immediately identify those killed, but a police officer told <em>AFP</em> on condition of anonymity that they were all “foreigners”.</p>
<p>Security forces have been hunting for the Pahalgam attackers, but they remain at large.</p>
<p>Clashes between fighters and government forces have drastically reduced during the last five years, but many local fighters have been killed since the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>Last month, the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.visionofhumanity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Global-Peace-Index-2025-web.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Global Peace Index 2025</a> placed the disputed region of Kashmir at the forefront of the critical escalation hotspots in the world.</p>

<p>The index released by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) with headquarters in Sydney, stated that the situation in occupied Kashmir exemplified the fragility of ceasefire agreements in volatile geographic settings and underscored the dangers posed by non-state actors capable of triggering international crises.</p>
<p>The Himalayan region of Kashmir has been at the heart of the hostility between old rivals India and Pakistan, both of whom claim the region in full and have fought two of their three wars over it.</p>
<p>India accuses Pakistan of helping Kashmiri fighters, but Pakistan denies this and says it only provides diplomatic and moral support to Kashmiris seeking self-determination.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said that New Delhi had ended its military conflict with Pakistan in May as it had met all its objectives and had not responded to pressure, rejecting United States President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925193">stance</a> that he brokered the truce.</p>
<p>Singh was speaking today at the opening of a discussion in parliament on the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>“India halted its operation because all the political and military objectives studied before and during the conflict had been fully achieved,” Singh said. “To suggest that the operation was called off under pressure is baseless and entirely incorrect.”</p>
<p>Pakistan thanked Trump for brokering the agreement, but India said Washington had no hand in it and that New Delhi and Islamabad had agreed between themselves to end the fighting.</p>
<p>During today’s parliament session, Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi slammed Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, noting that it had been 100 days since the Pahalgam attack but the government “has not been able to catch those five terrorists”, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.aninews.in/news/parliament-monsoon-session/general-news/100-days-since-pahalgam-terror-attack-but-those-five-terrorists-not-caught-gaurav-gogoi-attacks-bjp-led-government-in-lok-sabha20250728162301/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ANI</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>Indian opposition groups have questioned what they say is the intelligence failure behind the Pahalgam attack and the government’s inability to capture the assailants — issues they are expected to raise during the parliamentary discussion.</p>
<p>They have also criticised Modi for coming under pressure from Trump and agreeing to end the conflict, along with Indian jets being shot down during the fighting.</p>
<p>Pakistan said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">downed six</a> Indian planes in air-to-air combat. India’s highest-ranking general <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914500/indian-military-confirms-fighter-jets-shot-down-by-pakistan">said</a> in late May that India switched tactics after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909560">suffering losses</a> in the air on the first day of hostilities and established an advantage before a ceasefire was announced three days later.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Monday said Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur was “in contact” with the relevant administration over the incident of protesters being shot in Khyber district’s Tirah Valley.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927004">Seven people</a> were shot on Sunday after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926949">demonstration</a> outside the Brigade Headquarters in Bagh-Maidan Markaz against the death of a minor girl in a mortar strike in Tirah’s Zakhakhel.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the “firing on peaceful citizens by khawarij” — a term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). However, according to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927004#:~:text=Security%20personnel%20guar%C2%ADding%20the%20installation%20reportedly%20opened%20fire%20to%20control%20the%20crowd%2C%20according%20to%20sources.">sources</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926949#:~:text=some%20of%20the%20protesters%20alleged%20that%20the%20forces%20at%20the%20gates%20fired%20at%20them">protesters</a>, security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly had opened fire to control the crowd.</p>
<p>Besides the seven killed, at least 16 others also received bullet injuries, sources said. There has been no official statement from the local administration or the military about the mortar strike or Sunday’s killings.</p>
<p>“The chief minister is in constant contact with the relevant administration,” CM Gandapur’s public relations adviser, Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, said in a statement today.</p>
<p>He said the KP chief minister was “monitoring” the Tirah incident himself. “The KP government is extremely saddened over the incident,” Saif added.</p>
<p>“The provincial government is standing side by side with the affected families in this moment of sorrow and grief,” the official asserted.</p>

<p>Saif also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926565/saif-blasts-parties-boycotting-mpc-says-militancy-shared-challenge">again</a> slammed the KP opposition parties for not attending a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926456/gandapur-rails-against-good-taliban-bad-taliban-distinction">multi-party conference</a> (MPC) held last week over the security situation in the province, stressing that the moot had been organised “to prevent such incidents”.</p>
<p>The statement recalled that the provincial government will be holding a series of jirgas with tribal elders next week, including one in Peshawar. This is also based on the MPC’s decision to convene a jirga comprising elders, parliamentarians and stakeholders from each district.</p>
<p>According to CM Gandapur, a grand jirga, whose members will be nominated by the first jirga, would be organised 15 days after that to devise a strategy to implement the MPC’s declaration.</p>

<p>On Sunday, hundreds of tribesmen had brought the body of a girl, who they claimed was killed in a mortar strike in the Darbar locality of Peer Mela in Zakhakhel a day earlier, to the Brigade Headquarters.</p>

<p>Sources and eye-witnesses said the situation turned violent when an angry mob, comprising mostly young men, ignored calls by local elders to remain calm.</p>
<p>They first torched an excavator parked outside Brigade Headquarters, then tried to force open its main gate, following which security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly opened fire to control the crowd, according to sources.</p>
<p>However, in a statement from his office, PM Shehbaz said TTP terrorists were behind the incident as he expressed his grief over the “martyrdom of innocent and peaceful civilians”. The statement, carried by state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/27-07-2025/pm-expresses-grief-over-deaths-of-civilians-in-tirah-valley" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> and <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-expresses-grief-over-martyrdom-of-innocent-citizens-in-firing-in-tirah-valley/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">APP</a></em>, did not mention any protest.</p>
<p>He directed the authorities to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured.</p>
<p>“The nefarious designs of terrorists cannot shake our resolve,” the premier asserted, reaffirming the government’s commitment to eliminate terrorists and terrorism.</p>

<p>Videos circulating on social media showed an excavator on fire. Some protesters were also seen pelting stones at the Brigade Headquarters while trying to forcibly open the main gate. In the <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/Abdulghani1116/status/1949427908163891554" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">footage</a>, protesters could be seen running for cover as gunshots rang out.</p>
<p>The injured were transported to the Frontier Corps Hospital in Shah Kas Jamrud, Dogra Hospital in Bara and Hayatabad Medical Complex in Peshawar. One of the injured is said to be in critical condition.</p>
<p>Following the incident, security officials met with a delegation of Tirah elders at Brigade Headquarters and announced compensation for the victims on their demand. The KP government has also announced separate Rs10 million for the deceased and Rs2.5m for the injured.</p>
<p>Security officials said the local sector commander met with the Tirah elders and assured them of his full support in meeting their legitimate demands.</p>

<p>Residents in Peer Mela have claimed that mortar shelling by security forces has so far killed at least three persons over the last 10 days. They claimed that mortars were being fired as security forces conducted operations against armed militant groups in Zakhakhel, Shalobar, Adakhel and Malakdin Khel localities.</p>
<p>While a report on the mortar strike that was being protested could not be found, similar incidents in the Zakhakhel area took place in <a class="link--external" href="https://voicepk.net/2025/04/38196/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">April</a> this year and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878779">December 2024</a>, killing a child in each.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925907/mortar-shell-kills-two-children-in-kps-tank">two children</a> were killed on July 22 in a mortar shell blast in Raghzai village of the Tank district, Rescue 1122 said.</p>

<p>Tribal elders in Tirah and some other <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925049">KP districts</a> have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1711315">long opposed</a> any military operation, citing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892832">concerns</a> over displacement.</p>
