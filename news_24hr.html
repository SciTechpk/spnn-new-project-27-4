            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928471/pakistan-iran-set-8bn-annual-trade-target-to-boost-bilateral-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Iran set $8bn annual trade target to boost bilateral cooperation</strong></a>
            <p><p>Pakistan and Iran on Sunday agreed to elevate bilateral trade and achieve an annual trade volume of $8 billion, terming the move “a new phase of strategic economic partnership,” a statement from the commerce ministry said.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Iran share close ties and have signed multiple <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1829340">agreements</a> across sectors such as energy and trade.</p>
<p>The decision was made during a meeting between Commerce Minister Jam Kamal and the Iranian Minister for Industry, Mines and Trade, Mohammad Atabak, on the sidelines of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian’s two-day official <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928047">visit</a> to Pakistan.</p>
<p>According to the ministry’s statement, the high-level discussion marked a renewed commitment from both sides to accelerate trade, remove border bottlenecks, and build trust-based partnerships across priority sectors.</p>
<p>“[During the meeting], Kamal envisioned that, if fully leveraged, bilateral trade between Pakistan and Iran could easily exceed $5–8 billion annually in the coming years,” the ministry said.</p>
<p>Minister Kamal suggested organising targeted trade delegations that include representatives from federal and provincial chambers of commerce, enabling focused discussions on market access and regulatory facilitation, according to the statement.</p>
<p>“We’ve done this model successfully in Belarus and elsewhere,” he was quoted in the statement as saying. “Let’s do the same for Iran, starting with sectors that show the greatest potential for mutual benefit.”</p>
<p>The ministers also expressed a shared commitment to increasing the use of existing trade corridors and border facilities. Emphasis was placed on maximising the potential of neighbourhood trade, with Kamal highlighting how ASEAN countries have benefited enormously by trading within their region.</p>
<p>“Geography is an advantage. Pakistan and Iran must utilise this discount of distance. If we don’t, we lose both time and cost benefits,” he stated.</p>
<p>Atabak also highlighted ongoing discussions about increasing Pakistani exports to Iran and encouraged swift follow-up on newly signed agreements.</p>
<p>“Traders and industrialists in both countries are ready. They trust each other. What they need now is a clear and consistent facilitation mechanism from our side,” he noted.</p>
<p>Kamal said that beyond bilateral gains, such connectivity could expand to Turkey, Central Asia, Russia, and even parts of the Middle East, creating an economic bloc of substantial power and resilience.</p>
<p>Atabak supported the idea of holding a dedicated B2B day during every high-level visit and offered to bring Iranian business groups to Pakistan for in-depth meetings, the statement said.</p>
<p>The two ministers acknowledged the historic depth of Pakistan-Iran relations, expressing that recent regional and global developments have pushed both nations closer together.</p>
<p>“Without the rapid engagement and determination from you and your team, we wouldn’t have reached this stage. The momentum we’ve built must now be translated into structured trade outcomes,” Minister Atabak said while praising the Pakistani government’s proactive role in facilitating bilateral trade progress.</p>
<p>Kamal echoed similar sentiments, noting that both governments, as well as the private sector, had shown strong will and passion to work together.</p>
<p>“There’s a moment in diplomacy when the iron is hot—and this is that moment. We must act swiftly. Delays only complicate things,” he said.</p>
<p>He emphasised that formalities follow passion and political will, and highlighted that Pakistan is ready to deepen its economic relationship with Iran through structured channels like the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1829503">Joint Economic Commission (JEC)</a>, regular B2B exchanges, and sector-focused delegations.</p>
<p>Both ministers agreed on the importance of identifying specific sectors such as agriculture, livestock, services, energy, and cross-border logistics for future collaboration.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the human element of bilateral ties, both sides underscored the cultural and linguistic commonalities between the people of Pakistan and Iran.</p>
<p>The ministers agreed to fast-track the next session of the JEC, ensure participation from both public and private stakeholders, and prioritise border facilitation and trade logistics.</p>
<p>“With high-level political alignment and mutual trust, Pakistan and Iran appear poised to enter a new phase of strategic economic partnership that could reshape regional trade dynamics,” the statement said.</p>

<p>Separately,  Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called on President Pezeshkian on Sunday and conveyed Pakistan’s commitment to maintaining “brotherly ties” with Iran, according to a statement from the Foreign Office.</p>
<p>“Welcoming the Iranian president, the deputy prime minister/foreign minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s deep commitment to its historic and brotherly ties with Iran, emphasising their strong foundations in shared history, common cultural heritage, faith, and mutual respect,” the statement said.</p>
<p>President Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan’s support and reaffirmed Iran’s resolve to improve bilateral collaboration in various areas of shared interest. He also looked forward to meaningful discussions with Pakistani leaders to further reinforce the political and economic ties between the two friendly nations, the FO said.</p>

            <p><p>The nationwide death toll from monsoon rains has risen to 299, up from 234, as the season that began in late June continues to cause widespread devastation, the National Disaster Management Authority said on Sunday, according to state-owned <a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvworld/newsdetail/10212" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>PTV News</em></a>.</p>
<p>Monsoon <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926631">rains</a> fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. However, heavy downpours also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>According to earlier NDMA <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930">estimates</a>, the death toll stood at 234, while 596 people have been injured since June 26.</p>
<p>According to the latest figures, “at least 299 people have lost their lives in this year’s flash floods and torrential rains, while another 715 people were reported injured. Out of the total death toll — 140 were children, 102 men and 57 women,” the report said.</p>
<p>Out of the 715 injured, 239 were children, 204 were women, while 272 were men, it added.</p>

<p>Detailing the damage to public property sustained during the rains and floods triggered by heavy rain, the report estimated that a total of 1676 houses were damaged, out of which 562 homes were destroyed completely.</p>
<p>Around 428 livestock were lost during the rains, the report said.</p>
<p>Since June 26, NDMA has rescued and evacuated 2,880 people from impacted regions, while relief efforts were also underway. Per the report, the authority distributed 13,466 relief items including 1,999 tents, 61 ration bags, 958 blankets, 569 quilts, 613 mattresses, 1,282 kitchen sets, 1,163 food packs, 350 life jackets, 1,122 Hygiene home kits, 2,170 tarpaulins, and 146 de-watering pumps among other essential supplies.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928396/heavy-rain-likely-from-tomorrow-amid-urban-flooding-risk">forecasted</a> more rain, with wind-thundershowers in the upper and central regions of the country over the coming week. PMD prompted provincial disaster management authorities and district administrations to take preventive measures against possible urban flooding.</p>
<p>As per PMD’s latest forecast, rain, wind and thundershowers, with isolated heavy falls, are expected to hit the northern parts of the country, starting from August 4 till August 7.</p>
<p>Rainfall is expected in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Islamabad between these dates, while Gilgit Baltistan will receive rainfall starting from August 5.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Balochistan is forecast to experience mainly hot and humid weather, al­t­h­ough rain, wind and thundershowers are expec­t­ed in the northeastern and southern parts on Aug 6.</p>
<p>Sindh is likely to see hot and humid conditions in most parts, with cloudy weather and light rain expected in coastal areas.</p></p>

            <p><p>More than 400,000 Hindus took part in a month-long pilgrimage in Indian-held Kashmir, authorities said, shrugging off security worries weeks after a military conflict with Pakistan.</p>
<p>The pilgrimage <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921830/india-heightens-security-as-hindu-pilgrimage-begins-near-pahalgam">began</a> on July 3 and closes officially on August 9, but organisers said that lashing rains had damaged narrow paths, forcing a premature end.</p>
<p>Official Vijay Kumar Bidhuri said in a statement late on Saturday that 415,000 pilgrims had taken part.</p>
<p>Many of the faithful began their trek to the Amarnath ice pillar from near Pahalgam, where an April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in Pahalgam killed 26 mostly Hindu tourists in the Muslim-majority region.</p>
<p>New Delhi, without evidence, said the gunmen were backed by Pakistan, claims Islamabad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">rejected</a> — triggering a series of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat</a> diplomatic measures that escalated into a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.stimson.org/2025/four-days-in-may-the-india-pakistan-crisis-of-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four-day</a> conflict.</p>
<p>It was the worst standoff by the nuclear-armed nations since 1999, with more than 70 people killed in missile, drone and artillery fire on both sides, before a May 10 ceasefire.</p>
<p>New Delhi last week claimed that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927416/indian-opposition-assails-modi-in-parliament-for-failures-in-pak-india-conflict#:~:text=Amit%20Shah%20claims%20three%20%E2%80%98Pakistanis%E2%80%99%20involved%20in%20Pahalgam%20attack%20killed">three</a> Pakistani men who carried out the Pahalgam attack were killed during a gun battle on July 28 in forests adjacent to the hills where the cave shrine is located.</p>
<p>A few devotees may still visit the cave, but the numbers this year fall short of the estimated half a million devotees who took part in 2024.</p>
<p>Officials appealed to Hindus to undertake the pilgrimage, ramping up security for the event by deploying 45,000 troops with high-tech surveillance tools overseeing the gruelling trek to the cave, dedicated to Shiva, the deity of
destruction.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Indian forces exchanged fire with gunmen for a third day in Kulgam, far from the Amarnath pilgrimage route.</p>
<p>Soldiers have killed two fighters, a senior police officer said.</p></p>
