<p>‚ÄúDeputy Prime Minister [and] Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar, today signed, on behalf of Pakistan, the convention on the establishment of the International Organisation for Mediation in Hong Kong,‚Äù the statement by the FO read.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Dar appreciated the Chinese leadership for its wisdom in developing and consistently leading efforts for the establishment of IOMed and in fostering a global community with a shared future, the statement added.</p>
<p>He added that the creation of IOMed underscores the indispensability and significance of multilateralism as the centrepiece for international peace, stability, and development.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIOMeD also offers new opportunities and fresh hopes to build a more inclusive, more just and more equitable world. As one of the founding members of IOMed, Pakistan would continue to be an active voice in this noble mission,‚Äù the statement quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>The deputy PM underlined Pakistan‚Äôs strong commitment towards promoting peace and security as well as development. He elaborated on the critical importance of advancing and preserving multilateralism through faithful adherence to the principles of the UN Charter, full implementation of UN Security Council resolutions, as well as international law.</p>
<p>He also drew attention to India‚Äôs violation of international law through its acts of aggression against Pakistan and its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914001/fo-slams-modis-censure-of-iwt">unlawful holding in abeyance</a> of the Indus Waters Treaty. He also highlighted the occupation of Jammu and Kashmir and the occupied Palestinian Territories as drivers of conflict to regional peace and security.</p>
<p>Dar called for the resolution of the longstanding Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>The idea for the establishment of the IOMed was one of the key outcomes of the 2nd Belt and Road Forum held in Beijing in April 2019. China initiated discussions for the establishment of IOMed in 2021, and invited Pakistan to join negotiations as one of its founding members, the statement added.</p>
<p>The organisation is open to all countries; is based on respect for the sovereignty, core interests and legitimate concerns of every country; aims to promote dialogue and trust between parties concerned based on equality; and desires inclusion of various legal systems, and their mediators, the FO said.</p></p>

            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday, rejecting the weaponisation of water, warned that Pakistan would not allow India to cross the red line by holding the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance and endangering millions of lives for narrow political gains.</p>
<p>Delhi suspended its participation in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">Indus Waters Treaty</a> (IWT) of 1960, which governs the usage of the Indus river system, shortly after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">26 civilians</a> in India-held Kashmir were killed in what India called an act of terror.</p>
<p>Pakistan has denied involvement in the incident, but accord remains ‚Äúin abeyance‚Äù by India despite the two nuclear-armed neighbours agreeing to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910113/world-community-hails-ceasefire-decision-between-pakistan-and-india">ceasefire</a> this month following the worst fighting between them in decades.</p>

<p>After the April 22 attack, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered officials to expedite planning and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908603/india-starts-work-on-hydro-projects-after-suspending-treaty-with-pakistan-say-sources">execution</a> of projects on the Chenab, Jhelum and Indus rivers, three bodies of water in the Indus system that are designated primarily for Pakistan‚Äôs use, six people told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>The three-day International Conference on Glaciers‚Äô Preservation is being held in Tajikistan‚Äôs capital Dushanbe from May 29-31.</p>
<p>It is being attended by over 2,500 delegates from 80 UN member states and 70 international organisations, including prime ministers, vice presidents, ministers, and UN assistant secretaries-general.</p>
<p>The event is being hosted by the Tajikistan government in collaboration with the United Nations, UNESCO, WMO, the Asian Development Bank, and other key partners as a historic moment for climate ambition, glacier preservation, and international cooperation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs unilateral and illegal decision to hold in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty, which governs the sharing of the Indus Basin‚Äôs water, is deeply regrettable,‚Äù PM Shehbaz said while addressing the conference.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMillions of lives must not be held hostage to narrow political gains, and Pakistan will not allow this. We will never allow the red line to be crossed,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>During his address, PM Shehbaz touched upon all relevant issues, including glacial preservation, Pakistan‚Äôs climate vulnerability, the 2022 floods in Pakistan, global climate action and responsibility, scientific projections on glacial melt, weaponisation of water and call to protect nature and humanity‚Äôs shared destiny.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe world today bears fresh scars from the use of conventional weapons in Gaza that have left deep wounds. As if that were not enough, we are now witnessing an alarming new low‚Äîthe weaponisation of water,‚Äù PM Shehbaz observed.</p>
<p>He added that Pakistan, being home to over 13,000 glaciers, was the most concerning as glaciers contributed nearly half of the annual flows in the Indus river system ‚Äî ‚Äúthe lifeline of our civilisation, culture and economy‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe five great rivers that shape our geographical landscape‚ÄîIndus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej‚Äîall depend on the stability of glacial systems. This makes Pakistan one of the most vulnerable countries to any climatic changes that impact glaciers,‚Äù he continued.</p>
<p>He told the gathering that Pakistan had faced the peril of glacial melt in the form of devastating floods in 2022 that destroyed millions of acres of standing crops, thousands of houses as well as infrastructure ‚Äî despite the country contributing only less than half a per cent of the total world‚Äôs emissions and yet being one of the 10 most vulnerable countries.</p>
<p>He prayed that no other country faced such devastation, which necessitated a comprehensive plan and immediate implementation.</p>
<p>Referring to the ‚Äúsobering‚Äù scientific projections, he highlighted that glacial melt in the country‚Äôs region was expected to accelerate flooding in the coming decades, followed by a drastic decline in river flows as glaciers recede further.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese changes threaten our fragile ecosystem. As we inch closer to these grim new realities, we must heed the alarm bells, deflection signs of haunting consequences‚Äîlost livelihoods, displaced families, and deep chaos,‚Äù he warned.</p>
<p>Highlighting Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to shared responsibility and collective action, he called for enhanced global climate action to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe developed countries must meet their climate financial commitments without any delay and with a balanced focus on adaptation and mitigation as well as loss and damage.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAdequate funding for climate resilience, infrastructure, and overcoming financing gaps remains critical for climate-vulnerable countries,‚Äù the prime minister emphasised.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInvestment must be made in early warning systems and disaster preparedness and management.‚Äù</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz reflected on his childhood memories of swimming in the Ravi river, underscoring how rivers like Ravi and Tajikistan‚Äôs Vakhsh river, fed by glaciers, sustained life across regions, and that the shared water sources symbolised a common ecological destiny, requiring collective efforts for their preservation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet us protect and preserve nature‚Äôs precious bounties for our planet and our peoples,‚Äù he urged.</p>
