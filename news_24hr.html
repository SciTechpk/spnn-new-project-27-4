            <p><p>Rescue teams pulled more bodies from the rubble of a five-storey <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050">building collapse</a> in Karachi overnight, taking the toll on Saturday to 15 as the recovery operation continued for a second day,</p>
<p>The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, which was further weakened by recent rains, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922231#:~:text=DIG%20South%20Syed%20Asad%20Raza%20told%20Dawn">said</a> Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza.</p>
<p>Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed confirmed to <em>Dawn.com</em> that the toll had risen to 15. She added that there were nine wounded people since yesterday, out of whom six had been discharged and one had serious injuries.</p>
<p>“Rescue operation is still underway in Baghdadi, Lyari where the building had collapsed on Friday,” DIG Raza told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>

<p>Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.</p>
<p>Karachi, home to more than 20 million, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.</p>
<p>There were conflicting reports of the death toll, with Rescue 1122 stating it as 16 and DIG Raza saying that a 17th body was recovered from the rubble.</p>
<p>“On one side, debris has been removed up to the ground floor, while on the other side, the rescue team has removed debris up to the third floor,” the police officer added.</p>
<p>The deceased included nine men, six women and a child, according to a statement by Rescue 1122. Their bodies had been taken to the Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK).</p>
<p>“My daughter is under the rubble,” 54-year-old Dev Raj told <em>AFP</em> at the scene.</p>
<p>“She was my beloved daughter. She was so sensitive but is under the burden of debris. She got married just 6 months ago.”</p>
<p>Rescue teams worked throughout the night, and families said that at least eight people were still believed to be trapped as temperatures climbed to 33 degrees Celsius in the morning.</p>
<p>Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, leading the Rescue 1122 efforts at the scene, told <em>AFP</em> that the operation continued through the night “without interruption”. “It may take eight to 12 hours more to complete,” he said earlier today.</p>
<p>Up to 100 people had been living in the building, senior police officer Arif Aziz told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>The incident came days after a portion of a building <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921188/no-casualties-reported-as-22-rescued-from-partially-collapsed-building-in-karachis-kharadar">collapsed</a> in the city’s Kharadar area. However, no casualties or injuries were reported.</p>
<p>The Public Account Committee of the Sindh Assembly had directed the provincial government in December to take urgent steps to evacuate over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879565">570 buildings</a> declared “dangerous” by authorities across Karachi.</p>

<p>The Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=SBCA%20says%20issued%20multiple%20prior%20notices%20to%20vacate%20building">said</a> it had declared the plot as dangerous through its Technical Committee for Dangerous Buildings after a thorough inspection conducted in October 2022.</p>
<p>The authority said it had issued three ejectment notices to the residents since then, as well as asked K-Electric, Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) to disconnect utility services.</p>
<p>But Imran Khaskheli, an owner and resident watching the rescue operation on Saturday, denied receiving notices to <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>“Do you think we are out of our senses to stay in an unsafe building with our families?” he said. He told <em>AFP</em> he had seen cracks in the pillars of the building early on Friday morning.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“I knocked on all the doors and asked families to leave immediately,” Khaskheli said, adding that around 40 families lived in the building but that many did not heed his warning.</p>
<p>More than 50 buildings in the district have been declared unsafe, with six evacuated since yesterday, Karachi (South) Deputy Commissioner Javed Nabi Khoso told <em>AFP</em>.</p>

<p>Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922231#:~:text=Rescue%201122%20spokesperson%20Hassaanul%20Haseeb%20Khan%20told%20Dawn">said</a> the incident had reportedly occurred between 9am and 9:30am. However, they said they received the information late due to the suspension of communication networks, he added.</p>
<p>Mobile services are usually <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920725/army-to-be-deployed-across-country-for-security-during-muharram#:~:text=It%20was%20also%20agreed%20that%20any%20decision%20to%20suspend%20internet%20or%20mobile%20phone%20services%20will%20be%20made%20in%20consultation%20with%20provinces">suspended</a> in certain areas due to security concerns during Muharram.</p>
<p>Sindh Rescue 1122 Director General (DG) Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, in a statement, said yesterday there were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=Rescue%20DG%20lists%20%E2%80%98hinderances%E2%80%99%20in%20operations">hindrances</a> during the rescue operation due to the “unruly crowd, various road blockades and mobile network [issues]”.</p>
<p>Heavy machinery faced difficulty in reaching the site amid the narrow alleys of Lyari, a low-income neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Police even had to baton-charge a crowd that had gathered around the site to make way for machinery, officials added.</p>
<p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah sought a report on the collapse and details of dilapidated buildings from the SBCA.</p>
<p>Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani said a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=Saeed%20Ghani%20stresses%20timely%20evacuation%20of%20unsafe%20buildings">high-level committee</a> has been formed that will submit a report on the incident by Monday. He lamented that residents did not evacuate the building despite being served notices previously.</p>
<p>The minister also ordered the suspension of the related officials at the SBCA.</p>

            <p><p>Karachi’s central mourning procession of Muharram 9 left Nishtar Park towards its destination of Hussainiya Iraniyan Imambargah in Kharadar on Saturday amid tight security, according to police.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Karachi Traffic Police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921828">issued</a> a traffic plan for Muharram 8 to 10, outlining the procession routes as well as alternative traffic flows.</p>

            <p><p>Turkiye arrested three more opposition mayors early on Saturday as part of an investigation into alleged graft, officials from the main opposition, the Republican People’s Party (CHP) said, denouncing it as a “political operation”.</p>
<p>The early morning arrests were the latest move targeting elected officials of the CHP as the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan puts increasing pressure on the party, which won a huge victory against his Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the 2024 local elections and is rising in the polls.</p>
<p>The arrests were linked to an investigation into alleged <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899828">graft</a> which resulted in the removal in March of Istanbul’s powerful opposition mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, whose <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899058">jailing</a> sparked mass <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901088">protests</a> in Turkiye’s worst street unrest since 2013.</p>
<p>Imamoglu is Erdogan’s biggest political rival and the CHP’s candidate for the 2028 presidential race.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, police arrested more than 120 people as part of a probe into alleged graft in the opposition stronghold of Izmir, Turkiye’s third city.</p>

<p>The latest detainees were based in southern Turkiye: mayor of the southern city of Adana, Zeydan Karalar; mayor of the resort town of Antalya, Muhittin Bocek; and the mayor of Adiyaman in the southeast, Abdurrahman Tutdere.</p>
<p>“In a system where the law bends and sways according to politics, where justice is applied for one group and ignored for another, no one should expect us to trust in the rule of law or believe in justice,” <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/mansuryavas06/status/1941376901148192864" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Mansur Yavas on X, opposition mayor of the capital Ankara.</p>

<p>DEM has in recent months been working closely with Erdogan’s government to facilitate moves to end the decades-long conflict with the Kurds, facilitating talks which in May saw Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) rebels <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910684">ending</a> their bloody armed struggle in a conflict that cost nearly 40,000 lives.</p>
<p>Saturday’s arrests were the latest in a slew of legal manoeuvres targeting the CHP.</p>
<p>On Monday, an Ankara court began hearing a case against the party involving allegations of vote-buying at its 2023 leadership primary which could end up overturning the election of CHP’s popular leader <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898976">Ozgur Ozel</a>, who rose to prominence for his role in leading the March protests.</p>
