            <p><p>The National Elec­t­ric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Wednesday <a class="link--external" href="https://www.nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/K-Electric/2025/TRF-362%20K-ELECTRIC%20PROVISION%20MONTHLY%20FCA%20APRIL%202025%2009-07-2025%2010505-09.PDF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notified</a> a negative fuel cost adjustment (FCA) of Rs4.03 per unit for K-Electric (KE) consumers in July’s bills for power consumed in April.</p>
<p>According to a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/K-Electric/2025/TRF-362%20K-ELECTRIC%20PROVISION%20MONTHLY%20FCA%20APRIL%202025%2009-07-2025%2010505-09.PDF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a> issued by Nepra today, the authority “decided to allow a negative FCA of 4.0349/kWh for April 2025, to be passed on to the consumers in the billing month of July 2025”.</p>
<p>Nepra said the negative FCA would apply to “all the consumer categories except lifeline consumers, domestic protected consumers, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and prepaid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for pre-paid tariff”.</p>
<p>The adjustment would be shown separately in the consumers’ bills on the basis of units billed to the consumers in the respective month to which the adjustment pertains, it said.</p>
<p>“In case any bills of July 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in the subsequent month,” the notification said.</p>
<p>It also said that KE shall reflect the fuel charges adjustment in respect of April in the billing month of July.</p>
<p>The notification said that the negative FCA of Rs.4.0349/kWh was being allowed on a “provisional basis subject to adjustment” once Nepra determined KE’s Multi-Year Tariff for FY2024-30. “The difference in cost, if any, based on the MYT FY 2024-30 would be allowed in future adjustments once the same is notified,” it added.</p>
<p>Separately, Nepra also <a class="link--external" href="https://www.nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/Ex-WAPDA%20DISCOS/2025/TRF-100%20MFPA%20FCA%20MONTH%20OF%20MAY%202025%20FOR%20EX-WAPDA%20DISCOs%2009-07-2025%2010512-27.PDF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notified</a> a Rs0.49 per unit negative FCA following an adjustment on account of variation in fuel charges for May in the approved tariff of ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos).</p>
<p>According to a separate <a class="link--external" href="https://www.nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/Ex-WAPDA%20DISCOS/2025/TRF-100%20MFPA%20FCA%20MONTH%20OF%20MAY%202025%20FOR%20EX-WAPDA%20DISCOs%2009-07-2025%2010512-27.PDF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a> issued today, the authority “has reviewed and assessed a National Average Uniform decrease of Rs.0.4952/kWh in the applicable tariff for Discos on account of variations in the fuel charges for May”.</p>
<p>The notification said that the FCA should apply to all the consumer categories except lifeline consumers, protected consumers, EVCS and pre-paid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for prepaid tariffs.</p>
<p>“Discos shall reflect the fuel charges adjustment in respect of May 2025 in the billing month of July 2025,” the notification said, adding that it would be shown separately in the consumers’ bills based on units utilised in May.</p>
<p>“In case any bills of July 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in the subsequent month,” it added.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923094/new-delhi-lied-to-public-about-pahalgam-attack-bilawal-tells-indian-journalist' target='_blank'><strong>New Delhi ‘lied’ to public about Pahalgam attack, Bilawal tells Indian journalist</strong></a>
            <p><p>In an exclusive interview with Indian journalist Karan Thapar, PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Wednesday said the Indian public was “lied to” by New Delhi about Pakistan’s alleged involvement in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>The statement comes amid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913855/pakistan-slams-modis-inflammatory-monologue-urges-india-to-honour-international-order">tensions</a> between the two nuclear-armed countries in the wake of their recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military confrontation</a>, sparked by New Delhi’s baseless allegations against Islamabad over the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>In an interview with <em>The Wire’s</em> Thapar, the PPP chief said that had Pakistan been involved in the attack, evidence would have surfaced and the perpetrators identified.</p>
<p>This is the first interview given by a Pakistani representative to Indian media since the military escalation.</p>
<p>“As far as the Pahalgam terrorist attack is concerned, Pakistan has been willing to be part of an impartial international investigation; your government refused that,” Bilawal said.</p>
<p>Notably, Bilawal led a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916097">delegation</a> to present Pakistan’s case across the globe in the wake of the confrontation.</p>
<p>“To this day, the Indian government has not shared with Pakistan, with the international community, with the Indian public … who exactly are these individuals that were involved in this terrorist attack that are from Pakistan?”</p>
<p>When pressed on the issue, Bilawal said that if Pakistan was truly involved, the international community would endorse India’s perspective.</p>
<p>“It’s very uncomfortable for you that I point out the truth to the Indian public, that they have been lied to … that Pakistan was involved in this attack when we were not,” he asserted.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“The government has been unable to provide the evidence. That’s why during this war, the Indian media and the Indian government launched a campaign of disinformation to continue to bamboozle the people of India,” he added.</p>
<p>Last Friday, Bilal had told <em>Al Jazeera</em> that Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922101">no objection</a> to extraditing “individuals of concern” — namely Laskhar-i-Taiba (LeT) chief Hafiz Saeed and Jaish-i-Muhammad (JeM) chief Masood Azhar — to India as a confidence-building measure, as long as New Delhi showed willingness to cooperate in the process.</p>
<p>When Thapar asked about Saeed and the 2008 Mumbai attacks, Bilawal highlighted that the LeT chief was in prison and that the Mumbai attack case was still ongoing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/902591/remembering-the-mumbai-attacks">attacks</a> of November 26, 2008, targeting the symbols of India’s economic capital, including luxury hotels, left 166 people dead and more than 300 injured.</p>
<p>“As far as Hafiz Saeed is concerned, the founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba, he was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1684132">sentenced</a> to 31 years in prison for terrorist financing in April 2022 by Pakistan,” Bilawal said.</p>
<p>“As far as the Mumbai attack case is concerned, it’s absolutely true that the case is still sub judice. The frustration that the courts and the Pakistani government and legal system are having with achieving a conviction is that India is refusing to participate in the trial and produce the witnesses necessary to record their statements.”</p>
<p>Continuing his answer, Bilawal said, “I appeal to you that we need to work towards a place where Pakistan and India have that sort of relationship again, where we have that sort of cooperation, that we can deliver justice to the people of Mumbai.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Veteran journalist Zubeida Mustafa passed away on Wednesday in Karachi at 84, her family confirmed.</p>
<p>She was <a class="link--external" href="https://www.iwmf.org/community/zubeida-mustafa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">born</a> in India in 1941 and moved to Pakistan at a young age. She earned her undergraduate degree and graduate degree in international relations from the University of Karachi and began her career as a research officer at the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs in the 1960s.</p>
<p>She worked as an assistant editor at <em>Dawn</em>, where her career spanned 1975-2008. She was the first female journalist from Pakistan to receive an International Women’s Media Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award in <a class="link--external" href="https://www.zubeida-mustafa.com/?page_id=2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">May 2012</a>.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the Karachi Press Club hailed her as a “true icon and veteran of Pakistani journalism” who left behind a legacy “that will continue to inspire generations of journalists”.</p>
<p>“Zubeida Mustafa was not just a journalist; she was an institution. Her unwavering commitment to truth, her incisive analysis, and her relentless pursuit of social justice set a benchmark for ethical reporting. She was a pioneer, breaking barriers and paving the way for women in a field often dominated by men.</p>
<p>“Her work on social issues, education, and health was particularly impactful, demonstrating her deep empathy and dedication to improving the lives of ordinary citizens. The Karachi Press Club extends its heartfelt condolences to her family, friends and colleagues during this difficult time. Her absence will be deeply felt, but her contributions to journalism and society will never be forgotten. May her soul rest in eternal peace,” the press club said.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said it mourned the passing of a veteran journalist, columnist and editor who “championed social, cultural and language rights like few.</p>
<p>“She was a comrade-in-arms and stood by the disadvantaged and the oppressed. May her family and friends find strength to bear this irreparable loss.”</p>
