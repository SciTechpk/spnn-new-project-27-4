            <p><p>Pakistan on Monday conducted a successful training launch of a Fatah Series surface-to-surface missile with a range of 120 kilometres as part of ongoing “Ex Indus”, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7275" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>The test launch comes amid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908387">heightened tensions</a> between nuclear powers Pakistan and India in the wake of New Delhi’s aggressive measures in the wake of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>“The launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile’s advanced navigation system and enhanced accuracy,” the ISPR statement read.</p>

<p>The training launch was witnessed by senior officers of the army , as well as officers, scientists and engineers from Pakistan’s strategic organisations, the military’s media wing said.</p>
<p>The chairman joint chiefs of staff committee and the army chief congratulated the participating troops, scientists, and engineers.</p>
<p>“They expressed complete confidence in the operational preparedness and technical proficiency of [the] Pakistan Army to thwart any aggression against the territorial integrity of Pakistan,” the ISPR added.</p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari congratulated scientists and engineers, as well as the nation, on the successful test of the Fatah missile, according to a post on X by the PPP.</p>
<p>“The president appreciated the efforts of the security forces, scientists and engineers to strengthen the country’s defense.</p>
<p>“[He] reiterated national commitment to ensure national security and defence.”</p>

<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the efforts of the chairman joint chiefs of staff, the army chief, and the scientists and engineers involved in preparation for the launch, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office.</p>
<p>“The success of the training launch clearly shows that Pakistan’s defence is in strong hands.</p>
<p>“The prime minister expressed satisfaction over the professional capabilities of the Pakistan Army and its full preparedness for national defense,” the statement said.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the ISPR said that Pakistan had conducted a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908176">successful training launch</a> of the Abdali Weapon System, a surface-to-surface missile with a range of 450km.</p>
<p>In May last year, the army <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1833760">conducted a test-launch</a> of Fatah-II guided rocket system which had a range of 400 kilometres.</p>
<p>The guidance system makes this rocket a precision weapon enhancing its lethality and efficacy, while the trajectory mode and terminal guidance technology enables it to evade the enemy’s anti-ballistic missile systems.</p>

            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday said that a recent attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam was an attempt to “divert attention” from India’s internal challenges and its cross-border terrorism.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack%20were%20brought%20out">cross-border linkages</a>” of the att­a­­­c­kers.

<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> as it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an incursion and India’s premier granting “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war">military</a> warning of a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907785/any-military-misadventure-by-india-will-be-met-with-swift-resolute-notch-up-response-coas">swift</a>” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907930/us-hopes-that-indias-response-to-pahalgam-attack-doesnt-lead-to-broader-regional-conflict-vance">diplomatic channels</a> have remained engaged to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>Addressing the Regional Dialogue 2025 in Islamabad today, organised by the Institute of Regional Studies, Dar said Pakistan believed the Pahalgam attack was part of an effort to “divert attention” from India’s internal challenges, adding that it could be “self-choreographed”.</p>
<p>“We believe that what has happened is to divert attention — I am talking of Pahalgam — from India’s internal challenges, state-sponsored terrorism, the ongoing human rights violations in the Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir, and to gain narrow domestic political objectives,” Dar said.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget that there are some by-elections coming in the next few months in India,” he added, referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907658">upcoming polls in Bihar</a> in October.</p>
<p>“This brinkmanship carries consequences that extend far beyond India’s borders,” the deputy PM warned, calling India’s actions “unilateral, politically-motivated and highly provocative”.</p>
<p>He noted: “There appears to be a calculated and premeditated attempt to escalate regional tensions, following a familiar pattern — level allegations against Pakistan without evidence, use inflammatory rhetoric, incite war hysteria and use this as a pretext for aggression and unilateral actions.”</p>
<p>In a reference to the Indian government, Dar stressed that regional and international peace and security could not be “sacrificed at the altar of narrow electoral gains”.</p>
<p>“This is a dangerous political game and gamble, putting at stake the lives of millions in the region,” the foreign minister highlighted. However, he also reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace: “We will support all efforts towards de-escalation.”</p>
<p>“Analysts say this could be another ploy. It might have been self-choreographed,” echoing Pakistani leaders’ previous statements of the Pahalgam attack being a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906207">false flag operation</a>”.</p>
<p>“How can an FIR (first information report) be registered in 10 minutes at a police station where you need at least 45 minutes to reach? […] Come on. Nobody’s a fool,” Dar quipped.</p>
<p>“International dignitaries are talking [to] both sides. Few of them — great friends — suggested to me, ‘Can you try and help the perpetrators be caught?’ I said ‘come on, do you know the distance where it happened and where’s the Line of Control? 230 kilometres.”</p>
<p>“I cannot find the word abeyance in any international treaties’ dictionary. The word suspension is there.”</p>

<p>The two discussed matters of bilateral importance, with a particular focus on the ongoing situation between Pakistan and India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>The Chinese ambassador reaffirmed the “enduring and time-tested friendship between China and Pakistan”, describing the relationship as one of “ironclad brothers” who have always supported each other in challenging times.</p>
<p>He thanked Zardari for sharing Pakistan’s perspective, and emphasised that China would always support its ally to achieve the common desire of both countries to secure peace and stability in South Asia.</p>

<p>Zaradari conveyed his deep appreciation and gratitude to the Chinese government for its “consistent support, always standing by Pakistan in difficult times”.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907760">thanked China’s envoy</a> for endorsing his offer to conduct a neutral probe into the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>Last week, China had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907094/china-urges-india-pakistan-to-exercise-restraint-after-pahalgam-attack">urged</a> both India and Pakistan to “exercise restraint” as the two countries reportedly exchanged fire at the Line of Control (LoC).</p>

<p>A day ago, Islamabad decided to seek an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908460">immediate session</a> of the United Nations Security Council to apprise world powers about the recent tensions with India.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908460#:~:text=On%20Sunday%2C%20Prime%20Minister%20Shehbaz%20Sharif%20talked%20to%20his%20Malaysian%20counterpart%2C%20while%20Foreign%20Minister%20Ishaq%20Dar%20spoke%20to%20the%20Malaysian%20as%20well%20as%20Russian%20foreign%20ministers%2C%20a%20day%20ahead%20of%20Iran%E2%80%99s%20foreign%20minister%E2%80%99s%20arrival%20in%20Islamabad%20to%20discuss%20the%20same%20matter.">talked</a> to his Malaysian counterpart, while Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke to the Malaysian as well as Russian foreign ministers on the matter.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Foreign Office said FM Dar has issued directions to Pakistan’s permanent representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar, to take immediate steps for the UNSC session.</p>
<p>The instructions came two days after Ambassador Iftikhar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908062">said</a> Pakistan was closely following the situation stemming from India’s aggressive moves in the wake of the Pahalgam attack and would seek a UNSC meeting at an appropriate time.</p>
<p>“This important diplomatic move is part of Pakistan’s efforts to present true facts before the international community,” the statement said, adding that Pakistan decided to formally brief the UNSC on the latest situation in the region, as well as India’s aggressive steps and provocative statements.</p>
<p>It said Pakistan would specifically highlight the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty by India.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908598/poliovirus-detected-in-sewage-samples-from-18-districts-across-country' target='_blank'><strong>Poliovirus detected in sewage samples from 18 districts across country</strong></a>
            <p><p>Environmental samples collected from 18 districts across the country have been found positive for poliovirus, the National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) said on Monday.</p>
<p>Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.</p>
<p>“[A total of] 38 environmental [sewage] samples collected from 31 districts between April 7 and April 17 were tested at the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health, Islamabad,” the statement from the NEOC said.</p>
<p>“The lab confirmed detection of wild poliovirus type 1 in sewage samples of Loralai, Quetta, Zhob, Islamabad, Abbottabad, Bannu, DI Khan, Peshawar, Tank, North Waziristan, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Badin, Jamshoro, Hyderabad, Kashmore, Karachi, and Sukkur,” it added.</p>
<p>⁠Whereas samples collected from Noshki, Sibi, Islamabad, Charsadda, Lower Dir, Mansehra, Swat, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, and Rajanpur tested negative with no poliovirus detected, according to the NEOC.</p>
<p>“The Polio Programme is implementing a rigorous vaccination schedule to protect children from paralytic polio and interrupt virus transmission. Thanks to high-quality campaigns since September 2024, polio cases nationwide have declined,” the statement continued.</p>
<p>It added that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905470">second nationwide polio vaccination campaign</a> of 2025 was successfully conducted across the country from April 21 to 27, “achieving the target of vaccinating 45.4 million children under the age of five”.</p>
<p>“This remarkable milestone was made possible through the collective efforts of frontline polio workers, the Government of Pakistan, law enforcement agencies, health officials, and, most importantly, the commitment of parents who ensured their children received the vaccine.”</p>
<p>The next nationwide campaign is scheduled from May 26 to June 1, aiming to vaccinate 45.4 million children under the age of five across the country.</p>
<p>The statement urged all parents to vaccinate their children against polio every time the vaccine is offered, adding, “repeated vaccination strengthens children’s immunity and protects them from the crippling poliovirus”.</p>
<p>It added that it is the prime responsibility of parents and community members to ensure that no child in their homes or neighbourhoods is left unvaccinated. Every missed child is at risk and can contribute to the continued spread of the poliovirus. Protecting children from polio is a shared duty and starts with timely vaccination.</p>
<p>In a separate development, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Emergency Operations Centre has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908441">enhanced</a> the coverage of vaccination from 93 per cent in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889317">February’s polio campaign</a> to 98 per cent in April in province, according to data.</p>
<p>Late last month, over 800,000 children were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1781993">vaccinated</a> during the week-long anti-polio drive that ended in Rawalpindi district on April 27, health officials had said.</p></p>
