                <h2>Pakistan says Indian leadership‚Äôs remarks reflect ‚Äòdeeply troubling mindset‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan on Monday rebuked the recent remarks made by Indian leadership saying that they reflected a deeply troubling mindset that prioritised hostility over peace.</p>
<p>The Foreign Office issued a statement today after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896150#:~:text=The%20statement%20comes%20a%20day%20after%20India%E2%80%99s%20External%20Affairs%20Minister%20Subrahmanyam%20Jaishankar%2C%20referring%20to%20AJK%2C%20said%20the%20Kashmir%20dispute%20would%20be%20solved%20after%20the%20%E2%80%9Creturn%20of%20the%20stolen%20part%20of%20Kashmir%20which%20is%20under%20illegal%20Pakistani%20occupation%E2%80%9D.">flurry</a> of antagonistic statements made by Indian leaders, including one made by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson on May 29 where he stated that talks on the Kashmir dispute will only be held ‚Äúwhen Pakistan hands over [Azad Jammu and Kashmir] to us‚Äù.</p>

<p>Responding to the antagonistic remarks, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said, ‚ÄúAny attempt to portray Pakistan as the source of regional instability is divorced from reality.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe international community is well aware of India‚Äôs record of aggressive behavior, including documented support for terrorist activities within Pakistan,‚Äù he stated, adding that those facts could not be ‚Äúobscured by hollow narratives or diversionary tactics‚Äù.</p>

<p>He reiterated that the Kashmir dispute remained a ‚Äúcore issue threatening peace and stability in the region‚Äù and the country will continue to advocate for a ‚Äújust and lasting resolution to the Kashmir dispute in line with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people‚Äù.</p>
<p>He noted that the remarks made on the Indian side ‚Äúunderscored the utter futility of jingoism and coercion‚Äù, and that India will not be able to achieve its objectives through threats.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan remains committed to peace and constructive engagement, but it is equally resolved to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity against any aggression,‚Äù he stated.</p>
<p>The spokesperson emphasised that peace in the region demanded ‚Äúmaturity, restraint, and a willingness to address the root causes of conflict‚Äù.</p></p>

            </a>
            <p><p>Another low-intensity earthquake was felt by Karachi residents on Monday, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).</p>
<p>The tremor was the third within 24 hours.</p>
<p>The most recent quake <a class="link--external" href="https://seismic.pmd.gov.pk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">measured 3.2</a> on the Richter scale with the city‚Äôs densely populated Quaidabad area as its epicentre. The area‚Äôs residents had also experienced a similar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914834/karachi-experiences-36-magnitude-quake-with-quaidabad-as-epicentre">3.6-magnitude tremor</a> at 5:33pm yesterday.</p>
<p>Both earthquakes originated at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres beneath the surface.</p>

<p>A separate tremor originating near the city‚Äôs Gadap Town was recorded at 1:05am earlier today. It measured 3.2 on the Richter scale and had a depth of 12km.</p>
<p>Ameer Hyder, the chief meteorologist at the Met Office in Karachi, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the tremors were caused by an active fault line in Landhi.</p>
<p>He noted that the quakes‚Äô intensity was not high and was ‚Äúgradually declining‚Äù. While stating that no formal prediction could be made yet, Hyder expected the tremors to end within a week.</p>

<p>Experts have previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say">pointed out</a> that such minor seismic activities ‚Äúpreempt‚Äù high-intensity earthquakes by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates.</p>
<p>The country had witnessed around <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say">20 low-intensity earthquakes</a> in the first half of February ‚Äî an average of more than one tremor each day.</p>
