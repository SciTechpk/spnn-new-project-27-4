                <h2>President, PM reaffirm commitment for workers‚Äô welfare on Labour Day</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday reaffirmed the government‚Äôs commitment to the welfare and uplift of workers, state-media <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/01-05-2025/intl-labour-day-being-observed-today" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>As the world commemorated International Labour Day, the president and the premier issued separate messages to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>According to the <a class="link--external" href="https://normlex.ilo.org/dyn/nrmlx_en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:11210:0::NO::P11210_COUNTRY_ID:103166" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Labourers Organisation (ILO)</a>, Pakistan has yet to ratify 55 conventions and protocols. While labour laws <a class="link--external" href="https://www.riaabarkergillette.com/usa/wp-content/uploads/Labour-law-in-Pakistan.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exist</a> but enforcement is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881963">weak</a>, and despite government promises to create millions of jobs, issues like low pay, lack of social protection, and poor representation remain unresolved.</p>
<p>President Zardari paid tribute to the men and women labourers in the country and highlighted their struggles around the world, according to state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1917782980673823022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pakistan Television</a> (PTV)</em>.</p>

<p>In his statement, he said: ‚ÄúWe reiterate our commitment to workers‚Äô autonomy, fair wages, a safe environment and social security. Workers and the working class are the driving force of our economy and national development.‚Äù</p>
<p>He highlighted the role of workers ‚Äúin building our infrastructure, developing industries, agriculture, and the economy‚Äù.</p>
<p>He added: ‚ÄúOur workers are our pride. Our national development is due to the hard work and character of workers. In a rapidly changing world, we must focus on skilling our youth and workers for a bright future. We need to equip our workers and youth with modern skills.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOur hardworking workforce is the driving force behind our nation‚Äôs progress and our resilience,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe protection of fundamental rights of workers is enshrined in the Constitution of Pakistan and is fully consistent with the core conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), to which Pakistan is a committed signatory,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>The premier highlighted that the country has undertaken legislative and administrative reforms to strengthen labour and workforce protection, including key international labour conventions, such as the Forced Labour Convention and the 2014 Protocol to the Maritime Labour Convention.</p>
<p>He stated, ‚ÄúFor the first time, every worker in Pakistan is benefiting from a national occupational safety and health profile, ensuring safe and healthy workplaces across the country.‚Äù</p>
<p>He urged workers, activists, civil society and the government to play their role for ‚Äúa society that respects workers, upholds their rights, and creates opportunities for decent work‚Äù.</p>

<p>Gilani said workers were the backbone of any nation. He emphasised that as a nation, we must realise that unless the labour class is provided with social, economic, and legal protection, the dream of sustainable development will remain incomplete.</p></p>

            </a>
            <p><p>The ongoing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907397">heatwave</a> in Sindh is expected to subside from May 2, the Pakis¬≠¬≠tan Meteorological Depart¬≠ment (PMD) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Climate change is a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1890909">pressing reality</a> for Pakistan, directly impacting millions of lives. Heatwaves, intensified by climate change, are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891214/pms-aide-highlights-escalating-climate-challenges-faced-by-developing-countries">becoming</a> more frequent, prolonged and severe, disproportionately affecting communities with limited resources to adapt.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prevailing heatwave condition over most parts of the province is expected to subside from tomorrow,‚Äù the PMD said in its advisory issued today.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA westerly wave continues to grip the upper parts of the country,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>According to the advisory, thunderstorms and light rain were expected in Jamshoro, Hyderabad, Mitiari, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Mirpurkhas, Sukkur, Badin, Tharparker, and Umerkot with occasional gaps from May 2 to 5.</p>
<p>‚ÄúStrong windy conditions are likely in most parts of the province during [the] next two days,‚Äù the advisory said.</p>
<p>The forecast also said that Karachi was likely to experience hot and humid weather with occasional winds till May 3, adding that the maximum temperatures would be between 35¬∞C and 37¬∞C and the wind direction would be west and southwesterly.</p>
<p>PMD urged the public to take precautionary measures, avoid exposure to direct sunlight during the daytime and remain hydrated.</p>
<p>The advisory cautioned that ‚Äúwind-thunderstorm/hailstorm and lightning may damage loose structures like electric poles, trees, vehicles and solar panels etc.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúFarmers are advised to manage their crop activities keeping in view the weather conditions and take care of their livestock as well,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the PMD had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907452">predicted</a> wind and thunderstorm along with rain and isolated hailstorm in upper and central parts of the country from May 1 to 4, saying that the current heatwave conditions are likely to subside.</p></p>
