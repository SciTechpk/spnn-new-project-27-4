            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) opened the trading week on Monday on a positive trajectory, crossing the intraday high of 136,000 due to increased investor sentiment and improved economic outlook.</p>
<p>The stock market resumed trading at 134,299.76 points and gained 1,170 points in early trading to cross the 135,000 points barrier. The benchmark KSE-100 gained 1841.11 points (1.37pc), and is currently trading at 136,012.05 points. The total volume of shares traded is 134,882,053 with a value of Rs 11.12 billion.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction as the stock market surged to cross the all-time high level.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, he said the “significant achievement by the PSX is a clear reflection of the business community’s growing confidence in Pakistan’s economy.”</p>
<p>“The recent positive economic indicators are a testament to his government’s policies moving in the right direction,” he emphasised, reiterating that providing a business-friendly environment remains the government’s top priority.“</p>
<p>He said the country had moved from economic stability towards the path of economic growth, adding that the government of Pakistan was working tirelessly for national development and public welfare.</p>
<p>“This positive outlook follows a period of concerted efforts to stabilise the economy and implement structural reforms, which appear to be gaining traction and restoring investor trust,” he said, per the statement.</p>
<p>The previous week saw the stock market continue its record-breaking bullish run, crossing the 134,000-point threshold amid strong macroeconomic fundamentals and persistent buying by local mutual funds.</p>
<p>A surge in workers’ remittances, robust auto sales, and improved foreign exchange reserves provided a solid backdrop for investor optimism, helping offset subdued participation and minor currency depreciation.</p>
<p>Workers’ remittances rose to a historic $3.4bn in June, up 8pc year-on-year, taking full-year FY25 inflows to a record $38.3bn — a 27pc increase over the previous year. The State Bank of Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves surged by $1.8bn to $14.5bn for the week ending July 4, marking a 39-month high.</p>
<p>The auto sector further supported market gains. As per the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA), car sales in June rose 64pc year-on-year and 47pc month-on-month to 21,773 units. Full-year FY25 sales grew 43pc to 148,000 units, buoyed by pre-buying ahead of a proposed GST increase on smaller vehicles.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924121/alcaraz-says-sinner-rivalry-is-a-class-apart' target='_blank'><strong>Alcaraz says Sinner rivalry is a class apart</strong></a>
            <p><p>Carlos Alcaraz said he could hold his head high despite being unseated from his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845803">Wimbledon throne</a> by Jannik Sinner on Sunday and the Spaniard praised their hot rivalry for being several notches higher than the others on the men’s tour.</p>
<p>Alcaraz’s bid for a third straight title at the All England Club ended with a 4-6 6-4 6-4 6-4 loss on Centre Court, leaving him to digest his first Grand Slam final defeat.</p>
<p>“It’s always a bad feeling losing matches. It’s a little bit worse when you lose in a final,” said Alcaraz, who narrowly beat Sinner in a five-set humdinger at the French Open <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916052">last month</a>.</p>
<p>“I’m just proud about everything I’ve done in the last four weeks on grass at London. I leave Wimbledon, the court, with my head held really high because I did everything that I could.</p>
<p>“I played against someone who played an unbelievable game. So I’m just a little bit sad about losing, but with my head held really high.”</p>
<p>Alcaraz said his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913152/alcaraz-sinner-rivalry-takes-centre-stage-at-french-open">rivalry with Sinner</a> was great for the pair and also for tennis, which has had to endure the retirements of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1710246">Roger Federer</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1864310#:~:text=updates%20from%20Dawn-,'King%20of%20Clay'%20Rafael%20Nadal%20to%20end%20stellar,career%20after%20injury%2Dhit%20spell&amp;text=Rafael%20Nadal%20on%20Thursday%20announced,Roger%20Federer%20and%20Novak%20Djokovic.">Rafa Nadal</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1456898">Andy Murray</a> in recent years with fellow great Novak Djokovic in the twilight of a glorious career.</p>
<p>The young duo have now shared eight of the last nine Grand Slam titles, with each winning four.</p>
<p>“Every time we play each other, I think our level is really high. We don’t see a level like this. I don’t see any player playing against each other, having the level that we’re playing when we face each other,” Alcaraz added.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#extra-attention" id="extra-attention" title="Permalink"></a>Extra Attention</h2>
<p>“This rivalry, it’s becoming better and better. We’re playing in the finals of Grand Slams, finals of Masters and the best tournaments in the world. It’s going to get better.</p>
<p>“I’m just really grateful for that because it gives me the opportunity to just give my 100 per cent every practice, every day, just to be better. The level that I have to maintain and I have to raise if I want to beat Jannik is really high.”</p>
<p>Sinner’s coach Darren Cahill admitted that while the Italian did not take any of his rivals for granted, he does pay extra attention to Alcaraz.</p>
<p>“Jannik watches more Carlos matches than he does anybody else because he’s fascinated with the improvements that are coming in his game, and he’s pushing us as coaches to make sure that he’s improving as a tennis player,” Cahill said.</p>
<p>Sinner, who ended Alcaraz’s 24-match winning run across all events and 20-match streak at Wimbledon, was most pleased with ending his own run of five successive defeats against the Spaniard.</p>
<p>“When you lose several times against someone, it’s not easy,” said Sinner, who narrowed his win-loss record against Alcaraz to 5-8.</p>
<p>“At the same time in the past, I felt I was close. I never pushed myself down. I keep looking up to Carlos because even today I felt like he was doing a couple of things better than I did. So that’s something we’ll work on and prepare ourselves because he’s going to come for us again.</p>
<p>“There’s not only Carlos, but everyone. We have a big target on us so we have to be prepared. Then we’ll see what’s happening in the future.”</p>
<p>Alcaraz said he had no doubt that Sinner would learn from his near 5-1/2-hour loss at Roland Garros, where the Italian squandered three championship points, and hit back.</p>
<p>“I know he’s a really nice player and a huge champion. Champions learn from their losses,” Alcaraz said.</p>
<p>“I knew from the beginning he was going to learn from that final and not make the same mistakes. The way he played today, it was really high.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t surprised at all.”</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924124/bitcoin-tops-120000-for-the-first-time' target='_blank'><strong>Bitcoin tops $120,000 for the first time</strong></a>
            <p><p>Bitcoin crossed the $120,000 level for the first time on Monday, marking a milestone for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909554">world’s largest cryptocurrency</a> as investors bet on long-sought policy wins for the industry this week.</p>
<p>Bitcoin scaled a record high of $121,207.55 in the Asian session on Monday, before pulling back slightly to last trade 1.6 per cent higher at $121,015.42.</p>
<p>Starting today, the US House of Representatives will debate a series of bills to provide the digital asset industry with the nation’s regulatory framework it has long demanded.</p>
<p>Those demands have resonated with US President Donald Trump, who has called himself the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915340">“crypto president”</a> and urged policymakers to revamp rules in favour of the industry.</p>
<p>“It’s riding a number of tailwinds at the moment,” said IG market analyst Tony Sycamore, citing strong institutional demand, expectations of further gains and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886694">support from Trump</a> as reasons for the bullishness.</p>
<p>“It’s been a very, very, strong move over the past six or seven days, and it’s hard to see where it stops now; it looks like it can easily have a look at the $125,000 level,” he said.</p>
<p>The surge in bitcoin, which is up 29pc for the year so far, has sparked a broader rally across other cryptocurrencies over the past few sessions, even in the face of Trump’s chaotic tariffs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1709900">Ether</a>, the second-largest token, scaled a more than five-month top of $3,050.90, while XRP and Solana gained about 3pc each.</p>
<p>The sector’s total market value has swelled to about $3.78 trillion, according to data from <a class="link--external" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Washington declared the week of July 14 as “crypto week”, where members of Congress are set to vote on the Genius Act, the Clarity Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act.</p>
<p>The most significant bill is the Genius Act, which would create federal rules for stablecoins.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, prices of crypto-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong similarly surged.</p>
<p>Spot bitcoin ETFs launched by China AMC, Harvest and Bosera all scaled record highs, while the three ether ETFs managed by the asset managers were up roughly 2pc each.</p></p>
