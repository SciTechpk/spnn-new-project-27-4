            <p><p>A state of emergency was declared in several districts of Punjab on Thursday as heavy rains triggered flooding and claimed over 60 lives across the province in the past 24 hours, according to authorities.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924232">issued</a> a warning of torrential rains with wind-thundershowers that would last throughout the country till today. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has forecasted that heavy rains will continue to lash parts of the country over the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>“Sixty-three citizens have died while 290 were injured due to monsoon rains [across the province] in the past 24 hours,” read a statement by the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) spokesperson.</p>
<p>“At least 15 were reported dead in Lahore, nine in Faisalabad, five in Sahiwal, three in Pakpattan and nine in Okara,” the PDMA statement detailed, adding that the families of the deceased will receive compensation from the government.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz announced that “a rain emergency has been imposed in different areas of Punjab due to unprecedented torrential rains and a flood situation.”</p>
<p>She added that directives were issued to keep the public alert through sirens and announcements. The chief minister urged the public to cooperate with the local authorities and take safety precautions.</p>

<p>Punjab Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) Director General Tayyab Farid said that “rivers have overflowed due to heavy rains in Rawalpindi, Chakwal and surrounding areas”, leading to a flood situation.</p>
<p>“Citizens have been advised to avoid unnecessary travel, stay away from power lines and open manholes,” the Wasa DG said in a statement.</p>
<p>The PMD’s <a class="link--external" href="https://ffd.pmd.gov.pk/bulletin/A" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Flood Forecasting Division</a> (FFD) warned that urban flooding was expected in Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Faisalabad divisions during the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>However, it added that the wet spell was likely to subside in the next 48 hours.</p>
<p>In a post on X, the PMD said the heavy monsoon rains triggered a “significant surge” in water levels at the <a class="link--external" href="https://ndmc.pmd.gov.pk/new/dam-reservoirs.php?dam=tarbela" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tarbela</a>, <a class="link--external" href="https://ndmc.pmd.gov.pk/new/dam-reservoirs.php?dam=mangla" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mangla</a>, <a class="link--external" href="https://ndmc.pmd.gov.pk/new/dam-reservoirs.php?dam=khanpur" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Khanpur</a>, <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Simly</a> and <a class="link--external" href="https://ndmc.pmd.gov.pk/new/dam-reservoirs.php?dam=rawal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rawal</a> reservoirs.</p>
<p>The water level at Khanpur witnessed a gain of 4.5 feet, while the other four recorded an increase of a foot each.</p>

<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://ffd.pmd.gov.pk/bulletin/C" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">weather outlook</a>, the FFD said the water flows in the eastern rivers were likely to increase from July 21.</p>
<p>Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>

<p>Earlier today, the PMD issued a flood alert for the Gawalmandi and Kattarian stations in Rawalpindi as the water level in the Leh Nullah rose.</p>
<p>At 10:50am, the Gawalmandi and Kattarian gauges had crossed the 20ft level, at which evacuation is supposed to be ordered. However, the water levels soon started to recede, reaching 7ft at Gawalmandi and 8ft at Kattarian, according to the PMD’s real-time <a class="link--external" href="https://ffws.pmd.gov.pk/rtr.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">monitor</a>.</p>

            <p><p>Two people died and three others were injured when the roof of a six-storey building collapsed in the Khada Market area of Karachi’s Lyari, rescue and police officials said.</p>
<p>The incident occurred almost two weeks after a five-storey building <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050">collapsed</a> earlier this month in Lyari’s Lea Market, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922486/death-toll-in-lyari-building-collapse-stands-at-27-as-rescue-operation-ends-on-3rd-day">killing</a> 27 people. This incident raised serious concerns about building safety, prompting authorities to evacuate other dilapidated <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924493/new-survey-ordered-amid-doubts-over-sindhs-dangerous-buildings-list">buildings</a> in the city.</p>
<p>Regarding the incident today, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “Two women have died in the accident, while more than two others are reported to have been injured.”</p>
<p>Providing details of the incident, he said: “The building was dilapidated. Some labourers were working on the roof of the sixth floor when it collapsed.”</p>
<p>He added that the rescue operation has been completed.</p>
<p>Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIGP) South, Asad Raza, confirmed that the two people were killed and three others were injured in the incident.</p>
<p>“The top floor of the six-storey building — named Ghani Mansion, situated next to Bilal Masjid Peshawari Hotel — collapsed on the lower fifth floor,” he told <em>Dawn.com.</em></p>
<p>He said three injured people and the bodies of the deceased, including two women, were taken to Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital.</p>
<p>“The deceased women were sisters. Their daughters are among the injured and are being given medical assistance,” he said.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Lyari building earlier this month, Sindh Local Government minister Saeed Ghani had addressed an emergency press conference, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924493/new-survey-ordered-amid-doubts-over-sindhs-dangerous-buildings-list">revealing</a> that 588 buildings across the city had been declared hazardous — 456 of them located in District South, including 107 in Lyari alone.</p>
<p>The Sindh government had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922557/sindh-govt-suspends-sbca-dg-over-lyari-building-collapse-minister">suspended</a> the director-general of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) for approving the building’s construction. The provincial government has formed a committee on hazardous and dilapidated buildings to ensure transparency.</p>
<p>A day earlier, it was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924655">revealed</a> that as many as 44 dilapidated buildings, including 10 declared protected heritage in the city’s South district, have been vacated for demolition in the aftermath of the Lyari building tragedy.</p>
<p>A meeting, chaired by Commissioner Syed Hasan Naqvi, was told that so far, 44 dilapidated buildings had been vacated in the South and East districts for the safety of the residents.</p>
<p>In total, out of 588 buildings declared dilapidated by the SBCA, 68 buildings have been declared “highly dilapidated” by the city administration and will be vacated and demolished in the first phase.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday continued its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924716/psx-rebounds-on-hopes-of-ratings-upgrade">renewed</a> bullish momentum as it crossed the 138,000 point barrier.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,785.25 points, or 1.31 per cent, to stand at 138,165.21 points at 11:57am, from the previous close of 136,379.96 points. The index closed at 138,665.49 points, up by 2,285.53 points or 1.68pc.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, said: “Investor optimism over a potential rate cut in the upcoming monetary policy, expected later this month, has strengthened following a decline in yields during yesterday’s PIBs (Pakistan Investment Bond) auction.</p>
<p>“A stable external account and easing inflation further support the case for bringing interest rates down into single digits,” he told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>The PSX had staged a modest recovery yesterday as investors resumed buying, encouraged by the formation of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924499">high-level committee</a> to address the business community’s concerns over the recently introduced taxation measures.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The development has helped the KSE-100 index gain momentum despite the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924723/businesses-gear-up-for-nationwide-strike">July 19 strike call</a> by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry to protest against the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917240">powers</a> to arrest and prosecute businessmen introduced in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292">federal budget</a>.</p>
