                <h2>Vaccinations stall globally as Pakistan sees 2nd highest number of zero-dose children in South Asia</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Life-saving childhood vaccination coverage has stalled in recent decades, leaving millions of children at risk for deadly diseases with Pakistan having the highest number of children with zero doses in South Asia after India, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01037-2/fulltext" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new study</a> by British medical journal <em>Lancet</em>.</p>
<p><em>The Lancet</em> is a 200-year-old peer-reviewed weekly medical journal from the United Kingdom. Since its launch, the journal has expanded into a family of more than 20 speciality journals and has set up several global Lancet Commissions on various important issues in medicine and healthcare.</p>
<p>In a press release issued a day ago, the journal said that since its inception in 1974, the World Health Organisation‚Äôs Essential Programme on Immunisation (EPI) achieved ‚Äúunprecedented progress‚Äù, averting the deaths of an estimated 154 million children worldwide through routine childhood vaccination.</p>
<p>However, it said that as per a major new analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study Vaccine Coverage Collaborators, ‚ÄúDespite the progress of the past 50 years, the last two decades have also been marked by stagnating childhood vaccination rates and wide variation in vaccine coverage.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese challenges have been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving millions of children vulnerable to preventable diseases and death.‚Äù</p>
<p>The authors of the study, titled: ‚ÄúGlobal, regional, and national trends in routine childhood vaccination coverage from 1980 to 2023 with forecasts to 2030: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023‚Äù, said that the latest estimates should be taken as a ‚Äúclear warning‚Äù that global immunisation targets for 2030 would not be achieved without ‚Äútransformational improvements in equity‚Äù, according to the press release.</p>
<p>In 2019, the WHO set ambitious goals for improving vaccine coverage globally through the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1668378">Immunisation Agenda 2030</a>.</p>
<p>According to data from 2023, which the analysis is based upon, more than half of the world‚Äôs 15.7 million unvaccinated children were living in just eight countries, with 53 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa and 13pc in South Asia.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDespite the monumental efforts of the past 50 years, progress has been far from universal. Large numbers of children remain under and un-vaccinated,‚Äù senior study author Dr Jonathan Mosser from the University of Washington‚Äôs Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The journal pointed out that the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated challenges with global coverage rates of the original EPI-recommended vaccines declining sharply beginning in 2020, resulting in an estimated 15.6m children missing the full three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine or a measles vaccine between 2020 and 2023, as well as 15.9m children not receiving any polio vaccine and 9.18m missing out on the tuberculosis vaccine.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Covid-19 pandemic also reversed previous gains in reducing the number of unvaccinated zero-dose children globally, which peaked at 18.6m before falling to 15.7m by 2023. The study estimates that disruptions to immunisation services during the Covid pandemic resulted in around 12.8m additional unvaccinated zero-dose children globally during the four pandemic years (2020-2023).‚Äù</p>
<p>It stressed that ‚Äúaccelerated progress‚Äù would be necessary to achieve the 2030 target of halving the number of zero-dose children compared to 2019 levels, with only 18 of 204 countries and territories estimated to have already met this target as of 2023.</p>
<p>It added that population pressures would also add a ‚Äúdouble burden to already overstretched healthcare systems that are ill-equipped to handle the substantial growth in vaccine target populations‚Äù.</p>
<p>The study‚Äôs authors called for more concerted efforts to tackle vaccine misinformation and hesitancy to increase vaccine acceptance and uptake.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#pakistans-situation" id="pakistans-situation" title="Permalink"></a>Pakistan‚Äôs situation</h2>
<p>The study also found that Pakistan had the highest number of children with zero doses of vaccines after India in South Asia, with 419,000 children falling into that category.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIncreasing numbers of wild-type polio cases have been reported in Pakistan and Afghanistan,‚Äù the press release stated.</p>
<p>Last month, the Pakistan Polio Programme <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913239">launched</a> the third drive of the year against the crippling disease at the National Emergency Operations Centre.</p>
<p>Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.</p>

                <h2>Trump plays nice as Nato eyes ‚Äòhistoric‚Äô spending hike</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump struck a conciliatory tone towards Nato allies on Wednesday, framing an expected deal on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911297">increased defence spending</a> as a ‚Äúgreat victory for everyone‚Äù at their summit.</p>
<p>Everything has been carefully choreographed at the gathering in The Hague to keep the volatile US president on board: from chopping back the official part of the meeting to putting him up overnight in the royal palace.</p>
<p>The strategy seemed to be working ‚Äî for now ‚Äî with Trump seeming keen to share the plaudits for a deal set to see the 32 countries commit to spending 5 per cent of output on defence by 2035.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great victory for everybody, I think, and we will be equalised very shortly, and that‚Äôs the way it has to be,‚Äù said Trump, as European allies seek to catch up with US spending on defence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve been asking them to go up to 5pc for a number of years, and they‚Äôre going up to 5pc ‚Ä¶ I think that‚Äôs going to be very big news,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Hosting the meeting, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte told reporters that Trump was in an ‚Äúexcellent mood‚Äù at the dinner hosted on Tuesday by King Willem-Alexander in his royal palace, and that the US leader appeared inspired by his hosts.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe day begins in the beautiful Netherlands. The King and Queen are beautiful and spectacular people. Our breakfast meeting was great!‚Äù he posted on the Truth Social network.</p>

<p>Entering the meeting, leaders lined up to declare the summit‚Äôs planned spending hike as ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù.</p>
<p>Nato allies say the increase is needed to counter a growing threat from Russia but also to keep Trump engaged, with the US leader long complaining that Europe spends too little on its own defence.</p>
<p>Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said: ‚ÄúAs Europeans, we should realise that our long break from history is over.‚Äù The continent needed to take responsibility for its own security, ‚Äúin a very difficult time‚Äù, added De Wever.</p>
<p>The pledge divides up the spending into 3.5pc of GDP on core defence costs ‚Äî just above the current US level ‚Äî plus another 1.5pc to broader security-related areas such as cybersecurity and infrastructure.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#totally-committed" id="totally-committed" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòTotally committed‚Äô</h2>
<p>With that deal all but clinched, attention turned to the basic foundation of the alliance ‚Äî its mutual defence clause that says an attack on one is an attack on all.</p>
<p>Trump rattled his allies by appearing to cast some doubt on the validity of this promise, known as Article Five of the Nato treaty, telling reporters on the way to The Hague that it ‚Äúdepends on your definition.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs numerous definitions of Article Five.‚Äù</p>
<p>But Rutte played down the comments, saying he believed that Trump and the United States were still ‚Äútotally committed‚Äù to Article Five.</p>
<p>And when pressed about the collective pledge while meeting Rutte on Wednesday, Trump said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre with them all the way.‚Äù</p>
<p>Britain‚Äôs Prime Minister Keir Starmer dodged multiple questions seeking clarity over Washington‚Äôs stance.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe live in a very volatile world and today is about the unity of Nato, showing that strength,‚Äù said Starmer.</p>
<p>In an earlier message, probably not designed for public consumption, Rutte <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919863/flatterer-in-chief-how-natos-rutte-worked-to-win-over-trump">heaped flattery</a> on Trump, praising him for bringing everyone on board for the spending hike.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEurope is going to pay in a big way, as they should, and it will be your win,‚Äù Rutte wrote in a gushing, caps-filled missive to Trump, who promptly posted it on social media. ‚ÄúYou are flying into another big success in The Hague.‚Äù</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#nice-guy" id="nice-guy" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòNice guy‚Äô</h2>
<p>Underpinning the leaders‚Äô discussions on defence was Russia‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919776">invasion</a> of Ukraine, with Trump poised to meet the war-torn country‚Äôs president, Volodymyr Zelensky, on the summit sidelines.</p>
<p>Zelensky is playing a less central role here than at previous summits, to avoid a bust-up with Trump after their infamous Oval Office <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894932">shouting match</a>.</p>
<p>But Trump described him as a ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù and added that he was talking to Russian President Vladimir Putin about the war, saying: ‚ÄúI think progress is being made.‚Äù Rutte said that allies would send the message that support for Kyiv was ‚Äúunwavering and will persist‚Äù.</p>
<p>But despite his insistence that Ukraine‚Äôs bid for membership remains ‚Äúirreversible‚Äù, Nato will avoid any mention of Kyiv‚Äôs push to join after Trump ruled it out.</p>
<p>Hungary‚Äôs Kremlin-friendly Prime Minister Viktor Orban was more categorical.
‚ÄúNato has no business in Ukraine,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMy job is to keep it as it is. ‚Äú</p></p>
