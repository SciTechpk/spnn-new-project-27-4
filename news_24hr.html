            <p><p>Pakistan on Monday rebuked the recent remarks made by Indian leadership saying that they reflected a deeply troubling mindset that prioritised hostility over peace.</p>
<p>The Foreign Office issued a statement today after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896150#:~:text=The%20statement%20comes%20a%20day%20after%20India%E2%80%99s%20External%20Affairs%20Minister%20Subrahmanyam%20Jaishankar%2C%20referring%20to%20AJK%2C%20said%20the%20Kashmir%20dispute%20would%20be%20solved%20after%20the%20%E2%80%9Creturn%20of%20the%20stolen%20part%20of%20Kashmir%20which%20is%20under%20illegal%20Pakistani%20occupation%E2%80%9D.">flurry</a> of antagonistic statements made by Indian leaders, including one made by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson on May 29 where he stated that talks on the Kashmir dispute will only be held “when Pakistan hands over [Azad Jammu and Kashmir] to us”.</p>

<p>Responding to the antagonistic remarks, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said, “Any attempt to portray Pakistan as the source of regional instability is divorced from reality.</p>
<p>“The international community is well aware of India’s record of aggressive behavior, including documented support for terrorist activities within Pakistan,” he stated, adding that those facts could not be “obscured by hollow narratives or diversionary tactics”.</p>

<p>He reiterated that the Kashmir dispute remained a “core issue threatening peace and stability in the region” and the country will continue to advocate for a “just and lasting resolution to the Kashmir dispute in line with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people”.</p>
<p>He noted that the remarks made on the Indian side “underscored the utter futility of jingoism and coercion”, and that India will not be able to achieve its objectives through threats.</p>
<p>“Pakistan remains committed to peace and constructive engagement, but it is equally resolved to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity against any aggression,” he stated.</p>
<p>The spokesperson emphasised that peace in the region demanded “maturity, restraint, and a willingness to address the root causes of conflict”.</p></p>

            <p><p>Another low-intensity earthquake was felt by Karachi residents on Monday, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).</p>
<p>The tremor was the third within 24 hours.</p>
<p>The most recent quake <a class="link--external" href="https://seismic.pmd.gov.pk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">measured 3.2</a> on the Richter scale with the city’s densely populated Quaidabad area as its epicentre. The area’s residents had also experienced a similar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914834/karachi-experiences-36-magnitude-quake-with-quaidabad-as-epicentre">3.6-magnitude tremor</a> at 5:33pm yesterday.</p>
<p>Both earthquakes originated at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres beneath the surface.</p>

<p>A separate tremor originating near the city’s Gadap Town was recorded at 1:05am earlier today. It measured 3.2 on the Richter scale and had a depth of 12km.</p>

<p>Experts have previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say">pointed out</a> that such minor seismic activities “preempt” high-intensity earthquakes by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates.</p>
<p>The country had witnessed around <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say">20 low-intensity earthquakes</a> in the first half of February — an average of more than one tremor each day.</p>

            <p><p>The first case of wild poliovirus has been reported in Gilgit-Baltistan, bringing the national total to 11 this year, as the country continues to battle the debilitating disease.</p>
<p>The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health, Islamabad has confirmed a new case of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889214">wild poliovirus</a> in district Diamer of GB.</p>
<p>This is the first case of wild poliovirus reported from GB and the 11th confirmed case in Pakistan this year, said a statement by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913239">third</a> nationwide polio vaccination campaign of 2025, which began on 26 May, concluded yesterday, successfully reaching over 45 million children under five years of age across 159 districts, including high-risk areas of the country.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859264">Polio</a> is a highly infectious and debilitating disease with no cure. The only way to protect children is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for all children under five as well as the timely completion of all vaccines offered as part of the essential immunisation schedule.</p>
<p>The programme called on all parents to ensure their children do not miss out on any opportunity to receive polio drops.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#gb-reports-first-case" id="gb-reports-first-case" title="Permalink"></a>GB reports first case</h2>
<p>GB Health Secretary Asifullah Khan confirmed that a 23-month-old child has been diagnosed with poliovirus in Tangir area of district Diamer.</p>
<p>He said that the child has not travelled outside the area, however, the virus strain has been confirmed to originate from Liaquatabad area of Karachi.</p>
<p>Khan observed that there is a record of administering polio drops to the child. However, he added that child was not provided with the vaccines given after immediately after birth.</p>
<p>To a question, the health secretary said that the department has not announced the detection of the polio virus to the public but the case has been confirmed. Before the latest case, there has been no reported case of poliovirus in GB and the region was declared a polio-free zone.</p>
<p>Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879016">endemic</a>. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891351">challenges</a> such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.</p>
<p>Last year, the country reported more than 70 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.</p>
<p>This year’s first nationwide polio vaccination campaign was held in February, followed by a fractional IPV-OPV Polio (injectable polio vaccine) campaign in Quetta and Karachi on Feb 20 and 22, respectively. Around one million children were targeted for vaccination in this campaign.</p></p>
