                <h2>Interior minister rebuts rumours about President Zardari ‚Äòresigning‚Äô from office</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Thursday rebutted rumours of President Asif Ali Zardari being asked to resign, terming it a ‚Äúmalicious campaign‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are fully aware of who is behind the malicious campaign targeting President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and the chief of army staff,‚Äù Naqvi <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MohsinnaqviC42/status/1943211206371602592" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have categorically stated that there has been no discussion, nor does any such idea exist about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency,‚Äù he asserted.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe president of Pakistan enjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces,‚Äù the minister said.</p>
<p>He quoted President Zardari as having ‚Äúclearly‚Äù stated: ‚ÄúI know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.‚Äù</p>
<p>Naqvi stressed that the ‚Äúsole focus‚Äù of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was Pakistan‚Äôs strength and stability, and ‚Äúnothing else‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo those involved in this narrative, do whatever you wish in collaboration with hostile foreign agencies. As for us, we will do whatever is necessary to make Pakistan strong again, InshAllah,‚Äù Naqvi added.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, social media campaigns against the army have escalated, reflecting broader tensions within the country‚Äôs political and social fabric.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856908">government</a>, as well as the military, have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1876905">repeatedly</a> warned about ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=fake%20news%20and%20propaganda%20have%20become%20so%20common%20and%20there%20is%20no%20accountability%20for%20it.%E2%80%9D">fake news and propaganda</a>‚Äù proliferating on social media, with military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=theories%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20added.-,%E2%80%98Digital%20terrorism%E2%80%99,-Questioned%20about%20criticism">digital terrorism</a>‚Äù under the laws.</p>
<p>In May, President Zardari and PM Shehbaz formally decorated Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Syed Asim Munir with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912748/president-pm-decorate-coas-munir-with-rank-of-field-marshal">rank of field marshal</a> for his ‚Äúsagacious leadership and exceptional strategy‚Äù during the recent conflict with India.</p>
<p>In a subsequent dinner hosted by the army chief, Field Marshal Munir lauded the political leadership for their ‚Äústrategic foresight‚Äù during <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> against India.</p>

In a separate interview, he also termed it as a ‚Äúpractical necessity‚Äù for Pakistan, saying the system was ‚Äúdoing wonders‚Äù.</p>
<p>In May 2024, the army chief and President Zardari had expressed their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1825461">concern</a> over ‚Äúbaseless and unsubstantiated allegations levelled by a specific political party and its few individuals‚Äù against the army for their political interests.</p></p>

                <h2>Pakistan, China agree on joint media cooperation against fake news</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan and China on Thursday agreed to further enhance ties and joint broadcasting projects between their state broadcasters to tackle fake news and disinformation, <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/10-07-2025/pakistan-china-agree-to-enhance-ties" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Radio Pakistan</em></a> reported.</p>
<p>Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation, and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors, including trade, energy, infrastructure, and media collaboration, with initiatives like the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879166">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)</a> symbolising a shared vision for development.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1831125">government</a>, as well as the military, have previously warned about ‚Äúfake news and propaganda‚Äù proliferating on social media, with Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850240">saying</a> that not enough was being done against ‚Äúdigital terrorism‚Äù under the law.</p>
<p>The decision was made during a meeting in Beijing between Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar and Cao Shumin, Deputy Head of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Minister and Party Secretary of the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA).</p>

<p>‚ÄúBoth leaders also agreed on a joint narrative against fake news and emphasised technical training and institutional collaboration,‚Äù the report said. ‚ÄúThey described the ongoing partnership in the media as a reflection of mutual trust and longstanding friendship.‚Äù</p>
<p>The report added that the two sides also held talks related to a proposed agreement between <em>China Central Television (CCTV)</em> and <em>PTV</em> to promote the exchange of information and cooperation.</p>
<p>Tarar said Pakistan was ready to translate bilateral media cooperation into practical steps and that state-run media entities ‚Äî <em>PTV</em>, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> and <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> ‚Äî were playing a crucial role in communicating stories of China‚Äôs development, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856317">Belt and Road Initiative</a>, CPEC, cultural ties, and bilateral cooperation to the people of both countries.</p>
<p>Per the report, Tarar said <em>PTV</em> was building intellectual and cultural bridges between the two nations by broadcasting Chinese programmes, documentaries and news reports in Urdu.</p>
<p>He said <em>APP‚Äôs</em> ‚ÄúChina News Service‚Äù had crossed a significant milestone in effectively conveying Pakistan‚Äôs narrative to Chinese readers.</p>
<p>Referring to the recent Pakistan-India tensions, the information minister noted that the youth of China and Pakistan expressed strong solidarity with each other, which went viral on social media.</p>
<p>The meeting also discussed exchange visits of digital influencers from both Pakistan and China. Tarar said in the digital age, exchanges between influencers and social media representatives of both countries can inject new energy into bilateral relations.</p>
<p>Shumin said China considered Pakistan a trustworthy partner. ‚ÄúMedia organisations of Pakistan and China can come closer through the exchange of experiences,‚Äù she was quoted as saying in the report.</p>
<p>Both sides agreed that media, culture, and people-to-people relations can introduce new dimensions to the Pakistan-China friendship, and these efforts will be further strengthened under a joint strategy.</p>
<p>In February, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan, Jiang Zaidong <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pak-china-cooperation-in-education-media-to-be-expanded-chinese-ambassador/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>: ‚ÄúWe are ready to expand cooperation with Pakistan in education, media, think tanks, youth exchanges, and the film and television industries, to foster mutual learning between civilisations and strengthen cultural and people-to-people ties.‚Äù</p></p>
