            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918208/govt-draws-five-potential-buyers-for-pia' target='_blank'><strong>Govt draws five potential buyers for PIA</strong></a>
            <p><p>In its efforts to sell its struggling flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), the government has received expressions of interest from five parties, including business groups and a military-owned firm, the Privatisation Ministry said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The bids were submitted ahead of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913616">June 19 deadline</a> to acquire up to 100 per cent of PIA, which has accumulated over $2.5 billion in losses in roughly a decade. Still, following major restructuring, it posted its first <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903037">operating profit</a> in 21 years in the 2024-25 fiscal year.</p>
<p>The sale is seen as a test of Pakistan’s ability to shed loss-making state firms and meet conditions of a $7bn International Monetary Fund <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">bailout</a>. It would be the first major privatisation in nearly two decades.</p>
<p>Eight parties submitted their expression of interest, but only five of them provided documents of qualification, the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Among the five groups is a consortium of major industrial firms: Lucky Cement Ltd, Hub Power Holdings Ltd, Kohat Cement Co Ltd and Metro Ventures.</p>
<p>Another is led by investment firm Arif Habib Corp Ltd and includes fertiliser producer Fatima Fertiliser Co Ltd, private education operator The City School, and real estate firm Lake City Holdings.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917610/fauji-fertiliser-submits-expression-of-interest-for-pia-purchase">Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd</a>, a military-owned conglomerate, Pakistani airline Air Blue Ltd and a consortium including Bahria Foundation, domestic carrier Serene Air and US-based Equitas Capital LLC also submitted documents.</p>
<p>“The government will review the documents and give qualified parties access to data for due diligence,” the statement read.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#full-divestment" id="full-divestment" title="Permalink"></a>Full divestment</h2>
<p>Once a leading global airline, PIA <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884402">resumed</a> European flights in January after a four-year EU ban linked to safety concerns, and is seeking UK clearances, seen as key to its turnaround. Industry insiders say the winning bidder is expected to partner with a foreign airline to run operations.</p>
<p>A previous attempt to sell the airline failed as a $36 million bid from real estate firm Blue World City fell short of the $305m floor price, with concerns over debt, staffing, and limited control.</p>
<p>This time, the government is offering full divestment, has scrapped the sales tax on leased aircraft, and is providing limited protection from legal and tax claims. Around 80pc of the airline’s debt has been transferred to the state.</p>
<p>“We’re targeting Rs86bn in privatisation proceeds this year,” Privatisation Minister Muhammad Ali told <em>Reuters</em>. “For PIA, in the last round of bidding, 15pc of the proceeds were going to the government, with the rest staying within the company.”</p>
<p>He said bidders would be pre-qualified in early July, with due diligence lasting two to two-and-a-half months, with final bidding and negotiations expected in the fourth quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>Officials hope the sale will revive the stalled privatisation drive. Other planned deals include the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903689">Roosevelt Hotel</a> and several power firms by mid-2026.</p>
<p>“From the Roosevelt Hotel, we’re expecting over $100m as [the] first payment during this year,” said Ali.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Thursday predicted that pre-monsoon rains will fall across the country between June 20 and 23.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1852031#:~:text=Monsoon%20rains%20across%20the%20region%20from%20June%20to%20September%20offer%20respite%20from%20the%20summer%20heat%20and%20are%20crucial%20to%20replenishing%20water%20supplies.%20They%20are%20also%20vital%20for%20agriculture%2C%20and%20therefore%20the%20livelihoods%20of%20millions%20of%20farmers%20and%20food%20security%20for%20South%20Asia%E2%80%99s%20nearly%20two%20billion%20people.">fall across</a> the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. They are also vital for agriculture, and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security for South Asia’s nearly two billion people.</p>
<p>According to a statement, “currents from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal are penetrating the central and northern areas of Pakistan, while a westerly wave is expected to approach the north. Both of these weather systems are expected to arrive on June 20 (tomorrow).”</p>
<p>It added that duststorms, thunderstorms and heavy rain are expected in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit Baltistan, Murree, Galliyat, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mianwali, Sargodha, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sialkot, Narowal, Lahore, Faisalabad, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Haripur, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Malakand, Battagram, Shangla, Kohistan, Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, Nowshera, Charsadda, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Kohat, Bannu, Karak, Dera Ismail Khan, and Waziristan from June 20-23 with occasional gaps.</p>
<p>“Similar weather events could be expected in Zhob, Barkhan, Musakhel, Kalat, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan, Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar and Sahiwal from June 21-23, and in Sukkur, Larkana, Dadu, and Jacobabad from June 22-24.</p>
<p>PMD warned that the inclement weather “may damage loose structures like electric poles, trees, vehicles and solar panels” among others and advised farmers to “manage their crop activities keeping in view the weather conditions”.</p>
<p>“Urban flooding may occur in Lahore, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi [and] Islamabad during the forecast period,” the press release warned. “[The] general Public, travellers and tourists are advised to take precautionary measures during the weather activity.”</p>
<p>PMD added that hot weather is likely to subside gradually during the forecast period.</p>
<p>Last month, heavy rain triggered flash floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mohmand, South Waziristan and Upper Kohistan districts, damaging roads and agricultural land. However, no casualties were reported from any districts.</p>
<p>Heavy rainfall <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909665">triggered</a> flash floods in several areas of Halimzai tehsil in Mohmand district, including Shanikhel ,Tarikhel, Barokhel, Durbakhel and Babikhel.</p>
<p>The flood, caused by overflowing mountain streams, swept away dozens of livestock and damaged houses and link roads.</p>
<p>Last month, at least 13 civilians died and 92 others were injured as heavy rains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913072">lashed</a> several parts of Punjab.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918215/trump-extends-deadline-for-tiktok-sale-by-90-days' target='_blank'><strong>Trump extends deadline for TikTok sale by 90 days</strong></a>
            <p><p>President Donald Trump announced Thursday he had given social media platform TikTok another 90 days to find a non-Chinese buyer or be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917681/despite-law-us-tiktok-ban-likely-to-remain-on-hold">banned</a> in the United States.</p>
<p>“I’ve just signed the Executive Order extending the Deadline for the TikTok closing for 90 days (September 17, 2025),” Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114710716146853661" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on his Truth Social platform, putting off the ban for the third time.</p>
<p>A federal law requiring TikTok’s sale or ban on national security grounds was due to take effect the day before Trump’s January inauguration.</p>
<p>The Republican, whose 2024 election campaign relied heavily on social media, has previously said he is fond of the video-sharing app.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>“I have a little warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” Trump said in an <em>NBC News</em> interview in early May. “If it needs an extension, I would be willing to give it an extension.”</p>
<p>TikTok on Thursday welcomed Trump’s decision.</p>
<p>“We are grateful for President Trump’s leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users,” said a statement issued by the platform.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#digital-cold-war" id="digital-cold-war" title="Permalink"></a>Digital Cold War?</h2>
<p>Trump said in May that a group of purchasers was ready to pay TikTok owner ByteDance “a lot of money” for the video-clip-sharing sensation’s US operations.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly downplayed the risks that TikTok is in danger, saying he remains confident of finding a buyer for the app’s US business.</p>
<p>The White House had announced on Monday that Trump would throw the wildly popular video-sharing app, which has almost two billion global users, another lifeline.</p>
<p>During this new grace period, the administration will work “to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,” the administration said in a statement.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The president is “just not motivated to do anything about TikTok,” said independent analyst Rob Enderle. “Unless they get on his bad side, TikTok is probably going to be in pretty good shape.”</p>
<p>Trump had long supported a ban or divestment, but reversed his position and vowed to defend the platform after coming to believe it helped him win young voters’ support in the November election.</p>
<p>Motivated by national security fears and a belief in Washington that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese government, the ban took effect on January 19, one day before Trump’s inauguration, with ByteDance having made no attempt to find a suitor.</p>
<p>TikTok “has become a symbol of the US-China tech rivalry; a flashpoint in the new Cold War for digital control,” said Shweta Singh, an assistant professor of information systems at Warwick Business School in Britain.</p>
<p>The president announced an initial 75-day delay of the ban upon taking office. A second extension pushed the deadline to June 19. Now the deadline is September 17.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#tariff-turmoil" id="tariff-turmoil" title="Permalink"></a>Tariff turmoil</h2>
<p>Trump said in April that China would have agreed to a deal on the sale of TikTok if it were not for a dispute over his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810/trumps-tariffs-stoke-global-trade-war-as-china-eu-hit-back">tariffs</a> on Beijing.</p>
<p>ByteDance has confirmed talks with the US government, saying key matters needed to be resolved and that any deal would be “subject to approval under Chinese law.”</p>
<p>Possible solutions reportedly include seeing existing US investors in ByteDance roll over their stakes into a new independent global TikTok company.</p>
<p>Additional US investors, including Oracle and private equity firm Blackstone, would be brought on to reduce ByteDance’s share in the new TikTok.</p>
<p>Much of TikTok’s US activity is already housed on Oracle servers, and the company’s chairman, Larry Ellison, is a longtime Trump ally.</p>
<p>Uncertainty remains, particularly over what would happen to TikTok’s valuable algorithm.</p>
<p>“TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand – it’s simply not as powerful,” said Forrester Principal Analyst Kelsey Chickering.</p>
<p>Despite the turmoil, TikTok has been continuing with business as usual.</p>
<p>The platform on Monday introduced a new “Symphony” suite of generative artificial intelligence tools for advertisers to turn words or photos into video snippets for the platform.</p></p>

Many Zambians have raised the issue of this looting for years, but have met coordinated resistance. Consequently, Zambia’s treasury loses billions of dollars in revenue. These losses are driven by well-known multinationals working in concert with certain insiders close&nbsp;to the Zambian state.</p><p>Your editorial also says: “The US decision to cut $50m a year in aid to Zambia … is dreadful, and the reason given, corruption, rings hollow.” Alas, I disagree and wish to place this in context.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/ordinary-zambians-lose-out-twice-to-global-looting-and-local-corruption">Continue reading...</a></p>
