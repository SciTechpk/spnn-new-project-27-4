                <h2>Mastung blast derails 6 bogies as Jaffar Express targeted 2nd time in a week</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>No loss of life was reported after a bomb blast on a railway track in Balochistan‚Äôs Mastung district derailed six bogies of the Jaffar Express, an official said on Sunday.</p>
<p>With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province‚Äôs transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways‚Äô Quetta division, told <em>Dawn.com</em>: ‚ÄúA bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train. Fortunately, there was no loss of life.‚Äù</p>
<p>The incident occurred near the Spezand station in Mastung‚Äôs Dasht tehsil, when the train was heading from Quetta to Peshawar City station with 350 passengers on board.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecurity forces and rescue teams rushed to the site as soon as they were alerted about the incident, and began a search operation after cordoning off the area,‚Äù Kashif said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúFour bogies of the Jaffar Express had been placed back on the track, while efforts were underway to restore the other two,‚Äù the official noted.</p>
<p>A relief train of the Pakistan Railways brought the 350 passengers back to Quetta, while bogies stuck on the track will be returned to the city as well, according to a later statement from Kashif, who said that all tickets will be refunded.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, Kashif said the services of the Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail were suspended till August 14.</p>
<p>The Bolan Mail will resume its operations on August 16 (Saturday), when it will depart from Karachi ‚Äúin its proper turn‚Äù and will arrive in Quetta the next day, he added.</p>
<p>Today‚Äôs incident comes just three days after Quetta-bound Jaffar Express <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929447">narrowly escaped</a> a disaster in Balochistan‚Äôs Sibi, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train passed.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In another near-miss incident on July 24, a powerful explosion ripped through the Quetta-Sibi rail section, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926300">damaging a bogie</a> of the Bolan Mail.</p>
<p>A July 28 derailment of the Jaffar Express train in Sindh‚Äôs Sukkur was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927185">initially attributed</a> to an explosion ‚Äî even by government-run media ‚Äî but the Ministry of Railways later said a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927307">technical fault</a> was the cause.</p>
<p>In June, a powerful explosion of a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks caused four bogies of the Jaffer Express to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917945">derail in Jacobabad</a>. No one was hurt in the incident.</p>
<p>In April, the 3UP train heading from Karachi to Quetta was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904018">stopped</a> at Jacobabad railway station due to security reasons.</p>
<p>Train services betw¬≠een Quetta and the rest of the country were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900566">restored</a> on March 27, after they were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897306/all-trains-to-and-from-balochistan-suspended">suspended</a> due to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419">unprecedented hijacking</a> of the Pesha¬≠war-bound Jaffar Express earlier that month.</p>
<p>The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan‚Äôs Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897595/balochistan-standoff-ends-after-all-jaffar-express-hostages-rescued#:~:text=In%20all%2C%2021%20passengers%20lost%20their%20lives%2C%20while%20four%20FC%20personnel%20were%20martyred%2C%20the%20ISPR%20DG%20said.">21 passengers</a> and four security personnel. ‚ÄúAll 33 terrorists‚Äù were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.</p></p>

                <h2>PTI will approach lawyers over ‚Äòrumoured‚Äô 27th Amendment: Asad Qaiser</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser on Sunday addressed rumours of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, stating that the party would approach the legal fraternity regarding the potential legislation.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866452/26th-constitutional-amendment-awaits-presidential-assent-after-sailing-through-na-in-late-night-session">passing</a> the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866480">26th Constitutional Amendment</a> last year, the government had been planning to table another amendment, colloquially known as the 27th Amendment, aimed at reforming local governments and ‚Äúaddressing issues skipped in previous legislation‚Äù.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, the PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker stated that there is ‚Äúnew drama‚Äù surrounding the legislation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn this case, we will approach the lawyers‚Äô community regarding this legislation,‚Äù Qaiser said. ‚ÄúWe will begin by meeting with the Islamabad Bar this month.‚Äù</p>
<p>Referring to a ‚Äúschedule of activities‚Äù for this month, Qaiser said that the PTI will also arrange an engagement with foreign diplomats and embassies, as well as a seminar.</p>
<p>The PTI leader also assailed the manner in which the country is being governed, branding it ‚Äúillegal, unconstitutional and undemocratic‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe country is practically under martial law and decisions are being made based on personal preferences,‚Äù Qaiser stated. ‚ÄúThe country cannot be run under this hybrid system we have right now.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have decided that we will use all available forums ‚Äî parliament, the courts, the public ‚Äî to take our struggle against injustice and oppression forward.‚Äù</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Qaiser claimed that courts made decisions not based on merit, but due to institutional pressure.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe believe that the cases of political prisoners, including [PTI founder] Imran Khan, should be judged on merit, not due to pressure from the authorities,‚Äù he emphasised. ‚ÄúIf the trials are decided on merit and there is live coverage in the media, the nation will see what a drama this is.‚Äù</p>
<p>Qaiser continued: ‚ÄúThen there‚Äôs also a show in the assembly. The way it‚Äôs being controlled and the way its system is being run, as well as the way parliamentarians are being humiliated in front of Adiala Jail, is concerning. I have conducted some research into this matter and will bring it up before the National Assembly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAccording to our own rules, it is written that any MNA can inspect prisons. Is it just written down or can it actually be enforced?‚Äù he asked.</p>
<p>Details about the proposed constitutional amendment were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1868094">divulged</a> by sources following a meeting bet¬≠ween Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PPP Chairperson Bila¬≠wal Bhutto-Zardari in Lahore, atten¬≠ded by key leaders from both parties on October 27 last year.</p>
<p>In contradicting statements, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had declared that the government was not considering any such legislation. At the same time, then-adviser to the PM on Law and Justice Barr¬≠ister Aqeel Malik had hinted that the government could not only table ‚Äúan amendment‚Äù in parliament, but would also be able to pass it.</p>
<p>In June this year, amid speculation in legal circles about the government planning to bring in the 27th Amendment, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915322">endorsed</a> the amendment while calling for broad-based judicial reforms, including the nationwide rotation of judges.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ImranKhanPTI/status/1940527676537679951" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X in July, PTI founder Imran wrote that rather than bringing in the amendment ‚Äúthrough a sham parliament, it would be better to openly declare a monarchy, because what exists today is outright dictatorship, forcibly imposed on the country‚Äù.</p></p>
