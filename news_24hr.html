            <p><p>• Langrial says new 15pc tax rate on passive income aims to address disparity with active business earnings<br />
• Political leadership and intel agencies’ help enlisted to ensure compliance, root out corruption</p>
<p>KARACHI: Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial on Wednesday detailed a sweeping overhaul of the country’s tax compliance system, vowing to crack down on non-compliant sectors, expand <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913558">digital monitoring</a>, and address longstanding loopholes in the tobacco, retail and passive income tax regimes.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Geo News</em>, Mr Lan­g­rial said that the government’s re­­cent enforcement drive in the sugar sector had resulted in a 39 per cent increase in tax collection without any change in tax rates, and that si­­milar measures are now being rol­led out across other key industries.</p>
<p>“The story of non-compliance in the tobacco sector will fundamentally change, just as it did in sugar,” he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He acknowledged that raising tax rates on the formal sector often led to market erosion by the informal sector, but said the government’s solution is to target non-compliant businesses directly.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878800">Sugar mills</a> that were non-compliant have gone out of business due to our monitoring. We are now achieving almost 100 per cent compliance in most parts of the country,” Mr Langrial said.</p>
<p>He also revealed that the Intelligence Bureau was tasked with monitoring FBR teams to prevent collusion and corruption. “Thanks to the IB, we took several actions against black sheep within our own ranks,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr Langrial said similar monitoring has begun in the poultry sector, where initial checks revealed significant under-reporting of production and tax evasion. “One month of monitoring revealed millions of rupees in income tax evasion,” he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>On the issue of passive income, Mr Langrial said a new 15pc tax rate on passive income, compared to 29pc on active income, in an effort to address the bias against business investment and encourage investment.</p>
<p>Mr Langrial also addressed comparisons between the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916440">salaried</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916465/tax-relief-for-property-buyers-but-not-for-sellers">construction</a> sectors, noting that such comparisons are misleading.</p>
<p>“There exists a salaried sector inside construction, and sectors can’t be compared with types of income,” he said, emphasising the complexity of tax policy across different industries.</p>
<p>“We are saying that a person who has Rs50 million in the bank will be taxed at 15pc. This is an attempt to address the discrimination between active and passive income,” he said.</p>

            <p><p>• Finance secy says revenue numbers are already locked with IMF<br />
• Income tax rate of first slab reduced to 2.5pc, not 1pc as initially printed in Finance Bill<br />
• Change offsets additional fiscal impact from increased govt salaries<br />
• Aurangzeb defends steep pay hikes for lawmakers, ministers<br />
• Says govt held back on raising minimum wage as industry unwilling to implement previous rate<br />
• Contributory pension scheme for forces personnel may face delays</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Wednesday repeatedly warned that the government would be compelled to impose a further Rs400 to 500 billion in taxes if parliamentarians failed to approve the sweeping enforcement measures proposed in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292/budget-to-be-rolled-out-today-with-some-relief-for-salaried-group-on-the-cards">2025-26 budget</a> — as they were already cleared by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>“I now request my colleagues in both houses of parliament to get the enabling clauses for enforcement measures passed, otherwise we would have to take Rs400-500bn additional tax measures,” the usually soft-spoken minister said at his post-budget press conference, hinting at potential resistance within the ruling party, coalition partners and other pressure groups.</p>
<p>While Mr Aurangzeb did not name specific provisions, he was apparently referring to expanded enforcement powers for the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). These include the authority to block high-value financial transactions by non-filers — such as vehicle and property purchases, investment in securities and mutual funds, and opening certain prestigious bank accounts — along with powers to seal unregistered business premises, confiscate goods and recover taxes from firms, including those in the public sector.</p>
<p>At a recent special meeting, the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue raised objections to some of those measures introduced through the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909611">Tax Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2025</a> last month and hinted at tight scrutiny in due course. “Legal backing will be critical to institutionalise compliance and sustaining revenue growth,” the finance minister asserted.</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb explained that of the Rs700bn additional revenues envisaged for the next fiscal year — on top of an estimated 12 per cent organic growth in taxes driven by inflation and economic activity — about Rs389bn is tied to enforcement measures, while Rs312bn stems from additional tax measures.</p>
<p>“These numbers are locked with the IMF,” Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal said, adding that the federal cabinet’s decision to increase government workers’ salaries by 10pc — up from the originally proposed 6pc — will have an additional fiscal impact of roughly Rs28bn.</p>
<p>He was responding to a question abo­ut whether talks with the Fund were com­plete or changes would ensue bet­ween the budget presented before and to be subsequently passed by parliament.</p>
<p>Both the finance minister and the finance secretary indicated that this additional fiscal impact was filled with a change in income tax rates for the salaried class. The first income tax slab — people earning between Rs600,000 and Rs1.2 million per year — was reduced from 5pc to 2.5pc, as announced by the finance minister in his budget speech, instead of the 1pc earlier envisaged (and printed in the Finance Bill).</p>
<p>Responding to a question, Mr Auran­gzeb said that, given Pakistan’s history, int­ernational stakeholders had also dou­bted the country’s ability to enforce tax laws effectively and insisted on results.</p>
<p>During the current year, “we have demonstrated practically that we can deliver”, with Rs400bn recoveries through enforcement. “We now have the trust and credibility,” the minister said, reiterating the need for legal provisions to continue enforc­e­ment or risk Rs400bn of more taxes.</p>
<p><strong>Journalist walkout</strong></p>
<p>The presser was marred by a walkout from journalists over the cancellation of a traditional technical briefing on the Finance Bill.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The protest turned into a full-blown boycott following a decision by officials to continue the live event in the presence of their own people alone. Information Minister Atta­u­llah Tarar, who was not in attendance, had to rush to the scene to acknowledge journalists’ grievances and convince them to return to the presser.</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb also defended sharp increases, some of them as large as 550pc, in the salaries of the speaker, deputy speaker, members of parliament and ministers.</p>
<p>He insisted the hikes sh­­ould be seen in the context that the salaries of the mi­­nisters had last been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1298276">adju­s­ted</a> in 2016, compared to annual increases in the wa­­­ges of employees in pu­­blic and private sectors in line with inflation and other factors. “Had these been adjusted on an an­­n­ual basis, there would have been no sudden jump.”</p>
<p>At the same time, the finance secretary indicated delays in the implementation of a contributory pension scheme for armed forces personnel with effect from July 1, 2025, as announced by the finance minister last year.</p>
<p>Mr Bosal said the contributory scheme for military employees was not an easy job and consultations had been taking place with the Ministry of Defence.</p>
<p>Both the minister and the secretary parried questions about the size of salary increases and special allowance for armed forces personnel annou­nced in the budget speech.</p>
<p>They also did not respond to repeated questions regarding the justification and increase in allocation of funds for parliamentarians’ schemes to Rs70bn, instead of the Rs50bn approved by the Annual Plan Coordination Committee.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The minister conceded the relief in tax rates for the salaried class, corporates and other sectors was minor but insisted it should be seen in the “direction of travel” that the government would keep on following as more fiscal space became available.</p>
<p>He insisted that the government showed acknowledgement that certain sections of society are overburdened. “This is a signal from the government to start moving in the right direction,” he said.</p>
<p>Responding to a question, Mr Aurangzeb said the federal government had called provincial nominations for the new National Finance Comm­ission, as the prime minister had already announced to call its meeting in August. He rejected the impression that the Centre could unilaterally delink population from resource distribution.</p>
<p>When questioned about the proposed debt servicing surcharge (DSS) on electricity, the finance minister did not recall he had announced any such thing in his budget speech.</p>
<p>However, in his budget speech, he had said the DSS would be used not only for servicing interest but also for repaying principal debt. He also proposed amendments to the Nepra Act to allow the federal government to raise the DSS beyond the current 10pc ceiling on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum wage</strong></p>
<p>Asked why the government did not announce a minimum wage, the minister said the industry, in particular, and the private sector, in general, were not willing to pay even the previous minimum wage announced by the government.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan’s two international bonds are due for repayment in September and in April 2026, and the government was in a good position for their repayment.</p>
<p>Additionally, he ann­oun­ced plans to issue Panda bonds later this year to access China’s capital markets for diversification. The government also hopes to return to the US and European markets in 2026, contingent on improved credit ratings.</p>
<p>The minister stated that the government had eliminated additional customs duties on 4,000 tariff lines out of a total of 7,000 and reduced duties on an additional 2,700 lines as part of structural reforms aim­ed at aligning Pakis­tan’s trade and industrial policy with global standards.</p>
<p>These steps are part of a phased reform plan to simplify Pakistan’s tariff reg­i­me, aiming for an average rate of just over 4pc.</p>
<p>“Of these, around 2,000 tariff lines are directly linked to raw materials and intermediary goods used by the exporters,” he said. “This is the structural reform not taken in the past 30 years. This is a huge step, and we are committed to taking it forward gradually.”</p>
<p><strong>Breathe Pakistan</strong></p>
<p>The finance minister also expressed his gratitude to DawnMedia for its climate change initiative, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1863178">Breathe Pakistan</a>.</p>
<p>“I am very thankful to Dawn Group for the initiative it has taken on climate cha­n­­ge,” he said. “I have repeatedly said this (climate cha­nge) is an existential threat to Pakistan. Through Breathe Paki­st­an, you have taken it forward, and I commend you, your institution and your sponsors for highlighting this issue and its importance.”</p>
<p>He added, “It’s no longer just about the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1724134">floods</a> of 2022 — those of us living in Islamabad now experience windstorms and hailstorm every week. This never happened before. We are living climate change day in and day out. I want to sincerely thank your institution for leading the charge under Breathe Pakistan.”</p>

            <p><p>US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that US personnel were being moved out of the Middle East because “it could be a dangerous place”, adding that the United States would not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-embassy-iraq-preparing-ordered-evacuation-due-heightened-security-risks-2025-06-11/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> earlier on Wednesday that the US is preparing a partial evacuation of its Iraqi embassy and will allow military dependents to leave locations around the Middle East due to heightened security risks in the region, according to US and Iraqi sources.</p>
<p>The four US and two Iraqi sources did not say what security risks had prompted the decision, and reports of the potential evacuation pushed up oil prices by more than four per cent.</p>
<p>A US official said the State Department had authorised voluntary departures from Bahrain and Kuwait.</p>
<p>The State Department updated its <a class="link--external" href="https://iq.usembassy.gov/travel-advisory-update-ordered-departure-of-non-emergency-u-s-government-personnel-from-mission-iraq/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worldwide travel advisory</a> on Wednesday evening to reflect the latest US posture. “On June 11, the Department of State ordered the departure of non-emergency US government personnel due to heightened regional tensions,” the advisory said.</p>
<p>The decision by the US to evacuate some personnel comes at a volatile moment in the region. Trump’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916072">efforts</a> to reach a nuclear deal with Iran appear to be deadlocked, and US intelligence indicates that Israel has been making preparations for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912630">strike</a> against Iran’s nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>“They are being moved out because it could be a dangerous place, and we’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters. “We’ve given notice to move out.”</p>
<p>Asked whether anything can be done to lower the temperature in the region, Trump said: “They can’t have a nuclear weapon. Very simple, they can’t have a nuclear weapon.”</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904314">threatened</a> to strike Iran if stuttering talks over its nuclear programme fail. In an <a class="link--external" href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/11/us-news/biden-aides-committed-crimes-with-autopen-trump-tells-the-posts-pod-force-one/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> released earlier on Wednesday, Trump said that he was growing less confident that Tehran would agree to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913553">stop</a> enriching uranium, a key American demand.</p>
<p>Iranian Defence Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh also said yesterday that if Iran was subjected to strikes, it would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916525">retaliate</a> by hitting US bases in the region.</p>
<p>The US embassy in Kuwait said in a statement that it had “not changed its staffing posture and remains fully operational.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#military-presence" id="military-presence" title="Permalink"></a>Military presence</h2>
<p>The US has a military presence across the major oil-producing region, with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1810981">bases</a> in Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorised the voluntary departure of military dependents from locations across the Middle East, a US official said. Another US official said that it was mostly relevant to family members located in Bahrain — where the bulk of them are based.</p>
<p>“The State Department is set to have an ordered departure for [the] US embassy in Baghdad. The intent is to do it through commercial means, but the US military is standing by if help is requested,” a third US official said.</p>
<p>Iraq’s state news agency cited a government source as saying Baghdad had not recorded any security indication that called for an evacuation.</p>
<p>Another US official said that there was no change in operations at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest US military base in the Middle East and that no evacuation order had been issued for employees or families linked to the US embassy in Qatar, which was operating as usual.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#tensions" id="tensions" title="Permalink"></a>Tensions</h2>
<p>Oil futures climbed $3 on reports of the Baghdad evacuation, with Brent crude futures at $69.18 a barrel.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Britain’s maritime agency warned that increased tensions in the Middle East may lead to an escalation in military activity that could impact shipping in critical waterways. It advised vessels to use caution while travelling through the Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the Straits of Hormuz, which all border Iran.</p>
<p>Britain’s Foreign Office said it was monitoring the situation and would keep its embassy in Iraq under constant review following the US moves.</p>

<p>Iraq, a rare regional partner of both the US and its arch-regional foe Iran, hosts 2,500 US troops, although allegedly Tehran-backed armed factions are linked to its security forces.</p>
<p>Tensions inside Iraq have heightened since the start of Israel’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1779807">bombardment</a> of Gaza in October 2023, with armed groups in the country repeatedly attacking US troops, though attacks have subsided since last year.</p>
<p>Israel and Iran also twice <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1862397">exchanged</a> fire last year — the first ever such direct attacks between the region’s most entrenched enemies — with missiles and war drones hurtling across Iraqi airspace.</p>
<p>Top US regional ally Israel has also struck targets across the region, including Iraqi armed groups operating both inside Iraq and in neighbouring <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1873745">Syria</a>.</p>
<p>In recent months, the US has deployed more military assets in the Middle East, including B-2 bombers, which have since been replaced, and extended the deployment of a second aircraft carrier, which has since departed.</p>
<p>The next round of nuclear talks between Iran and the US is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312/iran-says-new-round-of-us-talks-planned-for-sunday">due</a> in the coming days, with Iran expected to hand over a counterproposal after rejecting an offer by Washington.</p>
<p>A senior Iranian official told <em>Reuters</em> that a military threat had always been part of the US’s negotiation tactics with Iran.</p>
<p>“Any military action against Iran, whether by the US or Israel, will have serious consequences,” the official warned.</p>
<p>Iran’s UN mission yesterday <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/Iran_UN/status/1932856661594587161" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on X: “Threats of ‘overwhelming force’ won’t change facts: Iran is not seeking a nuclear weapon and US militarism only fuels instability.”</p>

<p>The statement appeared to be a response to an earlier comment by US Army General Michael “Erik” Kurilla, the head of US Central Command, that he had provided the president with “a wide range of options” to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.</p>
<p>Kurilla postponed testimony he was due to deliver before US lawmakers today because of tensions in the Middle East, two other US officials said.</p></p>

Several regions could climb to 10C (50F) above seasonal norms, with Italy braced for the full force of the heat. Florence in Tuscany is forecast to soar to a sweltering 39C on Thursday and across the weekend.</p><p>Germany, France and Belgium will also face hot weather from Wednesday, with widespread highs at least 9C above the June average. Many other parts of Europe are forecast to experience temperatures 5-7C above normal. This is the result of a high-pressure system creating a heat dome over the region, whereby sinking air compresses and warms as it descends, trapping heat near the surface.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/09/weather-tracker-storms-summer-heat-europe-south-africa">Continue reading...</a></p>
