                <h2>Pakistan receives second tranche of $1bn from IMF</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan has received the second tranche of special drawing rights (SDR) worth $1.023 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme, the central bank said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The amount will be reflected in its foreign exchange reserves for the week ending on May 16, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said in a post on X. It would raise the reserves to $11.355bn.</p>

<p>Last week, the IMF had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">approved</a> the immediate disbursement of about $1bn to Pakistan under the ongoing EFF and allowed an additional arrangement for the $1.4bn Resilience and Sus¬≠tainability Facility (RSF).</p>
<p>In a statement issued last Friday, the IMF had said its Executive Board completed the first review of Pakistan‚Äôs economic reform programme supported by the EFF arrangement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis decision allows for an immediate disbursement of around $1bn (SDR 760 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to about $2.1bn (SDR 1.52bn). In addition, the IMF Executive Board approved the authorities‚Äô request for an arrangement under the RSF, with access of about $1.4bn (SDR 1bn),‚Äù it said.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>It noted that Pakistan‚Äôs policy efforts under the EFF had already delivered ‚Äúsignificant progress‚Äù in stabilising the economy and rebuilding confidence, amidst a challenging global environment.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFiscal performance has been strong, with a primary surplus of two per cent of gross domestic product achieved in the first half of FY25, keeping Pakistan on track to meet the end-FY25 target of 2.1pc of GDP.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInflation fell to a historic low of 0.3pc in April, and progress on disinflation and steadier domestic and external conditions, have allowed the State Bank of Pakistan to cut the policy rate by a total of 1100 bps since June 2025. Gross reserves stood at $10.3bn at end-April, up from $9.4bn in August 2024, and are projected to reach $13.9bn by end-June 2025 and continue to be rebuilt over the medium term.‚Äù</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it said the RSF would support the authorities‚Äô efforts to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and build economic and climate resilience.</p>
<p>A statement from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office (PMO) had said PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction over the approval and ‚Äúthe failure of India‚Äôs high-handed tactics‚Äù against Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe country‚Äôs economic situation has improved and the country is moving towards development. India is plotting a conspiracy to divert attention from our country‚Äôs development through unilateral aggression.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInternational institutions have responsibly rejected India‚Äôs false propaganda. Indian attempts to sabotage the IMF programme have failed,‚Äù it quoted the prime minister as saying.</p></p>

                <h2>Trump meets Syrian president, says he is looking into normalising ties</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump met with Syria‚Äôs president in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, after a surprise US announcement it would lift all sanctions on the Islamist-led government, and said Washington was exploring the possibility of normalising ties with Damascus.</p>
<p>He made the comments during a summit between the US and Gulf Arab countries. Trump met Syria‚Äôs Ahmed al-Sharaa before the summit. Photos posted on Saudi state television showed them shaking hands in the presence of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs crown prince.</p>
<p>Trump also urged Sharaa to normalise ties with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910555">Israel</a>, a White House spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Despite concerns within sectors of his administration over Syria‚Äôs leaders‚Äô former ties to Al Qaeda, Trump said on Tuesday during a speech in Riyadh he would lift sanctions on Syria in a major policy shift.</p>
<p>Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan joined Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MbS, virtually in the meeting, <em>Anadolu News Agency</em> reported.</p>
<p>MbS told the summit Saudi Arabia commends Trumps decision to lift sanctions on Syria.</p>
<p>The lifting of sanctions came despite deep Israeli suspicion of Sharaa‚Äôs administration, worries initially shared by some US officials. Israeli officials have continued to describe Sharaa as a jihadist, though he severed ties with al Qaeda in 2016. <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908118">Israel‚Äôs government</a> did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>The decision is a major boost for Sharaa, who has been struggling to bring the country under the control of the Damascus government after toppling former President Bashar al-Assad in December.</p>
<p>The challenges were laid bare in March when Assad loyalists attacked government forces, prompting revenge attacks in which Islamist gunmen killed hundreds of civilians from the Alawite minority, drawing strong US condemnation.</p>

<p>Trump is on a four-day visit to the oil-rich Gulf states that includes stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs first day of a four-day swing through the Gulf region was marked by lavish ceremony and business deals, including a <a class="link--external" href="https://-600bn-saudi-investment-pledge" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$600 billion commitment</a> from Saudi Arabia to invest in the US and $142 billion in US arms sales to the kingdom.</p>
<p>Later today, Trump will fly to the Qatari capital Doha, where he will participate in a state visit with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and other officials. Qatar, a key US ally, is expected to announce hundreds of billions of dollars in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910749/trump-starts-gulf-visit-seeking-big-economic-deals">investments</a> in the US.</p>
<p>US ally Israel has opposed sanctions relief for Syria, but Trump on Tuesday said that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who are both close to the US president, encouraged him to make the move.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#former-al-qaeda-commander" id="former-al-qaeda-commander" title="Permalink"></a>Former Al Qaeda commander</h2>
<p>Sharaa was for years the leader of al Qaeda‚Äôs official wing in the Syrian conflict. He first joined the group in Iraq, where he spent five years in a US prison. The United States removed a $10 million bounty on Sharaa‚Äôs head in December.</p>
<p>His interactions with Sharaa, who led rebel forces that toppled former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December, will be closely watched as observers gauge how serious Washington is about resetting its relationship with Damascus.</p>
<p>Sharaa renounced ties to Al Qaeda in 2016.</p></p>
