                <h2>Govt says Punjab Assembly opposition leader‚Äôs 10-year sentence in May 9 riots case according to law</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The federal government on Tuesday welcomed a Sargodha Anti-Terrorism Court‚Äôs (ATC) sentencing of Leader of Opposition in Punjab Assembly (PA) Malik Ahmed Khan Bhachar to 10 years in prison over a case related to the nationwide riots on May 9, 2023, hailing it as a positive step.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, military installations and state-owned buildings were vandalised as PTI supporters protested the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">arrest</a> of ex-premier Imran Khan ‚Äî who was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1752306">released</a> later but has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a> in various <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885852">cases</a> since August 2023. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including the party‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1774736">top leadership</a>, were arrested.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Addressing a press conference today in Islamabad, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said: ‚ÄúToday, the Sargodha ATC issued an order and we welcome it ‚Ä¶ I think it is a very positive step as justice has been upheld.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said the verdict ‚Äúfulfils all requirements of justice‚Äù and followed due process since the entire trial proceedings were carried out legally. ‚ÄúThe decision announced is in accordance with the law and the Constitution,‚Äù Malik said.</p>
<p>The state minister said Bhachar, PTI MNA Ahmed Chattha and former MNA Bilal Ejaz were sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment each in a case related to the riots.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen you take the law into your own hand, whether you‚Äôre an MNA or MPA or opposition leader ‚Ä¶ the [status] doesn‚Äôt matter, as the law is equal for everyone and will come into force.‚Äù</p>
<p>Malik hoped that other May 9-related cases would be decided soon as well.</p>
<p>Assailing the PTI, he alleged that the riots were ‚Äúcarefully curated‚Äù via ‚Äúplanning‚Äù to precisely attack over 200 locations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bachar said in a post on X that he would not abandon his support of Imran.</p>

<p>PTI MNA Asad Qaiser condemned the sentences, alleging that ‚Äúneither was any transparent or legal procedure followed in the case, nor was any credible witness presented. The demands of justice were grossly violated.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said in a post on X that the party would challenge the ‚Äúbiased decision‚Äù in the high court.</p>

<p>Terming the decision ‚Äúoutright injustice‚Äù, the party‚Äôs South Punjab wing said, ‚ÄúThe truth is that the establishment‚Äôs role in this entire process is evident to all, and nothing called justice remains.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese punishments are not only vengeful actions but also an insult to the country‚Äôs democracy, judiciary, and people, and now the people will no longer stay silent!‚Äù the statement read.</p>

<p>However, days ago, in a significant step towards de-escalation of political tensions, Ahmad formally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925367">rejected</a> the disqualification petitions following <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924877/punjab-assembly-talks-progress-but-pti-stands-firm-on-suspensions">negotiations</a> between the government and the opposition.</p>
<p>A notification by the assembly secretariat today said the 26 PTI lawmakers stood restored as MPAs.</p>
<p>The notification, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, said that the earlier order to suspend the provincial assembly members was withdrawn. The order listed the names of the 26 PTI MPAs.</p></p>

The flood-related death toll in the region rose to five today, after four lost their lives and 15 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719">went missing</a> yesterday in Diamer‚Äôs Babusar area.</p>
<p>In its alert, the PMD warned that the prevailing weather conditions increased the risk of Glofs, flash floods and landslides in vulnerable glaciated regions of GB and KP.</p>
<p>It forecast that the wet spell was likely to continue and could affect GB and KP in the current week, adding that scattered rain and thunderstorms, with isolated heavy falls, were expected in both regions.</p>

<p>Retired Colonel Ishaq Qazi, aged approximately 62‚Äì64 years and a resident of Defence Housing Authority Phase 5, ‚Äúleft his home along with his daughter, aged around 25 years, in a grey Honda City vehicle‚Äù, said a statement by Islamabad‚Äôs Sihala police station.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDue to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>A search operation by the police, Rescue 1122, DHA Phase 5 staff and a team of divers was underway, the statement said. A car bumper was recovered later as the search went on.</p>
<p>A video showed a man steering the vehicle in accumulated floodwater, with a person in the back waving their hand out. The car took a short, sharp slide downwards, after which it got swept away in the water, as some people gathered on a nearby bridge.</p>
