                <h2>Dar slams Israel, US attacks against fellow SCO member Iran as ‚Äòunacceptable‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday slammed last month‚Äôs attacks by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/tel-aviv-in-smoke-as-iran-launches-missiles-under-operation-true-promise-3-after-day-long-israeli-attacks">Israel</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">United States</a> on Iran as ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù as he attended a ministerial meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in China‚Äôs Tianjin.</p>
<p>The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. The group‚Äôs foreign ministers meet as a precursor to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1864831">annual summit</a> of its leaders, which will be hosted <a class="link--external" href="https://www.chinadailyasia.com/hk/article/615887" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by China</a> this autumn in Tianjin.</p>
<p>On June 13, Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign on Iran that targeted military and nuclear sites as well as residential areas, and killed senior military commanders, nuclear scientists and civilians. The attacks began days before a planned meeting between Tehran and Washington aimed at reviving nuclear negotiations. The US, which had been in talks with Iran since April 12, joined Israel in carrying out its own strikes on June 22, targeting Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz. Iranian authorities say the Israeli strikes killed at least 1,060 people.</p>
<p>Addressing the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers today, Dar said: ‚ÄúWe have strongly condemned the unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran and the US strikes on its nuclear facilities. Such illegal actions directed against SCO member states are unacceptable.‚Äù</p>
<p>Continuing his criticism of Israel, he said: ‚ÄúIsrael has shown a reckless disregard for international norms and humanity through its relentless and disproportionate use of force in Gaza, resulting in the death of tens of thousands of civilians causing the worst humanitarian crisis in Gaza. We call for immediate halt to Israel‚Äôs atrocities. The only viable remedy to Palestine dispute is the realisation of two-state solution which includes the establishment of Palestine as a viable, secure and contiguous state on the basis of pre-1967 borders with Al Quds as its capital.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUnilateral and illegal measures to change the status of disputed territories in violation of UN Security Council resolutions must be strongly condemned and opposed by all.‚Äù</p>

<p>Dar said Pakistan was ‚Äúincreasingly concerned at the trends of using aggression as a tool of policy.‚Äù</p>
<p>Instead, he called for the resolution of longstanding disputes through peaceful means, dialogue, diplomacy and according to the principles of international law, justice and fairness.</p>

<p>On regional issues, FM Dar said Pakistan sought a relationship of peace and stability with all its neighbours.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, the last three months witnessed extremely disturbing developments in South Asia. It is most unfortunate that the attribution of the Pahalgam Attack to Pakistan ‚Äî without a credible investigation or verifiable evidence ‚Äî brought the two nuclear-armed states to the brink of a major conflict. In the wake of mounting tensions, Pakistan‚Äôs restrained and responsible approach was met with legal transgressions, rhetorical belligerence, and strategic recklessness.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan remains steadfast in its commitment to the ceasefire and the cultivation of a stable regional equilibrium. However, we cannot accept that the arbitrary use of force is normalised. We believe that disputes and differences are resolved through dialogue and diplomacy, instead of conflict and coercion. In that backdrop, initiation of a comprehensive and structured dialogue can meaningfully address the full spectrum of issues that have long bedevilled the peace and security in South Asia. Strict adherence to bilateral agreements would be equally important in this regard.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said the events unfolding in the region since the April 22 terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam reaffirmed a ‚Äúcentral truth‚Äù of South Asian geopolitics: the peaceful settlement of longstanding unresolved disputes was ‚Äúimperative for an enduring peace‚Äù in the region.</p>
<p>Dar added that enduring peace and stability in Afghanistan also constituted a cornerstone of the SCO members‚Äô shared aspiration. He pointed out that the revival of the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group could serve as a valuable platform for pragmatic and results-oriented cooperation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTerrorism is the common concern of humanity that threatens global security. All forms of terrorism, including state terrorism are condemnable. We must shun the use of terrorism for political purposes and combat this menace through a cooperative approach, including addressing its root causes.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said the SCO was a vital platform for realising the benefits of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), pointing out that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a flagship BRI project, not only supplemented the SCO‚Äôs vision of regional connectivity and economic integration but also complemented its common objective of shared development and prosperity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe need to take concrete steps within existing SCO‚Äôs mechanisms for trade and development and promote the use of national currencies for mutual settlement within SCO region to avoid international financial shocks. We support the proposal to create SCO alternative development funding mechanism to give needed impetus to various stalled development initiatives.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs the permanent chair of the SCO‚Äôs Special Working Group dedicated to combatting poverty, Pakistan is fully committed to providing the necessary momentum to our collaborative endeavours to address poverty.‚Äù</p>
<p>Dar called on the SCO members to also collectively address the ‚Äúexistential threat‚Äù of climate change.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>

<p>‚ÄúAt a time when the global order is experiencing profound challenges, SCO has emerged as a stabilising force. Its inclusive approach underscoring the sovereign equality of states and seeking peaceful resolutions to disputes, offers a compelling alternative to aggression, confrontation and zero-sum rivalries. The SCO‚Äôs commitment to consensus, development, and mutual respect is a beacon of hope for building a better and equitable world.‚Äù</p>
<p>Stressing Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to the organisation and its principles, Dar said: ‚ÄúIn our pursuit to peace and security, we believe in non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, non-use of force or threat of its use in international relations, as well as seeking no unilateral military superiority in the region.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a post on X after the meeting, Dar said: ‚ÄúAt the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers meeting today, we reaffirmed our shared commitment to multilateralism, mutual respect and regional stability. The Shanghai Spirit continues to guide us towards dialogue, mutual trust and the pursuit of a more just and inclusive international order.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>Lahore court frees man involved in anti-Punjab CM rant</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A Lahore sessions court on Tuesday discharged an elderly man named Muhammad Sajid, involved in recently using inappropriate language against the Punjab chief minister in a viral video, in a case dating back to 2024.</p>
<p>A few days ago, a video of Sajid riding a motorcycle in the rain went viral on social media, in which he could be heard using abusive language against the chief minister.</p>
<p>A sessions court on Monday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924323/rant-against-cm-reply-sought-on-habeas-plea">sought</a> a reply from Johar Town police on a habeas corpus petition seeking his recovery. Sajid‚Äôs son Muhammad Umar had filed the petition for the recovery of his father.</p>
<p>According to the court order, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, ‚ÄúNo incriminating evidence is present against the accused person to be sent to judicial remand.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHence, the request of the investigating officer (IO) has been turned down, the accused person is discharged from the instant case ‚Ä¶ first information report, and the IO is ordered to release the person forthwith‚Äù.</p>
<p>The Lahore court discharged Sajid after he was nominated in a June 2024 case filed by the Green Town police station. Police subsequently released the senior citizen from handcuffs.</p>
<p>Police had arrested the citizen on July 14, according to a request for his judicial remand and presented him in the Model Town court today.</p>
<p>The accused‚Äôs counsel, Advocate Noman Sarwar Dogar, argued that his client had been wrongfully nominated in the 2024 FIR by the police.</p>
<p>The court observed in its order that all the facts and circumstances of the case create doubt in the police‚Äôs version of events.</p>
<p>In the habeas corpus case, the petitioner, Advocate Sameer Khan Khattak, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924323/rant-against-cm-reply-sought-on-habeas-plea#:~:text=Sameer%20Khan%20Khattak-,alleged,-that%20Johar%20Town">alleged</a> that Johar Town police had illegally detained his client‚Äôs father for the past two days.</p>
<p>He had claimed that Sajid had been arrested without any registered case and had not been produced before any court.</p>
<p>The counsel also stated that the police had forced the petitioner‚Äôs father to record apology videos, which were later circulated on social media.</p>
<p>He asked the court to order the recovery and release of the petitioner‚Äôs father.</p>
<p>Additional District and Sessions Judge Ghulam Farid had issued a notice to the Johar Town station house officer and directed him to file a reply by July 15.</p></p>
