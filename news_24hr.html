            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913238/govt-allocates-2000mw-for-bitcoin-mining-and-ai-data-centres' target='_blank'><strong>Govt allocates 2,000MW for Bitcoin mining and AI data centres</strong></a>
            <p><p>In a groundbreaking move to transform Pakistan into a global leader in digital innovation, the government has announced the allocation of 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the first phase of a national initiative to power Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.</p>
<p>The government recently decided to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899163">legalise</a> cryptocurrency to lure international investment in Pakistan. The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) was launched in March to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912539/govt-sets-up-digital-assets-authority-as-per-fatf-requirement">digital assets</a>” into the country’s financial landscape.</p>
<p>The federal government appointed entrepreneur <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895975">Bilal Bin Saqib</a> as the chief adviser to the finance minister on the council.</p>
<p>A statement by the Finance Division says this ambitious initiative is spearheaded by the PCC — a government-backed body under the Ministry of Finance — as part of a broader strategy to “monetise surplus electricity, create high-tech jobs, attract billions of dollars in foreign direct investment, and generate billions of dollars for the government”.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb stated that this strategic allocation marks a pivotal moment in Pakistan’s digital transformation journey, unlocking economic potential by turning excess energy into innovation, investment, and international revenue.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is uniquely positioned — both geographically and economically — to become a global hub for data centres. As a digital bridge between Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, Pakistan offers the most strategic location in the world for data flow and digital infrastructure,” the statement says.</p>
<p>It said that since the inception of the PCC, there has been tremendous interest from global Bitcoin miners and data infrastructure companies. Several international firms have already visited the country for exploratory discussions, and following this landmark announcement, more global players are expected to visit in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>“Pakistan’s underutilised power generation capacity is now being repurposed into a high-value digital asset. AI data centres and Bitcoin mining operations, known for their consistent and heavy energy usage, provide an ideal use case for this surplus.</p>
<p>“Redirecting idle energy, especially from plants operating below capacity, allows Pakistan to convert a long-standing financial liability into a sustainable, revenue-generating opportunity,” the statement added.</p>
<p>PCC CEO Bilal Bin Saqib emphasised the transformative nature of this initiative, and explained that with proper regulation, transparency, and international collaboration, Pakistan can become a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1609742">global crypto</a> and AI powerhouse.</p>
<p>Saqib said that this energy-backed digital transformation not only unlocks high-value investment but enables the government to generate foreign exchange in US dollars through Bitcoin mining.</p>
<p>Additionally, as regulations evolve, Pakistan can accumulate Bitcoin directly into a national wallet — marking a monumental shift from selling power in Pakistani rupees to leveraging digital assets for economic stability.</p>
<p>By offering stable and affordable energy, the statement said Pakistan presents a highly competitive environment compared to regional counterparts like India and Singapore, where rising power costs and land scarcity limit scalability.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s strategic advantage is further underscored by the global context as AI data centre demand has soared to over 100 gigawatts (GW), the global supply remains around 15GW. This massive shortfall creates an unprecedented opportunity for countries like Pakistan with surplus power, land and an emerging regulatory framework, it added.</p>
<p>The statement further said the country’s digital connectivity has also been significantly strengthened by the landing of the world’s largest submarine internet cable. The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893743">Africa-2 Cable Project</a>, a 45,000-kilometre global network connecting 33 countries through 46 landing stations, has now landed in Pakistan.</p>
<p>This milestone enhances Pakistan’s internet bandwidth, latency, and resilience through redundant fiber routes — key for ensuring high availability and operational continuity for AI data centres.</p>
<p>With more than 40 million crypto users, Pakistan holds immense potential as a regional leader in digital services. Establishing local AI data centres will not only address growing concerns around data sovereignty but will also enhance cybersecurity, improve digital service delivery, and empower national capabilities in AI and cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>These centres are expected to create thousands of direct and indirect jobs, catalysing the development of a skilled workforce in engineering, IT, and data sciences.</p>
<p>The statement adds that this announcement marks only the first phase of a broader, multi-stage digital infrastructure rollout. Future developments are expected to include renewable energy-powered facilities — leveraging Pakistan’s immense <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1861999">wind</a> (50,000MW potential in the Gharo-Keti Bandar corridor), solar, and hydropower resources — as well as strategic international partnerships with leading blockchain and AI companies, and the establishment of fintech and innovation hubs.</p>
<p>These efforts will be complemented by proposed incentives such as tax holidays, customs duty exemptions on equipment, and reduced taxes for AI infrastructure developers, it added.</p>
<p>“Pakistan’s combination of surplus power, geographic advantage, advanced subsea cable connectivity, renewable energy potential, and a large, digitally engaged population creates a compelling case for becoming a regional epicenter of Web3, AI, and digital innovation.</p>
<p>“With the right incentives, strategic investments, and collaborative partnerships, Pakistan is positioning itself not only as a destination for global digital infrastructure but also as a sovereign economy that can accumulate digital assets, export digital services, and lead in the next generation of technological transformation.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif departed for Turkiye on Sunday afternoon as he embarked on the first leg of his four-nation tour aimed at strengthening ties with the friendly countries.</p>
<p>The premier will visit Turkiye, Iran, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan from May 25-30, according to the <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/curtain-raiser-prime-ministers-visit-to-turkiye-iran-azerbaijan-and-tajikistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Foreign Office</a>. The tour follows diplomatic support voiced by three of these countries for Pakistan during the recent military confrontation with India.</p>
<p>The prime minister is accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi, state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/25-05-2025/pm-leaves-for-turkiye-on-first-leg-of-four-nation-tour" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> reported.</p>

<p>During the visit, PM Shehbaz will have “wide-ranging discussions with the leaders of these countries on an entire range of issues covering bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance”, according to the FO.</p>
<p>“He will also have the opportunity to express the deepest appreciation and acknowledgement for the support extended to Pakistan by the friendly countries during the recent crisis with India,” it noted.</p>
<p>While in Tajikistan — likely the last leg of his tour — the premier will also attend the International Conference on Glaciers being held in its capital, Dushanbe, on May 29 and 30.</p>
<p>As tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi escalated, with India launching deadly strikes on Pakistan on May 6, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909193/erdogan-conveys-turkiyes-solidarity-to-pm-shehbaz-amid-india-escalation">conveyed his solidarity</a> to the prime minister and said it supported Pakistan’s “calm and restrained policies”.</p>
<p>Following the tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">airbase attacks</a> and a US-brokered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> between the two neighbours, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev had “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911194/azerbaijan-hails-pakistans-remarkable-success-during-recent-military-strife-with-india-pmo">warmly congratulated</a> PM Shehbaz upon Pakistan’s remarkable success”, according to the PM Office.</p>
<p>Iran had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">offered to mediate</a> during the escalation and paid a visit to both <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">Islamabad</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909355/irans-foreign-minister-repeats-call-for-restraint-in-india-pakistan-standoff">New Delhi</a> in peace efforts, which were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911597">appreciated</a> by PM Shehbaz and the military’s spokesperson.</p>

<p>The diplomatic support voiced by Turkiye and Azerbaijan stoked anger in India as people <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cancelled their holidays</a> in popular resorts in the two countries.</p>
<p>The moves <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911469">intensified</a> as Adani group-operated Mumbai and Ahmedabad airports ended the ground handling concession agreements with Çelebi, an Istanbul-headquartered airport.</p>
<p>Small Indian grocery shops and major online fashion retailers also began a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912015">boycott of Turkish products</a> ranging from chocolates, coffee, jams and cosmetics to clothing.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913144/indias-water-move-threatens-millions-un-told' target='_blank'><strong>India’s water move threatens millions, UN told</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Pakistan terms IWT suspension ‘dangerous escalation’<br />
• Officials spar over India’s targeting of civilian areas</p>
<p>UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan has warned the United Nations that India’s unilateral decision to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274">suspend</a> the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) represents a dangerous escalation that violates international law and threatens the survival of more than 240 million people.</p>
<p>Speaking at a UN meeting on protecting water in armed conflict on Friday evening, Pakistan urged the world community to act before such actions triggered a humanitarian catastrophe or destabilised the region.</p>
<p>“This is a grave violation of international law, including human rights law, the treaty law and customary international law,” said Ambassador Usman Jadoon, Pakistan’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, at the Arria Formula meeting convened by Slovenia.</p>
<p>“We strongly condemn India’s unlawful announcement to hold the Treaty in abeyance and call upon India to strictly abide by its legal obligations and refrain from stopping, diverting or restricting rivers that are a lifeline for 240 million people of Pakistan. We will never accept any such moves,” Ambassador Jadoon said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

<p>He also drew attention to Indian leaders’ <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912761">alarming statements</a>, noting that “troubling pronouncements by the Indian leadership to ‘starve the people of Pakistan’ depict a highly dangerous and perverse thinking.</p>
<p>Pakistan used the UN forum to appeal for international consensus against the weaponisation of water.</p>
<p>Ambassador Jadoon urged the Security Council to monitor such developments closely and take pre-emptive action where necessary:</p>
<p>“The Council must play a role by identifying situations where violations of international law, including IHL (International Humanitarian Law) principles, could jeopardise peace and security or lead to catastrophic humanitarian crisis.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Pakistan’s statement highlighted three key points, legal prohibitions, obligations of warring parties and weaponisation of water. International law, including human rights law and IHL, prohibits attacks on water resources and related infrastructure. Den­ying access to water violates established norms and UN Security Council resolutions. Similarly, all parties in a conflict are bound by the IHL and must avoid actions that result in severe humanitarian consequences. Besides, using water as a tool of coercion or warfare is unacceptable and destabilising.</p>
<p>“It is regrettable that one country, exhibiting malevolent designs, has chosen to weaponise water in addition to using it as a bargain chip,” the diplomat said.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s statement comes amid growing concern in Islamabad over India’s recent efforts to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911383">bypass</a> treaty mechanisms and undermine the role of international mediators, particularly the World Bank, which had brokered the Treaty 1960. Officials in Pakistan view these actions as part of a broader pattern aimed at eroding cooperative frameworks and applying pressure on Islamabad through non-military means.</p>
<p>Ambassador Jadoon reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for global efforts to ensure the protection of water resources during conflicts and emphasised the need for a “resolute, principled and united stand” against any attempts to politicise or militarise water.</p>
<p><strong>Terror charge rejected</strong></p>
<p>At a separate meeting, delegates from Delhi and Islamabad engaged in a sharp verbal duel at the UN, after Pakistani Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad denounced the Indian military for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">targeting civilian areas</a> during the recent clash.</p>
<p>The exchange took place at the Security Council during its debate on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict on Friday.</p>
<p>Indian Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish reacted to his Pakistani counterpart’s tough statement, and while repeating Delhi’s usual allegations said that Pakistan had no justification to talk about civilians when it is using terrorism as a policy.</p>
<p>Pakistani delegate Saima Saleem hit back, accusing the Indian envoy of relying on “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909699">disinformation</a>, deflection and denial” as she said India was itself involved in acts of terrorism.</p>
<p>“No amount of obfuscation can hide the facts. India brazenly kills and maims civilians in occupied Jammu and Kashmir, carries out blatant aggression against Pakistan by targeting civilians and sponsors terrorism and assassinations in my country and across the globe,” Ms Saleem, a counsellor at the Pakistan Mission, told the 15-member Council.</p>
<p>India, she said, had even stooped to a new low of impeding the flow of rivers that serve as a lifeline for the 240 million people of Pakistan.</p>
<p>She pointed out that Pakistan, together with the international community, had condemned the Pahalgam incident.</p>
<p>“If India had nothing to hide, it should have agreed to credible, impartial and independent investigations into the incident,” the delegate said. “On the contrary,” she added, “India continues to subject people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir to state-sponsored terrorism to suppress their legitimate freedom struggle.”</p>
<p><strong>Blatant aggression</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this month, she recalled, India committed blatant aggression against Pakistan, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910848">launching unprovoked attacks on innocent civilians</a>, killing 40 people including seven women and 15 children and injuring 121 others, including 10 women and 27 children.</p>
<p>“India certainly has no credibility to lecture others on the protection of civilians,” Ms Saleem told delegates.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts and sacrifices, she pointed out, were well-known and acknowledged globally and Islamabad remains steadfast in its commitment to combat this menace.</p>
<p>On the other hand, she said, India continues to actively fund and support terror proxies that include <em>Fitna Al Khawarij</em> —the term used by the government for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, Balochistan Liberation Army and its Majeed Brigade group — to kill innocent civilians in Pakistan.</p>
<p>She drew the delegates’ attention to the recent savage attack on a school bus in Khuzdar that took the lives of innocent school-going children and left dozens injured.</p>
<p>“If India is genuinely committed to peace and security and good neighbourliness, it should end its state-sponsored terrorism, cease its oppression of Kashmiris, comply with its obligations under international law, UN Charter and bilateral treaties, and engage in meaningful dialogue for the peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the wishes of the Kashmiri people,” Ms Saleem added.</p>
