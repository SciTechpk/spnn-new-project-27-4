            <p><p>Pakistan was appointed as the vice chair of the UN Security Council’s (UNSC) Counter-Terrorism Committee on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The committee was established by UNSC resolution 1373 (2001), adopted unanimously on September 28, 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.</p>
<p>The committee, comprising all 15 UNSC members, is tasked with monitoring implementation of the above resolution, which requested countries to implement several measures intended to enhance their legal and institutional ability to counter terrorist activities at home, in their regions and around the world.</p>
<p>Pakistan was also appointed head of the UNSC committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011), which oversees the implementation of the sanctions measures on the Afghan Taliban.</p>
<p>In a press release, the Pakistan Mission to the UN called the appointments a “significant diplomatic development”.</p>

<p>It added that Pakistan was also appointed as the co-chair of the UNSC’s Informal Working Group (IWG) on documentation (working methods) and the newly established IWG on Sanctions.</p>
<p>The IWG on documentation focuses on improving the UNSC’s working methods, transparency, efficiency and inclusiveness.</p>
<p>The IWG on Sanctions issues aims to review and enhance the design, implementation, and effectiveness of UN sanctions regimes.</p>
<p>“These appointments represent an acknowledgement of Pakistan’s active engagement with the United Nations system, including its constructive role as an elected member of the Security Council,” the press release said, adding, “They are also an international recognition of Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts”.</p>
<p>Pakistan, it said, remained committed to working with the UN and fellow member states in advancing the principles and purposes of the UN Charter as well as playing its part in the global fight against terrorism in collaboration with its international partners.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1882311">began</a> a two-year term as a non-permanent UNSC member on the first day of the new year.</p>
<p>This marks Pakistan’s eighth term on the council, providing an opportunity to shape discussions on pivotal international issues, but also posing significant challenges.</p>

<p>While only permanent members hold veto power in the council, non-permanent members wield significant influence in terrorism-related sanctions committees, as decisions are made by consensus under established norms.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s term coincides with heightened tensions in conflict zones such as Gaza, held Kashmir and Syria.</p></p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has invited the opposition leader for consultations on appointing the next chief election commissioner (CEC), months after the incumbent’s term expired in January, it emerged on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The constitutional deadline for the appointment of a new chief election commis­sioner and two members of the Election Com­mission of Pakistan (ECP)  <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897583">exp­ired</a> on March 12, with no action from the government.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866480">26th Amendment</a> allowed the CEC and the members to continue till their successors come in. As per Article 215(4) of the Constitution, the appointment of the CEC and members must be completed within 45 days.</p>
<p>In a letter dated May 16 and addressed to Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub — seen by <em>Dawn.com</em> — the prime minister noted that the term of the incumbent CEC, Sikandar Sultan Raja, expired on January 27 this year, adding that he was holding office in accordance with the second proviso to clause 1 of Article 215 of the Constitution (term of office of the Commissioner [and members]).</p>
<p>“In term of clause (2A) of Article 213 and sub-clause (b) of clause (2) of Article 218 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, three names each for the appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and two Members (i.e. for Sindh and Balochistan) are to be forwarded to the Parliamentary Committee for hearing and confirmation of any one person against each position,” the letter read.</p>
<p>“In view of the aforesaid, you are invited for a meeting for consultation, in terms of clause (2A) of Article 213 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, in order to finalize three names each for appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and Members from Sindh and Balochistan.”</p>
<p>No exact date for a meeting was given, nor were any names released about prospective CECs.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#disqualification-reference" id="disqualification-reference" title="Permalink"></a>Disqualification reference</h2>
<p>Separately, a hearing on the disqualification reference against Ayub was adjourned until July 1 as he was obligated to attend the upcoming federal budget session in parliament.</p>
<p>Last week, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Sadiq <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914430">forwarded</a> a reference seeking Ayub’s disqualification to the ECP.</p>
<p>The reference is based on an application filed by former MNA Babar Nawaz, who lost to Ayub in the 2024 general election in NA-18 (Haripur) by a margin of 82,000 votes.</p>
<p>A five-member committee chaired by the CEC presided over the hearing, with Ayub stating that he had yet to appoint counsel.</p>
<p>“The budget session will start soon and I am a member of the Finance Committee. The budget meeting will be held for two weeks,” he said, requesting time to attend the budget session and appoint a leader.</p>
<p>Sindh Election Commission member Nisar Durrani said that there is a 90-day time limit to act on the speaker’s reference. The commission granted Ayub’s request and adjourned the hearing until June 24.</p>
<p>In a separate case in which the opposition leader was accused of rigging by Babar Nawaz, the opposition leader’s lawyer sought time to submit a reply and arguments. The commission adjourned the hearing until July 1.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Speaking to reporters following the hearing, Ayub assailed the National Assembly for sending the reference “without using their brains”.</p>
<p>“The speaker did not consult me about this reference,” he said. “In the 2018 elections, I beat my opponent by 40,000 votes. He previously approached the Abbottabad High Court, but the case was dismissed.”</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915424/trump-talks-with-putin-on-ukraine-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Trump talks with Putin on Ukraine, Iran</strong></a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump said he spoke to Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Wednesday about Ukraine and Iran, warning that the Kremlin leader had “very strongly” pledged to respond to Kyiv’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914858">stunning drone attack</a> on Russian bombers.</p>
<p>Trump said that there was no “immediate peace” on the horizon in Ukraine — which Russia <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676939">invaded</a> in 2022 — following what he described as a one-hour and 15-minute call with the Russian president.</p>
<p>On Iran, Trump said that Putin had offered to “participate” in talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme, as Trump accused the Islamic republic of “slow walking” its response to Washington’s offer of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914989">deal</a>.</p>
<p>The call came three days after Ukraine conducted a massive, daring drone attack against Russian military airbases, saying it had destroyed several Russian nuclear-capable bombers worth billions of dollars.</p>

<p>Trump said that he and Putin had “discussed the attack on Russia’s docked airplanes, by Ukraine and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides”.</p>
<p>“It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate peace. President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields,” Trump said in his post.</p>
<p>Trump did not say whether he had warned Putin off any such retaliation against Ukraine, which Washington has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1882042">supported</a> to the tune of billions of dollars in its fight against Russia.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#definitive-answer" id="definitive-answer" title="Permalink"></a>‘Definitive answer’</h2>
<p>The Republican has repeatedly alarmed Kyiv and Western allies by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892985/trump-brands-zelensky-a-dictator">appearing</a> to side with Putin over the war, and had a blazing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894932/trump-zelensky-row-in-oval-office-after-dispute-on-compromise-with-russia">Oval Office row</a> with visiting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
<p>But Trump has also shown growing frustration with Putin as Russia has so far derailed the US president’s efforts to honour a campaign pledge to end the war within 24 hours, even if he never explained how this could be achieved.</p>
<p>The call between Trump and Putin did, however, show that Washington and Moscow may be eying cooperation on another key global issue — Iran.</p>
<p>Trump said he believed they were both “in agreement” that Iran could not have a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904314">nuclear weapon</a>, and that time was running out for Tehran to respond to US offers of a deal.</p>
<p>“President Putin suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion,” Trump said.</p>
<p>The US president added: “It is my opinion that Iran has been slow walking their decision on this very important matter, and we will need a definitive answer in a very short period of time!”</p>
<p>Putin told his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian that Moscow was ready to help advance talks on a nuclear deal, the Kremlin said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said earlier today that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915388/irans-khamenei-dismisses-us-nuclear-proposal-vows-to-keep-enriching-uranium">Washington’s proposal</a> was against Tehran’s national interest, amid sharp differences over whether Tehran can continue to enrich uranium.</p></p>
