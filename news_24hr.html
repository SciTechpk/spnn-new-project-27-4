            <p><p>Five terrorists were killed and three officers were injured in an exchange of fire during an operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Hangu district, police said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906333/3-traffic-cops-injured-in-terrorist-attack-in-kps-lakki-marwat-district-police">witnessed</a> an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>According to a statement by KP Inspector General of Police (IGP) Zulfiqar Hameed, security forces and police carried out a joint operation in Hangu’s Zargari Shinawari area.</p>
<p>“During the operation, there was a heavy exchange of fire between the terrorists and the law enforcement personnel,” the statement read.</p>
<p>“Security forces fought bravely and killed five terrorists. However, Hangu District Police Officer (DPO) Khalid Khan, the Doaba station house officer (SHO), and an officer of the security forces were injured in the exchange of fire,” it added.</p>
<p>The statement said that DPO Khalid “was hit by three bullets”, while his condition was said to be stable.</p>
<p>Police were making arrangements for a helicopter to airlift DPO Khalid from the Hangu hospital to Peshawar for further treatment, Imran Khan, personal secretary to IG Hameed, told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>IG Hameed spoke to the injured officers and enquired about their well-being, according to the police statement.</p>
<p>“Law enforcement agencies are determined to continue their fight against terrorism,” the statement added.</p>
<p>Pakistan ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents.</p>

<p>On June 21, KP police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918714">killed</a> a terrorist and injured two others belonging to the TTP group in Dera Ismail Khan as they attempted to attack the police.</p>
<p>In May, two policemen were martyred and two were injured in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911459">suicide attack</a> in Peshawar, while in a separate incident, two cops lost their lives as a result of an attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu.</p>
<p>Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773">three</a> “wanted terrorists” were killed during a joint operation between the regional police and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) in Bannu district.</p>
<p>On July 5, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP’s Tipu Gul group were killed in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922269">joint operation</a> by the CTD.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925210/aurangzeb-eyes-game-changer-investment-discussions-with-us' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb eyes ‘game-changer’ investment discussions with US</strong></a>
            <p><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has said the government aims to follow the ongoing trade talks with the United States by discussing investment, terming it a potential “game-changer” for economic ties between the two countries.</p>
<p>He made the remarks after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925024">meeting</a> with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer on Friday as part of a critical round of trade talks aimed at securing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901838">tariff relief</a> and expanding bilateral economic cooperation.</p>
<p>“One thing we discussed was that we have to move beyond the immediate trade imperative, which is obviously very critical, but besides that, for the Pakistan-US relationship to be brought to the next level and bring in a real step change, [there is] an investment imperative that will hopefully emerge,” Aurangzeb said in a video statement.</p>
<p>“Areas [for investment] have already been identified,” the minister said, mentioning <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902898">minerals and mining</a>, artificial intelligence, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912373">digital infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915365">cryptocurrency</a>.</p>
<p>“We feel this will be a real game-changer, God-willing, in terms of the economic relationship between Pakistan and the United States.”</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Aurangzeb added that both sides committed to begin their talks with trade and follow them through “very quickly with investment discussions between the two countries and real execution of the investment upside that is available, so that it becomes a win-win” for Pakistan and the US.</p>
<p>The minister termed his dialogue with Lutnick and Greer “very constructive”. Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh and Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul, who were present during the meeting, accompanied Aurangzeb in the video statement.</p>
<p>“Positive progress over the last few weeks and months was reviewed. Equally importantly, we focused on the slightly outstanding aspects,” the finance czar said, adding there was a clear commitment from both sides to “get closure” on those items.</p>
<p>The minister highlighted that as the US was Pakistan’s largest trading partner, it was quite critical to move forward in the “same spirit” in which the recent discussions had taken place.</p>
<p>“In the next few days, we hope that the coming leadership-level announcements will reflect all the hard work and efforts that have been put in both by Pakistan and the US side,” Aurangzeb said.</p>
<p>Pakistan aims to finalise a long-term reciprocal tariff agreement that would prevent the re-imposition of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901838">29 per cent tariff</a> on Pakistani exports — primarily textiles and agricultural products. While Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922611/trump-dispatches-letters-outlining-new-tariffs-on-foreign-nations">announced</a> tariffs for some countries, talks with others are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923479">ongoing</a> ahead of his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922652/trump-announces-up-to-40pc-tariffs-on-several-nations#:~:text=%E2%80%94%20postponing%20their%20imposition%20to%20August%201.">extended</a> August 1 deadline.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922229/pakistan-us-reach-accord-on-trade-and-tariffs">reached</a> an initial understanding on a deal that could shape the future of the country’s key export sectors. A formal announcement on any deal is expected only after the US concludes similar ongoing negotiations with other trade partners.</p>
<p>A source close to the US administration has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925087#:~:text=The%20president%20wants%20concrete%20deliverables%20before%20the%20August%2015%20deadline">mentioned</a> a further deadline: “The president wants concrete deliverables before the August 15 deadline. Countries that stall may find themselves on the wrong end of a tariff wall.”</p>
<p>A senior Pakistani official involved in the negotiations said: “We’re not here for aid. We’re here for serious negotiations and a possible deal. It’s about mutual benefit now — trade, not dependence.”</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, influential US-based businessmen with stakes in cryptocurrency and rare earth mineral ventures have quietly supported Pakistan’s efforts to gain greater access to American markets.</p>
<p>In April, the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906732">partnered with</a> World Liberty Financial (WLF), a decentralised finance platform backed by US President Donald Trump. Earlier that month, a US delegation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903248">expressed</a> Washington’s strategic interest in the country’s mineral sector.</p></p>

            <p><p>Syria’s interim government said its security forces were deploying in the predominantly-Druze southern city of Sweida on Saturday and urged all parties to respect a ceasefire, after days of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924259/89-killed-as-bedouin-druze-clash-in-syria">factional bloodshed</a> that has left hundreds dead.</p>
<p>Interim President <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1888623">Ahmed al-Sharaa</a>, in a separate speech, said that “Arab and American” mediation had helped bring calm, and criticised Israel for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924588">airstrikes</a> against Syrian government forces in the south and Damascus during the week.</p>
<p>Sweida province has been engulfed by nearly a week of violence, which began with clashes between Bedouin fighters and Druze factions, before Damascus sent in government security forces.</p>
<p>Israel has carried out airstrikes in southern Syria and on the defence ministry in Damascus, saying it is protecting the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924613">Druze</a> minority, of whom there are a significant number in Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.</p>
<p>In a statement on Saturday, the Syrian presidency announced an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire and urged all parties to end hostilities immediately.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The interior ministry said internal security forces had begun deploying in Sweida.</p>
<p>The death toll from violence in Sweida province, heartland of Syria’s Druze minority, has risen to 940 since last weekend, a war monitor said, despite the announcement of a ceasefire.</p>
<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that the dead included 326 Druze fighters and 262 Druze civilians, 182 of whom were “summarily executed by defence and interior ministry personnel”.</p>
<p>They also included 312 government security personnel and 21 Sunni Bedouin, three of them civilians who were “summarily executed by Druze fighters”.</p>
<p>Another 15 government troops were killed in Israeli strikes, the observatory said.</p>
<p>Sharaa called for calm and said Syria would not be a “testing ground for partition, secession, or sectarian incitement”.</p>
<p>“The Israeli intervention pushed the country into a dangerous phase that threatened its stability,” he said in a televised speech.</p>
<p>US envoy Tom Barrack announced on Friday that Syria and Israel had agreed to a ceasefire supported by Turkiye, Jordan and neighbours.</p>
<p>Barrack, who is both US ambassador to Turkiye and Washington’s Syria envoy, urged Druze, Bedouins and Sunnis to put down their weapons “and, together with other minorities, build a new and united Syrian identity”.</p>
<p>Israel has attacked Syrian military facilities and weaponry in the seven months since Sharaa’s forces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1877481">toppled</a> President Bashar al-Assad, and says it wants areas of southern Syria near its border to remain demilitarised.</p>
<p>On Friday, an Israeli official said Israel had agreed to allow Syrian forces limited access to the Sweida area for the next two days.</p>

The contraceptives are primarily long-acting, such as IUDs and birth control<strong> </strong>implants, and were almost certainly intended for women in Africa, according to two senior congressional aides, one of whom visited a warehouse in Belgium that housed the contraceptives. It is not clear to the aides whether the destruction has already been carried out, but said they had been told that it was set to occur by the end of July.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/18/trump-administration-destroy-contraceptives-usaid-africa">Continue reading...</a></p>
