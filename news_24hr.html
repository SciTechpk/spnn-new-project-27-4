            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928471/pakistan-iran-set-8bn-annual-trade-target-to-boost-bilateral-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Iran set $8bn annual trade target to boost bilateral cooperation</strong></a>
            <p><p>Pakistan and Iran on Sunday agreed to elevate bilateral trade and achieve an annual trade volume of $8 billion, terming the move “a new phase of strategic economic partnership,” a statement from the commerce ministry said.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Iran share close ties and have signed multiple <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1829340">agreements</a> across sectors such as energy and trade.</p>
<p>The decision was made during a meeting between Commerce Minister Jam Kamal and the Iranian Minister for Industry, Mines and Trade, Mohammad Atabak, on the sidelines of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian’s two-day official <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928047">visit</a> to Pakistan.</p>
<p>According to the ministry’s statement, the high-level discussion marked a renewed commitment from both sides to accelerate trade, remove border bottlenecks, and build trust-based partnerships across priority sectors.</p>
<p>“[During the meeting], Kamal envisioned that, if fully leveraged, bilateral trade between Pakistan and Iran could easily exceed $5–8 billion annually in the coming years,” the ministry said.</p>
<p>Minister Kamal suggested organising targeted trade delegations that include representatives from federal and provincial chambers of commerce, enabling focused discussions on market access and regulatory facilitation, according to the statement.</p>
<p>“We’ve done this model successfully in Belarus and elsewhere,” he was quoted in the statement as saying. “Let’s do the same for Iran, starting with sectors that show the greatest potential for mutual benefit.”</p>
<p>The ministers also expressed a shared commitment to increasing the use of existing trade corridors and border facilities. Emphasis was placed on maximising the potential of neighbourhood trade, with Kamal highlighting how ASEAN countries have benefited enormously by trading within their region.</p>
<p>“Geography is an advantage. Pakistan and Iran must utilise this discount of distance. If we don’t, we lose both time and cost benefits,” he stated.</p>
<p>Atabak also highlighted ongoing discussions about increasing Pakistani exports to Iran and encouraged swift follow-up on newly signed agreements.</p>
<p>“Traders and industrialists in both countries are ready. They trust each other. What they need now is a clear and consistent facilitation mechanism from our side,” he noted.</p>
<p>Kamal said that beyond bilateral gains, such connectivity could expand to Turkey, Central Asia, Russia, and even parts of the Middle East, creating an economic bloc of substantial power and resilience.</p>
<p>Atabak supported the idea of holding a dedicated B2B day during every high-level visit and offered to bring Iranian business groups to Pakistan for in-depth meetings, the statement said.</p>
<p>The two ministers acknowledged the historic depth of Pakistan-Iran relations, expressing that recent regional and global developments have pushed both nations closer together.</p>
<p>“Without the rapid engagement and determination from you and your team, we wouldn’t have reached this stage. The momentum we’ve built must now be translated into structured trade outcomes,” Minister Atabak said while praising the Pakistani government’s proactive role in facilitating bilateral trade progress.</p>
<p>Kamal echoed similar sentiments, noting that both governments, as well as the private sector, had shown strong will and passion to work together.</p>
<p>“There’s a moment in diplomacy when the iron is hot—and this is that moment. We must act swiftly. Delays only complicate things,” he said.</p>
<p>He emphasised that formalities follow passion and political will, and highlighted that Pakistan is ready to deepen its economic relationship with Iran through structured channels like the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1829503">Joint Economic Commission (JEC)</a>, regular B2B exchanges, and sector-focused delegations.</p>
<p>Both ministers agreed on the importance of identifying specific sectors such as agriculture, livestock, services, energy, and cross-border logistics for future collaboration.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the human element of bilateral ties, both sides underscored the cultural and linguistic commonalities between the people of Pakistan and Iran.</p>
<p>The ministers agreed to fast-track the next session of the JEC, ensure participation from both public and private stakeholders, and prioritise border facilitation and trade logistics.</p>
<p>“With high-level political alignment and mutual trust, Pakistan and Iran appear poised to enter a new phase of strategic economic partnership that could reshape regional trade dynamics,” the statement said.</p>

<p>Separately,  Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called on President Pezeshkian on Sunday and conveyed Pakistan’s commitment to maintaining “brotherly ties” with Iran, according to a statement from the Foreign Office.</p>
<p>“Welcoming the Iranian president, the deputy prime minister/foreign minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s deep commitment to its historic and brotherly ties with Iran, emphasising their strong foundations in shared history, common cultural heritage, faith, and mutual respect,” the statement said.</p>
<p>President Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan’s support and reaffirmed Iran’s resolve to improve bilateral collaboration in various areas of shared interest. He also looked forward to meaningful discussions with Pakistani leaders to further reinforce the political and economic ties between the two friendly nations, the FO said.</p>

            <p><p>Funeral prayers were held Sunday morning for a police constable martyred in a terrorist attack on a checkpoint in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district, where an exchange of fire also left three terrorists dead and three policemen injured.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a>, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773/3-terrorists-killed-during-joint-operation-in-kps-bannu-police">July</a>.</p>
<p>Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan said in a statement that three terrorists were killed and police constable Rooh Niaz Khan was martyred when 40 to 50 terrorists attacked the police check post in Fateh Khel, Bannu.</p>
<p>Three terrorists were killed and as many policemen were injured in the exchange of fire, which lasted more than an hour, the statement added.</p>
<p>Soon after receiving information about the attack on the post, RPO Khan and District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi, along with the force, left for the site of the incident, Aamir Khan, spokesperson for the Bannu region police, told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>“The terrorists had blocked the roads leading to the post, but the police officials reopened the roads and fought with the terrorists,” RPO Khan said.
“Police personnel bravely fought the terrorists, who used heavy weapons.”</p>
<p>He noted that the search operation for the miscreants was still underway.</p>
<p>According to a statement by the Bannu Police Office, funeral prayers for the martyred constable were offered on Sunday morning at Bannu Police Lines. In attendance were his relatives, RPO Khan, DPO Kulachi, and other police officers.</p>
<p>While speaking on the occassion, DPO Kulachi said: “Martyred police officer Rooh Niaz Khan sacrificed his life while fighting against anti-national elements, proving that Bannu Police is steadfast on every front.”</p>
<p>“We will never forget his sacrifice,” he said, adding that the bravery, sense of duty and sacrifice of the deceased are a beacon of light for everyone else.</p>
<p>DPO Kulachi emphasised that Bannu Police were fully capable of confronting terrorists on every front.</p>
<p>On Thursday, at least six law enforcement personnel were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927953">injured</a> in a quadcopter attack on Miryan police station in Bannu amid an ongoing operation against terrorists in the Nurar area, where KP police had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927161/terrorist-attack-foiled-by-police-in-kps-bannu">foiled</a> a terrorist attack bid earlier in the week.</p>
<p>However, a police official identified as Constable Hayatullah was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925895">martyred</a> last month when terrorists attacked him in Bannu.</p>
<p>Earlier in July, three terrorists were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924957">killed</a> in an intelligence-based operation in Bannu, while another died in an encounter with police in Malakand district.</p></p>

            <p><p>Jason Holder smashed a four on the final ball to give West Indies a dramatic two-wicket victory over Pakistan on Saturday, lifting the hosts level in their T20 international series.</p>
<p>On the same night he took four wickets to reach a West Indies T20I record 81 for his career — breaking Dwayne Bravo’s old mark of 78 — Holder went 16 not out and West Indies ended a horrid losing streak with zero balls to spare.</p>
<p>Pakistan, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928069">won Thursday’s opener</a> by 14 runs, will try to bounce back in Sunday’s series-deciding T20 match under the lights at Lauderhill, Florida.</p>

<p>West Indies, set 134 to win, was on the brink of a seventh consecutive T20 defeat after having been swept 5-0 last month by visiting Australia.</p>
<p>Gudakesh Motie led West Indies with 28 runs but went down on the first ball of the 17th over, run out by Mohammed Haris with the hosts on 96 for six.</p>
<p>Haris caught Keacy Carty for a duck three balls later but Holder swatted a six to end the 18th over, West Indies still needing 24 to win.</p>
<p>Romario Shepherd smashed a six and a four off Hasan Ali in the 19th over to leave West Indies on 126 for seven entering the final over.</p>
<p>Shaheen Shah Afridi allowed Holder a run but then took Shepherd’s wicket lbw for 15. He allowed newcomer Shamar Joseph a run that pulled West Indies within six runs with three balls remaining.</p>
<p>Holder and Joseph each struck for singles and Afridi went wide to Holder, leaving West Indies three runs shy for the final delivery, setting the stage for Holder’s heroics.</p>
<p>Pakistan won the toss and batted first, going 133 for nine.</p>
<p>Hasan Nawaz led Pakistan on 40 with four sixes and a four while captain Salman Agha added 38 on one six and three fours.</p></p>
