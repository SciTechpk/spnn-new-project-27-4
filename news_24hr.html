            <p><p>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on Monday it has appointed Leah Gutierrez as the director general for its Central and West Asia Department, which oversees engagement with Pakistan and 10 other countries.</p>
<p>The ADB is a key <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915179">lender</a> for Pakistan, with vital financing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917938">programmes</a> underway, along with assisting in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918863">digital overhaul</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913568">climate policy</a> plans.</p>
<p>As director general, Gutierrez will deliver ADB’s strategic agenda in the Central and West Asia region, which includes Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkiye, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>Her appointment takes effect today, read a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.adb.org/news/leah-gutierrez-appointed-director-general-adb-central-and-west-asia-department" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by ADB.</p>
<p>“I am honoured to serve in this position and will continue to engage with developing member countries and stakeholders to promote inclusive growth, regional cooperation, and sustainable development across the region,” Gutierrez was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>Gutierrez has over four decades of professional experience, including 25 years at ADB, the statement noted.</p>
<p>“Prior to her appointment, Gutierrez was the director general for ADB’s Sectors Department 3, where she managed operations for finance, human and social development, and public sector management and governance.</p>
<p>“She is also a former director general of the Pacific Department. She has held senior positions in ADB’s Strategy, Policy, and Partnerships Department; Southeast Asia Department; and Office of the Secretary,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Last October, the ADB <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1865165">appointed</a> Xiaoqin Fan as the new country director.</p>
<p>In June, Pakistan signed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917938">$1 billion financing</a> for a five-year multi-tranche facility with the ADB. The same month, the bank approved an $800 million programme to strengthen fiscal sustainability and improve public financial management in Pakistan.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927118/ttp-terrorists-who-masterminded-attack-on-chinese-engineers-last-year-killed-in-karachi-operation-ctd' target='_blank'><strong>TTP terrorists who masterminded attack on Chinese engineers last year killed in Karachi operation: CTD</strong></a>
            <p><p>Three terrorists, including the mastermind behind the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870248">November 2024 attack</a> on Chinese engineers, were killed during a counterterrorism operation in Karachi’s Manghopir area, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>On November 5 last year, two Chinese nationals were shot at and wounded by a private security guard in a textile mill in Karachi’s SITE area. At that time, investigators had suspected that it was a targeted attack.</p>
<p>Following the incident, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870248#:~:text=In%20a%20statement%20issued,and%20institutions%20in%20Pakistan.">statement</a> that the attack was being probed, adding that Pakistan was committed to the safety and security of Chinese nationals, projects, and institutions in the country. A first information report (FIR) was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870532">registered</a> two days later against the security guard who had fled after the incident.</p>
<p>“A terrorist who masterminded an attack on Chinese engineers in November last year has been killed during an operation in Karachi’s Manghopir area,” Additional Inspector-General of Police, Counter-Terrorism Department Azad Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>Khan said the slain terrorist was identified as Zafran, while two of his accomplices were also killed in the operation.</p>
<p>Senior CTD official Raja Umer Khattab said that the operation was jointly carried out by the CTD and personnel of intelligence agencies. “The teams raided a house in the Manghopir area and killed the terrorists during an operation,” he said. “They belonged to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).”</p>
<p>At the time of the incident, Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG-South) Syed Asad Raza told journalists that the incident had occurred as a result of a verbal altercation between the engineers and the guard, but a further probe was underway to ascertain the exact reason.</p>
<p>He had said that a supervisor and three guards of the private security company had been detained for questioning, while efforts were underway to arrest the guard involved in the shooting.  The DIG had added that the suspect’s residence had been traced, and investigators were collecting information about him from his neighbours.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">surge</a> in terrorist activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. However, Chinese nationals have also been targeted inside Pakistan over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1877910/20-chinese-citizens-killed-34-injured-in-14-terrorist-attacks-since-2021-nacta">report</a> by the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta) published in 2024, 20 Chinese citizens have been killed and 34 injured in terrorist attacks in the country since 2021.</p>
<p>In October 2024, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1863586/pm-shehbaz-assures-chinese-envoy-of-personally-overseeing-karachi-terror-attack-investigation">suicide attack near Karachi airport</a>, claimed by the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), left two Chinese citizens dead and injured ten others.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1824034/china-seeks-answers-after-engineers-killed-in-bisham">March 2024</a>, Chinese workers were targeted in KP’s Besham, reportedly carried out by affiliates of either the TTP or Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), resulting in five Chinese fatalities.</p>
<p>At least four people, including three Chinese nationals, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1686920">killed</a> while four others were injured in a suicide attack outside the University of Karachi’s (KU) Confucius Institute in 2022.</p>
<p>The escalation in violence against Chinese nationals had amplified Beijing’s security concerns, especially over progress on China-Pakistan Econo­mic Corridor (CPEC) projects.  Speaking at the event in late October last year, the Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong had expressed frustration over the attacks, stating it was “unacceptable” and urging Islamabad to strengthen security measures for Chinese nationals and crack down on anti-China elements.</p>
<p>Former Foreign Office spokes­person Mumtaz Zahra Baloch had called the statement “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1869028">perplexing</a>” and a stark departure from the longstanding diplomatic norms between the two nations.</p></p>

            <p><p>• Unruly mob sets fire to excavator, tries to force open gates of garrison; several hurt as security men fire to disperse crowd<br />
• Security officials and KP govt announce compensation for victims<br />
• 2 Chitral Scouts martyred in clash near Afghan border</p>
<p>KHYBER: A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926949/protesters-fired-upon-in-kps-tirah-valley-says-govt-official">protest</a> over the killing of a minor girl in Tirah took a turn for the worse on Sunday, as seven people were shot after a demonstration outside a military installation took a violent turn, eye-witnesses and sources told <em>Dawn.</em></p>
<p>Following the incident, security officials met with tribal elders and announced compensation for the victims, assuring that medical treatment would be provided to the injured. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has announced separate compensation for the deceased and injured.</p>
<p>Hundreds of tribesmen had brought the body of a girl, who they claimed was killed in a mortar strike in the Darbar locality of Peer Mela in Zakhakhel a day earlier, to the Brigade Headquarters in Bagh-Maidan Markaz early on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Sources and eye-witnesses said the situation turned violent when an angry mob, comprising mostly young men,  ignored calls by local elders to remain calm.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>They first torched an excavator parked outside Brigade Headquarters, and then tried to force open the garrison’s main gate.</p>
<p>Security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly opened fire to control the crowd, according to sources.</p>
<p>At least six protesters were killed and seventeen others received bullet injuries, sources said.</p>
<p>There was no official statement from the local administration or the military about the mortar strike, or Sunday’s killings.</p>
<p>Videos circulating on social media showed an excavator on fire. Some protesters were also seen pelting stones at the Brigade Headquarters while trying to forcibly open the main gate. In the footage, protesters could be seen running for cover as gunshots rang out.</p>
<p>The injured were shifted to the Frontier Corps Hospital in Shah Kas Jamrud,  Dogra hospital in Bara and Hayatabad Medical Complex in Peshawar.</p>
<p>One of the injured is said to be in critical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Security officials meet tribal elders</strong></p>
<p>As the situation became tense, a delegation of Tirah elders held a series of meetings with security officials at Brigade Headquarters.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the protesters dispersed following the intervention of elders.</p>
<p>Security officials said the local sector commander met with elders in Tirah and assured them of his full support in meeting their legitimate demands.</p>
<p>Officials also expressed their sympathies with the relatives of those who had lost their lives on Sunday, sources told <em>Dawn.</em></p>
<p>On the elders’ demand, security forces announced compensation for the families of the deceased and the injured.</p>
<p>A statement issued from the KP chief minister’s secretariat said the provincial government was grieved over the loss of lives in Tirah.</p>
<p>The provincial government will give Rs10 million to the deceased and Rs2.5m to the injured.</p>
<p>The statement added the provincial government was committed to sustainable peace, mutual respect and public safety. The KP government had called a jirga comprising tribal elders and public representatives to address their issues.</p>
<p>“The district administration and institutions have been directed to strengthen communication with the public and maintain law and order situation,” the statement quoted the chief minister as saying.</p>
<p><strong>Protest</strong></p>
<p>Later, MNA Iqbal Afridi from NA-27 Khyber and MPA Abdul Ghani, along with their supporters, held a protest at Bab-i-Khyber in Jamrud against Sunday’s incident.</p>
<p>They demanded a transparent judicial enquiry into the incident along with adequate compensation for the victims.</p>
<p>The lawmakers opposed the military operation in Tirah valley and demanded peace without displacing the locals.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, residents in Peer Mela have claimed mortar shelling by security forces has so far killed at least three persons during the last ten days.</p>
<p>They claimed mortars were being fired as security forces conducted operations against armed militant groups in Zakhakhel, Shalobar, Adakhel and Malakdin Khel localities.</p>
<p><strong>Security officials martyred</strong></p>
<p>Separately, two security personnel embraced martyrdom in an exchange of fire with militants in the Arsoon village of Chitral, which borders Afghanistan, on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Official sources told <em>Dawn</em> that forces retaliated against the indiscriminate and unprovoked firing by militants.</p>
<p>Five personnel were also injured in the exchange.</p>
<p>According to the official sources, security forces inflicted heavy casualties on militants and forced them to pull back from their village.</p>
<p><em>Umer Farooq in Peshawar and Zahiruddin in Chitral also contributed to this report</em></p>
