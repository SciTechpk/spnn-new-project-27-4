            <p><p>Brics leaders at a summit on Sunday took aim at US President Donald Trump’s “indiscriminate” import tariffs and recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921439/the-israel-iran-ceasefire-appears-to-be-holding-whats-next-for-the-middle-east">Israeli-US strikes</a> on Iran.</p>
<p>The 11 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910457">emerging nations</a> — including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — account for about half the world’s population and 40 per cent of global economic output.</p>

<p>The bloc is divided about much, but found common cause when it comes to the mercurial US leader and his stop-start <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922286/trump-says-probably-12-tariff-letters-being-sent-out-on-monday">tariff wars</a> — even if it avoided naming him directly.</p>
<p>Voicing “serious concerns about the rise of unilateral tariff” measures, Brics members said the tariffs risked hurting the global economy, according to a summit joint statement.</p>
<p>Trump fired back at the bloc directly on social media on Sunday night.</p>
<p>“Any country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of Brics will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10 per cent Tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy,” Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114809574296066307" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on his Truth Social platform.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch    media--uneven  media--stretch">

    </figure></p>
<p>Earlier, Brics also offered symbolic backing to fellow member Iran, condemning a series of military strikes on nuclear and other targets carried out by Israel and the United States.</p>
<p>In April, Trump threatened allies and rivals alike with a slew of punitive duties, before offering a months-long reprieve in the face of a fierce market sell-off.</p>
<p>Trump has warned he will impose unilateral levies on partners unless they reach “deals” by August 1.</p>
<p>In an apparent concession to US allies such as Brazil, India and Saudi Arabia, the summit declaration did not criticize the United States or its president by name at any point.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#no-show" id="no-show" title="Permalink"></a>No show</h2>
<p>Conceived two decades ago as a forum for fast-growing economies, the BRICS have come to be seen as a Chinese-driven counterbalance to US and western European power.</p>
<p>But as the group has expanded to include Iran, Saudi Arabia and others, it has struggled to reach meaningful consensus on issues from the Gaza onslaught to challenging US global dominance.</p>
<p>Brics nations, for example, collectively called for a peaceful two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict — despite Tehran’s long-standing position that Israel should be destroyed.</p>
<p>An Iranian diplomatic source said his government’s “reservations” had been conveyed to Brazilian hosts. Still, Iran stopped short of rejecting the statement outright.</p>
<p>In perhaps a further sign of the diplomatic sensitivities, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister skipped Sunday’s discussions entirely, according to a Brazilian government source.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is among the world’s leading beneficiaries of high-tech US military exports and is a long-standing US partner.</p>
<p>The political punch of this year’s summit has been depleted by the absence of China’s Xi Jinping, who skipped the meeting for the first time in his 12 years as president.</p>
<p>The Chinese leader is not the only notable absentee. Russian President Vladimir Putin, charged with war crimes in Ukraine, also opted to stay away, participating via video link.</p>
<p>He told counterparts that Brics had become a key player in global governance.</p>
<p>The summit also called for regulation governing artificial intelligence and said the technology could not be the preserve of only rich nations.</p>
<p>The commercial AI sector is currently dominated by US tech giants, although China and other nations have rapidly developing capacity.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922525/death-toll-from-texas-floods-reaches-78' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll from Texas floods reaches 78</strong></a>
            <p><p>The death toll from <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922320/27-people-confirmed-dead-as-flood-waters-recede-in-us-state-of-texas">catastrophic floods</a> in Texas reached at least 78 on Sunday, including 28 children, as the search for girls missing from a summer camp continued, and fears of more flooding prompted evacuations of volunteer responders.</p>
<p>Larry Leitha, sheriff of Kerr County in Texas Hill Country, said 68 people had died in flooding in his county, the epicentre of the flooding, among them 28 children.</p>
<p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott, speaking at a press conference on Sunday afternoon, said another 10 had died elsewhere in Texas and confirmed 41 were missing.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump sent his condolences to the victims and said he would probably visit the area on Friday. His administration had been in touch with Abbott, he added.</p>
<p>“It’s a horrible thing that took place, absolutely horrible. So we say, God bless all of the people that have gone through so much, and God bless, God bless the state of Texas,” he told reporters as he left New Jersey.</p>
<p>Among the most devastating impacts of the flooding occurred at Camp Mystic summer camp, a nearly century-old Christian girls camp where 10 Camp Mystic campers and one counsellor were still missing, according to Leitha.</p>
<p>“It was nothing short of horrific to see what those young children went through,” said Abbott, who noted he toured the area on Saturday and pledged to continue efforts to locate the missing.</p>
<p>The flooding occurred after the nearby Guadalupe River broke its banks after torrential rain fell in the central Texas area on Friday, the US Independence Day holiday.</p>

<p>Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said the destruction killed three people in Burnet County, one in Tom Green County, five in Travis County and one in Williamson County.</p>
<p>“You will see the death toll rise today and tomorrow,” said Freeman Martin, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, also speaking on Sunday.</p>
<p>Officials said on Saturday that more than 850 people had been rescued, including some clinging to trees, after a sudden storm dumped up to 15 inches (38 cm) of rain across the region, about 140 kilometres northwest of San Antonio.</p>
<p>Kidd said he was receiving unconfirmed reports of “an additional wall of water” flowing down some of the creeks in the Guadalupe Rivershed, as rain continued to fall on soil in the region already saturated from Friday’s rains.</p>
<p>“We’re evacuating parts of the river right now because we are worried about another wall of river coming down in those areas,” he said, referencing volunteers from outside the area seeking to help locate victims.</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency was activated on Sunday and is deploying resources to first responders in Texas after Trump issued a major disaster declaration, the Department of Homeland Security said. US Coast Guard helicopters and planes were aiding search and rescue efforts.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#scaling-back-federal-disaster-response" id="scaling-back-federal-disaster-response" title="Permalink"></a>Scaling back federal disaster response</h2>
<p>Trump has previously outlined plans to scale back the federal government’s role in responding to natural disasters, leaving states to shoulder more of the burden themselves.</p>
<p>Some experts questioned whether cuts to the federal workforce by the Trump administration, including to the agency that oversees the National Weather Service, led to a failure by officials to accurately predict the severity of the floods and issue appropriate warnings ahead of the storm.</p>
<p>Trump’s administration has overseen thousands of job cuts from the National Weather Service’s parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, leaving many weather offices understaffed, former NOAA director Rick Spinrad said.</p>
<p>Spinrad said he did not know if those staff cuts factored into the lack of advance warning for the extreme Texas flooding, but that they would inevitably degrade the agency’s ability to deliver accurate and timely forecasts.</p>
<p>Trump pushed back when asked on Sunday if federal government cuts hobbled the disaster response or left key job vacancies at the National Weather Service under Trump’s oversight.</p>
<p>“That water situation, that all is, and that was really the Biden setup,” he said, referencing his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden. “But I wouldn’t blame Biden for it, either. I would just say this is 100-year catastrophe.”</p>
<p>He declined to answer a question about FEMA, saying only, “They’re busy working, so we’ll leave it at that,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees FEMA and NOAA, said a “moderate” flood watch issued on Thursday by the National Weather Service had not accurately predicted the extreme rainfall and said the Trump administration was working to upgrade the system.</p>
<p>Joaquin Castro, a Democratic US congressman from Texas, told <em>CNN’s</em> “State of the Union” program that fewer personnel at the weather service could be dangerous.</p>
<p>“When you have flash flooding, there’s a risk that if you don’t have the personnel … to do that analysis, do the predictions in the best way, it could lead to tragedy,” Castro said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#complete-devastation" id="complete-devastation" title="Permalink"></a>‘Complete devastation’</h2>
<p>Katharine Somerville, a counsellor on the Cypress Lake side of Camp Mystic, on higher ground than the Guadalupe River side, said her 13-year-old campers were scared as their cabins sustained damage and lost power in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>“Our cabins at the tippity top of hills were completely flooded with water. I mean, y’all have seen the complete devastation, we never even imagined that this could happen,” Somerville said in an interview on <em>Fox News</em> on Sunday.</p>
<p>Somerville said the campers in her care were put on military trucks and evacuated, and that all were safe.</p>
<p>The disaster unfolded rapidly on Friday morning as heavier-than-forecast rain drove river waters rapidly to as high as 29 feet (9 meters).</p>
<p>A day after the disaster struck, the summer camp, where 700 girls were in residence at the time of the flooding, was a scene of devastation. Inside one cabin, mud lines indicating how high the water had risen were at least six feet (1.83 m) from the floor. Bed frames, mattresses and personal belongings caked with mud were scattered inside. Some buildings had broken windows, and one had a missing wall.</p></p>

            <p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet on Monday with US President Donald Trump, who expressed hope for a “deal this week” between Israel and Hamas that sees hostages released from the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Indirect <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922220/hamas-ready-for-immediate-talks-on-ceasefire-proposal">negotiations</a> between Israel and Hamas began on Sunday evening in Doha, aiming to broker a ceasefire and reach an agreement on the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.</p>
<p>Trump said on Sunday that there was a “good chance” of reaching an agreement.</p>
<p>“We’ve gotten a lot of the hostages out, but pertaining to the remaining hostages, quite a few of them will be coming out,” he told journalists.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, speaking before boarding his flight to Washington on Sunday, said his meeting with Trump could “definitely help advance this” deal.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said he dispatched the team to Doha with “clear instructions” to reach an agreement “under the conditions that we have agreed to.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He previously said Hamas’ response to a draft US-backed ceasefire proposal, conveyed through Qatari and Egyptian mediators, contained “unacceptable” demands.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#important-mission" id="important-mission" title="Permalink"></a>‘Important mission’</h2>
<p>Two Palestinian sources close to the discussions told <em>AFP</em> the proposal included a 60-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921634/trump-urges-60-day-gaza-ceasefire-deal-ahead-of-netanyahu-visit">truce</a>, during which Hamas would release 10 living hostages and several bodies in exchange for Palestinians detained by Israel.</p>
<p>However, they said, the group was also demanding certain conditions for Israel’s withdrawal, guarantees against a resumption of fighting during negotiations, and the return of the UN-led aid distribution system.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has an “important mission” in Washington, “advancing a deal to bring all our hostages home,” said Israeli President Isaac Herzog after meeting him on Sunday.</p>
<p>Trump is not scheduled to meet the Israeli premier until 6:30pm (3:30am PKT) on Monday, the White House said, without the usual presence of journalists.</p>
<p>Of the 251 hostages taken by Hamas during the 2023 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1779807">attack</a>, 49 are still being held in Gaza, including 27, the Israeli military says, are dead.</p>
<p>Since Hamas’s October 2023 attack sparked the massive Israeli offensive in Gaza, mediators have brokered two temporary halts in the fighting. They have seen hostages freed in exchange for some of the thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Recent efforts to broker a new truce have repeatedly failed, with the primary point of contention being Israel’s rejection of Hamas’s demand for a lasting ceasefire.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#enough-blood" id="enough-blood" title="Permalink"></a>‘Enough blood’</h2>
<p>In Gaza, the territory’s civil defence agency reported 26 people killed by Israeli forces on Sunday, 10 of them in a strike in Gaza City’s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood.</p>
<p>“We are losing young people, families and children every day, and this must stop now,” Sheikh Radwan resident Osama al-Hanawi told <em>AFP.</em></p>
<p>“Enough blood has been shed.”</p>
<p>Contacted by <em>AFP</em>, the Israeli military said it could not comment on specific strikes without precise coordinates.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#hundreds-killed-seeking-aid" id="hundreds-killed-seeking-aid" title="Permalink"></a>Hundreds killed seeking aid</h2>
<p>The offensive has created dire humanitarian conditions for the more than two million people in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>A US- and Israel-backed group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), took the lead in food distribution in the territory in late May, when Israel partially lifted a more than two-month blockade on aid deliveries.</p>
<p>But its operations have had a chaotic rollout, with repeated reports of aid seekers <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919902/israel-kills-another-46-waiting-for-aid-in-gaza">killed</a> near its facilities while awaiting rations.</p>
<p>UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the GHF over concerns that it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The UN human rights office said last week that more than 500 people have been killed waiting to access food from GHF distribution points.</p>
<p>The Gaza health ministry on Sunday placed the toll even higher, at 751 killed. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed at least 57,418 people in Gaza.</p></p>
