                <h2>Trump says escalation ‚Äòa shame‚Äô, Guterres urges restraint</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump has said said the escalation between India and Pakistan was a ‚Äúshame‚Äù.</p>
<p>He was the first world leader to react to the tense situation after India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">carried out strikes</a> inside Pakistan which also retaliated and reportedly shot down Indian jets.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame. We just heard about it as we were walking in the doors of the Oval [Office],‚Äù he said inside the White House after overseeing the swearing-in ceremony for his special envoy, Steve Witkoff.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúI guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past. They‚Äôve been fighting for a long time,‚Äù the US president added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI hope it ends very quickly.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a statement, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called for restraint from both countries, Associated Press  reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Secretary-General is very concerned about the Indian military  operations across the Line of Control and international border. He calls  for maximum military restraint from both countries. The world cannot  afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan,‚Äù said  the statement.</p>
<p>The US State Department also said it is ‚Äúclosely monitoring developments,‚Äù <em>CNN</em> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are aware of the reports, however we have no assessment to offer at this time,‚Äù the spokesperson said. ‚ÄúThis remains an evolving situation,and we are closely monitoring developments.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>May 9 riots: SC CB rules civilians can be tried in military courts</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>With two judges dissenting, the Supreme Court‚Äôs Constitutional Bench (CB) on Wednesday gave its go-ahead for civilians involved in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279/special-report-may-9-mayhem-and-military-trials-a-year-on">May 9, 2023 riots</a> to be tried in military courts.</p>
<p>The case pertains to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878498">military trials</a> and the subsequent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881338">sentencing of civilians</a> for their role in attacks on army installations during the riots that followed ex-premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">Imran Khan‚Äôs arrest</a> on May 9, 2023.</p>
<p>The 5-2 ruling came as the CB accepted a set of 38 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1797503">intra-court appeals</a> (ICAs) moved by the federal and provincial gover¬≠nments as well as Shuhada Forum Balochistan, among others, against the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783105">widely-praised</a> October 2023 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783065/may-9-riots-sc-declares-military-trials-of-civilians-null-and-void">ruling</a> that declared that trying the accused civilians in military courts <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783065/may-9-riots-sc-declares-military-trials-of-civilians-null-and-void">violated the Constitution</a>.</p>
<p>The bench ‚Äî led by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also including Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, and Shahid Bilal Hassan ‚Äî had been reviewing whether the trial of civilians in military courts was Constitutional or not.</p>
<p>Justice Aminuddin announced the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/downloads_judgements/i.c.a._5_2023_07052025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10-page short order</a> of the majority ruling.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Justices Mandokhail and Afghan dissented from the verdict, dismissing the appeals in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/downloads_judgements/i.c.a._5_2023_dn_07052025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">separate order</a> and upholding the earlier ruling that declared military trials as null and void.</p>
<p>That Oct 23, 2023 verdict by a five-member bench ‚Äî led by Justice Ijazul Ahsan and comprising Justices Munib Akhtar, Yayha Afridi, Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi and Ayesha A. Malik ‚Äî had declared the military trials of civilians as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783244/sc-strikes-down-military-justice-for-civilians">unconstitutional</a> by a majority of 4-1.</p>
<p>While the bench unanimously emphasised that the cases of the May 9 suspects will proceed before criminal courts, the majority ruling had struck down Section 2(1)d(i) and 2(1)(d)(ii) and Section 59(4) of the <a class="link--external" href="https://pakistancode.gov.pk/pdffiles/administrator5a436c410d7fc88fc27dae7b864c6f63.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pakistan Army Act, 1952</a>.</p>
<p>In today‚Äôs pivotal verdict, the constitutional bench ‚Äî formed under the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866652/president-zardari-gives-assent-to-26th-constitutional-amendment">26th Amendment</a> ‚Äî restored those sections of the Army Act.</p>
<p>The short order stated that by a majority of five judges, ‚ÄúIntra Court Appeal No.5/2023 and other connected appeals are allowed and the impugned judgment, dated 23.10.2023, [‚Ä¶] is set aside.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhereas, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan dismissed the aforesaid Intra Court Appeals.</p>
<p>On December 13, 2024, the SC‚Äôs constitutional bench <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878498">conditionally allowed</a> military courts to pronounce reserved verdicts of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279#:~:text=A%20year%20on%2C%20as%20of%20May%209%2C%202024%2C%2085%20of%20these%20civilians%20are%20still%20in%20military%20custody.">85 civilians</a> who were in custody for their alleged involvement in the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>Subsequently, on December 21, military courts <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880141">sentenced 25 civilians</a> to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their involvement. Days later, another <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881338">60 civilians</a> were handed jail terms for a similar period over the matter.</p>
<p>On January 2, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884089">mercy petitions</a> of 19 accused were accepted on humanitarian grounds, while 48 other pleas have been processed to Courts of Appeal.</p>
<p>The sentencing of civilians by military courts was not only condemned by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880270">PTI</a>, but the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880757/may-9-riots-us-joins-uk-eu-in-voicing-concerns-over-military-trials-of-civilians">United States</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880609/trying-civilians-in-military-courts-lacks-transparency-uk-says-after-may-9-fgcm-convictions">United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880384">European Union</a> also raised concerns, saying the move contradicted international laws.</p>
