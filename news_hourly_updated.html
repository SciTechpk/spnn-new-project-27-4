                <h2>Pakistan downs 3 Indian jets as retaliation for late-night strikes at 6 sites: state media</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan military has brought down three Indian jets in retaliation for late-night strikes by its neighbouring country launched after midnight at the sites of Kotli, Bahawalpur, Muridke, Bagh and Muzaffarabad, state media reported.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between Pakistan and India began roughly around 1am on Wednesday with the Indian air strikes when the neighbouring country launched ‚ÄúOperation Sindoor‚Äù. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed the downing of two Indian jets around 2:45am with a third confirmed around 3:42am. The military spokesperson provided an updated damage assessment of the scenario around 4am.</p>
<p>Tarar said that the response was ongoing but did not share operational details. ‚ÄúWe shot down two Indian planes and we are responding to Indian aggression right now as we speak,‚Äù he told British broadcaster <em>Sky News</em>.</p>
<p>Chaudhry said in an interview on <em>CNN</em>: ‚ÄúI can confirm that two aircraft of Indian Air force have been taken down. The locations I have so far are around Bhatinda in India [Punjab] and Akhnoor [in occupied Kashmir].‚Äù</p>
<p>At 3:42am, state broadcaster <em>PTV</em> reported: ‚ÄúPakistan Air Force shot down another Indian Rafale aircraft 17 nautical miles southwest of Awantipora. So far, Pakistan Air Force has shot down three fighter jets of the Indian Air Force.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndian media, in a state of frenzy, is continuously running fabricated stories about losses of Pakistani Air Force and false claims of damaged aircraft,‚Äù the broadcaster added, stating, ‚ÄúNo Pakistan Air Force aircraft has sustained any damage.‚Äù</p>

<p>Appearing on British broadcaster <em>Sky News</em> around 2:45am, Tarar said Pakistan‚Äôs response is ongoing, but did not share operational details.</p>
<p>When asked about the potential for escalation, Tarar said it ‚Äúis an evolving situation‚Äù.</p>
<p>He reiterated that Pakistan was expecting an attack by India and said that ‚Äúthey would be the aggressor‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe offered an investigation into the whole Pahalgam episode, we wanted a fair and transparent investigation. But ‚Ä¶ India, without evidence, has targeted civilians, women and children. India had no right to do that,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs the minister for information, I have occupied a seat of responsibility,‚Äù Tarar said. ‚ÄúI have taken an oath and I will give you verified information.‚Äù</p>
<p>When asked why India blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack, Tarar replied: ‚ÄúThis area (Pahalgam) is a good 200 kilometres from the Line of Control. The FIR was filed in 10 minutes, but police arrived after one and a half hours.‚Äù</p>
<p>Tarar accused India of ‚Äúrunning away‚Äù from an investigation into the Pahalgam attack and accused India‚Äôs governing party of ‚Äúwanting a reason to attack Pakistan‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have a high morale and we will respond to Indian aggression,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia has no evidence whatsoever to link Pakistan to this incident,‚Äù he stressed. ‚ÄúIndia has attacked civilians ‚Ä¶ without any justifiable cause and because we have the right to self-defence, we will defend our country, we will respond.‚Äù</p>
<p>Questioned about terrorists found hiding in Pakistan in the past, including Al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden, Tarar rejected the allegations and reiterated that Pakistan was facing terrorist attacks ‚Äúevery second week‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre talking about the history ‚Äî the Soviet invasion, the cold war ‚Äî then that‚Äôs a different story,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Tarar also maintained that the US had thanked Pakistan for its efforts in the war against terrorism and ‚Äúfor the good fight we are fighting‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia will now face Pakistan‚Äôs very fierce response, because we are never the aggressors,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Referring to Pahalgam, Tarar said India ‚Äúis questioning its own government‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey have no evidence, they have no facts and they ran away from the investigation which Pakistan had offered,‚Äù the minister added. They attacked our civilians, they attacked our mosque today, they attacked five localities. Pakistan will now respond and will respond very, very effectively.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur desire for peace should not be mistaken for weakness,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>When asked about India‚Äôs strikes, Tarar said that no terrorist infrastructure was hit.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen I took foreign and local journalists to a village near the LoC ‚Ä¶ tomorrow morning, I was planning to take them to Bahawalpur and Muridke to show them where the strikes have occurred, to show that the local population is living there.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe totally deny India‚Äôs allegations regarding terrorists,‚Äù Tarar maintained. ‚ÄúWe have complete evidence that women and children have been targeted, there are civilian casualties in this and we will bring the evidence to foreign and local media. There are no terrorist camps.‚Äù</p>
<p>Questioned about the possibility of de-escalation, Tarar said that the situation is ongoing, adding, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see how it turns out‚Äù.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>ARY News</em> at 1:06am about the initial details of the attack, DG Chaudhry said: ‚ÄúAll of our air force jets are airborne. This cowardly and shameful attack was carried out from within India‚Äôs airspace. They were never allowed to come and intrude into the space of Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>He noted: ‚ÄúLet me say it unequivocally: Pakistan will respond to this at a time and place of its own choosing. This heinous provocation will not go unanswered.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis temporary happiness that India has achieved with this cowardly attack will be replaced with enduring grief.‚Äù</p>

<p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told <em>ARY News</em> that civilian areas were attacked.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe attacks were carried out on civilian areas,‚Äù Asif said, adding that the ‚Äúcowards‚Äù attacked from their own airspace. ‚ÄúThey never left their house. Let them come out, we will respond fittingly.‚Äù</p>
<p>When asked about Pakistan‚Äôs decisions, Asif replied that Pakistan will retaliate.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will give a far greater response than their own strike,‚Äù the minister said. ‚ÄúNot only did they attack civilians but they did it from their own airspace.‚Äù</p>
<p>On <em>Geo News</em>, Asif clarified that the strikes were launched from within India‚Äôs airspace.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWomen and children have been martyred in civilian areas. India is claiming it was targeting terrorist camps,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere is no such thing, international media can visit the targets so that India‚Äôs lies are exposed. We are offering international media to come wherever attacks have happened.‚Äù</p>
<p>The defence minister further said: ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have the courage to attack us in our airspace, and they are firing on women and children. Mosques have been destroyed.‚Äù</p>
<p>He vowed that ‚Äúwe will give a befitting response,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey will immediately receive their due.‚Äù</p>
<p>Multiple loud explosions were heard in Azad Jammu and Kashmir close to the mountains around the city of Muzaffarabad after midnight, multiple <em>Reuters</em> witnesses said.</p>
<p>After the explosions, the city‚Äôs power was blacked out, the witnesses said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs act of aggression has resulted in martyrdom of civilians, including women and children. This act of aggression has also caused grave threat to commercial air traffic.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe strongly condemn India‚Äôs cowardly action, which is a flagrant violation of the UN Charter, international law, and established norms of inter-state relations.</p>
<p>In the wake of Pahalgam attack, the Indian leadership has once again used the bogey of terrorism to advance its sham narrative of victimhood, jeopardising regional peace and security. India‚Äôs reckless action has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict.‚Äú</p>
<p>The FO said the situation continues to evolve and Pakistan reserves the right to respond appropriately at a time and place of its choosing, in accordance with the Article-51 of the UN Charter, and as enshrined in international law.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe government, armed forces and people of Pakistan stand united in the face of Indian aggression. They will always act with iron resolve to protect and preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>When asked by reporters at the White House about the strikes, US President Donald Trump called India‚Äôs actions a ‚Äúshame‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame we just heard about it ‚Ä¶ I guess people knew something was going to happen, based on a little bit of the past. They‚Äôve been fighting for a long time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been fighting for many decades ‚Ä¶ I just hope it ends very quickly.‚Äù</p>

<p>Meanwhile, sources in the Civil Aviation Authority said Pakistan‚Äôs airspace was to be completely closed and the Islamabad International Airport was closed for flights, with all flights diverted to Karachi airport.</p>
<p>The sources said the airspace was initially closed for 48 hours and all flights were cancelled, with passengers advised to return home.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMajor change in air routes in the region. All foreign flights rerouted to Pakistani airspace. Foreign flights leave Pakistani airspace and head towards the Arabian Sea.

<p>Earlier, Asif said that a clash with India ‚Äúcan happen anytime‚Äù amid the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586">ongoing tensions</a> between the two countries in the wake of a militant attack in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the headquarters of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) earlier in the day, where he was briefed on the country‚Äôs preparation for a ‚Äúconventional threat‚Äù. Asif was also part of the visit.</p>
<p>Speaking in an interview on <em>Geo News</em> show ‚ÄòAaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath‚Äô on the briefings in the ISI HQ, the defence minister reiterated that he had already said before that a clash with India was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907158">imminent</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat is still imminent today and can happen anytime,‚Äù he said, adding that a confrontation could be ‚Äúone of the choice‚Äù India could want to adopt but ‚Äúwe have developed a countermeasure for every choice, whether that is a surgical strike or ground attack or air attack or naval engagement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are ready for them everywhere at all times.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said the ‚Äúcrux‚Äù of today‚Äôs briefing was that ‚Äúevery kind of incursion or attack is being expected from them.‚Äù</p>
<p>Asif added that the briefing also delved into Pakistan‚Äôs strategy for responding to any situation.</p>

<p>Questioned about the chance of an ambush on a large scale, the minister said such actions were always taken on a small scale and added that he did not see any possibility of a big ambush or movement since it was detected immediately.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are continuously monitoring them,‚Äù he said, referring to Indian activities on the border. ‚ÄúEverything is in our watch. It is not the matter that they‚Äôre doing something hidden, which will cause an ambush.‚Äù</p>
<p>Asif said Pakistan‚Äôs preparation was complete and the government would not sit idly by. ‚ÄúA befitting response will be given to them at every level the moment they make a move.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pakistan has also taken the matter to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586">United Nations Security Council</a>, which was briefed on the country‚Äôs stance on the Pahalgam attack and India‚Äôs ‚Äúunsubstantiated‚Äù allegations.</p>
<p>In the latest moves by the two nuclear-armed nations, the Civil Defence in Rawalpindi has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908691/civil-defence-activates-14-posts-in-rawalpindi">activated its 14 posts</a> in the garrison city while all states in India are set to conduct <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908697/indian-states-told-to-conduct-air-raid-drills">mock drills</a> for ‚Äúeffective civil defence‚Äù.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the United States again today called for calm between India and Pakistan, after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned of stopping water from flowing across borders.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe continue to urge Pakistan and India to work towards a responsible resolution that maintains long-term peace and regional stability in South Asia,‚Äù State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters.</p>
<p>She did not comment on Modi‚Äôs latest comments but said that the US was ‚Äúaware of various reports‚Äù on the situation and was ‚Äúengaged‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe remain in touch with the governments of both countries at multiple levels,‚Äù she said.</p>

<p>The prime minister‚Äôs visit entailed a detailed briefing on the prevailing security environment, ‚Äúwith a particular focus on preparedness for [a] conventional threat in the light of India‚Äôs increasingly aggressive and provocative posture along Pakistan‚Äôs eastern border‚Äù, a statement from the PM Office (PMO) said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe leadership was apprised of regional security developments and the evolving threat matrix, including conventional military options, hybrid warfare tactics and terrorist proxies,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The premier was accompanied by Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, Asif and the services chiefs, the PMO said.</p>
<p>The services chiefs ‚Äî Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar ‚Äî were part of the visiting team, according to a group photo released on the occasion.</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz and the accompanying dignitaries ‚Äúunderscored the imperative of heightened national vigilance, seamless inter-agency coordination, and reinforced operational readiness to deter and decisively respond to any violation of Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity‚Äù, the PMO said.</p>
<p>Commending the ISI‚Äôs ‚Äúprofessionalism and strategic acumen‚Äù, the prime minister lauded its ‚Äúcritical role in safeguarding national interests and enabling informed national security decision-making under complex and dynamic conditions‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan Army is one of the most professional and disciplined force in the world,‚Äù the premier was quoted as saying. He reaffirmed that the entire nation was standing with ‚Äúour brave armed forces‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe leadership reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs unambiguous resolve to defend the homeland against all threats ‚Äî conventional or otherwise,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>The leaders reiterated that with the nation‚Äôs full support, the armed forces, supported by all other elements of national power and state institutions, remained ‚Äúfully prepared to uphold Pakistan‚Äôs security, prestige, and honour under all circumstances‚Äù.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also visited the newly established National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre (NIFTAC) and formally inaugurated its state-of-the-art headquarters, ‚Äúwhich will serve as the central node for coordinating Pakistan‚Äôs national counterterrorism strategy‚Äù, the PMO said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNIFTAC, a federal institution, integrates over 50 relevant federal and provincial departments and agencies into a unified intelligence and threat management architecture supported by a centralised national database.‚Äù</p>
<p>The statement added that at the subnational level, NIFTAC is linked to six Provincial Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centres (PIFTACs), including those in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, ensuring seamless coordination from the federation to the provinces.</p>
<p>Commending the efforts of all stakeholders involved in operationalising this vital capability, the prime minister described NIFTAC as a quintessential national platform for collaborative threat assessment and response. He underscored that ‚Äúdismantling the nexus between terrorism, illicit networks, and external sponsorship requires robust and efficient institutional mechanisms.‚Äù</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said NIFTAC would play a pivotal role in uprooting terrorism and its support structures from the country.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Modi said that water from India that once flowed across borders would be stopped.</p>
<p>Modi did not mention Pakistan specifically, but his speech comes after New Delhi suspended its part of the 65-year-old Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which governs water critical for consumption and agriculture.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs water used to go outside, now it will flow for India‚Äù, Modi said in a speech in New Delhi.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs water will be stopped for India‚Äôs interests, and it will be utilised for India.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pakistan has warned that tampering with its rivers would be considered ‚Äúan act of war‚Äù.</p>
<p>However, experts also pointed out that India‚Äôs existing dams do not have the capacity to block or divert water and can only regulate the timing of when they release flows.</p>
<p>Islamabad accused India of altering the flow of the Chenab River, one of three rivers placed under Pakistan‚Äôs control according to the IWT.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have witnessed changes in the river (Chenab) which are not natural at all,‚Äù Punjab Irrigation Minister Kazim Pirzada told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe majority impact will be felt in areas which have fewer alternate water routes,‚Äù Pirzada warned.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOne day the river had normal inflow and the next day it was greatly reduced,‚Äù Pirzada added.</p>
<p>In Azad Jammu and Kashmir, large quantities of water from India were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906856">reportedly released</a> on April 26, according to the Jinnah Institute.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is being done so that we don‚Äôt get to utilise the water,‚Äù Pirzada added.</p>

<p>It added that Muttaqi extended an invitation to Dar to visit Afghanistan again. ‚ÄúHe conveyed prayers and best wishes for the government and people of Pakistan,‚Äù the FO said.</p>
<p>Dar also briefed his Afghan counterpart on recent provocation and ‚Äúillegal and unilateral measures‚Äù by India against Pakistan, reiterating Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to peace and safeguarding its sovereignty.</p>
<p>Both leaders expressed satisfaction with the pace of progress made by the two sides in bilateral relations since the deputy PM‚Äôs visit to Afghanistan on April 19, with a focus on trade, connectivity, economic cooperation, people-to-people contacts and reactivating political consultative mechanisms.</p>
<p>The two sides also agreed on the importance of maintaining high-level contacts for fostering long-term cooperation to promote peace and security in the region and beyond, the statement concluded.</p>

            </a>
            <p><p>Seven soldiers were martyred in a blast from an improvised explosive device planted by ‚ÄúIndian proxy‚Äù terrorists in Balochistan‚Äôs Kacchi district, the military‚Äôs media wing said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7280" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said: ‚ÄúOn May 6, 2025, terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, so-called ‚ÄòBaloch Liberation Army‚Äô, targeted security forces‚Äô vehicle with an improvised explosive device in general area Mach.‚Äù</p>
<p>It said the following seven soldiers were subsequently martyred in the attack: Subedar Umar Farooq, 42, resident of Karachi; Naik Asif Khan, 28, resident of Karak district; Naik Mashkoor Ali, 28, resident of Orakzai district; Sepoy Tariq Nawaz, 26, resident of Lakki Marwat district; Sepoy Wajid Ahmed Faiz, 28, resident of Bagh district; Sepoy Muhammad Asim, 22, resident of Karak district and Sepoy Muhammad Kashif Khan, 28, resident of Kohat district.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNefarious designs of India and its proxies operating on Pakistani soil will be defeated by the valiant security forces, LEAs (law enforcement agencies) and the brave nation of Pakistan,‚Äù the ISPR said.</p>
<p>It added that sanitisation of the area was being carried out to eliminate any terrorists present in the area and the perpetrators of the ‚Äúheinous and cowardly act‚Äù would be brought to justice.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecurity forces of Pakistan, in step with the nation, remain determined to thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan, and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve.‚Äù</p>
<p>Two Pakistan Coast Guards personnel were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908760">injured</a> on Monday when a remote-controlled bomb targeted their patrol vehicle in the Jiwani area, while a Levies official escaped unharmed when his private vehicle was destroyed by a separate roadside bomb in Pishin district.</p>
<p>Last week, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">accused</a> India of activating its ‚Äúassets‚Äù to inte¬≠nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting ‚Äúirr¬≠e¬≠futable evidence‚Äù of Ind¬≠ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind¬≠ian military personnel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPost-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and the independent terrorist cells ‚Ä¶ to increase their activity,‚Äù he had said, using the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Militant violence and security operations intensified in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901722/militant-attacks-in-march-surged-to-highest-level-since-2014">report</a> by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">ranked second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p></p>
