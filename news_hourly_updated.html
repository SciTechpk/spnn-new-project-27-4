                <h2>CJP questions LHC‚Äôs ‚Äòfinal observations‚Äô in Imran‚Äôs May 9 bail cases</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi on Tuesday raised questions over some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919908">observations</a> made by the Lahore High Court (LHC) on former premier Imran Khan‚Äôs bail pleas in eight May 9 cases.</p>
<p>In November 2024, a Lahore anti-terrorism court had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875254">denied</a> Imran bail in the cases related to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9, 2023 riots</a>, including an attack on the house of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1752201">Lahore corps commander</a>.</p>
<p>The incarcerated PTI leader‚Äôs plea challenging that was also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921953">rejected</a> by the LHC on June 24. Subsequently, days later, Imran <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926834">moved</a> the Supreme Court against the high court‚Äôs decision.</p>
<p>A three-member bench led by CJP Afridi, which also included Justices Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, resumed hearing the bail pleas today.</p>
<p>Barrister Salman Safdar appeared on behalf of Imran, while Punjab Special Prosecutor Zulfiqar Naqvi was representing the state.</p>
<p>During the hearing, CJP Afridi took note of some ‚Äúfindings‚Äù issued by the LHC in its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921953">detailed verdict</a> of dismissing Imran‚Äôs bail pleas.</p>
<p>![ .]https://www.dawn.com/news/1919908)</p>
<p>‚ÄúCan final observations be given in a case for bail?‚Äù the chief justice questioned rhetorically.</p>
<p>Based on the same principle, he said, ‚ÄúFor now, we will not touch upon whether the findings in this case are right or not. We will not go into the legal matters at the moment.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf we touch upon the legal findings, then the case for either [party] can be affected,‚Äù CJP Afridi explained.</p>
<p>He directed the counsels of both respondents to assist the court with legal questions and complete their preparations by the next hearing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Supreme Court will not issue any such findings that may affect the case,‚Äù the top judge reiterated.</p>
<p>At one point, Safdar requested the court to allow him to speak at the rostrum but CJP Afridi denied that plea.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the bench issued notices to the Punjab government and adjourned the hearing till August 19.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com:443/feeds/home#engineered-and-fabricated-evidence" id="engineered-and-fabricated-evidence" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòEngineered and fabricated evidence‚Äô</h2>
<p>A two-member bench of the SC had taken up Imran‚Äôs bail pleas on June 29, but adjourned the hearing without issuing notices as Safdar could not appear.</p>
<p>Imran‚Äôs appeal, filed through Safdar, claimed that the PTI founder has been accused of conspiring and abetting violence on May 9.</p>
<p>However, at the time of the alleged offence, Imran was in the custody of the National Accountability Bureau. Therefore, his involvement in violence was ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù, the petition argued.</p>
<p>On LHC‚Äôs rejection of the bail pleas, the fresh appeal claimed that the court relied on ‚Äúengineered and fabricated evidence‚Äù which included ‚Äústale, discredited and delayed statements of police officials‚Äù.</p>
<p>In its detailed verdict, the two-member LHC bench comprising Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi and Tariq Mahmood Bajwa observed that the prosecution had evidence that reflected Imran‚Äôs role in the violence that broke out on May 9 following his arrest.</p>
<p>The bench reproduced the statements of two police officials and prosecution witnesses, who claimed to have secretly attended PTI‚Äôs meetings wherein Imran allegedly gave instructions to other leaders to attack military installations in case of his imminent arrest from the Islamabad High Court (IHC).</p>
<p>The meetings were allegedly held at a rest area of Chakri, Rawalpindi, on May 4 and at Imran‚Äôs Zaman Park residence in Lahore on May 7-9, 2023.</p></p>

            <p><p>Security forces have eliminated another three terrorists attempting to infiltrate via the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Balochistan‚Äôs Zhob district, the military‚Äôs media wing said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The military‚Äôs anti-infiltration <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929546/security-forces-kill-33-terrorists-in-balochistans-zhob-district-ispr">operation</a>, which began on the night of August 7, has so far killed 50 terrorists.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn night [of] 10/11 August 2025, a deliberate sanitisation operation was conducted in surrounding areas of Sambaza along [the] Pakistan-Afghanistan border,‚Äù the Inter-Services Public Relations said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7388" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring the conduct of the operation, three more Indian sponsored <em>khawarij</em> were hunted down and successfully neutralised. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed <em>khawarij</em>,‚Äù the ISPR added.</p>

<p>The ISPR highlighted: ‚ÄúThe number of <em>khawarij</em> killed in four days‚Äô anti-infiltration operation has risen to 50.‚Äù</p>
<p>It noted that ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929744/security-forces-kill-14-more-indian-sponsored-terrorists-along-pak-afghan-border-in-zhob-ispr">47 <em>khwarij</em></a> were sent to hell‚Äù previously, following successful engagements by the security forces in the general area Sambaza of Zhob from August 7 to 9.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe security forces remain committed to secure the nation‚Äôs frontiers and thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Pakistan,‚Äù the military reaffirmed.</p>
<p>Just a day ago, the US State Department <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930224/us-state-department-designates-bla-majeed-brigade-as-foreign-terrorist-organisations">designated</a> the banned so-called Balo¬≠chistan Liberation Army (BLA) and its combat wing, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349">Majeed Brig¬≠ade</a>, as a Foreign Terr¬≠¬≠orist Organisation.</p>
<p>The US said the move, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925093/pakistan-seeks-listing-of-majeed-brigade-as-terror-group">long-desired</a> by Pakistan, demonstrated its commitment to countering terrorism, while <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930323/us-designates-bla-as-foreign-terrorist-outfit#:~:text=cooperation%20and%20international%20coordination">signalling</a> strengthened cooperation and international coordination in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">broke</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>The country <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">ranked second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p></p>
