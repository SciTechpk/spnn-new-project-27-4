                <h2>Iran fires back at Israel after onslaught targets nuclear facilities</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Iran struck Israel early on Saturday with barrages of missiles in response to an latter’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/tel-aviv-in-smoke-as-iran-launches-missiles-under-operation-true-promise-3-after-day-long-israeli-attacks">onslaught</a> on the Islamic republic’s nuclear and military facilities yesterday that killed several <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916918/who-was-hossein-salami-the-revolutionary-guards-chief-killed-in-israeli-attacks">top generals</a>.</p>
<p>The missile salvo comes after nearly 80 people, including top army officers, were killed while over 300 were wounded in Iran a day ago as a result of Israel’s strikes on military sites and private residences, according to the country’s UN envoy Saeed Iravani.</p>

<p><strong>What we know so far:</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>One dead, ‘some 40’ injured in Israel as Iran launches ‘Operation True Promise 3’ in response</li>

<li>Radiation ‘unchanged’ in Iran’s Natanz area; ‘limited damage’ to Fordo and Isfahan nuclear sites</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>In the morning, Iran launched a fresh wave of attacks, state media said, after Israel’s military reported it detected inbound missiles from Tehran.</p>
<p>A senior Iranian military official, General Ahmad Vahidi, said “Operation True Promise 3” — as the retaliatory strikes are dubbed — will continue for as long as necessary“, according to Iranian state media <em>IRNA</em>.</p>

<p>Air raid sirens and explosions rang out across Israel overnight, with its military calling on residents to take refuge in bomb shelters in the morning.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said dozens of missiles — some intercepted — had been fired in the latest salvos from Iran.</p>
<p>One woman was killed and “some 40 people” were injured by the Iranian strikes, Israel’s Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter said.</p>
<p>“We faced three salvos of ballistic missiles fired from Iran today, about 150 in total,” Leiter <a class="link--external" href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-news-06-12-25-hnk-intl#cmbviaw2v00003b6wvywxa11k" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>CNN</em>’s Kaitlan Collins.</p>
<p>“We expect that the Iranians, who have a considerable volume of ballistic missiles, somewhere in the neighbourhood of 2,000, will continue to fire them,” he said.</p>
<p>“Israel is in war, not with the people of Iran … we are in a war against a regime that is intent on achieving nuclear power,” Leiter said.</p>
<p>He added that Israel wouldn’t know “precisely how much” damage it could inflict on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure until its forces “continue and complete the campaign”. “Ask me that question in four or five days,” the envoy added.</p>
<p>Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz took shelter inside a bunker, conducting a situation assessment after Iran’s retaliatory strikes, an Israeli official <a class="link--external" href="https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-news-06-12-25-hnk-intl#cmbvc0ru000113b766n6zew28" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>CNN</em></a>.</p>

<p>Smoke was billowing above skyscrapers in downtown Tel Aviv, an <em>AFP</em> journalist reported, as Iran’s Revolutionary Guard said it had attacked dozens of targets in Israel.</p>
<p>Israel’s firefighting service said its teams were responding to the aftermath of Iranian missile strikes, including working to rescue people trapped in a high-rise building.</p>
<p>Resident Chen Gabizon told <em>AFP</em> he ran to an underground shelter after receiving an alert notification.</p>
<p>“After a few minutes, we just heard a very big explosion, everything was shaking, smoke, dust, everything was all over the place,” he said.</p>

<p>The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) said the missiles targeted Israel’s airbases that were used as launch sites for attacks on Iran, the <em>Tasnim</em> news agency <a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/06/14/3334935/irgc-targets-israeli-airbases-used-as-launch-sites-for-attack-on-iran" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>“In this operation, the missile and drone units of the IRGC Aerospace Force employed a combination of precision-guided and smart missile systems to strike military centres, airbases used as launch sites for the criminal aggression against our nation,” the IRGC statement said.</p>
<p>It added that other targets included “military-industrial facilities instrumental in producing missiles and other weaponry for the Zionist regime’s army to commit crimes against the resistant nations of the region — particularly the oppressed people of Palestine and Gaza”.</p>
<p>“Field reports, satellite imagery and intelligence intercepts confirm the effective impact of dozens of ballistic missiles on strategic targets in occupied Palestine. Despite the enemy’s claims of interception, they failed to counter the waves of missile attacks launched by the Islamic Republic of Iran,” the statement added.</p>
<p>A senior Iranian official <a class="link--external" href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-news-06-12-25-hnk-intl#cmbvg0j3u002w3b76nxw5vcfd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>CNN</em></a> that Iran would intensify its attacks on Israel and target the regional bases of any country that “attempts to defend the regime”.</p>

<p>In Tehran earlier today, fire and heavy smoke billowed from Mehrabad airport, an <em>AFP</em> journalist said, as local media reported a blast in the area.</p>
<p>Iran’s ambassador to the UN said on Friday that 78 people had been killed and 320 wounded in the first wave of strikes by Israel.</p>

<p>Iran said earlier it had activated its air-defence system and explosions could be heard across the capital.</p>
<p>Dozens of people took to the streets of Tehran overnight to cheer their country’s military response, with some waving national flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans.</p>
<p>Separately, <em>IRNA</em> said the country’s forces downed two Israeli fighter jets during a massive Israeli air raid, although Israel denied this.</p>

<p>After a day of back-and-forth bombardments, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for the two nations to cease fire.</p>

<p>US officials said they were helping Israel defend against the missile attacks, even as Washington insisted it had nothing to do with Israel’s strikes on Iran.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump agreed on a call with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer that “dialogue and diplomacy” were needed to calm the crisis, Starmer’s office said.</p>
<p>Trump also spoke with Netanyahu on Friday, US officials said, without elaborating.</p>
<p>Iran’s missile salvo came hours after Israel said its widespread air raids had killed several top Iranian generals, including most of the senior leadership of the Revolutionary Guards’ air force.</p>
<p>It had launched several rounds of strikes that hit about 200 targets, including nuclear facilities and air bases.</p>
<p>Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to bring Israel “to ruin” during a televised address.</p>

<p>In Israel, Netanyahu issued a statement calling on the Iranian public to unite against their own government. But he also warned more attacks were coming.</p>
<p>“In the past 24 hours, we have taken out top military commanders, senior nuclear scientists, the Islamic regime’s most significant enrichment facility and a large portion of its ballistic missile arsenal,” Netanyahu said.</p>
<p>While stressing that it was not involved in the Israeli attacks, the United States warned Iran not to attack its personnel or interests.</p>
<p>Tehran nevertheless said Washington would be “responsible for consequences”.</p>

<p>Iran confirmed that the Guards’ aerospace commander had been killed, along with “a group of brave and dedicated fighters”.</p>
<p><em>AFP</em> images showed a gaping hole in the side of a Tehran residential building that appeared to have sustained a targeted strike.</p>

<p>After months of urging Israel not to strike Iran while he worked toward a nuclear deal, Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-tells-reuters-its-unclear-if-iran-still-has-nuclear-program-2025-06-13/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Reuters</em></a> in a phone interview on Friday that he and his team had known the attacks were coming — and still saw room for an accord.</p>
<p>“We knew everything, and I tried to save Iran [from] humiliation and death. I tried to save them very hard because I would have loved to have seen a deal worked out,” Trump said.</p>
<p>“They can still work out a deal, however, it’s not too late,” he added.</p>
<p>Trump’s shifting stance around the Israeli strikes, which he called “<a class="link--external" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-tells-abc-israel-strikes-iran-excellent-warns/story?id=122807155" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">excellent</a>” and “<a class="link--external" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/12/politics/trump-israel-iran-strike#:~:text=called%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20strikes%20on%20Iran%20overnight%20%E2%80%9Ca%20very%20successful%20attack" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">very successful</a>” in a series of media interviews on Friday, offered one of the most striking examples yet of how he conducts high-stakes negotiations through both frank public rhetoric and behind-the-scenes maneuovers.</p>

<p>Iran confirmed that above-ground sections of the Natanz enrichment plant had been destroyed, but the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said radiation levels outside the site “remained unchanged”.</p>
<p>“Most of the damage is on the surface level,” said the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran’s spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi.</p>
<p>Iran said there was only limited damage to the Fordo and Isfahan nuclear sites.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Israel’s strikes against Iran a “unilateral action” and said Washington was not involved, while also urging Tehran not to target US interests or personnel in the region.</p>
<p>However, a US official told <em>AFP</em> that Washington was helping Israel defend against Iranian missile attacks.</p>

<p>The United States and other Western governments have repeatedly accused Iran of seeking a nuclear weapon, an ambition it has consistently denied.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said Israeli intelligence had concluded that Iran was approaching the “point of no return” on its nuclear programme.</p>
<p>Israel had called for global action after the IAEA accused Iran on Thursday of non-compliance with its obligations.</p>
<p>Iran currently enriches uranium to 60 per cent, far above the 3.67pc limit set by a largely moribund <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1194411">2015 agreement</a> with major powers, but still short of the 90pc threshold needed for a nuclear warhead.</p></p>

                <h2>Pakistan warns UNSC of ‘grave threat to world peace’ posed by Israeli strikes on Iran</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Israel’s strikes on Iranian nuclear and military facilities constitute a “grave danger and a serious threat” to the peace, security, and stability of the entire region and beyond, Pakistan told the United Nations Security Council during an emergency session convened on Friday, the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/foreign-correspondent/pakistan-warns-unsc-of-grave-threat-to-world-peace-posed-by-israeli-strikes-on-military-targets-in-iran/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>Israel on Friday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">launched</a> widescale strikes on Iran, claiming that it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories, and military commanders. Iran’s ambassador told the UN that 78 people had been killed and 320 wounded in the first wave of strikes by Israel.  In a message, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks were the beginning of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.</p>
<p>Iranian media and witnesses reported explosions, including at the country’s main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, <em>Reuters</em> reported. Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards corps said its top commander, Hossein Salami, was killed, and state media reported the unit’s headquarters in Tehran had been hit. Six Iranian nuclear scientists were killed, Iranian state media reported.</p>
<p>In his remarks, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, strongly condemned the “unjustified and illegitimate” aggression by Israel against Iran, reaffirming that Islamabad stood in resolute solidarity with the Iranian government and people.</p>

<p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi requested the Security Council meeting, saying Israel “has now crossed every red line, and the international community must not allow these crimes to go unpunished”.</p>
<p>Among those supporting the request for a meeting were Algeria, Pakistan, China and Russia.</p>
<p>Amid escalating tensions, the Pakistani envoy urged the Security Council to discharge its responsibility to uphold international law and stop this aggression immediately.</p>
<p>Ambassador Asim strongly called for the resolution of the crisis through dialogue and diplomacy</p>
<p>Briefing the Security Council, UN Under-Secretary-General for political affairs Rosemary DiCarlo, told ambassadors that the repercussions of the attacks were already reverberating.</p>
<p>“I reaffirm the Secretary-General’s condemnation of any military escalation in the Middle East,” she said, urging both Israel and Iran to exercise maximum restraint and “avoid at all costs a descent into deeper and wider regional conflict”.</p>
<p>She also noted that the military escalation came just as “some significant diplomatic developments” were unfolding, including the planned <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">resumption</a> of United States-Iranian talks in Oman at the weekend. Latest reports indicate that Iran will no longer attend.</p>
<p>DiCarlo urged parties to stay the diplomatic course.</p>
<p>“A peaceful resolution through negotiations remains the best means to ensure the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme,” she said.</p>
<p>“We must at all costs avoid a growing conflagration which would have enormous global consequences.”</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916989/un-security-council-warned-of-deepening-crisis-in-middle-east">briefing</a> the Council, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi said his agency was in constant contact with the Iranian Nuclear Regulatory Authority to assess the status of affected facilities and determine broader impacts on nuclear safety and security.</p>
<p>He stressed that nuclear sites must never be targeted — under any circumstances.</p>
<p>“Such attacks have serious implications for nuclear security, nuclear safety and safeguards, as well as regional and international peace and security,” Grossi said.</p>
<p>He stands ready to travel to the region at the earliest opportunity, he added, to assess the situation and support safety, security and non-proliferation efforts in Iran.</p>
<p>“It is clear that the only sustainable path forward for Iran, for Israel, the entire region and the international community is one grounded in dialogue and diplomacy to ensure peace, stability and cooperation.”</p>
<p>Grossi concluded by offering the IAEA as a neutral platform where “facts prevail over rhetoric” and where technical engagement replace escalation.</p>
<p>“I reaffirm my personal and the agency’s readiness to facilitate dialogue and support efforts that promote transparency, security and the peaceful resolution of nuclear issues in Iran.”</p>
<p>Pakistan came out strongly in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917004">support</a> of Iran’s right to self-defence, following Israeli military strikes on Iranian targets, distinguishing its position from most other regional and global powers.</p>
<p>The Pakistani position was more than a diplomatic footnote; rather a bold assertion of principle in a region accustomed to cautious ambiguity.</p>

<p>When the Foreign Office described Isr­­ael’s action as “unjustified and illegitim­a­­te aggression” that violated “the soverei­g­nty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran” and flouted the UN Charter, it did not stop at condemnation.</p>
<p>It explicitly mentioned Article 51: “Iran has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.” The statement further urged the world to “hold the aggressor accountable for its actions.”</p>
<p>In a call with the Iranian foreign minister, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar condemned the blatant Israeli aggression and reiterated Islamabad’s strong support to Iran for the sake of peace in the region.</p>
<p>He also conveyed the deepest sympathies on the loss of many precious lives in Israeli attacks on Iranian territory.</p></p>
