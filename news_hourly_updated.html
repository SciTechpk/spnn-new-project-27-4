                <h2>Govt acting on comprehensive and effective strategy to completely eliminate terrorist outfits: PM Shehbaz</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said the government was implementing a comprehensive and effective strategy to ‚Äúcompletely eliminate‚Äù the menace posed by the proscribed <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>, <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and other terrorist outfits to the country.</p>
<p>Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.</p>
<p>In response, the government labelled the group as <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and directed use of the term <em>khariji</em> for attackers. It later <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525">designated</a> Balochistan-based groups as <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">highlight</a> India‚Äôs alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office said the premier chaired a meeting of the Steering Committee on Counter-Terrorism and Establishment of the State Writ (Harden the State) today at the PM House. The meeting was attended by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, National Security Adviser Lieutenant General Muhammad Asim Malik, PM aide Rana Sanallah, the four provincial chief secretaries and police chief, ministers and officials.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan is working on a comprehensive, effective and workable strategy to completely eliminate <em>Fitna al Hindustan</em>, <em>Fitna al Khawarij</em> and other such anti-social elements,‚Äù the statement quoted PM Shehbaz as saying.</p>
<p>He said the state was determined to eradicate and uproot the scourge of terrorism, adding that even the world recognised Pakistan‚Äôs successful operations against terrorists.</p>

<p>The prime minister said the state had adopted a ‚Äúmulti-pronged strategy‚Äù in the war against terrorism and made ‚Äúfull and effective use‚Äù of important elements such as ground operations, legislation, meaningful public communication and discouraging extremist thinking.</p>
<p>The prime minister directed the committee to ensure effective coordination between the federal and provincial governments against terrorism and to strictly implement the recommendations of the committee in this regard.</p>
<p>Lauding the role of security personnel and law enforcement agencies, he said the provincial governments, Intelligence Bureau, Ministry of Interior and Counter-Terrorism Department had taken ‚Äúvery effective steps‚Äù in the war against terrorism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith the joint actions and cooperation of all the relevant institutions, effective actions were taken against smuggling, which made it possible to prevent it,‚Äù he said, adding that preventing the issue had a positive impact on the economy.</p>
<p>The prime minister said that only a peaceful and strong state structure free from terrorism could restore the confidence of investors at the international level, adding that the government had brought substantial changes, such as the digitisation of all systems and improvement in the tax system, for this end.</p>
<p>Pointing to the performance of the Pakistan Stock Exchange, he said the record increase in its index and the improvement in the country‚Äôs global ratings indicated the economy‚Äôs stability and would restore the confidence of foreign investors.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also said that the implementation of the repatriation programme for Afghans residing illegally in the country was also continuing effectively in accordance with international laws.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir had, similarly, a day ago <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927575/coas-munir-reaffirms-resolve-to-eradicate-terrorism-warns-of-decisive-response-to-all-threats">reaffirmed</a> the military‚Äôs resolve to eradicate the menace of terrorism from the country, underscoring the nation‚Äôs preparedness to respond decisively to any external or internal threats.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations, the army chief was speaking to a group of stakeholders at the 16th National Workshop in Balochistan.</p>
<p>‚Äú[The] COAS resolutely reaffirmed Pakistan Army‚Äôs unwavering commitment to uproot the menace of terrorism and [the] inevitability of socio-economic uplift of Balochistan for national cohesion and integration,‚Äù the statement had said.</p></p>

                <h2>Utility Stores Corporation shutters down operations at all outlets</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Utility Stores Corporation (USC) on Thursday formally ceased operations, in compliance with the July 31 deadline <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924725">established</a> earlier this month to close the state-owned enterprise (SOE).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924725#:~:text=Established%20in%201971,%20USC%20is%20a%20state-owned%20enterprise%20tasked%20with%20supplying%20essential%20commodities%20at%20subsidised%20rates,%20primarily%20targeting%20low-income%20households.%20It%20currently%20operates%20over%204,000%20retail%20outlets%20nationwide.">Established</a> in 1971, USC was an SOE tasked with supplying essential commodities at subsidised rates, primarily targeting low-income households. It operated over 4,000 retail outlets nationwide.</p>
<p>According to a USC notification from the Ministry of Industries and Production, available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, the decision was taken in compliance with directives issued by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on June 28 and a meeting of the board of directors earlier this month.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll the sales and purchases at utility stores have been closed with effect from July 31, except shifting of stock from stores to warehouses and returned to vendors and handing-taking of stores‚Äô inventories,‚Äù the notification reads, instructing strict compliance with the order.</p>
<p>Additionally, sales through the business-management suite Odoo have been permanently discontinued as of today, a second USC notification read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll point of sale systems connected with Odoo will be rendered inactive across all stores effective July 31,‚Äù the notice read. ‚ÄúNo store in charge or designated official is authorised to conduct any sales through the Odoo system after this date. Additionally, no procurement transactions shall be initiated through Odoo either.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the notification, the Odoo system will only be utilised for inventory reconciliation and record maintenance and any attempt to carry out sales or purchase transactions after today will be treated as ‚Äúa serious violation of official policy‚Äù.</p>
<p>It added that ‚Äúany employee found conducting or facilitating sales or purchases through Odoo after July 31 shall be held personally responsible, and strict disciplinary action will be initiated under USC rules.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the finance ministry‚Äôs Federal SOE Performance Overview for the first half of FY25, USC posted a loss of Rs4.1 billion over six months, with cumulative losses rising to Rs15.5bn ‚Äî highlighting persistent structural and operational challenges.</p>
<p>In January, the federal cabinet <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1887083">formed</a> a high-level committee to develop a comprehensive strategy for the prompt shutdown of USC operations nationwide. The committee was tasked with determining a plan for the immediate closure of the USC, as well as arrangements for placing permanent USC employees in the surplus pool or absorption against existing vacancies in other federal government organisations.</p>
<p>The National Assembly‚Äôs Standing Committee on Privatisation was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906202">informed</a> in April that under the restructuring plan of USC, 1,203 Utility Stores were closed while 2,237 employees were laid off.</p></p>
