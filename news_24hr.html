            <p><p>• PML-N withdraws candidate in favour of JUI-F’s nominee on minority seat<br />
• ANP’s Shahida Waheed wins draw on women seat</p>
<p>PESHAWAR: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Thursday withdrew its candidate in favour of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) for a seat reserved for non-Muslims, paving the way for JUI-F to become the largest opposition party in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly with 18 lawmakers.</p>
<p>As a result, JUI-F’s candidate Gorpal Singh will now be notified as MPA-elect on the said seat by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Awami National Party (ANP) candidate Shahida Waheed was declared the winner through a draw against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Parliamentarians (PTI-P) candidate for a seat reserved for women. She will also be notified by the ECP as MPA-elect.</p>

<p>Both developments took place at the office of Provincial Election Commissioner (PEC) Saeed Gul in Peshawar on Thursday, where senior party leaders were present.</p>
<p>PML-N provincial president Amir Muqam and JUI-F’s Maul­ana Attaur Rehman attended the event along with their respective candidates, Gorsaran Lal and Gorpal Singh. The PML-N delegation formally withdrew its candidate in support of JUI-F’s nominee.</p>
<p>Similarly, delegations of ANP, led by MPA Nisar Baz and candidate Shahida Waheed, and PTI-P, led by MPA Arbab Waseem and candidate Somi, were also present for the draw. Following the draw, ECP officials declared Ms Waheed the winner.</p>
<p>Both PML-N and JUI-F were allo­­t­ted one seat each, reserved for non-Muslims, on the basis of the seven general seats won by each of them. The ECP had decided to allot the remaining seat through a draw.</p>
<p>Similarly, both ANP and PTI-P were awarded one seat each reserved for women and the remaining seat had to be allotted through a draw between candidates of these parties.</p>
<p>Following the notifications, JUI-F and PML-N will each hold nine of the total 26 reserved seats for women in the KP Assembly. PPP holds five, while ANP and PTI-P will now hold two and one, respectively.</p>
<p>For the four seats reserved for non-Muslims, JUI-F will hold two, while PML-N and PPP will have one each.</p>
<p>The opposition now <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920722/opposition-will-swell-to-52-in-kp-assembly">holds</a> a total of 52 lawmakers in the KP Assembly, including 18 MPAs of JUI-F, 17 of PML-N, 10 of PPP, four of ANP, and three of PTI-P. Presently, Dr Ibadullah of PML-N is the leader of the opposition in the KP Assembly. PTI-backed lawmakers maintain their tally of 92 members.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924884/us-declares-outfit-behind-pahalgam-attack-terror-group' target='_blank'><strong>US declares outfit behind Pahalgam attack ‘terror group’</strong></a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: The US has designated the group, which claimed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in India-held Kashmir’s Pahalgam area, as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) and specially designated global terrorist (SDGT) group.</p>
<p>Without any evidence, New Delhi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">blamed</a> Islamabad for the April 22 attack, which saw 26 people killed in the Baisaran hill station, and used it as a pretext to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">launch</a> military strikes against Pakistan.</p>
<p>According to a recent <em>BBC News</em> report, the group had initially said it was behind the attack, but later disowned it.</p>
<p>Thursday’s statement from the State Department seemed to echo India’s viewpoint, which has claimed that the little-known newly-formed group was actually a “front and proxy” of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).</p>
<p>India also blames the LeT for orchestrating the 2008 Mumbai attacks and several other attacks on military forces. The US earlier designated LeT as an FTO in December 2001.</p>
<p>One of the first mentions of the group came in 2020, when then-Indian army chief M.M. Naravane accused Pakistan of creating a “new terror group” in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>“I would rather call it Terror Revival Front. It is another terrorist organisation by another name. This is a terrorist organisation supported by its proxies across the border. They will be dealt with appropriately,” he was quoted as saying. Pakistan’s Foreign Office had rejected the allegation at the time.</p>
<p>“These actions taken by the Department of State demonstrate the Trump administration’s commitment to protecting our national security interests, countering terrorism, and enforcing President Trump’s call for justice for the Pahalgam attack,” the statement said.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with Indian journalist Karan Thapar, former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had said that Pakistan was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1923094">ready</a> to cooperate with India against this group.</p>
<p>At the time, Mr Thapar had claimed that New Delhi’s attempts to have the group designated as a terror outfit by the United Nations had been blocked by China, on Pakistan’s behalf.</p>

            <p><p>US President Donald Trump threatened to sue <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> on Thursday over a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796?st=wghsCB&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">story</a> about an alleged off-colour letter he wrote to Jeffrey Epstein, amid lingering political fallout over his administration’s handling of the late financier’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924612">sex trafficking case</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Journal</em> story says the letter featuring a sketch of a naked woman and Trump’s signature was part of a collection of notes for Epstein’s 50th birthday in 2003.</p>
<p>The newspaper says it reviewed the letter but did not print an image.</p>
<p><em>Wall Street Journal</em> editor-in-chief Emma Tucker “was told directly by (White House press secretary) Karoline Leavitt, and by President Trump, that the letter was a FAKE,” Trump wrote in a <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114871422727186590" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on his Truth Social network.</p>
<p>“Instead, they are going with a false, malicious, and defamatory story anyway,” he said.</p>
<p>“President Trump will be suing <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, NewsCorp, and Mr. (Rupert) Murdoch, shortly. The press has to learn to be truthful, and not rely on sources that probably don’t even exist.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>The Republican president was already facing a firestorm over his past relationship with Epstein, and claims that his administration is covering up lurid details of Epstein’s crimes to protect rich and powerful figures.</p>
<p>Epstein <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1499139">died by suicide</a> in a New York prison in 2019 — during Trump’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1295231">first term</a> — after being charged with federal sex trafficking in a scheme where he allegedly groomed young and underage women for sexual abuse by his wealthy contacts.</p>
<p>He was previously required to register as a sex offender in Florida after pleading guilty to two felony prostitution-related charges.</p>
<p>Later on Thursday, Trump asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to release transcripts of grand jury testimony in the Epstein case, “subject to court approval”.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#another-wonderful-secret" id="another-wonderful-secret" title="Permalink"></a>‘Another wonderful secret’</h2>
<p>The alleged letter — which Trump denies writing — is raunchy, as were others in the collection, the <em>Journal</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796?st=wghsCB&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. It contains several lines of typewritten text, contained in an outline of a naked woman drawn with a marker.</p>
<p>“The future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair,” the <em>Journal</em> reported.</p>
<p>“The letter concludes: ‘Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.’”</p>
<p>Trump denied writing the letter or drawing the figure, telling the <em>Journal</em>: “This is not me. This is a fake thing.”</p>
<p>“I don’t draw pictures of women,” he said. “It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”</p>
<p>Murdoch, who controls the <em>NewsCorp</em> global media company, was in Trump’s suite on Sunday at MetLife Stadium outside New York City for the FIFA Club World Cup final.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#epstein-row" id="epstein-row" title="Permalink"></a>Epstein row</h2>
<p>The Trump-supporting far-right has long <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922841/trump-faces-maga-meltdown-over-epstein-reversal-after-govt-says-sex-offender-did-not-have-client-list">latched</a> onto the Epstein scandal, claiming the existence of a still-secret client list and that he was murdered in his cell as part of a cover-up.</p>
<p>Trump supporters expected the Republican to answer their questions on his return to office in January, but now find themselves being told the conspiracy theories are false.</p>
<p>The Justice Department and FBI said in a memo made public earlier this month that there is no evidence that Epstein kept a “client list” or was blackmailing powerful people.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>They also dismissed the claim that Epstein was murdered in jail, confirming his suicide, and said they would not be releasing any more information on the probe.</p>
<p>That could change if grand jury testimony or evidence are released.</p>
<p>On Thursday, US media reported that a federal prosecutor who handled Epstein’s case, who is the daughter of a prominent Trump critic, was abruptly fired.</p>
<p>Maurene Comey, whose father is former FBI director James Comey, was dismissed on Wednesday from her position as an assistant US attorney in Manhattan, the reports said.</p>
<p>Comey also prosecuted Ghislaine Maxwell, the only former Epstein associate who has been criminally charged in connection with his activities.</p>
<p>Maxwell is the person who compiled the leather-bound book of letters for Epstein in 2003, <em>The Journal</em> reported.</p>
<p>“The <em>WSJ</em> should be ashamed for publishing it. Where is this letter? Would you be shocked to learn they never showed it to us before publishing it?” Vice President JD Vance wrote on X.</p>
