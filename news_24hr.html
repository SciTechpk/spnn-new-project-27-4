            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390/25-israeli-made-drones-used-by-india-in-attempt-to-attack-pakistan-all-shot-down-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>25 Israeli-made drones used by India in attempt to attack Pakistan, all shot down: ISPR</strong></a>
            <p><p>Pakistan’s armed forces have taken down 25 Israeli-made <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909385/all-you-need-to-know-about-israel-made-harop-drones-used-by-india-in-pakistan">Harop drones</a> sent into the country by India since last night, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A day earlier, Pakistan mourned the loss of 31 lives in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">overnight attacks</a> by Indian forces on civilians, describing New Delhi’s actions as “terrorism” and accusing it of continuous ceasefire violations on the Line of Control (LoC).</p>
<p>The Pakistan military termed the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824#:~:text=The%20Pakistani%20military%20has%20brought%20down%20five%20Indian%20jets%20in%20retaliation%20for%20late%2Dnight%20strikes%20launched%20by%20its%20neighbouring%20country%20at%20six%20sites%2C%20including%20in%20Punjab%E2%80%99s%20Sialkot%20and%20Bahawalpur%2C%20as%20well%20as%20Azad%20Jammu%20and%20Kashmir.">downing of five Indian fighter jets</a> as a major victory —  and it was seemingly acknowledged when Indian officials <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909047">admitted</a> that at least three of their aircraft had “crashed” within their territory.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, as both countries continued to trade heavy artillery fire, authorities revealed the extent of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">damage caused by Indian strikes</a> at six locations — Ahmedpur East, Muridke, Sialkot and Shakkargarh in Punjab and Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Azad Kashmir.</p>
<p>“The Pakistan Army, using their soft-kill (technical) and hard-kill (weapons) skills fully, have shot down 25 Israeli-made Harop drones,” the ISPR said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7282" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> today.</p>
<p>Referring to Pakistan’s response to Indian strikes, the ISPR press release said: “After the destruction of its five modern jets, drones and several posts, as well as soldier deaths, India is attacking Pakistan using these Israeli-made Harop drones in panic.”</p>
<p>“This cowardly attack is a sign of India’s worry and panic,” the statement added.</p>
<p>“The debris of these Israeli-made Harop drones is being collected from various locations across Pakistan,” the military’s media wing said. It asserted that the Pakistan Army was “giving a befitting reply to the enemy and crushing all its nefarious designs”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Indian defence ministry <a class="link--external" href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2127670" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">admitted</a> that its armed forces targeted a number of locations in Pakistan in the morning today. Indian outlet <em><a class="link--external" href="https://aninews.in/news/national/general-news/harpy-drones-used-by-indian-military-to-target-enemy-air-defence-systems20250508154319/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ANI News</a></em> reported that Harpy drones were used by the Indian military to target Pakistan’s “air defence system”. According to the <a class="link--external" href="https://dimse.info/harpy-harop/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Database of Israeli Military and Security Export</a>, the Harop is a “later development of the Harpy”.</p>
<p>The ministry’s statement also alleged that Pakistan had “increased the intensity” of firing at the LoC, where the two countries’ troops have been exchanging fire for the past several days.</p>

<p>“The Harpy is designed to attack radar systems and is optimised for the suppression of enemy air defences (Sead) role. It carries a high explosive warhead,” the <em>ANI</em> report read.</p>
<p>In a press briefing early today, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said Pakistan’s forces had neutralised 12 drones sent by India since last night. He also stated that four army personnel were injured as one drone, besides those downed, managed to engage a military target partially.</p>
<p>The ISPR DG detailed the locations where 12 of those drones sent by India were neutralised — Lahore, Attock, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi and Bahawalpur in Punjab, as well as Sukkur’s Miano, Umerkot’s Chhor and near Karachi in Sindh.</p>
<p>“Other than these 12, one drone, however, managed to engage a military target near Lahore partially,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said.</p>
<p>“Four men of the Pakistan Army have been injured in this attack near Lahore and partial damage to an equipment has occurred,” he said.</p>
<p>The DG ISPR further said that as a result of India’s drone activity, one civilian embraced martyrdom and another was injured in Miano.</p>

<p>During the press briefing, the military’s media spokesman also showed a series of pictures showing the debris of the drones. He added that the debris and downed drones were being collected from multiple locations.</p>
<p>“As we speak, the process of India sending across these Harop drones, this naked aggression continues, and the armed forces are on high degree of alert and neutralising them as we speak,” he continued.</p>
<p>“This is a serious, serious provocation,” the DG ISPR said.</p>
<p>“The Indians have resorted to these measures after] having miserably failed on the night of May 6 and 7, when they attacked places of worship and civilian infrastructure and killed innocent civilians, including children, women and [the] elderly,” he continued.</p>

<p>He further said: “Not only that, having faced the destruction of five of their aircraft, multiple drones, and suffering heavy casualties along LoC and damage, it appears that India has apparently lost the plot.</p>
<p>“And rather than going on a path of rationality, it is further escalating in a highly charged environment to satisfy the hubristic mindset of the Indian government,” Lt Gen Chaudhry asserted.</p>
<p>“The international community can visibly see the path that India is treading through this extremely provocative military aggression in a region, which is highly fragile and putting the security of the region and beyond at risk,” he said.</p>
<p>The DG ISPR added that the Pakistan armed forces remain “fully vigilant to any type of threat”. He then repeated the details of the Indian drones downed in Urdu.</p></p>

            <p><p><strong>• Educational institutions remain open, exams underway<br />
• Security beefed up across province<br />
• Rescue-1122 ready to meet any eventuality</strong></p>
<p>KARACHI: Although routine life in Karachi and other parts of the province remained unaffected by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">Indian strikes</a> in Azad Kashmir and Punjab, the provincial authorities on Wednesday prepared a contingency plan and beefed up security across Sindh to tackle any situation.</p>
<p>Almost all educational institutions remained opened on Wednesday and intermediate exams were held as per their schedule in Karachi and other parts of the province.</p>
<p>The director general of Rescue-1122, retired Brigadier Wajid Sibghatullah Mahar, told <em>Dawn</em> that the Sindh Emergency Rescue Service had prepared an emergency plan, outlining preparedness and resource allocation in anticipation of the situation.</p>
<p>“Rescue-1122 (Sindh) is on high alert and prepared with manpower, resources and coordination protocols to deal with any emergency efficiently,” according to the content of the plan reviewed by <em>Dawn</em>. “Rescue 1122 team stands fully ready to respond to any emergency across the province.”</p>
<p>The Sindh health department also declared “emergency” in all health facilities due to the prevailing regional security situation.</p>
<p>According to a communique issued by the director general-health, all leaves of health personnel, including doctors and nurses, stand cancelled. The health authorities were asked to maintain close coordination with Rescue-1122, district administration and law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>According to the contingency plan, ambulances are fully integrated with Rescue-1122, operating to respond  promptly to any medical emergency that may arise.</p>
<p>The plan has been shared with all relevant district administrations for their information and necessary action.</p>
<p><strong>Police on alert</strong></p>
<p>Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon on Wednesday ordered the provincial police to remain alert at all levels in view of the tense situation at the country’s borders, according to an official statement.</p>
<p>He directed policemen to keep a close watch on bazaars, markets and public places and enhanced monitoring and checking at the bordering towns and important installations.</p>
<p>“The Pakistan army, air force and navy are extremely alert at the borders while the Sindh police are alert against the enemies inside the province,” declared the IG police.</p>
<p>Also, Karachi police chief Javed Alam Odho chaired a meeting at his office in view of the current situation.</p>
<p>The metropolis police chief ordered the city police to remain alert and present at their headquarters while leaves of all policemen had been cancelled, according to the police statement. He said monitoring of all important installations should be increased.</p>

            <p><p>• Four missiles struck Jamia Masjid Ummul Qura in Muridke, killing three civilians<br />
• 13 people, including two girls, martyred in Subhan mosque strike<br />
• Funeral of Bahawalpur victims held at Dring Stadium</p>
<p>LAHORE: Tensions between India and Pakistan have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">intensified</a> after a series of Indian air and drone strikes resulted in the deaths of at least 31 Pakistani civilians, with many others injured, including 16 martyred only in Muridke and Bahawalpur.</p>
<p>As many as three civilians were kil­led when four Indian missiles struck Jamia Masjid Ummul Qura and an ad­­joining house in Muridke, some 40 kilometres from Lahore. The decea­sed were identified as Abdul Malik (from Jhang), Mohammad Alam (Samundri), and Midasar (Chunian).</p>
<p>Two others were injured and shif­ted to local hospitals. Sources said that the area had reportedly been evacuated earlier due to warnings of a possible strike, which helped reduce further casualties. The mosque was des­troyed and local authorities later arr­a­­­nged visits for both international and domestic media to inspect the site.</p>
<p><strong>Bahawalpur</strong></p>
<p>In Bahawalpur, officials confirmed that 13 civilians, including four men, seven women and two three-year-old girls, were killed in the missile strike on Subhan Mosque, located in the Chowk Azam area on the outskirts of Bahawalpur between the night of May 6 and 7.</p>
<p>The military’s media wing ISPR has yet to release an official list of the deceased. Most of the victims belonged to the same family, but they have yet to be officially identified.</p>
<p>When <em>Dawn</em> contacted the related government officials for the lists of the martyrs and injured, it was informed that the ISPR was finalising it before releasing it to the media.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>High-level visits were conducted by Corps Commander Bahawalpur Lt Gen Aqeel, Divisional Commissioner Musarrat Jabeen and Punjab Health Minister Khawaja Salman Rafique, who met with the injured at Bahawal Victoria Hospital on directives from the Punjab chief minister.</p>
<p>The targeted mosque and madressah complex are located in Azam Chowk, not in Ahmedpur East as previously speculated.</p>
<p>The madressah premises also include residences, where most of the deceased lived and were targeted by the Indian missiles.</p>
<p><em>Dawn</em> learnt that the private seminary during the last week had been evacuated by the local administration, apprehending any Indian assault on it. However, the residents of the seminary’s residential quarters and students were allowed to return just a day before the attack.</p>
<p>Witnesses reported hearing four po­­werful explosions that shook windows as far as Satellite Town and Ba­­ghdadul Jadeed Railway Station. Des­pite the panic, many residents rushed towards the blast site, chanting slogans in support of the armed forces.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, life went on as usual in Bahawalpur, with commercial activities in the grain, vegetable markets and local bazaars continuing on Wednesday along with the normal flow of traffic on roads.</p>
<p>However, public and private schools, colleges, and universities remained closed under the government’s orders.</p>
<p>The funeral prayers for victims were offered at Bahawalpur’s Dring Sta-dium under tight security measures.</p>
<p><strong>Narowal</strong></p>
<p>In Narowal’s Shakargarh sector, Indian forces launched drone and mortar shell attacks on civilian areas late Tuesday night. A government dispensary sustained partial damage, while mortar shells and drone munitions fell in surrounding fields but failed to detonate. The Pakistan Army also launched a counterattack on Indian forces. The Indian army also fired ammunition in the Harra and Sial villages.</p>
<p>A drone was later recovered from a tree and defused by the bomb disposal squad after being alerted by citi­­zens. Narowal Deputy Com­mis­sioner Syed Hassan Raza declared an emergency at all hospitals across the district, including BHUs, RHCs and DHQ Hospital. Doctors and paramedical staff were placed on 24-hour alert and full stocks of medicines and medical supplies were ensured.</p>
