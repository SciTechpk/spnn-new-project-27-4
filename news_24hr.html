            <p><p>The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Tuesday issued a stay order for the appointments of new opposition leaders in the National Assembly and the Senate following the disqualification and removal of PTI’s Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz.</p>
<p>On August 5, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928901">disqualified</a> Ayub and Faraz, along with other opposition MNAs and MPAs, following their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">convictions</a> in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927964/pti-opposition-leaders-over-100-others-sentenced-for-may-9-riots#:~:text=judgements%20in%20three%20separate%20cases">three</a> cases related to the May 9, 2023 riots.</p>
<p>Subsequently, on August 8, both leaders were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929551">removed</a> from their posts in notifications issued by the NA and Senate secretariats.</p>
<p>A division bench comprising Justices Arshad Ali and Dr Khurshid Iqbal took up the petitions filed earlier today by Ayub and Faraz against the denotification of their parliamentary roles.</p>
<p>PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan appeared as the counsel for both petitioners.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The bench issued notices to the ECP and other respondents, directing them to halt the appointments for the opposition leader in both houses of the parliament, which are currently vacant.</p>
<p>The court adjourned the hearing till August 15 (Friday), seeking replies from the respondents.</p>
<p>A PHC bench comprising Justice Ali and Justice Farah Jamshed had also barred the ECP from taking any action against Ayub and Faraz on August 6, but to no avail since the order came a day after their disqualification.</p>
<p>The court had also granted the two leaders, as well as Zartaj Gul, protective bail till August 20.</p>

            <p><p>Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi on Tuesday raised questions over some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919908">observations</a> made by the Lahore High Court (LHC) on former premier Imran Khan’s bail pleas in eight May 9 cases.</p>
<p>In November 2024, a Lahore anti-terrorism court had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875254">denied</a> Imran bail in the cases related to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9, 2023 riots</a>, including an attack on the house of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1752201">Lahore corps commander</a>.</p>
<p>The incarcerated PTI leader’s plea challenging that was also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921953">rejected</a> by the LHC on June 24. Subsequently, days later, Imran <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926834">moved</a> the Supreme Court against the high court’s decision.</p>
<p>A three-member bench led by CJP Afridi, which also included Justices Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, resumed hearing the bail pleas today.</p>
<p>Barrister Salman Safdar appeared on behalf of Imran, while Punjab Special Prosecutor Zulfiqar Naqvi was representing the state.</p>
<p>During the hearing, CJP Afridi took note of some “findings” issued by the LHC in its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921953">detailed verdict</a> of dismissing Imran’s bail pleas.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Can final observations be given in a case for bail?” the chief justice questioned rhetorically.</p>
<p>Based on the same principle, he said, “For now, we will not touch upon whether the findings in this case are right or not. We will not go into the legal matters at the moment.</p>
<p>“If we touch upon the legal findings, then the case for either [party] can be affected,” CJP Afridi explained.</p>
<p>He directed the counsels of both respondents to assist the court with legal questions and complete their preparations by the next hearing.</p>
<p>“The Supreme Court will not issue any such findings that may affect the case,” the top judge reiterated.</p>
<p>At one point, Safdar requested the court to allow him to speak at the rostrum but CJP Afridi denied that plea.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the bench issued notices to the Punjab government and adjourned the hearing till August 19.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#engineered-and-fabricated-evidence" id="engineered-and-fabricated-evidence" title="Permalink"></a>‘Engineered and fabricated evidence’</h2>
<p>A two-member bench of the SC had taken up Imran’s bail pleas on June 29, but adjourned the hearing without issuing notices as Safdar could not appear.</p>
<p>Imran’s appeal, filed through Safdar, claimed that the PTI founder has been accused of conspiring and abetting violence on May 9.</p>
<p>However, at the time of the alleged offence, Imran was in the custody of the National Accountability Bureau. Therefore, his involvement in violence was “impossible”, the petition argued.</p>
<p>On LHC’s rejection of the bail pleas, the fresh appeal claimed that the court relied on “engineered and fabricated evidence” which included “stale, discredited and delayed statements of police officials”.</p>
<p>In its detailed verdict, the two-member LHC bench comprising Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi and Tariq Mahmood Bajwa observed that the prosecution had evidence that reflected Imran’s role in the violence that broke out on May 9 following his arrest.</p>
<p>The bench reproduced the statements of two police officials and prosecution witnesses, who claimed to have secretly attended PTI’s meetings wherein Imran allegedly gave instructions to other leaders to attack military installations in case of his imminent arrest from the Islamabad High Court (IHC).</p>
<p>The meetings were allegedly held at a rest area of Chakri, Rawalpindi, on May 4 and at Imran’s Zaman Park residence in Lahore on May 7-9, 2023.</p></p>

            <p><p>Pakistan on Tuesday welcomed the US’ <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930224/us-state-department-designates-bla-majeed-brigade-as-foreign-terrorist-organisations">decision</a> to designate the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and Majeed Brigade to its Foreign Terrorist Organisation list, according to a Foreign Office (FO) press release.</p>
<p>The US State Department made the announcement yesterday, stating that the designations demonstrated the US President Donald Trump’s commitment to counter-terrorism.</p>
<p>In today’s <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/pakistan-welcomes-us-designation-of-baloch-liberation-army-bla-and-majeed-brigade-as-foreign-terrorist-organisations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>, the FO emphasised that Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349">proscribed</a> the Majeed Brigade — BLA’s suicide squad — as a terrorist entity since July 18, 2024.  The BLA itself was proscribed in 2006, according to the National Counter-Terrorism Authority’s <a class="link--external" href="https://nacta.gov.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/proscribed-organizations-06-oct-2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">list of proscribed organisations</a>.</p>

<p>“BLA/Majeed Brigade is involved in multiple terrorist attacks in Pakistan, including the heinous <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897237/rescue-operation-for-hostages-underway-after-terrorists-attack-jaffar-express-in-balochistan">Jaffer Express</a> terrorist incident and the Khuzdar bus attack that resulted in the loss of precious lives,” the release said.</p>
<p>At least 26 hostages lost their lives in the Jaffar Express attack in March, for which the BLA <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901013/jaffar-express-departs-from-quetta-after-17-day-hiatus#:~:text=claimed%20by%20Balochistan%20Liberation%20Army%20terrorists%2C">claimed responsibility</a>. In the Khuzdar bus attack, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913363">10 people</a> — including two students — lost their lives during a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912542/pm-vows-strong-action-against-perpetrators-after-school-bus-blast-in-khuzdar">suicide attack</a> on a school bus in May.</p>
<p>The group was also behind the 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1863586">attack</a> near the Karachi airport, which killed three people, including two Chinese nationals, as well as the Gwadar Port Authority Complex <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1822759">attack</a>, which claimed the lives of eight soldiers.</p>
<p>“Pakistan remains a steadfast bulwark against terrorism. Our sacrifices have secured critical counter-terrorism successes, not only for the country, but for regional stability and global security.”</p>
<p>It added that the country remained unwavering in its resolve to protect its citizens and eliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. “Pakistan remains committed to cooperating with the international community to overcome this common challenge.”</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi welcomed the US’ decision and sincerely thanked US President Donald Trump and the US administration.</p>
<p>“This is a major diplomatic victory for Pakistan and another defeat for our eternal enemy,” Naqvi was quoted as saying in a post on X by the Interior Ministry.</p>
<p>“This move by the US is an acknowledgement of Pakistan’s immense sacrifices in the war against terrorism,” adding that Pak-US cooperation against terrorism is welcome.</p>
<p>“A path has been created for action on a global level against the BLA and Majeed Brigade.”</p>

<p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also welcomed the US’ decision while speaking to reporters at an event in Hyderabad.</p>
<p>He said organisations like the BLA and Majeed Brigade use violence to target innocent civilians, “especially hard working labourers who go to Balochistan for work.</p>
<p>“When India and Pakistan fought war, BLA and Majeed Brigade openly voiced support for Modi,” he said.</p>
<p>“Now the US has endorsed this point, which is a huge success for Pakistan.</p>
<p>He noted that although it helps when other countries declare these groups as terrorist organisations, “we must try to declare it as such through the UN so that international financing, especially that of Indian intelligence agencies and facilitators, is tackled.”</p>
<p>Islamabad had previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925093/pakistan-seeks-listing-of-majeed-brigade-as-terror-group">requested</a> that the Majeed Brigade be listed as an international terrorist organisation. In 2019, the State Department <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1491717">labelled</a> the BLA as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT), making it a crime for anyone in the US to assist the militants, but did not designate the Majeed Brigade at that time.</p>
<p><a class="link--external" href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FTO designations</a> are made by the Secretary of State, following section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and “are an effective means of curtailing support for terrorist activities and pressuring groups to get out of the terrorism business”.</p>
<p>SDGT designations, meanwhile, target individuals and groups under <a class="link--external" href="https://www.state.gov/executive-order-13224/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Executive Order 13224</a>, even if they are not part of a formally recognised organisation.</p></p>
