                <h2>Death toll in Lyari building collapse surges to 27, rescue operation still underway</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The death toll from the five-storey <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050">building collapse</a> in Karachi has risen to 27, with several people still missing under the rubble, officials said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Rescue teams worked overnight on Friday to pull out more bodies from the rubble of the building situated in Lyari on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market.</p>
<p>Till Saturday, 80 per cent of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922268">rescue operation</a> had been completed, according to South Deputy Commissioner (DC) Javed Nabi Khoso.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em> today at around 1:30pm, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said ‚Äúit will take five to six more hours to complete the rescue operation‚Äù.</p>
<p>Khan added that several people are still missing under the rubble but he could not cite an official figure yet since rescue operations were ongoing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFive people, including three women have been injured and so far,‚Äù said a statement from Edhi Rescue Service.</p>
<p>A total of 27 bodies have been recovered so far, including nine women, 15 men, a 13-year-old child, a 10-year-old child, and a one-year-old infant. The bodies have been shifted to Civil Hospital Karachi by Edhi Ambulance.</p>
<p>Ten people who were injured have been discharged.</p>
<p>While speaking to the media today after leading the Ashura procession, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah provided details on the building collapse.</p>
<p>‚ÄúImmediate rescue efforts were launched to save any survivors trapped under the rubble,‚Äù he said, adding that the bodies recovered had been handed over to the families.</p>
<p>He echoed Khan‚Äôs statement of rescue operations being expected to conclude today.</p>
<p>The chief minister assured that a detailed inquiry into the causes of the collapse would be conducted, with committees already formed to investigate the matter thoroughly.</p>
<p>He revealed that over 480 buildings in old city areas, mostly in District South, have been declared dangerous.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe government plans to assist affected residents in finding alternative housing,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>CM Murad added that the recently collapsed building was constructed only a few months ago, apparently without proper approval, and those responsible for unauthorised construction would face strict punishment.</p>
<p>He also urged  the public to verify that any building they purchase has proper approval from the Building Control Authority.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that several people resist evacuation due to poverty and lack of alternatives, often buying or renting cheaper properties without checking safety approvals and later demanding government protection.</p>
<p>While empathising with these difficulties, he stressed that sometimes strict action is necessary to ensure public safety, as demonstrated by recent enforcement measures.</p></p>

<p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid rich tribute to the sacrifice of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) and his companions, saying that Ashura gives us a message of sacrifice, truthfulness, sincere determination, and standing up for the truth.</p>
<p>In their separate messages on Yaum-i-Ashura, they urged the nation to uphold the values and principles of fortitude and courage demonstrated by the martyrs of Karbala and to exhibit perseverance in the face of trials, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>President Zardari said that Karbala is a symbol of an eternal struggle against falsehood. ‚ÄúThis day is not only an unparalleled story of sacrifice, loyalty, and patience but also a bright lamp that shows the path of truth and righteousness in the darkness of every era.‚Äù</p>
<p>In his message, PM Shehbaz said: ‚ÄúKarbala teaches us that although the path of truth is difficult, it is the path that leads to the pleasure of Allah Almighty and the satisfaction of hearts and eternal prosperity.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said the message of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) is not limited to his time but is a universal message, which even today convinces us that a Muslim stands for the truth, supports the oppressed, and advocates justice in all circumstances.</p></p>
