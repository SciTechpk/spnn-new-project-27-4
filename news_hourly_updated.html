                <h2>Bilawal-led team stresses need for Pak-India dialogue in meetings with US Congress members</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A high-level delegation led by PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has stressed the need for dialogue with India in a series of meetings with US Congress members in Washington, state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/05-06-2025/multiparty-delegation-holds-series-of-meetings-with-us-congressmen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Pakis¬≠tan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">launched</a> a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi‚Äôs growing lobbying presence there. As part of its global outreach, the team will also visit London and Brussels.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow">delegation</a> comprises former foreign ministers Bilawal, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh¬≠mina Janjua.</p>
<p>During Wednesday‚Äôs discussions at Capitol Hill, the delegation underscored the urgency of dialogue on the Kashmir issue, noting it was an ‚Äúunfinished agenda of the United Nations‚Äù.</p>
<p>It stressed the imperative of respect for international law, UN Security Council resolutions and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), <em>Radio Pakistan</em> added.</p>
<p>Bilawal emphasised that sustainable peace in South Asia hinged on dialogue, restraint and a just resolution of the Kashmir dispute, rather than ‚Äúunilateralism or intimidation‚Äù.</p>
<p>He briefed members of Congress on India‚Äôs recent acts of unprovoked aggression, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910848">targeting of civilians</a>, as well as the ‚Äúdeeply concerning‚Äù and unilateral <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">suspension</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>.</p>
<p>Bilawal appreciated the US, particularly ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915520/pakistan-wants-trump-to-arrange-talks-with-india">President Donald Trump</a>, for his constructive role in helping <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">de-escalate tensions</a> and supporting efforts towards a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>‚Äù, according to the report.</p>
<p>The delegation reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs principled stance on regional peace, counterterrorism efforts and recent Indian aggression, reaffirming Pakistan‚Äôs commitment ‚Äúto peace, responsible conduct, and rejection of baseless allegations‚Äù.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, members of the Congress welcomed the Pakistani delegation, urging ‚Äúboth countries to demonstrate restraint and prioritise regional peace and stability‚Äù, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> stated.</p>
<p>They reiterated the US support for the people of Pakistan and its commitment to aiding the country‚Äôs economic progress.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Bilawal <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/BBhuttoZardari/status/1930387061397135549" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted on X</a> that his team met with Congressmen Jack Bergman and Tom Suozzi, who co-chair the Congressional Pakistan Caucus, along with Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar and Republican Party‚Äôs Ryan Keith Zinke.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the Pakistani delegation underscored that enduring regional peace rested on ‚Äúprincipled dialogue, mutual restraint, and a just settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, not unilateralism and coercion‚Äù.</p>

<p>Bergman and Suozzi were among a group of lawmakers who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903968">visited Pakistan</a> in April and met with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir, along with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.</p>
<p>Bergman has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892390#:~:text=Congressman%20Jack%20Bergman%20also%20voiced%20support%20for%20the%20movement">repeatedly</a> voiced <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906059/us-congressman-bergman-reaffirms-call-for-imrans-release">support</a> for former prime minister Imran Khan, calling for his release.</p>

                <h2>Karachi victim in DHA assault case ‚Äòforgives‚Äô suspect but court rejects bail application</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A Karachi resident who was assaulted in the Defence Housing Authority earlier this week says he has forgiven the suspect and does not want to take the case to court, even as a judge rejected the suspect‚Äôs bail in a separate hearing.</p>
<p>On Monday, Karachi police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914964">arrested</a> a main suspect along with two of his employees over charges of beating a citizen named Dheeraj. The suspect, identified as Salman Farooqi, was arrested from DHA and his vehicle was impounded.</p>
<p>Farooqi, who was travelling in a luxury car, allegedly assaulted a motorcyclist accompanied by a woman on the Khayaban-i-Ittehad Road following a minor accident.</p>
<p>A judicial magistrate on Tuesday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915280/two-remanded-in-assault-case">remanded</a> Farooqi and his guard, Owais Hashmi in police custody in the case. They were produced in court today by the police following the completion of their two-day remand.</p>
<p>Today, Dheeraj appeared in court and identified the suspect.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was not aware that the court had summoned me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe lawyer told me today, so I appeared.‚Äù</p>
<p>The judicial magistrate asked Dheeraj whether he was facing any sort of pressure.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was my fault, my bike hit his car,‚Äù Dheeraj told the court.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI do not want to file a case. I forgive the suspect,‚Äù he said, adding  ‚ÄúWhatever the court decides, I will have no objection.‚Äù</p>
<p>Dheeraj filed a no objection certificate (NOC). However, the court noted that the affidavit appeared to have been submitted under undue influence or coercion.</p>
<p>Public Prosecutor Irfana Qadri told the court that a case had been registered against the suspect for threatening and humiliating a woman, identified as Dheeraj‚Äôs sister Kalpana.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese are non-bailable charges,‚Äù Qadri said. The court reserved its verdict after the lawyers‚Äô arguments.</p>
<p>In a separate hearing, however, Additional District and Sessions Judge Abdul Zahoor Chandio rejected the bail application filed by Farooqi and Hashmi.</p>
<p>A case had been registered against the suspects at the Gizri police station on the complaint of an eyewitness citizen.</p></p>
