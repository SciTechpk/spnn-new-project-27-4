                <h2>Indian ban fails to hit Pakistan‚Äôs trade</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: India‚Äôs attempt to disrupt Pakistan‚Äôs external trade by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908171">banning</a> ships carrying Pakistani goods from anchoring at its ports has failed to yield the desired impact, according to shipping industry representatives.</p>
<p>On May 2, India imposed a ban on ships carrying goods originating from or destined for Pakistan, barring them from entering Indian ports or transiting through Indian territory. The move followed military aggression under ‚Äò<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988">Operation Sindoor</a>‚Äô launched on May 7, which ended within four days due to Pakistan‚Äôs forceful <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">retaliation.</a></p>
<p>While India initially sought to hurt Pakistan‚Äôs trade flows, the outcome fell short of expectations. Shipping companies reportedly adapted by separating cargo bound for and from Pakistan, thereby avoiding dependence on Indian ports.</p>
<p>Importers, however, said the Indian ban has resulted in longer shipping times and higher freight charges.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMother vessels are not coming to Pakistan due to this Indian action, which delays our imports by 30 to 50 days,‚Äù said Javed Bilwani, President of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He added that importers are now relying on feeder vessels, which raises costs.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Shipping delays push up costs, but exporters report minimal impact on overall trade</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exporters also reported a spike in shipping and insurance costs following the Indian aggression. However, they said the overall impact on exports remains minimal.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is no significant impact on exports after the Indian aggression, except for a rise in insurance costs. Shipping charges had already gone up even before the escalation,‚Äù said Aamir Aziz, an exporter of textile made-ups.</p>
<p>Pakistan‚Äôs exports are heavily reliant on imported inputs for value addition. With the government maintaining tight controls on imports to conserve foreign exchange, any disruption in supply chains has broader economic implications.</p>
<p>However, Pakistan Ship‚Äôs Agents Association Secretary General Syed Tahir Hussain dismissed claims that mother vessels have stopped calling at Pakistani ports.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou can see mother vessels at Karachi and Port Qasim,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFeeder vessels are also sufficient to handle Pakistan‚Äôs trade volume, as they can carry between 6,000 and 8,000 containers ‚Äî well above the current level of our exports and imports.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>Trade with India</strong></p>
<p>Formal trade relations between Pakistan and India have remained <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1499076">frozen</a> since 2019. Bilateral trade declined from $2.41bn in 2018 to $1.2bn in 2024. Pakistan‚Äôs exports to India decreased from $547.5 million in 2019 to just $480,000 in 2024.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, unofficial trade is thriving. <em>Al Jazeera</em>, quoting the India-based Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), reported last month that unofficial Indian exports to Pakistan are estimated at $10bn per year.</p>
<p>This parallel trade has been facilitated through alternate routes, including ports in Dubai (UAE), Colombo (Sri Lanka), and Singapore.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs exports include pharmaceuticals, petroleum products, plastics, rubber, organic chemicals, dyes, vegetables, spices, coffee, tea, dairy items, and cereals. Pakistan‚Äôs key exports to India consist of copper, glassware, organic chemicals, sulphur, fruits and nuts, and certain oilseeds.</p>

                <h2>SC decision upholding transfer of judges to IHC challenged</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Five judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) have challenged the Supreme Court‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918159/sc-constitutional-bench-dismisses-pleas-against-transfer-of-ihc-judges">decision</a> to uphold the transfer of three judges from other high courts to the federal capital.</p>
<p>The appeal was filed on Saturday, two days before the Judicial Commission of Pakistan‚Äôs (JCP) meeting to appoint chief justices to at least three high courts on July 1.</p>
<p>In its judgement anno¬≠unced on June 19, the Supreme Court‚Äôs Const¬≠itutional Bench, had held by a majority of 3-2 that the transfer of three judges to IHC from Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan high cou¬≠rts was within the framework of the Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>The Constitutional</strong></p>
<p>Ben¬≠ch had also partially sent the matter to the president to determine seniority amongst judges, based on their service records.</p>
<p>Now, IHC‚Äôs justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz, who originally challenged the transfers, have filed an intra-court appeal (ICA) against the June 19 judgement.</p>
<p>The ICA, jointly moved by senior counsel Muneer A. Malik and Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed, urged the court to set aside the order in the interest of justice.</p>
<p>While the appeal is heard, the Supreme Court should grant an interim relief against the judgment, the applicants pleaded.</p>
<p>The five judges have requested the Supreme Court not to consider justices Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, Khadim Hussain Soomro and Muhammad Asif as judges of IHC until they take fresh oaths in accordance with Article 194 Justice Dogar is also the acting chief justice of IHC.</p>
<p>The appeal contended that Section 3 of the Islamabad High Court Act 2010 only provides for the appointment of judges to the IHC from other provinces but makes no reference to transfers.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The appeal contended that the June 19 order impermissibly reads in ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù in Article 200(1) and (2) of the Constitution when no such language was contained in the provision.</p>
<p>The appeal pleaded that the constitutional bench had misunderstood the provisions of Article 200 by reading sub-article (1) in isolation from other provisions of the article by not holding that transfers envisioned in Article 200(1) were only for a temporary and time-specified period.</p>
<p>The order also failed to interpret of articles 200 and 175A, without scuttling and undermining the powers of JCP under Article 175A of the Constitution, the appeal argued adding the independence of judiciary does not allow bestowing onto the executive a much more expansive power than what the text of Article 200 and the foundational principles of constitutional law can bear.</p>
<p>The concept of federalism also mandates that the provincial authority‚Äôs role in the permanent filling of vacancies of judges must not be usurped, it added.</p>
<p>The June 19 judgment had partially remanded the matter to the president to determine the seniority after examining the service record of the transferred judges as soon as possible, including the question of whether these transfers were permanent or temporary.</p>
<p>The powers of the president under Article 200(1) are two distinct provisions dealing with different situations and niceties and neither do they overlap nor override each other, the verdict explained, adding the transfer by the president by means of Article 200 cannot be construed as a fresh appointment, the judgment had held adding the powers of transfer conferred to the president by the framers of the Constitution cannot be questioned on the ground that if the posts were vacant in IHC then why they were not filled up by JCP through fresh appointments.</p>
