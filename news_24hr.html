            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922486/death-toll-in-lyari-building-collapse-stands-at-27-as-rescue-operation-ends-on-3rd-day' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll in Lyari building collapse stands at 27 as rescue operation ends on 3rd day</strong></a>
            <p><p>Rescuers on Sunday concluded their operation to recover people from the site of a five-storey building which collapsed in Karachi earlier this week, with the final death toll standing at 27.</p>
<p>Rescue teams worked overnight on Friday to pull out more bodies from the rubble of the building situated in Lyari on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market.</p>
<p>“The rescue operation was completed on Sunday evening,” Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>. “No more human casualties have been found; thus, the total death toll stands at 27 people, whose bodies were earlier recovered and transported to Civil Hospital Karachi.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that acting Rescue 1122 Director General Dr Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh remained on the ground for over 30 hours, directly commanding the rescue operation.</p>
<p>Khan said that the exact cause of the collapse would be determined later, but suggested it was “because the building was dilapidated”.</p>
<p>“A day before the collapse, residents felt a ‘shock’. It can be said now that it was not an earthquake, but the building’s structure being shaken or dislocated,” Khan said. “There were 12 families, though some families had already left the building after the tremors.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#difficulties" id="difficulties" title="Permalink"></a>Difficulties</h2>
<p>The Rescue-1122 spokesperson said that there was a lack of coordination among different rescue organisations and that staffers from two private rescue organisations fought during the operation.</p>
<p>“They sustained injuries to the head during the scuffle,” Khan said. “It would have been more appropriate if one organisation had been given command, under which all rescue institutions could have worked.”</p>
<p>Another problem, according to Khan, was that relatives remained at the site as they were not willing to be moved to any government or private shelter. The rescue workers faced “immense pressure” from the relatives, he added.</p>
<p>Khan added that there was difficulty in moving heavy machinery like cranes due to the narrow streets.</p>
<p>“We used the same high-tech equipment that was used during the recent earthquake in Turkiye,” Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>. “The use of such high-tech equipment, like life detectors helped rescue several people safely with some minor injuries. Without this equipment, the use of heavy machinery might have caused further injury.”</p>
<p>He said that over 100 personnel took part in the operation for three days, working in different shifts.</p>
<p>At around 1:30pm, Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “it will take five to six more hours to complete the rescue operation”.</p>
<p>A total of 27 bodies were recovered, including nine women, 15 men, a 13-year-old child, a 10-year-old child, and a one-year-old infant. The bodies were transported to Civil Hospital Karachi by Edhi Ambulance.</p>
<p>Ten people who were injured have been discharged.</p>
<p>While speaking to the media today after leading the Ashura procession, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah provided details on the building collapse.</p>
<p>“Immediate rescue efforts were launched to save any survivors trapped under the rubble,” he said, adding that the bodies recovered had been handed over to the families.</p>
<p>He echoed Khan’s statement of rescue operations being expected to conclude today.</p>
<p>The chief minister assured that a detailed inquiry into the causes of the collapse would be conducted, with committees already formed to investigate the matter thoroughly.</p>
<p>He revealed that over 480 buildings in old city areas, mostly in District South, have been declared dangerous.</p>
<p>“The government plans to assist affected residents in finding alternative housing,” he said.</p>
<p>CM Murad added that the recently collapsed building was constructed only a few months ago, apparently without proper approval, and those responsible for unauthorised construction would face strict punishment.</p>
<p>He also urged the public to verify that any building they purchase has proper approval from the Building Control Authority.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that several people resist evacuation due to poverty and lack of alternatives, often buying or renting cheaper properties without checking safety approvals and later demanding government protection.</p>
<p>While empathising with these difficulties, he stressed that sometimes strict action is necessary to ensure public safety, as demonstrated by recent enforcement measures.</p></p>

            <p><p>Yaum-i-Ashura processions in major cities across the country safely concluded on Sunday evening amid tightened security.</p>
<p>Yaum-i-Ashura is observed every year on Muharram 10 with solemnity to pay homage to Imam Husain — the grandson of Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) — and other martyrs of Karbala.</p>
<p>So far, processions in Karachi, Hyderabad and Punjab have culminated, according to statements from senior officials.</p>
<p>The Ashura procession in Karachi safely culminated at Hussainiya Iraniyan Imam Bargah, with a police update sharing that the head of the procession reached the imam bargah at 6:20pm.</p>
<p>Additional IG Karachi Javed Alam Odho praised the Karachi Police for excellent security arrangements during Muharram, according to a statement from his office.</p>
<p>“Majalis and processions were organised at several places in Karachi, including Nishtar Park,” he was quoted as saying, expressing appreciation for the Traffic Police for arranging alternative routes for the convenience of the general public during the main procession.</p>
<p>Additional IG Odho also thanked media representatives, procession organisers, mourners and other institutions for their cooperation, according to the statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah expressed his satisfaction over the peaceful end of Ashura and thanked the interior minister, police and Rangers for “foolproof” security arrangements and the local government minister, Karachi mayor and relevant staff for providing facilities, according to a statement from his office.</p>
<p>“The peaceful conclusion of Ashura processions across Sindh is the government’s success,” Shah was quoted as saying. “Despite high security concerns, the Sindh Police did an excellent job, and the government made every effort to provide all facilities to the mourners.”</p>

<p>Shah praised the role of religious scholars in maintaining religious harmony, calling their role “commendable”.</p>
<p>“Sindh is the land of Sufis. We are advocates of peace,” Shah stated.</p>
<p>Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar also congratulated Sindh Police for their excellent security strategy and performance during Ashura.</p>
<p>“During this important occasion, security measures taken by all units of the Sindh Police, including the Traffic Police and Special Branch Police at the provincial level from Muharram 1 to Ashura, are commendable at every level,” he was quoted as saying in a statement.</p>
<p>Lanjar also praised and appreciated the performance of Rangers Sindh and other security agencies on this occasion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the central Ashura procession in Hyderabad culminated peacefully at Karbala Dadan Shah.</p>
<p>Every year, the procession departs from Qadam Gah Maula Ali and is managed by Anjuma-i-Hyderi, which was founded in 1948.</p>
<p>The entire route was sealed since the early morning with barbed wire, while police and Rangers personnel were deployed.</p>
<p>The procession reached St Mary’s Convent School roundabout, where mourners performed zohrain prayers. Subsequently, a majlis was addressed a small distance from the roundabout by Syed Wasim Hyder Zaidi, according to an Anjuman-i-Hyderi spokesman.</p>
<p>A majlis was also addressed by Allama Irfan Ali Kazmi before the procession departed from Qadam Gah.</p>
<p>The procession was delayed by over an hour at St Mary’s Chowk and passed the area at 5.15pm instead of the usual time of 4pm. This area also connects the route of the tazia procession from the city.</p>
<p>Police arrangements for security were also weak. No strict checking was seen and everyone was allowed to reach the procession route, especially from Universal Book Depot point. Some policemen who were initially seen for security purpose disappeared subsequently.</p>
<p>Deputy Inspector General Tariq Dharejo, Senior Superintendent of Police Adeel Chandio and Deputy Commissioner Zain Ul Abidin monitored the proceedings in the control room set up in the City police station.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a statement from the Punjab government stated that processions were culminating safely in multiple cities across the province. Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif congratulated her team, including Salman Rafique, ministers, institutions and others, for the “excellent arrangements”.</p>
<p>“For the first time, we had not only the best Muharram in terms of arrangements but also the most peaceful one,” Maryam was quoted as saying. “Along with cleaning the roads, the dirt of hatred was also wiped away.”</p>
<p>Senior Provincial Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, accompanied by other ministers, arrived at the bridge of the Metro Bus Station, leaving Nisar Haveli in Lahore. She also visited the control room established at the Punjab Home Department and reviewed arrangements for Yaum-i-Ashura across the province in detail.</p>
<p>A briefing delivered to Aurangzeb confirmed that the processions were being monitored in real-time through 7,500 cameras across Punjab and that 113,000 personnel were deployed.</p>
<p>Additionally, more than 1,600 “hate-spreading accounts” were reported by the Cyber ​​Patrol Cell of the Home Department and 170 people were arrested, according to the briefing.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb was also briefed on the provision of clean water and clean procession routes, where water was sprinkled to cool mourners amid the heat and the spraying of disinfectants was continuous. Mobile toilets were also provided and rescue personnel were on standby in case of emergency.</p>
<p>A coordinated plan was also prepared with the Water and Power Distribution Authority (Wapda) and other institutions for uninterrupted power supply during Yaum-i-Ashura.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Karachi Traffic Police issued a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921828">traffic plan</a> for Muharram 8 to 10, outlining the procession routes as well as alternative traffic flows.</p>
<p>Stringent security measures are being taken across the country, such as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920725/army-to-be-deployed-across-country-for-security-during-muharram">army deployment</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919931">crackdown</a> on sectarian content and hate mongers, ahead of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920308">Ashura</a> (Muharram 10), being observed today.</p>

<p>In their separate messages on Yaum-i-Ashura, they urged the nation to uphold the values and principles of fortitude and courage demonstrated by the martyrs of Karbala and to exhibit perseverance in the face of trials, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>President Zardari said that Karbala is a symbol of an eternal struggle against falsehood. “This day is not only an unparalleled story of sacrifice, loyalty, and patience but also a bright lamp that shows the path of truth and righteousness in the darkness of every era.”</p>
<p>In his message, PM Shehbaz said: “Karbala teaches us that although the path of truth is difficult, it is the path that leads to the pleasure of Allah Almighty and the satisfaction of hearts and eternal prosperity.”</p>
<p>He said the message of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) is not limited to his time but is a universal message, which even today convinces us that a Muslim stands for the truth, supports the oppressed, and advocates justice in all circumstances.</p></p>

            <p><p>Six people were killed while one person was injured on Sunday amid flash floods and heavy rain across Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authorities (PDMA) in both provinces.</p>
<p>At least 22 people have been killed and 11 others have been injured in KP in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921210">accidents</a> related to rain, strong winds, flash floods and landslides since June 25, according to PDMA reports. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920723">wreaked havoc</a> in the province, while 18 people were swept away along the Swat River due to a sudden surge in the gushing water.</p>
<p>Additionally, PDMA warned on Friday that the risk of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922068">glacial lake outburst flood</a> (Glof) — the sudden release of water and debris from a glacial lake — has increased in glacial areas of the province due to increasing temperatures, which in turn has raised the risk of additional flooding.</p>
<p>Today’s report from the PDMA outlined that four people were killed in KP while another was injured due to heavy rainfall and flash floods, according to the PDMA’s reporting officers in Malakand and Hazara divisions.</p>
<p>The PDMA said that three rooms in a house in the Buner district’s Teenolo Dheri village collapsed, killing a woman and injuring a man. Separately, in Buner, a temporary bridge pillar at Faizabad Khwar was swept away.</p>
<p>In Malakand, a flash flood caused by heavy rainfall swept through the Heero Shah union council, killing three people.</p>
<p>According to the PDMA report, one woman and two children were swept away. The woman and one of the children drowned.</p>
<p>“Rescue 1122 recovered [a] female body, while two children are still missing,” the report read, adding that a rescue operation was underway.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 later issued an update stating that one of the children had been rescued.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dargai Assistant Commissioner (AC) Shahbaz Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em> that a woman and her grandson drowned in the Zor Mandi nullah as they were crossing it.</p>
<p>“Both bodies were recovered by Rescue 1122 and moved to Dargai hospital,” he stated.</p>
<p>Dargai Additional AC Waheedullah told <em>Dawn.com</em> that there was heavy rain in the mountains of Kot and the Hiro Shah Dargai area in the morning.</p>
<p>“Flash floods occurred in small, dry nullahs originating from the mountains and leading to small streams,” he said. “A nine-year-old boy was swept away by the flash flood in a small dry nullah. His grandmother, around 55-years-old, tried to save him but was also swept away.</p>
<p>The additional AC said that a rescue operation was launched immediately and that the boy’s body was recovered from the Pir Kalay Harichan Charsadda/Badragga Malakand boundary, while the body of the woman was recovered from the Zormandi Quaidabad area.</p>
<p>Additional AC Waheedullah further said that he was present in the field and people were discouraged from approaching or crossing the nullahs through announcements and the deployment of Levies personnel.</p>
<p>Additionally, three cows were rescued from flash floods in the Zormandi area.</p>
<p>“The bodies are being transported to Arang Bajaur and an ambulance from Rescue 1122 was arranged,” Waheedullah added.</p>
<p>In Mansehra, the PDMA stated in its report that an an 18-year-old resident of Rawalpindi had drowned in a flash flood in Putwar Halqa Jabba which was caused by heavy rain.</p>
<p>Amir Khadam, spokesperson for Rescue 1122 in Mansehra, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the young man drowned when he was crossing a nullah in the Mansehra district with his motorcycle on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>“The body of the deceased was recovered from floodwater in the Ghotar area and was turned over to his heirs,” Khadam said.</p>
<p>The PDMA added that due to the heavy rainfall, landslides were reported in Buner’s Pandriks union council and Torghar district’s Tharala area. Both events caused traffic blockages and heavy machinery was deployed to clear the roads.</p>
