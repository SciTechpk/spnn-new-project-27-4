                <h2>COAS Munir stresses potential for ‚Äòbroader, multidimensional‚Äô ties with US built on mutual respect</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir has stressed the ‚Äúimmense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect‚Äù with the United States, the military‚Äôs media wing said on Friday.</p>
<p>COAS Munir is on a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917414">five-day</a> official visit to the US, where he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093/trump-coas-munir-talk-counterterrorism-and-trade-in-cordial-meeting-ispr">met with</a> President Donald Trump over luncheon, becoming the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">first</a> serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. National Security Advisor Lt Gen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907660/in-a-first-isi-chief-made-national-security-adviser">Muhammad Asim Malik</a> ‚Äî also the intelligence chief ‚Äî has accompanied Gen Munir.</p>
<p>COAS Munir held an interaction in Washington DC with prominent US think tanks and representatives of the strategic affairs institutions, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7326" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>Senior scholars, analysts, policy experts and representatives of leading international media outlets were also part of the ‚Äúcomprehensive and candid exchange‚Äù, ISPR added.</p>
<p>The army chief ‚Äúunderscored the immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect, shared strategic interests, and economic interdependence‚Äù, the statement said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Evaluating the Pakistan-US partnership, Gen Munir underlined the ‚Äúhistorical convergences between the two nations, particularly in areas such as counterterrorism, regional security and economic development‚Äù.</p>
<p>In his remarks, the army chief also highlighted Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúunwavering commitment to regional peace and stability, and its constructive role in fostering a rules-based international order‚Äù.</p>
<p>The army chief also noted the ‚Äúmalign influence of certain regional actors in sponsoring and perpetuating terrorism as a tool of hybrid warfare‚Äù, the statement added.</p>
<p>He mentioned this as he alluded to the details and analysis of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910729/operation-bunyanum-marsoos-11-soldiers-martyred-78-wounded-while-defending-pakistan">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a> during the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186">conflict</a> with India and ‚Äúelaborated on Pakistan‚Äôs perspective on terrorism‚Äù.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir emphasised that Pakistan had been on the ‚Äúfront lines of the global war against terrorism, having rendered immense sacrifices ‚Äî both human and economic ‚Äî in pursuit of a safer and more secure world‚Äù.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has repeatedly <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a> that Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911617#:~:text=which%20lost%2090%2C000%20lives%20and%20over%20%24150%20billion%20economic%20losses">lost</a> 90,000 valuable lives and incurred $150 billion worth of economic losses over the past few decades.</p>
<p>During the session, COAS Munir also invited international partners to explore collaborative opportunities in various sectors to ‚Äúunlock shared prosperity‚Äù.</p>
<p>He highlighted Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúremarkable untapped potential, particularly in the domains of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915901">information technology</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1871762">agriculture</a>, and its vast and underexploited reserves in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903248">mining</a> and mineral sectors‚Äù, echoing topics discussed in his meeting with Trump and previous Pak-US interactions.</p>
<p>The army chief also provided a detailed exposition of Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúbalanced approach to regional and global conflicts, advocating for dialogue, diplomacy, and adherence to international law‚Äù, the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He reaffirmed that Pakistan continues to play a ‚Äúresponsible and proactive role in mitigating regional tensions and promoting cooperative security frameworks‚Äù. The statement comes amid heightened tensions in the Middle East amid the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/israel-iran-conflict">Israel-Iran war</a> as the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918216/how-trump-a-self-proclaimed-peacemaker-embraced-israels-campaign-against-iran">weighs</a> whether to intervene militarily or not.</p>
<p>Participants, the ISPR said, noted the ‚Äúopenness and clarity of the COAS‚Äôs perspectives and appreciated Pakistan‚Äôs consistent and principled policies‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe interaction was marked by a spirit of mutual understanding and was widely regarded as a positive step toward enhancing strategic dialogue between Pakistan and the United States,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The interaction also provided an opportunity to articulate Pakistan‚Äôs principled stance on key regional and global issues, and to deepen understanding of Pakistan‚Äôs strategic outlook, the military‚Äôs media wing noted. It reflected the country‚Äôs ‚Äúcommitment to transparent diplomacy, international engagement, and the pursuit of peaceful coexistence through principled and proactive dialogue‚Äù.</p></p>

                <h2>Supreme Court rules against construction in Karachi DHA park, except for jogging track</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: The Supreme Court (SC) has restrained the authorities concerned from raising any structure apart from a jogging track on the premises of an amenity plot / park located in the Defence Housing Authority (DHA).</p>
<p>The apex court also said that the people must not be deprived of the park‚Äôs utility, subject to a nominal entrance fee meant for its maintenance.</p>
<p>A two-judge bench comprising Justice Mohammad Shafi Siddiqui and Justice Salahuddin Panhwar was hearing a civil petition filed against an order of the Sindh High Court (SHC) at the SC‚Äôs Karachi Registry.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>It also allowed a request by the counsel for the respondents to transfer the matter to the principal seat at Islamabad after seeking the approval of the chief justice of Pakistan, as the lawyer submitted that, since the injunctive order had been passed, the interests of the respondents were at stake.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Bench rules ordinary people should not be deprived of park‚Äôs utility</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Citing DHA, Cantonment Board Clifton (CBC), M/s Optimum Sports (Private) Limited and others as respondents, the managing committee of Masjid-i-Saheem, located at Khayaban-i-Rahat, Phase VI, DHA, along with some neighbouring residents, moved the apex court through their counsel Khawaja Shams-ul-Islam against an order of the SHC passed on March 11.</p>
<p>The bench in its order said that the lawyer for the petitioners had placed before it a case whereby it was claimed that a ‚Äúpublic park‚Äù meant for the use of common persons was now being licensed to an entity for its commercial gain and that every individual entering the park would be charged exorbitantly.</p>
<p>The counsel also argued that the purpose of the amenity, i.e. public park, cannot be changed into any other amenity, depriving the public at large from utilising it solely as a park.</p>
<p>The lawyer for the petitioners also maintained that although a division bench of the SHC dealt with some of the issues, including the locus standi of the petitioners, nonetheless, a public interest litigation was involved.</p>
<p>Representing the respondents, Advocate Hussain Ali Almani asserted that public entry was not restricted, but it would be subject to an entrance fee for the jogging track.</p>
<p>He also submitted that presently, the respondents were raising a jogging track and had planned to construct padel courts and other allied structures.</p>
<p>The bench in its order said, ‚ÄúWe are of the view that apart from the jogging track, no structure of the nature as licensed to them or otherwise, be raised till the next date of hearing and the common person shall not be deprived to park‚Äôs utility subject to nominal fee meant for its maintenance.‚Äù</p>
<p>At this juncture, the counsel for the respondents requested for the transfer of the case to the principal seat of the apex court, as he submitted that the interests of the respondents were at stake after issuance of the injunctive order.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the bench directed its office to transfer the case to the principal seat in Islamabad for further hearing, after seeking approval of the chief justice, and to fix it for hearing in the opening week after the summer vacations.</p>
<p>The petitioners contended that the amenity plot/parking lot in question was adjacent to the mosque, the entrance of which was connected with the masjid, and that it was a park admeasuring over two acres.</p>
<p>They also asserted that the present controversy arose when M/s Optimum Sports (Private) Limited had started demolishing/altering the main gate of the masjid and parking lot, and after a long discussion the petitioners were told that the parking lot had been given to the private firm by way of a licence agreement executed between the firm and DHA and CBC.</p>
<p>They further argued that the contract, without an open auction or any public tender and without following the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Rules, was seriously hampering the right of access to the mosque, as the namazis had been using the designated parking of the masjid for over 30 years.</p>
<p>The petitioners asserted that the impugned SHC order dismissing their petition suffered from legal infirmity, as it ought to have appreciated that state functionaries, in awarding contracts, must act fairly, reasonably, honestly and justly and that the high court has the power to judicially review administrative actions to check their fairness, reasonableness and transparency.</p>
