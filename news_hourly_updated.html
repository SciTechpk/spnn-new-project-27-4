                <h2>1 dead, 3 children injured in KPs Bannu after quadcopter attacks by militants: police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>One person was killed while three were injured after militants carried out two quadcopter attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Bannu district on Wednesday, according to police.</p>
<p>The incident comes following reports of multiple quadcopter and drone attacks in KP and Balochistan over the past year. In March, at least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901160/11-killed-in-mardan-security-action">11 people</a> were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, while in May, a suspected quadcopter munitions drop <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912007/locals-stage-sit-in-as-kp-minister-denounces-killing-of-3-children-in-alleged-north-waziristan-drone-strike">claimed</a> the lives of four children and injured five others in North Waziristan District‚Äôs Mir Ali tehsil. The military <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912393/security-forces-falsely-implicated-in-north-waziristan-incident-ispr">clarified</a> that security forces were ‚Äúfalsely implicated‚Äù in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told <em>Dawn.com</em>, ‚ÄúTwo quadcopter incidents occurred in the district today.  In the first quadcopter attack by militants, one woman was killed while three children were injured, including two of the woman‚Äôs children.‚Äù</p>
<p>The woman‚Äôs body and the injured people were taken to the hospital for medical assistance, he added.</p>
<p>DPO Kulachi said that another quadcopter attack occurred where terrorists attacked the Meryan police station, damaging the station‚Äôs solar panels on the rooftop.</p>
<p>He said, ‚ÄúThe police personnel remained safe in the attack,‚Äù adding that it was the third such militant attack on the same police station.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA search operation was underway in the area to track down the terrorists,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities recently, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Bannu has seen several militant attacks over the past several months.</p>
<p>On Saturday, one person was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922294/jirga-member-killed-3-injured-by-armed-suspects-firing-in-bannu-police">killed</a> and three others were injured after armed assailants attacked a jirga in the district.</p>
<p>In March, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895956">16 terrorists</a> were killed while five soldiers were martyred as security forces responded to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895785">terrorist attack</a> on the Bannu Cantonment.</p>
<p>The incident resulted in the deaths of 13 civilians and injured 32 others after ‚Äúsevere destruction‚Äù of a mosque and a residential building due to the suicide blasts, causing the perimeter wall to partially collapse.</p></p>

                <h2>Chinese air chief commends PAF‚Äôs ‚Äòexemplary performance‚Äô during Pak-India conflict</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chinese air force chief Lieutenant General Wang Gang has lauded the ‚Äúexemplary performance‚Äù of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) during the Pakistan-India conflict in May.</p>
<p>As New Delhi launched deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a>, which Islamabad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">denied</a>, PAF <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">downed six</a> Indian jets in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">retaliation</a>. After tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">strikes</a> on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>The praise from Lt Gen Gang came as a high-level defence delegation led by him called on PAF‚Äôs Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu at Air Headquarters in Islamabad, the military‚Äôs media affairs wing said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7346" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLauding the professional acumen and strategic foresight of PAF‚Äôs leadership, the visiting dignitary paid rich tribute to the exemplary performance of Pakistan Air Force during the recent conflict with India,‚Äù the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) stated.</p>

<p>Gen Wang, chief of the People‚Äôs Liberation Army Air Force (Plaaf), praised the ‚Äúdecisive and measured response delivered by PAF pilots under the resolute leadership of the air chief, describing it as a textbook example of precision, discipline and courage in the face of unprovoked aggression‚Äù.</p>
<p>During their meeting, the two air force heads discussed ‚Äúmatters of mutual interest, regional security dynamics and avenues of enhanced bilateral cooperation, particularly in the domain of airpower and operational synergy‚Äù.</p>
<p>During the conflict, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said the PAF <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909332#:~:text=air%20force%20used%20Chinese%20J%2D10C%20jets">used Chinese J-10C jets</a> in its response to India‚Äôs attack. However, China‚Äôs foreign ministry had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909435">said</a> it was ‚Äúnot familiar with the matter‚Äù.</p>
<p>On Monday, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922576/army-chief-dismisses-factually-incorrect-claims-of-external-input-in-operation-bunyanum-marsoos">rejected</a> India‚Äôs insinuation of direct Chinese support to Pak¬≠¬≠i¬≠stan during the May conflict, calling it a ‚Äúshoddy attempt‚Äù by New Delhi to repudiate Pakistan‚Äôs military capabilities.</p>
<p>According to a <em>Reuters</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-helped-pakistan-with-live-inputs-conflict-with-india-indian-army-deputy-2025-07-04/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>, Indian army‚Äôs Deputy Chief Lt Gen Rahul Singh of India‚Äôs army had alleged that China gave Islamabad ‚Äúlive inputs‚Äù on key Indian positions during the conflict and provided ‚Äúall possible support‚Äù.</p>
<p>During the meeting today, Lt Gen Gang also expressed ‚Äúdeep appreciation for the high state of operational readiness and the cutting-edge capabilities‚Äù of the PAF, according to ISPR.</p>
<p>He was ‚Äúparticularly impressed by PAF‚Äôs seamless integration of multi-domain operations, terming it a hallmark of modern air warfare and conveyed Plaaf‚Äôs keen interest in learning from PAF‚Äôs battle-proven experience in multi-domain operations‚Äù.</p>
<p>The Plaaf chief was given a comprehensive briefing on PAF‚Äôs modern force structure, strategic initiatives and the evolution of its operational doctrine, the ISPR statement added.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Air Chief Marshal Sidhu also reaffirmed the ‚Äústrong bond of friendship between the two air forces and reiterated PAF‚Äôs commitment to expanding cooperation in training, technology and operational domains‚Äù.</p>
<p>He extended a gracious welcome to the distinguished guests, reiterating that Pakistan and China enjoy historic and time-tested ties rooted in mutual trust, strategic convergence, and shared aspirations for regional peace and stability.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe meeting stands as a testament to the shared resolve of Pakistan and China to advance their time-tested strategic partnership through deepened cooperation and innovation-driven collaboration,‚Äù the ISPR highlighted.</p>
<p>Last week, the air chief also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921677/air-chief-meets-senior-military-political-leadership-in-landmark-us-visit">met with</a> senior military and political leadership of the United States in the first official visit by a serving PAF air chief in ‚Äúover a decade‚Äù.</p></p>
