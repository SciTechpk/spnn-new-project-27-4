<p>‚ÄúWe are currently launching attacks on several sites in Iran,‚Äù military spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said in a televised press conference following an overnight barrage of missiles and drones launched by Iran.</p>
<p>Defrin later said that Israel‚Äôs ongoing air campaign had created ‚Äúaerial freedom of action‚Äù from western Iran to Tehran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have created aerial freedom of action from west Iran all the way to Tehran‚Ä¶ Tehran is no longer immune,‚Äù he told journalists, adding that the air force ‚Äúlaunched a massive strike involving more than 70 fighter jets, targeting objectives in Tehran‚Äù overnight.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs <em>Tasnim</em> news agency reported that two Revolutionary Guards were killed in an Israeli strike on a base in central Iran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFollowing the brutal attack by the Zionist regime on the Zarandiyeh Basij base, two members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were martyred,‚Äù the news agency said, citing the Guards.</p>
<p>The student-run <em>ISNA</em> network, meanwhile, reportedthat  a police chief and another officer were killed in a drone strike about 300 kilometres west of Tehran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis morning, police chief Major Habibollah Akbarian, along with second lieutenant Amir Hossein Seifi, were martyred by a drone strike in Asadabad city in the western province of Hamedan,‚Äù <em>ISNA</em> reported.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Israeli military said that its air strikes on Iran had killed more than 20 Iranian army and Revolutionary Guards commanders.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSince the beginning of the operation (on Friday), over 20 commanders in the Iranian regime‚Äôs security apparatus have been eliminated,‚Äù the military said in a statement, naming several top commanders in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the armed forces.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs state-owned broadcaster <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/06/14/749816/Iran-air-defense-forces-Iranian-Army-shoot-down-f-35-fighter-jet-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Press TV</a></em> reported that an Israeli F-35 fighter jet had been shot down in the western part of the country on Saturday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIranian Army‚Äôs Public Relations Office said in a statement ‚Ä¶ that its air defence forces had successfully struck and destroyed another F-35 fighter jet belonging to the Israeli regime over the western part of the country,‚Äù the report read.</p>
<p><em>Press TV</em> reported that ‚Äúthe fate of the pilot remains unknown and is currently under investigation‚Äù, adding that more information would be released in due course.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Iranian media reported Israeli strikes in cities in the west and northwest, which house key defences and military bases.</p>
<p>The <em>Fars</em> and <em>Mehr</em> news agencies said the strikes hit the northwestern city of <a class="link--external" href="https://www.mehrnews.com/news/6498987/%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%BA%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%B8-%D8%A7%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tabriz</a> as well as parts of the western provinces of Lorestan, Hamedan, and Kermanshah.</p>
<p>The Tabriz Oil Refinery Company, however, <a class="link--external" href="https://www.mehrnews.com/news/6499724/%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D9%BE%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B4%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B2-%D8%B5%D8%AD%D8%AA-%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D8%AC%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denied</a> reports of any attack or damage to its facilities and said its operational activities are being carried out as usual.</p>
<p><em>Fars</em> said two projectiles hit Tehran‚Äôs Mehrabad airport, and Iranian media said flames were reported there. Close to key Iranian leadership sites, the airport hosts an air force base with fighter jets and transport aircraft.</p>
<p>The <em>Tasnim</em> news agency reported on X that an Israeli drone struck the Hakim Children‚Äôs Hospital in Tehran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA hostile drone launched by the Israeli regime hit Hakim Children‚Äôs Hospital, which is affiliated with Tehran University of Medical Sciences,‚Äù the agency reported, quoting a statement from the university‚Äôs public relations office.</p>

<p>After his country claimed to have struck multiple targets in Iran, Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened that ‚ÄúTehran will burn‚Äù if Iran fired more missiles at Israel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Iranian dictator is turning the citizens of Iran into hostages and bringing about a reality in which they ‚Äî especially the residents of Tehran ‚Äî will pay a heavy price because of the criminal harm to Israeli civilians,‚Äù Katz was quoted as saying in a statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf [Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei continues to fire missiles toward the Israeli home front ‚Äî Tehran will burn.‚Äù</p>
<p>Israel‚Äôs military also said its fighter jets were set to resume striking targets in Tehran, after announcing it had hit air defences in the area of the Iranian capital overnight.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe way to Iran has been paved,‚Äù the military‚Äôs chief of staff and air force chief were quoted as saying in an army statement.</p>

<p>Gen Vahidi said the sites included the Nevatim and Ovda airbases, in which the Israeli regime‚Äôs command and control, as well as the electronic warfare centre, were located. Other sites, he added, included the Tel Nof airbase near Tel Aviv, Israel‚Äôs defence ministry, as well as its industrial and military centres in the capital.</p>

<p>Iran had confirmed that above-ground sections of the Natanz enrichment plant had been destroyed, but the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said radiation levels outside the site ‚Äúremained unchanged‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMost of the damage is on the surface level,‚Äù said Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI) spokesperson Behrouz Kamalvandi.</p>
<p>There was only limited damage to the Fordow and Isfahan nuclear sites, Iran said.</p>
<p>It said that its Fordow nuclear facility sustained limited damage following recent attacks, the semi-official <em>ISNA</em> news agency reported today, citing a spokesperson for the country‚Äôs atomic energy organisation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere has been limited damage to some areas at the Fordow enrichment site,‚Äù Kamalvandi said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe had already moved a significant part of the equipment and materials out, and there was no extensive damage and there are no contamination concerns.‚Äù</p>
<p>However, an Israeli military official claimed the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites were significantly damaged due to Israeli strikes, according to <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>The official said that it would take more than a few weeks for Iran to repair damage at the two sites.</p>
<p>Dozens of people took to the streets of Tehran overnight to cheer their country‚Äôs military response, with some waving national flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans.</p>

<p>After a day of back-and-forth bombardments, Pope Leo appealed on Saturday for authorities in Iran and Israel to act with ‚Äúreason‚Äù after recent airstrikes and to pursue dialogue.</p>
<p>He told an audience in St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica he was following the situation with ‚Äúgreat concern‚Äù. ‚ÄúIn such a delicate moment, I strongly wish to renew an appeal to responsibility and to reason,‚Äù said the pope.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe commitment to building a safer world free from the nuclear threat must be pursued through respectful encounters and sincere dialogue to build a lasting peace, founded on justice, fraternity, and the common good,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo one should ever threaten the existence of another,‚Äù said Leo. ‚ÄúIt is the duty of all countries to support the cause of peace, initiating paths of reconciliation and promoting solutions that guarantee security and dignity for all.‚Äù</p>

<p>US officials said they were helping Israel defend against the missile attacks, even as Washington insisted it had nothing to do with Israel‚Äôs strikes on Iran.</p>

<p>Trump also spoke with Netanyahu on Friday, US officials said, without elaborating.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs missile salvo came hours after Israel said its widespread air raids had killed several top Iranian generals, including most of the senior leadership of the IRGC‚Äô air force.</p>
<p>It had launched several rounds of strikes that hit about 200 targets, including nuclear facilities and air bases.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Iran said the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906722">dialogue</a> with the US over Tehran‚Äôs nuclear programme is ‚Äúunjustifiable‚Äù after Israel‚Äôs biggest-ever military strike against its longstanding enemy, seemingly abandoning <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">planned talks</a> on Sunday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúContinuing Iran-US nuclear talks is unjustifiable while barbarous Israeli attacks persist on the country, Iranian state media quoted Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi as saying on Saturday.</p>
<p>Earlier, Iran‚Äôs foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said that Israel‚Äôs attack on Iran made the talks ‚Äúmeaningless‚Äù, while adding that it was uncertain Iran would attend Sunday‚Äôs round of talks in Oman.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe other side (the US) acted in a way that makes dialogue meaningless. You cannot claim to negotiate and at the same time divide work by allowing the Zionist regime (Israel) to target Iran‚Äôs territory,‚Äù state media quoted foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei as saying on Saturday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is still unclear what decision we will make on Sunday in this regard,‚Äù Baghaei was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>He said Israel ‚Äúsucceeded in influencing‚Äù the diplomatic process and the Israeli attack would not have happened without Washington‚Äôs permission, accusing Washington of supporting the attack.</p>

<p>Iran earlier accused the US of being complicit in Israel‚Äôs attacks, but Washington denied the allegation and told Tehran at the United Nations Security Council that it would be ‚Äúwise‚Äù to negotiate over its nuclear programme.</p>
<p>Tehran said Washington would be ‚Äúresponsible for consequences‚Äù as the US warned Iran not to attack its personnel or interests, stressing that it was not involved in the Israeli attacks.</p>
<p>The conflict raised questions as to whether Sunday‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">sixth round of talks</a> planned between the US and Iran to seek a deal on Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme would go ahead in Oman.</p>
<p>Iran has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a> that its uranium enrichment programme is for anything other than civilian purposes, rejecting allegations from the US and Israel that it is secretly developing nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Netanyahu claimed Israeli intelligence had concluded that Iran was approaching the ‚Äúpoint of no return‚Äù on its nuclear programme. Israel had called for global action after the IAEA accused Iran on Thursday of non-compliance with its obligations.</p>
<p>Iran currently enriches uranium to 60 per cent, far above the 3.67pc limit set by a largely moribund <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1194411">2015 agreement</a> with major powers, but still short of the 90pc threshold needed for a nuclear warhead.</p>

                <h2>Pakistan stands in ‚Äòcomplete solidarity‚Äô with Iran amid conflict with Israel: PM Shehbaz</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday expressed ‚Äúcomplete solidarity‚Äù with Iran amid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/israel-military-says-currently-launching-attacks-on-several-sites-in-iran">heavy exchanges</a> of missiles and airstrikes between Tehran and arch-foe Israel, while former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said that Pakistan cannot afford the conflict in Iran turning into Iraq 2.0 or World War III.</p>
<p>There were reports of new <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/israel-continues-attacks-on-iran-warns-tehran-will-burn-if-it-continues-retaliatory-missile-barrage">Israeli strikes</a> in Iran earlier today as Tel Aviv warned ‚ÄúTehran will burn‚Äù after the Islamic Republic continued its barrage of overnight missiles in response to Israeli <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/tel-aviv-in-smoke-as-iran-launches-missiles-under-operation-true-promise-3-after-day-long-israeli-attacks">onslaught</a> on its nuclear facilities that killed its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916918/who-was-hossein-salami-the-revolutionary-guards-chief-killed-in-israeli-attacks">top generals</a>.</p>
<p>The missile exchange comes a day after nearly 80 people, including top army officers, were killed while civilians were among over 300 wounded in Iran as a result of Israel‚Äôs strikes on military sites and private residences, according to the country‚Äôs UN envoy Amir Saeid Iravani.</p>
<p>According to <em>PTV News</em>, the PM spoke over the phone to Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian, informing him that Pakistan stands in complete solidarity with the ‚Äúbrotherly people of Iran against Israel‚Äôs unprovoked and unjustified aggression‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe (the PM) strongly condemned the Israeli attacks against Iran, which are a violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and a complete violation of the UN Charter and international law,‚Äù the report read. The PM added that Iran has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prime minister condemned Israel‚Äôs provocations and adventurism, calling them a serious threat to regional and global peace and stability,‚Äù <em>PTV News</em> reported. ‚ÄúHe also strongly condemned Israel‚Äôs unabated acts of brutal genocide against the brave Palestinians.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to <em>PTV News</em>, PM Shehbaz urged the international community and the UN to take ‚Äúimmediate and credible steps‚Äù against Israeli aggression, stating that Pakistan is fully committed to promoting peace in the region.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian thanked the PM for Pakistan‚Äôs support, saying that this was a ‚Äúreflection of the close and brotherly relations between the two countries‚Äù.</p>
<p><em>PTV News</em> reported that Pezeshkian apprised PM Shehbaz of Iran‚Äôs perspective on the crisis with Israel and urged the international community, especially Islamic countries, to work together to confront these threats. The two leaders agreed to remain in close contact.</p>

<p>While addressing a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MediaCellPPP/status/1933832480001228826" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press conference</a> in Brussels, Bilawal said, ‚ÄúWe certainly do not want a war on this border (with Iran). Pakistan has condemned the strikes that took place over the last couple of days on our neighbouring country.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will continue to advocate for peace on all our borders. Be it with Afghanistan, be it with Iran, be it with India. We absolutely cannot afford this conflict in Iran to turn into Iraq 2.0 or World War III.‚Äù</p>

<p>He said that it had become ‚Äúfar too easy to have a war every month‚Äù and added that war had become the ‚Äúdefault setting‚Äù that ‚Äúwhenever there is a conflict or dispute, to launch into a full-scale war‚Äù.</p>
<p>Bilawal called on the international community to ‚Äúimmediately impose a ceasefire in this Iranian conflict with occupying forces in Palestine‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe cannot have perpetual war. It serves none of our interests,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Pakis¬≠tan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">launched</a> a broad-based engagement campaign to present its perspective on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914500/indian-military-confirms-fighter-jets-shot-down-by-pakistan">recent conflict</a> with India to the world and counter New Delhi‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">unproven</a> allegations. As part of its global outreach, the team has visited the United States, is currently in London, and will also head to Brussels.</p>
<p>The delegation comprises Ex-FMs Bilawal, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; and Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh¬≠mina Janjua.</p>

<p>Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday said that Pakistan will ‚Äúsafeguard Iran‚Äôs interests‚Äù amid exchanges of missiles between Tehran and Israel, state media <a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/14-06-2025/pakistan-to-safeguard-irans-interests-at-all-intl-forums-defense-minister" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Radio Pakistan</em></a> reported.</p>
<p>Condemning the Israeli attack on Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúneighbour and fraternal country‚Äù during a session of parliament, the defence minister urged that a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) be convened to launch an initiative that ‚Äúmanifests the unity of [the] Muslim Ummah‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan stands firm on its traditional stance, as it has neither recognised Israel nor established relations with it,‚Äù Asif said. ‚ÄúPakistan will safeguard Iran‚Äôs interests at all international fora, including the United Nations.‚Äù</p></p>
