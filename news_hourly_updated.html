                <h2>Govt approves four potential bidders for struggling PIA</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The government said on Tuesday it had approved four parties, including business groups and a military-backed firm, to potentially bid for a stake in debt-ridden Pakistan International Airlines.</p>
<p>The government has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896181">seeking</a> to sell a 51-100 per cent stake in the struggling national airline to raise funds and reform cash-draining, state-owned enterprises as envisaged under a $7 billion International Monetary Fund programme.</p>
<p>It would be the country‚Äôs first major privatisation in nearly two decades.</p>
<p>Among the bidding groups, one is a consortium of major industrial firms Lucky Cement, Hub Power Holdings, Kohat Cement and Metro Ventures.</p>
<p>Another is led by investment firm Arif Habib Corp and includes fertiliser producer Fatima Fertiliser, private education operator The City School, and real estate firm Lake City Holdings.</p>
<p>Additionally, Fauji Fertiliser Company, a military-backed conglomerate, and Pakistani airline Airblue have been approved to bid for PIA.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe pre-qualified parties will now proceed to the buy-side due diligence phase,‚Äù Privatisation Minister Muhammad Ali said in a statement from his ministry.</p>
<p>The review process is set to last two to two-and-a-half months, with final bidding and negotiations anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2025, Ali previously told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>The privatisation ministry also said that the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation approved the transaction structure for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895820">Roosevelt Hotel</a> located in New York, including options for both outright sale and long-term lease.</p>
<p>From the Roosevelt Hotel, Pakistan is expecting over $100 million as a first payment during this year, Ali previously told <em>Reuters</em>.</p></p>

                <h2>Govt announces Independence Day to be celebrated under theme of ‚ÄòMarka-i-Haq‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal on Tuesday said that this year‚Äôs Independence Day would be celebrated under the banner of ‚ÄúMarka-i-Haq‚Äù (Battle of Truth) to demonstrate the nation‚Äôs resilience, progress, and pride.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Army had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">named</a> the period of conflict with India since the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> to the May 10 conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos as ‚ÄúMarka-i-Haq‚Äù in May.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">US-brokered ceasefire</a> for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>Iqbal presided over a preliminary meeting today under the prime minister‚Äôs directions to celebrate this year‚Äôs Independence Day with ‚Äúfull national spirit and renewed resolve‚Äù.</p>
<p>Senior representatives from the Inter-Services Public Relations, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of National Heritage and Culture, Ministry of Education and Professional Training, Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination and other departments participated in the meeting to discuss how to make the day ‚Äútruly reflective of the feelings, aspirations and pride of the people of Pakistan‚Äù, according to a press release.</p>
<p>Iqbal said that this year‚Äôs Independence Day was being dedicated to the theme of ‚ÄúMarka-i-Haq‚Äù to ‚Äúhonour the courage, faith, and resolve of the nation‚Äù.</p>
<p>He said that the celebrations would send a ‚Äúclear message to the world that Pakistan stands proud, strong and committed to its sovereignty‚Äù.</p>
<p>The minister added that at the same time, the government aimed to highlight the steady progress being made in economic recovery, defence resilience and international recognition of the country‚Äôs leadership, financial stabilisation and expertise, showing that Pakistan‚Äôs journey was ‚Äúnot just about survival but about rising to its full potential‚Äù.</p>
<p>While discussing the activities of the scheduled celebrations, the minister emphasised that every sector and official in charge should ensure that all universities and schools observe the day in the same format. The same was advised for provincial celebrations and celebrations abroad in collaboration with the Overseas Ministry.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA robust discussion took place where the committee members shared the planned activities and innovative ideas for celebrations at the federal and provincial levels,‚Äù the press release said, adding that Iqbal said that a comprehensive plan should be developed with budgets.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis year, we are not just commemorating another Independence Day; we are marking a moment of national revival. A moment that reflects the resilience of our people, the resolve of our state, and the rise of Pakistan as a global voice of strength, peace, and purpose. The world has seen that while Pakistan is a peace-loving nation, it will never compromise on its sovereignty. Our recent defence of our territorial integrity showed our maturity, strength, and our determination to protect regional stability without weakness.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe must use this opportunity to honour the spirit of ‚ÄòMarka-i-Haq‚Äô, a defining chapter in our history where our armed forces, our citizens, our government, and every institution stood together. We are also seeing concrete gains across the board: inflation is down, exports are growing, digitisation is transforming governance and innovation is thriving. This is the time to celebrate Pakistan across every field, including military, economic, cultural and scientific and to tell our story to the world with pride and ambition.‚Äù</p>
<p>He emphasised that the celebrations must be unified. ‚ÄúOne voice, one pride from every district, every province and every corner of the globe where Pakistanis live, so the world hears the unmistakable confidence of one nation standing tall.‚Äù</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said while addressing the meeting‚Äôs participants: ‚ÄúThe nation stands as one united, unshaken, and ready to defeat any designs against it. Our civil and military forces are shoulder to shoulder. These celebrations will reiterate to the world what they are already telling us that we are united and strong,‚Äù</p>
<p>Information Minister Ataullah Tarar shared that extensive plans were underway with song competitions, special programming and a documentary. He assured the meeting‚Äôs members that the celebrations would be reflective of the country‚Äôs achievements and ‚Äúcelebrate the global acclaim the country is receiving‚Äù.</p>
<p>The participants shared a range of proposals to ensure that the celebrations reflected the ‚Äúhearts of ordinary Pakistanis and involve everyone‚Äù from the cities to the villages, from students to artists, and from businesses to the diaspora.</p>
<p>Plans were also discussed for national songs, dramas, poetry gatherings, documentaries, cultural fairs, public events, school competitions and global embassy activities, ‚Äúall designed to inspire the nation and tell its story to the world‚Äù.</p></p>
