            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005/12-terrorists-of-indian-proxy-outfits-killed-in-kp-balochistan-engagements-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>12 terrorists of ‘Indian proxy’ outfits killed in KP, Balochistan engagements: ISPR</strong></a>
            <p><p>Twelve terrorists of “Indian proxy” outfits were killed by security forces while two personnel were martyred in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the military’s media wing said on Monday.</p>
<p>The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said the intelligence-based operations (IBOs) were conducted on Saturday and Sunday against the banned militant Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan group in KP and the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Front in Balochistan.</p>
<p>It said an IBO was conducted in Lakki Marwat district during which troops engaged the enemy at its location and sent “five Indian sponsored” terrorists to “hell”.</p>
<p>In a second IBO in Bannu district, two “Indian sponsored” terrorists were “successfully neutralised” by the security forces.</p>
<p>It added that terrorists ambushed a security forces convoy in another incident in North Waziristan district’s general area of Mir Ali, adding that two “Indian sponsored” terrorists were “sent to hell” after the effective response of troops.</p>
<p>“However, during the intense fire exchange, two brave sons of soil, Sepoy Farhad Ali Turi (age: 29 years, resident of Kurram district) and Lance Naik Sabir Afridi (age: 32 years, resident of Kohat district) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced martyrdom.”</p>
<p>The ISPR said sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the areas. “Security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian abetted and prosecuted terrorism perpetrated through their proxies, and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” it concluded.</p>
<p>In the first Balochistan encounter, troops engaged the terrorists at their location in Awaran district’s general area of Gishkur and killed “Indian-sponsored terrorist Younas” in an intense fire exchange, while two more were injured.</p>
<p>“In another engagement in Turbat City, Kech district, security forces successfully neutralised two Indian-sponsored terrorists; terrorist ring leader Sabr Ullah and terrorist Amjad alias Bichoo,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p>It added that weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from the terrorists, who were actively involved in multiple activities against law enforcement agencies and target killing of innocent civilians.</p>
<p>“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any terrorist present in the area, as security forces of Pakistan, in step with the nation, remain determined to thwart attempts by Indian proxies at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan.”</p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari lauded the security forces for the successful operations, terming it a positive step and saying they would continue until the complete elimination of terrorism from the country.</p>
<p>“Our resolve to eliminate terrorist elements and defend the country will remain unwavering,” he was quoted as saying in a statement from the presidency.</p>
<p><em>The Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to security forces for the operations and commended them for their professional expertise and for taking timely action against the “Indian agenda”.</p>
<p>“The Indian conspiracy of putting in danger the life and property of innocent and unarmed citizens in Balochistan by perpetrating terrorism had been exposed,” he added.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz further said, “We will foil the nefarious designs of India to undermine peace and security in Pakistan.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908833">seven soldiers were martyred</a> in a blast from an improvised explosive device planted by the “Indian proxy” terrorist group Balochistan Liberation Army in Kacchi district.</p>
<p>“Nefarious designs of India and its proxies operating on Pakistani soil will be defeated by the valiant security forces, law enforcement agencies and the brave nation of Pakistan,” the ISPR had said.</p>
<p>Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">accused</a> India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.</p>
<p>“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said, using the state-designated term for the banned TTP.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Militant violence and security operations intensified in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901722/militant-attacks-in-march-surged-to-highest-level-since-2014">report</a> by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.</p>
<p>Pakistan ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>

            <p><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Relief Minister Haji Nek Muhammad Dawar on Monday strongly condemned the deaths of three children and injuries to women from an alleged drone strike in the North Waziristan district.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://www.facebook.com/nekmuhammadkhanpti/posts/pfbid0ReuaMTZ5GLzsH5Tz7d2XQiN5uDm8UvwNse1jpFKUaxJz8aEa1FKKujRiiSi7XH54l" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on his Facebook account said the alleged incident occurred in the district’s Hormuz village in Mir Ali tehsil.</p>
<p>“I have already clearly said on the floor of the KP Assembly that all types of operations and war operations should be kept away from civilian populations, so that the common people, especially innocent women and children, are not harmed,” the post read.</p>
<p>He later told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “We will raise our voice at every forum and make every effort to bring those responsible to justice.”</p>
<p>The minister added that he stood with the affected family and would provide them with all possible assistance. He also ordered an immediate investigation and sought a detailed report from the institutions concerned.</p>
<p>No official statement has been issued at the federal level yet or from provincial authorities.</p>
<p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman also addressed the incident in the National Assembly today in the form of “positive advice” for the government.</p>
<p>He said the rulers and the establishment needed to think about giving strength, reassurance and confidence to the nation.</p>
<p>“If today still drones fall in Waziristan […] how will we respond to the people? These are sensitive matters and should be reconsidered. We cannot maintain national unity without thinking about this.”</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Meanwhile, locals began a sit-in in the tehsil’s centre with the bodies. All those who died belonged to one family, they said.</p>
<p>Local tribal leaders termed the incident a “government failure” and said that North Waziristan was being targeted once again. They demanded that an impartial commission be formed immediately to investigate the incident, adding that the sit-in would continue until they were satisfied with the investigation.</p>
<p>Former MNA Mohsin Dawar strongly condemned the alleged strike.</p>
<p>JUI-F leader Hafiz Hamdullah also expressed regret over the alleged incident and criticised the lack of coverage on the issue.</p>
<p>“The media is silent. The federal government is silent. The KP government is silent. Politicians are silent,” he said in a post on X.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911993/after-putin-call-trump-says-russia-and-ukraine-to-start-immediate-talks-on-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>After Putin call, Trump says Russia and Ukraine to start ‘immediate’ talks on ceasefire</strong></a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump said on Monday that Russia and Ukraine “will immediately start negotiations” toward a ceasefire and an end to their three-year-old war, speaking after he held a call with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>“Negotiations between Russia and Ukraine will begin immediately,” Trump said in a Truth Social <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114535693441367601" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> following his call with Putin, which lasted two hours.</p>
<p>After the call, Putin said efforts to end the war were “generally on the right track” and that Moscow was ready to work with Ukraine on a potential peace deal.</p>
<p>“We have agreed with the president of the United States that Russia will propose and is ready to work with the Ukrainian side on a memorandum on a possible future peace accord,” Putin told reporters near the Black Sea resort of Sochi.</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on the statement that talks would begin immediately. A source familiar with the matter earlier said Zelenskiy spoke “for a few minutes” with Trump before the US leader’s call with Putin.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Kyiv has said it is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910311">ready</a> for a ceasefire now, while Moscow has said conditions must be met first.
In his social media post, Trump said the Vatican, “as represented by the Pope, has stated that it would be very interested in hosting the negotiations. Let the process begin!”</p>
<p>Putin and Trump spoke after direct talks last week in Turkiye between Moscow and Kyiv, the first since 2022 in the early months of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Talks last week failed to agree on a truce.</p>
<p>US Vice President JD Vance earlier repeated a warning that Washington could walk away from the peace process.</p>
<p>Putin said the memorandum would define “a number of positions, such as, for example, the principles of settlement, the timing of a possible peace agreement”.</p>
<p>He said that if appropriate agreements were reached, there could be a ceasefire, adding that direct talks between Russia and Ukraine gave “reason to believe that we are generally on the right track”.</p>
<p>“The main thing for us is to eliminate the root causes of this crisis,” Putin said. “We just need to determine the most effective ways to move towards peace.</p>
<p>He thanked Trump for supporting the resumption of direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv and said Trump noted Russia’s support for peace, though the key question was how to move towards peace.</p>
<p>Trump, who has promised to bring a swift end to Europe’s deadliest war since World War Two, has repeatedly called for a ceasefire after three years when Washington joined other Western countries in arming Ukraine.</p>
<p>European leaders have said they want the United States to join them in imposing tough new sanctions on Russia for refusing a ceasefire. The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy spoke to Trump on Sunday ahead of his call with Putin.</p>
<p>Putin was speaking from Russia’s Black Sea resort of Sochi while Trump was in Washington.
Shortly before the call, Vance told reporters that Washington recognised there was “a bit of an impasse here”.</p>
<p>“And I think the president’s going to say to President Putin: ‘Look, are you serious? Are you real about this?’” Vance said as he prepared to depart from a visit to Italy.</p>
<p>“I think, honestly, that President Putin, he doesn’t quite know how to get out of the war,” Vance said.</p>
<p>He said, “It takes two to tango. I know the president’s willing to do that, but if Russia is not willing to do that, then we’re eventually just going to say, ‘This is not our war.’</p>
<p>“We’re going to try to end it, but if we can’t end it, we’re eventually going to say: ‘You know what? That was worth a try, but we’re not doing any more.’”</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Trump wanted to see a ceasefire, but that he had grown “weary and frustrated with both sides of the conflict”.</p>
<p>Asked if a package of secondary sanctions against Russia remains on the table, she said: “I think everything’s on the table.”</p>
<p>Putin, whose forces control a fifth of Ukraine and are advancing, has stood firm on his conditions for ending the war, despite public and private pressure from Trump and repeated warnings from European powers.</p></p>
