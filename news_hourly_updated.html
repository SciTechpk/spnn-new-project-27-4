                <h2>‚ÄòShameless actions‚Äô: Pakistan condemns Israeli ministers storming Al-Aqsa mosque</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan on Monday unequivocally condemned the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem by Israeli ministers, accompanied by settler groups and shielded by Israeli police, calling Tel Aviv out for its ‚Äúshameless actions which are inflaming tensions in Palestine and the wider region.‚Äù</p>
<p>Early on Sunday, Israel‚Äôs far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir led a large group of illegal settlers in a provocative march and mass incursion into the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem, coinciding with the Jewish commemoration of Tisha B‚ÄôAv, <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/far-right-israeli-minister-leads-mass-illegal-settler-incursion-into-al-aqsa-mosque/3649390" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Anadolu Agency</em> reported</a>.</p>
<p>According to the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, at least 1,251 illegal Israeli settlers stormed the mosque compound in the morning hours, performing Talmudic rituals, singing, and dancing under heavy police protection.</p>
<p>Al-Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest site in Islam after Makkah and Madina. Under a delicate decades-old ‚Äústatus quo‚Äù arrangement with Muslim authorities, the Al-Aqsa compound is administered by a Jordanian religious foundation, and Jews can visit but may not pray there.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis sacrilege against one of Islam‚Äôs holiest sites is not only an affront to the faith of over a billion Muslims but also a direct assault on international law and the collective conscience of humanity,‚Äù Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif posted on X.</p>

<p>He said that such systematic provocations by the occupying power, coupled with reckless calls for annexation, imperilled the prospects for peace.</p>
<p>The prime minister said that Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúshameless actions‚Äù were deliberately inflaming tensions in Palestine and the wider region, pushing the Middle East closer to further instability and conflict.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan reiterates its urgent call for an immediate ceasefire, an end to all acts of aggression, and the revival of a credible peace process leading to an independent and viable State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in accordance with international law and relevant UN resolutions,‚Äù PM Shehbaz added.</p>
<p>The Foreign Office also issued a separate statement to condemn the Israeli move.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe presence and statements of senior Israeli officials, and the repugnant declaration that ‚Äòthe Temple Mount is ours,‚Äô are a dangerous and deliberate attempt to provoke religious sentiments across the world, escalate tensions, and alter the status of Al‚ÄëAqsa Mosque,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>It said that Israel‚Äôs expansionist attempts were a deliberate effort to destabilise the region and sabotage any meaningful path to peace.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese provocations risk igniting a catastrophic spiral of violence across the region.‚Äù</p>
<p>The world, it continued, must not remain silent in the face of such systemic, illegal, inhumane, and unlawful aggression. Such actions constitute a blatant violation of international human rights and humanitarian laws, the United Nations Charter, as well as various UN and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Resolutions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe urge the international community, particularly the United Nations, to take immediate and concrete steps to hold Israel accountable for its illegal actions and to protect the religious sanctity of Al‚ÄëAqsa Mosque and the rights of the Palestinian people, in particular the right to self-determination.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan reaffirms its unwavering support for the creation of a sovereign, independent, viable, and contiguous Palestinian State based on pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.‚Äù</p>
<p>Since October 7, 2023, Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed 60,839 and injuring nearly 149,000 Palestinians, per the Palestinian health ministry. Bombardments have also <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-has-destroyed-88-of-gaza-strip-since-oct-7-2023-gaza-media-office/3634914" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">destroyed</a> 88 per cent of the Gaza Strip, according to the Gaza Media Office.</p>
<p>Pakistan has consistently raised its voice for the people of Palestine, calling for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.</p>
<p>Last month, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921570/dont-be-a-bystander-pakistan-tells-unsc">urged</a> the UNSC not to remain ‚Äúa bystander‚Äù amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) on Monday on a one-day visit to review the flood damages from the recent monsoon rains and distribute relief funds to the affected people.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate cha¬≠nge became more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921009/at-least-8-dead-13-injured-in-rain-related-incidents-across-gb-punjab-and-sindh-officials#:~:text=two%20sisters%20died%20after%20being%20swept%20away">late June</a>. Situation worsened when deadly floods <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20so%20far%2C%2010%20fatalities%20and%20four%20injuries%20have%20been%20reported.%20Seven%20deaths%20were%20reported%20from%20Babusar%2C%20two%20from%20Thore%20Valley%20(Dia%C2%ADmer)%20and%20another%20from%20Astore%20district.">10 people</a>, mostly tourists, have lost their lives, with between 10 and 15 tourists still missing.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at Gilgit Airport, GB Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, Chief Minister Gulbar Khan and other officials welcomed the prime minister, <em>PTV News</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1952263870954791012" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>

<p>He chaired a review meeting on the damages caused by the recent rainfall.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz hailed the work of various federal authorities, including the National Disaster Management Authority and the ministries of communication, water, GB, climate change, and international coordination, in assisting with the relief work.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan‚Äôs contribution to global emissions is negligible but despite this, Pakistan is among the top 10 countries that are facing destruction and losses due to global warming,‚Äù the premier noted.</p>
<p>Recalling the devastating 2022 floods, he said, ‚ÄúAfter that, each year such destruction comes in less or greater intensity.‚Äù</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz stressed that he had issued ‚Äúclear‚Äù directives to Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik and his team to work on the matter. He highlighted that Malik has attended various conferences on climate change and secured funds for resilient infrastructure in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Highlighting that the ministry had a key role in ‚Äúmitigating the changes arising from climate change‚Äù across the country, the premier noted that the NDMA was originally established for relief, rescue and rehabilitation work once a disaster strikes.</p>
<p>He recalled that the communication secretary had spent six days in GB as he oversaw the restoration of roads damaged by the rains.</p>
<p>The prime minister vowed to visit GB once the monsoon rains end to lay the foundation stone of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1822414">Daanish School</a> he had promised to the region. ‚ÄúWe will also discuss other development projects with you and decide on them,‚Äù he assured the GB government.</p>
<p>He termed the destruction caused by cloodbursts, whether in Diamer or other areas, as ‚Äúunfortunate‚Äù. He prayed for those who lost their lives and for the speedy recovery of the injured.</p>
<p>The visit comes after PM Shehbaz chaired a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928144">high-level meeting</a> last week to review the monsoon damage, where he reaffirmed the federal government‚Äôs full support for relief and recovery efforts in GB and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).</p>
<p>Kashmir Affairs and GB Minister Amir Muqam, Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik, Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, PM‚Äôs political aide Rana Sanaullah and PM‚Äôs coordinator on GB Shabbir Ahmed Usmani are accompanying the premier.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prime minister will meet with the victims of rains and floods in Gilgit and distribute relief funds,‚Äù <em>PTV</em> said previously.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz will also hold meetings with Governor Shah and CM Gulbar.</p>
<p>In a statement on the occasion, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said, ‚ÄúThe hopes of flood affectees are attached to the prime minister.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGB has faced losses worth more than Rs20 billion due to the worst destruction caused by the floods,‚Äù Faraq highlighted.</p>
<p>As floods and landslides hit GB in late July, CM Gulbar had appe¬≠aled to the federal government for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838">Rs7bn in emergency funds</a> to deal with climate-induced disasters.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCooperation from the federal government plays the role of Oxygen for GB,‚Äù the official said, stressing that ‚Äúhomeless people with wrecked houses and eroding settlements were looking forward to remedies for their wounds‚Äù.</p>
<p>Terming PM Shehbaz‚Äôs visit a ‚Äúgood omen‚Äù, Faraq welcomed the premier to the region.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922323/maximum-temperature-record-shattered-in-gbs-chilas-and-bunji-pmd">heat¬≠¬≠waves</a>, erratic weat¬≠her patterns and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928021">glacial melting</a> have triggered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a> and intense floods across the region.</p>
<p>Five members of a family trapped due to a flood four days ago in GB‚Äôs Ghizer District were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928659/5-family-members-stranded-due-to-floods-in-gb-rescued-after-4-days">rescued today</a>, the region‚Äôs Rescue 1122 said.</p>
<p>Last week, more cloudburst-induced floods hit the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927955/cloudburst-causes-floods-in-ghizer-hunza">Ghizer and Hunza</a> districts.</p>
<p>On Friday, a <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">glacier burst</a> in GB‚Äôs Bagrot Valley led to the death of a 12-year-old boy, while his father was injured. The same day, Rescue 1122 officials said one person was rescued, while three other family members <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928144#:~:text=Tragedies%20mount%20in%20GB">went missing</a> after they had attempted to rescue a man who had jumped into the Ghizer River.</p>
