                <h2>Policeman on polio duty gunned down in Balochistan‚Äôs Noshki</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A policeman guarding a polio vaccination team was gunned down on Tuesday by unknown attackers in Balochistan‚Äôs Noshki district, according to an official.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries where polio <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1883410">remains</a> endemic, and vaccination teams are frequently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1804269">targeted</a> by militants waging a campaign against security forces.</p>
<p>Noshki Deputy Commissioner (DC) Amjad Hussain Soomro confirmed the ‚Äúunfortunate incident‚Äù to <em>Dawn.com</em>, in which Waheed Ahmed was gunned down in Noshki‚Äôs Killi Muhammad Hassni district.</p>
<p>He said that police have set up checkpoints at various places to search for the attackers, who will be arrested soon.</p>
<p>DC Soomro noted that security of the health department staff working on the anti-polio campaign has been further beefed up.</p>
<p>He added that the anti-polio campaign is continuing even after the terrorist incident and the targets given to the anti-polio teams in Noshki district for this national cause will be completed soon.</p>
<p>Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind confirmed that the martyred was a resident of Jalalabad, Noshki.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe polio campaign is a national duty, and any attack on it is intolerable,‚Äù Rind said in a statement, paying tribute to the slain officer who ‚Äúsacrificed himself while on duty‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis attack is a conspiracy to sabotage the national campaign and spread fear and panic,‚Äù Rind added.</p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack in Noshki and offered heartfelt condolences to the family of the bereaved.</p>
<p>He noted that the courage and sacrifice of polio officials ‚Äú[inspires] us all to save our children from this crippling disease.‚Äù</p>
<p>The president reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to fully eradicating polio.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have the tools, the will, and the support of our global partners to make this vision a reality,‚Äù he said in a statement issued today. ‚ÄúI call on parents to open their doors to vaccinators, ensuring every child receives the life-saving polio drops.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI urge teachers, religious leaders, and community elders to champion this noble cause, dispelling myths and building trust. I appeal to the media to amplify the truth: the polio vaccine is safe, effective, and our best weapon.‚Äù</p>
<p>He reiterated his support for his daughter Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, ‚Äúwhose tireless advocacy and efforts has galvanized our nation in this fight against polio‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúToday, I also pay tribute to our brave polio workers, who risk their lives to reach every child, often in the face of grave danger.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe also honour those polio workers and security officials who have made the ultimate sacrifice, losing their lives to cowardly attacks aimed at derailing our efforts to make Pakistan polio-free,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the incident and affirmed that strict action will be taken against militant elements targeting the polio campaign, according to state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/27-05-2025/president-pm-condemn-attack-on-polio-team-in-nushki" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em>.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and said that an attack on the team tasked with securing the safe future of children is intolerable.</p>
<p>Balochistan Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar strongly condemned the incident, describing it as a ‚Äúcowardly and inhumane act.‚Äù</p>
<p>He emphasised that targeting the polio campaign is equivalent to attacking the future of innocent children. While paying tribute to the martyred official, the minister hailed him as a ‚Äúhero of the nation.‚Äù</p>
<p>Kakar warned that any effort to derail the polio campaign would be seen as a direct challenge to the writ of the state, and affirmed that the government will deal with terrorists with an iron fist.</p>
<p>Yesterday, two polio workers were abducted by armed assailants in Tank district while performing their duties in the Dolat Koruna area as part of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913239/pakistan-launches-3rd-anti-polio-drive-of-this-year">ongoing vaccination drive</a> which kicked off on Sunday.</p>

<p>The Pakistan Polio Programme launched the third drive of the year against the crippling disease at the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), Islamabad.</p>

                <h2>India approves stealth fighter programme amid tensions with Pakistan</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>India‚Äôs defence minister has approved a framework for building the country‚Äôs most advanced stealth fighter jet, the defence ministry said on Tuesday, amid a new arms race with Pakistan weeks after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">military conflict</a> between the neighbours.</p>
<p>Indian state-run Aeronautical Development Agency, which is executing the programme, will shortly invite initial interest from defence firms for developing a prototype of the warplane, envisaged as a twin-engine 5th generation fighter, the ministry said.</p>
<p>The project is crucial for the Indian Air Force, whose squadrons of French, Russian and ex-Soviet aircraft have fallen to 31 from an approved strength of 42 at a time when rival China is expanding its air force rapidly.</p>
<p>Pakistan has one of China‚Äôs advanced warplanes, the J-10, in its arsenal, which it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911307">claims</a> to have used to shoot down India‚Äôs latest French Rafale jets in the recent fighting.</p>

<p>Militaries of nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan faced-off in four days of fighting this month, which saw use of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911123">fighter jets</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">missiles</a>, drones and artillery by both sides before a ceasefire was announced by US President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>It was the first time both sides utilised drones at scale and the South Asian powers are now locked in a drones arms race, according to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/india-pakistans-drone-battles-mark-new-arms-race-asia-2025-05-27/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reuters</a></em>‚Äô interviews with 15 people, including security officials, industry executives and analysts in the two countries.</p>
<p>India will partner with a domestic firm for the stealth fighter programme, and companies can bid independently or as a joint venture, the defence ministry said in a statement, adding that the bids would be open for both private and state-owned firms.</p>
<p>In March, an Indian defence committee had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895761">recommended</a> including the private sector in military aircraft manufacturing to shore up the capabilities of the Indian Air Force and reduce the burden on state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, which makes most of India‚Äôs military aircraft.</p>
