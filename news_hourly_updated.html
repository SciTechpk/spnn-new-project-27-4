            <p><p>Six Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel were injured in a ‚Äúterrorist attack‚Äù at a police checkpoint in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Bannu district on Wednesday, a police spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, Spokesperson for the Bannu Police Aamir Khan said, ‚ÄúTerrorists attacked a Frontier Constabulary checkpoint situated in the border area of Takhti Khel in Bannu.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs a result of the attack, six personnel of the FC were injured, but the immediate response of the constabulary forced the terrorists to flee.‚Äù</p>

<p>Spokesperson Khan added that the injured constables have been taken to the Combined Military Hospital in Bannu for treatment.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPolice teams have been sent to the area and have begun a search operation to track down the terrorists,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">surge</a> in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies‚Äô personnel, and security forces.</p>
<p>Attacks increased after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">broke</a> a ceasefire agreement with the government.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP ‚Äî including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat, and Bajaur ‚Äî have seen a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a> reported, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu this month.</p>
<p>A day ago, a police official identified as Constable Hayatullah was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925895/police-constable-martyred-in-bannu-terrorist-attack">martyred</a> when terrorists attacked him in Bannu while he was returning home from duty.</p>
<p>On July 21, over a dozen terrorists <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1925535">attacked</a> a police station in the Bakkakhel town of Bannu. However, the cops responded effectively and thwarted their nefarious plan to take over the building. The police also thwarted a sabotage bid by defusing explosives in the Ghoriwala town of Bannu. An official said the explosives were seized during an intelligence-based operation in the area.</p>
<p>On July 19, two police officials, including an officer, were injured when terrorists carried out a quadcopter <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925051">attack</a> on Bannu‚Äôs Miryan police station.</p></p>

            <p><p>Incarcerated PTI Founder Imran Khan‚Äôs sons met with United States President Donald Trump‚Äôs key aide <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881184">Richard Grenell</a> on Tuesday as they kicked off a campaign calling for their father‚Äôs release from prison.</p>
<p>Imran‚Äôs sons ‚Äî Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim Khan, 26 ‚Äî <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910789">called attention</a> to their father‚Äôs incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Imran, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a> since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831">¬£190 million</a> corruption case and also faces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845818">pending</a> trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.</p>
<p>Grenell, US special presidential envoy for special missions ‚Äî known for publicly calling for Imran‚Äôs release ‚Äî posted on X that he had met with Sulaiman and Kasim in California, urging them to ‚Äústay strong‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere are millions of people around the world who are sick of political prosecutions. You are not alone.‚Äù</p>

<p>Imran‚Äôs sons also met with Dr Asif Mahmood, a Pakistani American physician who has been playing a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1747390#:~:text=Dr%20Asif%20Mahmood%2C%20a%20Pakistani%20American%20physician%20who%20is%20playing%20a%20key%20role%20in%20the%20campaign%20to%20win%20over%20Americans">key role</a> in the PTI‚Äôs campaign to win over Americans.</p>
<p>Dr Mahmood, vice chairman of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), shared a picture showing he also met with Grenell, along with the ex-premier‚Äôs sons.</p>
<p>‚ÄúImmense pride for [Kasim] and Sulaiman Khan for their bravery in fighting for their father, former prime minister Imran Khan‚Äôs freedom,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He also praised Grenell for ‚Äústanding for justice and principle‚Äù and called for unity to free the PTI founder.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Imran‚Äôs sister Aleema Khan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922952/imran-shuns-dialogue-plans-nationwide-protest#:~:text=Ms%20Khan%20said%20that%20Imran%E2%80%99s%20sons%2C%20Qasim%20and%20Suleiman%2C%20will%20go%20to%20the%20US">said</a> the two brothers will go to the US to highlight injustices meted out to their father before coming to Pakistan to become part of a movement calling for the ex-premier‚Äôs release.</p>
<p>Although the government has not officially commented on the matter, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan">told</a> <em>Dawn.com</em> that Article 16 of the Constitution, which grants the right to gather, was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Malik also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923089">said</a> that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals, and that if they ‚Äúviolate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled‚Äù.</p>
<p>There were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan">conflicting</a> statements from PML-N leaders as well on whether the duo would be allowed entry into Pakistan, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they should be allowed to come and ‚Äúcarry out their activities‚Äù, but within the limitations of the law.</p></p>
