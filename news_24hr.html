            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921464/govt-has-decided-to-enhance-water-storage-capacity-due-to-indias-actions-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Govt has decided to enhance water storage capacity due to India’s actions: PM Shehbaz</strong></a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday said that the government has decided to enhance the country’s water storage capacity, given India’s designs to weaponise water.</p>
<p>India in April held the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">abeyance</a> following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence.  The treaty allocates the Indus Basin’s six rivers between the two countries: India gets the eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas, Sutlej), while Pakistan receives nearly 80 per cent of the water from the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab).</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">termed</a> any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.  The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in Hague also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921230">ruled</a> India cannot unilaterally suspend or hold the IWT in abeyance.</p>
<p>During a visit to the National Emergencies Operations Centre today, the prime minister referred to the PCA’s order, emphasising that India had no authority to suspend the IWT unilaterally.</p>
<p>“But the enemy has certain evil designs against Pakistan and wants to take steps against the waters treaty. For that, the government has decided that we will build our water storage.”</p>
<p>He said the government would build a “non-controversial water storage capacity” by utilising resources such as the Diamer Bhasha dam and others.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said there was a clear clause in the 1991 water accord between the provinces to build on water capacity.</p>
<p>“We will build this capacity with our own resources in the next few years. There is a critical role of the National Disaster Management Authority in this.”</p>

<p>The prime minister directed that weather warnings and calamity threats should be regularly issued through phone messages in collaboration with the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority.</p>
<p>The prime minister recounted the disastrous impacts of the catastrophic floods in 2022. He said that Pakistan was unfortunately among the countries on the world map which could be hit by natural disasters such as cloudbursts, even though it had hardly any contribution to the greenhouse effect.</p>
<p>During the year 2022, Pakistan had suffered more than any country in the world, he noted. More than 1,700 lives were lost, vast stretches of farmland were washed away, homes and infrastructure were damaged, and the national exchequer suffered losses of Rs30 billion, according to government estimates.</p>
<p>The prime minister further said that glacial melting due to heat waves also demanded the highest level of preparedness.</p>
<p>“What happened in Swat in which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920723/17-killed-as-rains-wreak-havoc-across-kp">precious lives were lost</a>, engulfed the entire nation in a pall of gloom,” he said and stressed that the stakeholders in the matter should take an honest review of the incident, directing for a formulation of a comprehensive mechanism in collaboration with the provinces to prevent such occurrences in the future.</p>
<p>The prime minister also ordered a report in this regard.</p>
<p>He opined that in the aftermath of the floods of 2022, the relevant ministers negotiated the grants and public-private partnerships for building resilient infrastructure in the country.</p>
<p>The prime minister appreciated the National Emergencies Operations Centre and expressed hope that the relevant authorities would fully utilise the resilient platform for the progress of the country’s economy and social sectors.</p>
<p>He also assured the government’s complete support in strengthening the institute and its capacity building.</p>
<p>The prime minister hoped that the facility would be connected with the provinces and could convey real-time information with interventions such as an early warning system.</p>
<p>During his visit, he was given a briefing by NDMA Chairman Lieutenant General Inam Haider Malik over the current monsoon season, the flood situation and the precautionary measures taken in this regard.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921469/us-senate-approves-divisive-trump-spending-bill' target='_blank'><strong>US Senate approves divisive Trump spending bill</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Republican-led US Senate approved President Donald Trump’s mammoth <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921128">domestic policy bill</a> on Tuesday by the narrowest of margins, despite misgivings over delivering deep welfare cuts and another $3 trillion in national debt.</p>
<p>Republican leaders had struggled to corral support during a record 24-hour “vote-a-rama” amendment session on the Senate floor, as Democrats offered dozens of challenges to the most divisive aspects of the package.</p>
<p>But Senate Majority Leader John Thune was able to turn around wavering moderates to deliver a 50-50 vote, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie.</p>
<p>The sprawling text now heads to the House of Representatives, where it faces unified Democratic opposition and multiple Republicans baulking at the budget-busting costs, as well as slashed health care and food aid programmes for poor Americans.</p>
<p>Trump’s bill proposes a $4.5tr extension of his first-term tax cuts, contentiously offset with $1.2tr in savings mainly targeting the Medicaid health insurance programme, as well as federal food aid.</p>
<p>The health care cuts could see an estimated 12 million low-income and disabled Americans lose coverage.</p>
<p>The package also rolls back billions of dollars in green energy tax credits while providing a $350 billion infusion for border security and Trump’s mass migrant deportation program.</p>
<p>The president made clear that the goal remains to get the bill through the House in the coming days and sign it into law by Friday’s July 4 Independence Day holiday.</p>
<p>“It’s going to get in, it’s going to pass, and we’re going to be very happy,” Trump told reporters ahead of the vote.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#utter-shame" id="utter-shame" title="Permalink"></a>‘Utter shame’</h2>
<p>Polls show the bill is among the most unpopular ever considered, and Democrats hope to leverage public anger ahead of the 2026 midterm elections when they aim to retake the House.</p>
<p>Backed by extensive independent analysis, they say the bill’s tax cuts would disproportionately benefit the wealthy at the expense of social safety net programs for the poorest Americans.</p>
<p>“Today, Senate Republicans betrayed the American people and covered the Senate in utter shame,” said Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Senate Democratic minority.</p>
<p>“In one fell swoop Republicans passed the biggest tax break for billionaires ever seen — paid for by ripping away health care for millions of people and taking food out of the mouths of hungry kids.”</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>A handful of senators in the Republican majority had threatened to upset the apple cart, voicing concerns that the bill would add more than $3.3tr to the nation’s already yawning budget deficits over a decade.</p>
<p>The most high-profile opposition came in the shape of tech billionaire and estranged former Trump aide Elon Musk, who balked at the bill’s debt implications and stripping of clean energy subsidies.</p>
<p>A furious Trump on Tuesday said he would consider <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921414/trump-ramps-up-musk-feud-with-deportation-threat">deporting</a> Musk — whose electric car company Tesla gives him extensive interests in green energy — and ending federal funds for his companies.</p>
<p>“Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,” Trump posted on social media.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#focus-on-house" id="focus-on-house" title="Permalink"></a>Focus on House</h2>
<p>Although the House of Representatives has already passed its own version of the bill, it will have to come back to the lower chamber for a final rubber stamp before it reaches Trump’s desk.</p>
<p>House Republicans were watching anxiously from the sidelines to see if their Senate colleagues would adopt changes that would be hard for Speaker Mike Johnson to sell to his lawmakers.</p>
<p>Fiscal hawks in the lower chamber are furious at what they say is $651bn of extra deficit spending in the Senate’s tweaks.</p>
<p>A House vote could come as early as Wednesday but even with full attendance, House Republicans can only afford to lose three votes.</p>
<p>“The House will work quickly to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill that enacts President Trump’s full America First agenda by the Fourth of July,” Johnson said after the vote.</p>
<p>“The American people gave us a clear mandate, and after four years of Democrat failure, we intend to deliver without delay.”</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921423/jcp-nominates-chief-justices-of-high-courts' target='_blank'><strong>JCP nominates chief justices of high courts</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) on Tuesday appointed the chief justices to the four high courts, a statement issued by the Supreme Court said.</p>
<p>Per the statement, the JCP held four consecutive meetings to make a decision related to the appointments and, by a majority of its total membership in each meeting, opted to allow the acting chief justices to continue serving the top roles.</p>
<p>Letters were subsequently issued to the prime minister’s principal secretary, informing the government about the nominations and requesting the forwarding of the same to the president for their appointment.</p>
<p>The letters said that Justice Sarfraz Dogar was nominated as the new chief justice of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), Justice Rozi Khan Barrech as the chief justice for the Balochistan High Court (BHC), Justice Syed Muhammad Attique Shah for the Peshawar High Court, and Justice Junaid Ghaffar for the Sindh High Court (SHC).</p>
<p>Pre­sident Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921132/president-names-justice-dogar-top-judge-at-ihc">already formally decla­red</a> Justice Dogar the “senior-most judge” of the IHC, following the issuance of a revised seniority list by the Ministry of Law and Justice.</p>
<p>The development followed a ruling by the Supreme Court on June 19, upholding the constitutionality of transferring three judges from other provincial high courts and referring the matter of seniority determination to the president.</p>
<p>On Friday, five IHC judges had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920890">challenged</a> the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the transfer of three judges — Justice Dogar from the LHC, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro from the SHC, and Justice Muhammad Asif from the BHC.</p>
<p>President Zardari had also declared that the status of the transfer of all three judges would be permanent.</p></p>
