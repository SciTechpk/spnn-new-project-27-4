                <h2>COAS Munir back in US to meet senior political and military leadership</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir is undertaking an official visit to the United States and has engaged in high-level interactions with senior political and military leadership, as well as members of the Pakistani diaspora, the military‚Äôs media wing said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The visit comes shortly after he went to the US in June on a five-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917414">official visit</a>, where he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093/trump-coas-munir-talk-counterterrorism-and-trade-in-cordial-meeting-ispr">met</a> with US President Donald Trump over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">luncheon</a>, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.</p>
<p>During the trip in June, Field Marshal Munir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918382">stressed</a> the ‚Äúimmense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect‚Äù with Washington.</p>
<p>Today‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7386" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said: ‚ÄúIn Tampa, COAS attended the Retirement Ceremony of outgoing Commander United States Central Command (Centcom), General Michael E. Kurilla, and the Change of Command Ceremony marking the assumption of command by Admiral Brad Cooper.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCOAS lauded General Kurilla‚Äôs exemplary leadership and his invaluable contributions to strengthening bilateral military cooperation, and extended his best wishes to Admiral Cooper, expressing confidence in continued collaboration to address shared security challenges.</p>
<p>In June, Gen Kurilla hailed Pakistan as a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524/us-centcom-chief-lauds-phenomenal-partner-pakistan-in-counter-terrorism-efforts">phenomenal partner</a>‚Äù in the arena of counter-terrorism, citing their struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State.</p>
<p>The field marshal also met with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine, where matters of mutual professional interest were discussed and Munir extended an invitation to General Caine to visit Pakistan.</p>
<p>The army chief also interacted with the chiefs of defence from friendly nations on the sidelines of the meeting, ISPR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring an interactive session with the Pakistani diaspora, COAS urged them to remain confident in Pakistan‚Äôs bright future and to actively contribute to attracting investments.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe diaspora reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Pakistan‚Äôs progress and development.‚Äù</p></p>

                <h2>Iran offers incentives for joint ventures in Balochistan</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>QUETTA: Iranian Consul General in Quetta Ali Reza Rajaei and President of the Zahidan Chamber of Commerce and Industry Abdul Hakim Regi have invited Balochistan‚Äôs industrialists and business community to launch joint ventures with Iranian investors in Mirjaveh Free Zone.</p>
<p>They said that the Iranian government will extend all facilities and incentives for starting joint ventures with Iranian entrepreneurs and investors.</p>
<p>They extended the offer during a meeting with business leaders and representatives of the Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Small Chamber of Commerce and Small Industries and the Pak-Iran Chamber of Commerce in Quetta on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Iranian officials emphasised that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1928471">achieving</a> the $10 billion bilateral trade target between Pakistan and Iran depends on cooperation. They also congratulated Balochistan‚Äôs business community on the resumption of Quetta-Zahedan flight services via Mashhad.</p>
<p>The Iranian envoy and members of the delegation expressed satisfaction over recent agreements signed between Pakistani and Iranian officials in Islamabad, including plans to expand bilateral trade to $10bn.</p>
<p>They noted that while official agreements are encouraging, their implementation will not be possible without the cooperation of chambers of commerce and the business community. They stressed that Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan may have different geographies but share common economic interests and trade barriers must be removed collectively.</p>
<p>The delegation agreed to the proposal for forming a transport issue resolution committee and encouraged private-sector initiatives to further enhance bilateral trade.</p>
<p>Earlier, Quetta Chamber President Haji Muhammad Ayub Mariani and Vice President Engineer Mir Wais Khan Kakar highlighted the chamber‚Äôs long-standing efforts to promote and strengthen brotherly trade ties with neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>They stressed the need to resolve transport issues and reduce tariffs on imports from each other to boost bilateral trade. They also proposed forming a joint committee ‚Äî comprising chamber representatives, NLC officials and transport ministry authorities from both countries ‚Äî to address cross-border goods transport problems. According to them, resolving these issues would create dignified employment opportunities and improve living standards for people in both nations.</p>
