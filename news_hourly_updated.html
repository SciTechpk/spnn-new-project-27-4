            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met with China‚Äôs President Xi Jinping on Tuesday as he represented Pakistan in a joint call of the foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) member states.</p>
<p>The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. The group‚Äôs foreign ministers meet as a precursor to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1864831">annual summit</a> of its leaders, which will be hosted <a class="link--external" href="https://www.chinadailyasia.com/hk/article/615887" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by China</a> this autumn in Tianjin.</p>
<p>In a post on X today, Dar <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MIshaqDar50/status/1945012596056187239" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>  he was ‚Äúdelighted‚Äù to meet with Xi at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing before the SCO meeting and conveyed the ‚Äúwarm greetings of the leadership, government and people of Pakistan‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs iron-clad brothers and all-weather strategic cooperative partners, we remain committed to deepening Pak-China enduring friendship and advancing shared regional goals,‚Äù he posted on X.</p>

                <h2>UK introduces e-visa for Pakistani students, workers</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The United Kingdom‚Äôs government on Tuesday launched e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù border and immigration system.</p>
<p>The announcement came just a day after the two countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924280/pakistan-uk-ink-accord-to-boost-economic-cooperation">formally signed</a> the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-uk-evisas-for-pakistani-students-and-workers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> today, the British High Commission (BHC) in Islamabad said: ‚ÄúThe UK Government is replacing physical immigration documents for most student and worker visas with a digital proof of immigration status, an e-visa.‚Äù</p>
<p>British High Commissioner Jane Marriott <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/JaneMarriottUK/status/1945002473325752743" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X that the facility was for ‚Äúmost students and workers applying for more than 6 months‚Äù.</p>

<p>An e-visa is an online record of a person‚Äôs immigration permission in the UK and will make the visa process easier and more secure, the BHC noted in its statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúE-visas are tried and tested, with millions of people already using them on select immigration routes,‚Äù it highlighted.</p>
<p>Students and workers who intend to stay in the UK for a period longer than six months will be eligible to apply for the e-visa. The UK government plans to expand the scheme to all visa applications, according to the statement.</p>
<p>In 2024, the UK government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854346">announced</a> that the country‚Äôs immigration system was transitioning to a fully digital format, replacing physical documents with an online immigration system.</p>
<p>The BHC outlined the following eligibility criteria for the e-visa:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students, including short-term study for 11 months</li>
<li>Global Business Mobility routes (specifically, Senior or Specialist Worker, Graduate Trainee, UK Expansion Worker, Service Supplier, Secondment Worker)‚ÄØ‚ÄØ</li>
<li>Global Talent‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ</li>
<li>International Sportsperson‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ</li>
<li>Skilled Worker (including health and care)‚ÄØ‚ÄØ</li>
<li>Temporary Work routes (specifically, Charity Worker, Creative Worker, Government Authorised Exchange, International Agreement, and Religious work routes)‚ÄØ</li>
<li>Youth Mobility Scheme‚ÄØ‚ÄØ</li>
</ul>
<p>Applicants applying as dependents or for visas other than study or work, eg. general visitor visa, will still need a physical visa, the statement noted.</p>
<p>Those with existing in-date physical visas do not need to take any action.</p>
<p>Marriott noted that the changes were set to make the visa process simpler for students and workers. ‚ÄúIt also means applicants can hold onto their passports, saving time,‚Äù she pointed out.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>She clarified that updating from a physical visa to an e-visa will have no impact on a person‚Äôs present immigration status.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHolders can link their travel document (such as passport) to their UKVI (UK Visas and Immigration) account to facilitate straightforward international travel,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>The UKVI ‚Äî introduced in 2024 ‚Äî is an account that visa holders staying in the UK for longer than six months are required to create. It serves as an online record of people‚Äôs immigration status.</p></p>
