            <p><p>G7 leaders on Monday called for “de-escalation” in the Middle East, starting with the Israel-Iran conflict and leading to a Gaza ceasefire, as US President Donald Trump hastily left the group’s summit.</p>
<p>After months of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917469/fact-check-trump-netanyahu-viral-comments-about-pakistan-on-iran-israel-clash-are-fake">attacking</a> Gaza — flattening homes, targeting hospitals, and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912795">starving</a> a besieged population — Israel expanded its assault by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">launching</a> wide-scale air strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences last week, killing top <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">commanders, scientists and civilians.</a>.</p>
<p>Israeli officials have claimed the strikes are part of a broader operation codenamed ‘Rising Lion’ to deter Tehran’s nuclear ambitions, which the latter has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a>, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p>
<p>“We urge that the resolution of the Iranian crisis leads to a broader de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza,” said the G7 <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/statements/2025/06/16/g7-leaders-statement-on-recent-developments-between-israel-and-iran" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joint statement</a> released by Canada.</p>
<p>The statement said that Israel “has a right to defend itself” and stressed “the importance of the protection of civilians,” as the growing attacks kill civilians on both sides.</p>
<p>The leaders of the club of industrial democracies — Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States — stated their conviction that Iran “can never have a nuclear weapon”.</p>
<p>Trump told reporters before his decision was announced to leave early due to  the Middle East situation: “As soon as I leave here, we’re going to be doing something.”</p>
<p>He later stated that his early departure from the summit had “nothing to do with” working on a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, refuting comments by French President Emmanuel Macron, who said the US president made a ceasefire proposal.</p>
<p>Macron “mistakenly said that I left the G7 Summit, in Canada, to go back to D.C. to work on a ‘ceasefire’ between Israel and Iran”, Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114696999897040583" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on his Truth Social platform as he left the moot to return to Washington.</p>
<p>“Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a ceasefire. Much bigger than that,” Trump added in the post.</p>

<p>Macron said earlier today that Trump had made an offer for a ceasefire between Israel and Iran.</p>
<p>“There is indeed an offer to meet and exchange. An offer was made especially to get a ceasefire and to then kick-start broader discussions,” Macron told reporters at the G7.</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly declined to say if the United States would participate in Israeli military action, although he has said Washington was not involved in initial strikes, and the White House said that US forces remained in a defensive posture.</p>
<p>A US official had said Trump would not sign a draft statement from G7 leaders calling for a de-escalation of the conflict. The draft statement had stated Iran must never have a nuclear weapon and that Israel has the right to defend itself.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the US president urged civilians to evacuate Tehran “immediately” amid rising <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917457/iran-state-tv-resumes-programming-after-israeli-attack-on-tehran-trump-reiterates-negotiations">tensions</a> between Israel and Iran.</p>
<p>“Iran should have signed the ‘deal’ I told them to sign. What a shame, and waste of human life. Simply stated, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. I said it over and over again!</p>
<p>“Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!” he <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114695407357588413" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>Separately, Macron called for strikes against civilians in Iran and Israel to end, as he warned against forcing regime change in Tehran, <em>AFP</em> reported.</p>
<p>“If the United States can achieve a ceasefire, that’s a very good thing,” Macron told reporters at the G7 summit in Canada. <em>Fox News</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-requests-nsc-be-prepared-he-returns-early-g7-summit-fox-news-reports-2025-06-17/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> he would convene his National Security Council.</p>
<p>Macron called on both Israel and Iran to “end” strikes against civilians and warned that aiming to overthrow Tehran’s clerical state would be a “strategic error”.</p>
<p>“All who have thought that by bombing from the outside you can save a country in spite of itself have always been mistaken,” he said.</p>

<p>Tensions have escalated since Friday, with more than 224 Iranians killed and over 1,000 injured, most of them civilians. Israel says 24 people have been killed, mostly civilians.</p>
<p>Iranian media soon reported explosions and heavy air defence fire in Tehran early on Tuesday. Air defences were also activated in Natanz, home to key nuclear installations 320km away, the <em>Asriran</em> news website reported. A White House aide said it was not true that the US was attacking Iran.</p>
<p>In Israel, air raid sirens wailed in Tel Aviv after midnight and again early in the morning, when several explosions were heard over the city.</p>
<p>There were two direct impacts from those Iranian missiles — one in the Tel Aviv area and one in Herzliya. Israeli reports are describing the missile strike in Herzliya as having targeted a sensitive site, <em>Al Jazeera</em> reported.</p>
<p>The report added that a sensitive site in code for something of military or strategic significance. The military censor in Israel has updated and further constrained the limitations of media coverage on missile strikes on Israel, so there is very little information.</p>
<p>Israel’s military also claimed that it had killed Ali Shadmani, Iran’s wartime chief of staff and the most senior military commander.</p>
<p>It also said it targeted multiple missile and UAV sites in western Iran, including surface-to-surface missile infrastructure, surface-to-air launchers and drone storage facilities, in a statement accompanied by black-and-white footage showing missile launchers exploding, <em>AFP</em> reported.</p>
<p>Sources told <em>Reuters</em> that Tehran had asked Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia to urge Trump to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to an immediate ceasefire. In return, Iran would show flexibility in nuclear negotiations, according to two Iranian and three regional sources.</p>
<p>US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told <em>Fox News</em> on Tuesday that Trump was still aiming for a nuclear deal with Iran even as hostilities have escalated between Israel and Tehran, while a White House aide said separately that Washington was not attacking Iran.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Hegseth said on <em>Fox News’</em> “Jesse Watters Primetime” show when asked if Trump was still aiming for a nuclear deal with Iran.</p>
<p>“We are postured defensively in the region to be strong in pursuit of a peace deal. And we certainly hope that’s what happens here,” Hegseth said.</p>
<p>“If President Trump is genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/araghchi/status/1934626079676805542" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X.</p>
<p>“Israel must halt its aggression, and absent a total cessation of military aggression against us, our responses will continue.”</p>

<p>Netanyahu told reporters on Monday that Israel was committed to eliminating threats posed by Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, adding, “If this can be achieved in another way—fine. But we gave it a 60-day chance.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1934697728682107058" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joint statement</a>, Pakistan and 19 other countries’ foreign ministers strongly condemned Israel’s recent military attacks against Iran, calling for de-escalation and swift return to negotiations for a sustainable agreement on the Iranian nuclear programme.</p>
<p>The statement was issued by the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Brunei, Chad, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Mauritania, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Turkiye and the United Arab Emirates.</p>

<p>Their top diplomats called for the urgent necessity of establishing a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and other Weapons of Mass Destruction, which should apply to all states in the region without exception, in line with relevant international resolutions. There is also an urgent need for all countries of the Middle East to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), they emphasised.</p>
<p>The foreign ministers highlighted the paramount importance of refraining from targeting nuclear facilities that were under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, in accordance with relevant IAEA resolutions and United Nations Security Council decisions, as such acts constituted a violation of international law and international humanitarian law, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions.</p>
<p>Iran is a party to the NPT, whereas Israel, which is not a party to the NPT, is the only country in the Middle East widely believed to have nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Israel possesses around 90 nuclear warheads, <a class="link--external" href="https://armscontrolcenter.org/countries/israel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to the US-based Centre for Nuclear Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. There are multiple UN resolutions concerning Israel’s nuclear arsenal, including UN General Assembly Resolution 41/93, which urged Tel Aviv to renounce its weapons and place its facilities under IAEA safeguards.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with security concerns growing and Israeli airspace closed because of the war, the Chinese embassy in Israel urged Chinese citizens to leave the country via land border crossings as soon as possible.</p>
<p>India’s foreign ministry said Indian students in Tehran have been moved out of the city for safety in light of the conflict, while others who are “self-sufficient” in terms of transport have been advised to move out too.</p>
<p>“Separately, some Indians have been facilitated to leave Iran through the border with Armenia,” the ministry said.</p>

<p>The Iran-Israel air war — the biggest battle ever between the two longtime enemies — escalated on Monday with Israel targeting Iran’s state broadcaster and uranium enrichment facilities.</p>
<p>IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told the <em>BBC</em> that the Natanz plant sustained extensive damage, likely destroying 15,000 centrifuges, while Iran’s Fordow plant remained largely intact.</p>
<p>Talks between the United States and Iran, hosted by Oman, had been scheduled for June 15 but were scrapped, with Tehran saying it could not negotiate while under attack.</p>
<p>Israel launched its air war with a surprise attack that has killed nearly the entire top echelon of Iran’s military commanders and its leading nuclear scientists. It says it now has control of Iranian airspace and intends to escalate the campaign in coming days.</p>
<p>Trump has consistently said the Israeli assault could end quickly if Iran agreed to US demands that it accept strict curbs to its nuclear programme.</p>
<p>“As I’ve been saying, I think a deal will be signed, or something will happen, but a deal will be signed, and I think Iran is foolish not to sign,” Trump told reporters on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in Canada on Monday.</p>
<p>On Monday, Iran state TV resumed live coverage after Israel’s attack on the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) building.</p>
<p>“The Zionist regime, the enemy of the Iranian nation, minutes ago conducted a military operation against the Islamic Republic of Iran news network”, part of <em>IRIB</em>, said Hassan Abedini, a senior official at the broadcasting service. “The regime (Israel) was unaware of the fact that the voice of the Islamic revolution and the great Iran will not be silenced with a military operation.”</p>
<p>The blast occurred as the presenter was live on TV, lambasting Israel before she was seen leaving the live broadcast, Iranian media reported, sharing a video of the incident. The attack was confirmed by the Israeli defence minister as well.</p>
<p>The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) strongly condemned Israel’s strike on an Iranian state broadcaster and called for an end to the “bloodshed”, <a class="link--external" href="https://aje.io/p8ugy8?update=3779783" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Al Jazeera</em></a> reported.</p>
<p>“CPJ is appalled by Israel’s bombing of Iran’s state TV channel while live on air,” CPJ Regional Director for the Middle East Sara Qudah said.</p>
<p>“Israel’s killing, with impunity, of almost 200 journalists in Gaza has emboldened it to target media elsewhere in the region. This bloodshed must end now.”</p>
<p>Yesterday, Israel’s Haifa-based Bazan Group said all refinery facilities have been shut down after a power station used to produce steam and electricity were significantly damaged in an attack by Iran, according to a regulatory filing.</p>
<p>The group said the Iranian attack resulted in the death of three company employees. The refinery is located in Haifa Bay, according to Israeli media.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917559/punjab-presents-infrastructure-focused-rs533tr-budget' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab presents infrastructure-focused Rs5.33tr budget</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Health, education get major allocations<br />
• Govt employees’ salaries up by 10pc<br />
• Minimum pay raised to Rs40,000<br />
• 50,000 families to get house loans<br />
• Lahore remains priority for development schemes<br />
• Credible plan to boost tax revenues missing</p>
<p>LAHORE: The PML-N government in Punjab on Monday proposed a Rs5.33 trillion annual <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917366/punjab-budget-today">budget</a> for the fiscal year 2025-26, focusing primarily on large infrastructure schemes and freebies for the urban middle classes, especially the youth, as well as small industries and farmers to regain the political ground it had lost in its stronghold in the 2024 election.</p>
<p>The budget features a record Rs1.24tr Annual Dev­elop­ment Programme (ADP), which is Rs240 billion or 25pc greater than the federal Public Sector Development Progr­amme (PSDP), and commits to produce Rs740bn in estimated provincial surplus to meet a key IMF goal to hold down consolidated federal budget deficit.</p>
<p>The Provincial Consoli­dated Fund also includes a one-time income of Rs160bn under the head of ‘supernume­rary resource’ from an undisclosed source. This kind of irregular income is normally used to bridge the budget deficit. In this case, it is speculated to have been added to meet the provincial surplus condition of the IMF programme.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Mian Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman presented the budget in Punjab Assembly.</p>
<p>The budget focuses the social sector with whopping allocations for health, education, infrastructure, local government, public safety and agriculture. Cumulatively, Rs2.61tr has been allocated, including Rs630.5bn, Rs811.8bn and Rs129.8bn for health, education and agriculture, respectively.</p>
<p>The budget, however, does not lay out a credible plan to boost tax revenues, except an incremental increase of 11.4pc to Rs525bn. The budget documents show the government had failed to collect the targeted tax of Rs471bn for the outgoing year as the collection is estimated to face a shortfall of around 10pc due to lower collection of GST on services and immovable urban property tax.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it reveals allocation of a considerable subsidy amounting to Rs165bn in total for various sectors, including Rs10bn, Rs40.8bn, Rs79.5bn and Rs35bn for agriculture, transport, free medicines and Ram­azan Package, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Development plan</strong></p>
<p>The total layout of the budget includes ADP of Rs1.24tr—Rs398bn or 47pc more than the ongoing ADP and Rs240bn more than the PSDP for 2025-26.</p>

<p>Punjab has proposed a 10pc raise in the salary of all government employees (BPS 1-22) and 5pc incre­ase in the pension of the retired employees, which is 2pc less than 7pc incre­ase in pensions as annou­nced in the federal budget. The budget also proposes an increase in the minimum wage from Rs37,000 to Rs40,000 per month.</p>
<p>“We have allocated Rs148bn for education in the wake of development and Rs661bn for the non-development expenditures, which are 127pc and 24.4pc higher than the FY 2024-25,” the finance minister told the lawmakers in the House.</p>
<p>“I am feeling proud to say that, like FY 2024-25, the health sector would also be our priority. For next fiscal year, we have allocated a record Rs128bn, which is 131pc higher than the FY 2024-25. For non-development expenditures, Rs450bn have been allocated, 16pc higher than the FY 2024-25,” he said.</p>
<p>The province expects to receive Rs4tr under the Federal Divisible Pool (FDP). It estimates to collect own-source taxes amounting to Rs524bn, and own-source non-tax receipts of Rs303bn, Rs102bn in capital receipts and recovery of loans, and Rs128bn in foreign project assistance.</p>
<p>On expenditure side, Punjab estimates to spend Rs2.03tr (current expenditures), Rs679bn on service delivery, Rs590bn as capital expenditures, Rs58bn (Food A/C-II), Rs1.2tr (ADP) and Rs740bn as estimated surplus.</p>
<p><strong>Initiatives</strong></p>
<p>The government plans to introduce various initiatives, including continuation of laptop scheme for which over Rs15bn have been allocated.</p>
<p>The major initiatives to be launched in FY 2025-26 in various sectors include Rs101bn in education sector, over Rs72bn for health sector, Rs44.2bn for Social Welfare &amp; PESSI, Rs4.8bn for irrigation, Rs84.5bn for transport and roads, over Rs43bn for agriculture, Rs13bn for forest; wildlife &amp; fisheries and over Rs12bn for energy.</p>
<p>“In 2025-26 FY, Rs15bn will be provided as scholarships to deserving students under the Honhaar Scholarship Programme. Similarly, Rs15bn have been allocated for provision of laptops to the eligible students under CM Punjab laptop scheme during FY 2024-25,” the minister explained.</p>
<p>Talking about the surplus budget amounting to Rs740bn, the minister said: “To maintain the financial discipline under the agreement between the IMF and the federal government, Rs740bn EPS (estimated provincial surplus) has also been included in the budget. However, the provincial surplus’ implementation is subject to the achieving the federal revenue target by the FBR.”</p>
<p>During FY 2025-26, the government plans to continue the “Apni Chat Apna Ghar Programme” under which it has provided houses to 50,000 families by providing Rs48bn interest-free loans payable in 15 years. For next fiscal year, the government has proposed to earmark Rs150bn for this scheme in a bid to provide loans to 50,000 more families for construction of houses.</p>
<p>Another scheme titled “Apni Zameen Apna Ghar” is also under consideration to be launched in the FY 2025-26 to provide plots to deserving people free of cost in 19 districts through balloting.</p>
<p>The government has also increased budget for the solid waste management under Suthra Punjab Programme from Rs120bn to Rs150bn while Rs10bn have been earmarked for the parks and horticulture authorities and ex­­­pansion of water and sa­­nitation agencies to more districts.</p>
<p>Lahore, like the last year, would remain on priority as it would have Rs85bn for several development schemes under Lahore Development Pro­gramme. Following the LDP model, a Rs25bn special programme namely CM Punjab Development Programme has been proposed to be initiated in other cities.</p>

            <p><p>The US Department of Defence on Monday awarded OpenAI a $200 million contract to put generative artificial intelligence (AI) to work for the military.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based OpenAI will “develop prototype frontier AI capabilities to address critical national security challenges in both warfighting and enterprise domains”, according to the department’s posting of awarded contracts.</p>
<p>The programme with the defence department is the first partnership under the startup’s initiative to put AI to work in governments, according to OpenAI.</p>
<p>OpenAI plans to show how cutting-edge AI can vastly improve administrative operations such as how service members get health care and also cyber defenses, the startup said in a post.</p>
<p>All use of AI for the military will be consistent with OpenAI usage guidelines, according to the startup.</p>

<p>Big tech companies are increasingly pitching their tools to the US military, among them Meta, OpenAI and, more predictably, Palantir, the AI defense company founded by Peter Thiel, the conservative tech billionaire who has played a major role in Silicon Valley’s rightward shift.</p>
<p>OpenAI and defense tech startup Anduril Industries late last year announced a partnership to develop and deploy AI solutions “for security missions.”</p>
<p>The alliance brings together OpenAI models and Anduril’s military tech platform to ramp up defenses against aerial drones and other “unmanned aircraft systems”, according to the companies.</p>
<p>“OpenAI builds AI to benefit as many people as possible, and supports US-led efforts to ensure the technology upholds democratic values,” OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said at the time.</p></p>
