            </a>
            <p><p>A bus carrying students was targeted in a blast in Balochistan‚Äôs Khuzdar district on Wednesday morning, leaving three children among five dead, while several others were injured, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn yet another cowardly and ghastly attack planned and orchestrated by terrorist state of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">India</a> and executed by its proxies in Balochistan, innocent school-going children‚Äôs bus was targeted today in Khuzdar,‚Äù a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7297" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by the ISPR reads.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif subsequently reached Quetta later in the day for security briefings and the law and order situation in the province after the talk.</p>
<p>The ISPR said that as per the initial reports, ‚Äúthree innocent children and two adults have embraced martyrdom and multiple children have sustained injuries.‚Äù</p>
<p>It further said that ‚Äúafter having miserably failed in the battlefield, through these most heinous and cowardly such like acts, Indian proxies have been unleashed to spread terror and unrest in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.‚Äù</p>

<p>The statement said that ‚ÄúIndian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians.‚Äù</p>
<p>It noted that India had ‚Äúfailed‚Äù in Pakistan‚Äôs Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent conflict, and its [proxies] were ‚Äúbeing hunted [down] by military and law enforcement agencies‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUse of terrorism as a state policy by [the] Indian political government is abhorrent and reflective of their low morality and disregard of <em>[sic]</em> basic human norms,‚Äù the ISPR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPlanners, abettors and executors of this cowardly Indian sponsored attack will be hunted down and brought to justice and [the] heinous face of India will be exposed in front of the entire world,‚Äù the military vowed.</p>
<p>Pakistan Armed Forces, with the support of the brave Pakistani nation, stand ‚Äúunited to uproot Indian sponsored terrorism from Pakistan in all its manifestations‚Äù, the ISPR said.</p>
<p><em>APP</em> added that PM Shehbaz arrived in Quetta to review the law and order situation in the wake of the incident, accompanied by the defence, interior and information ministers.</p>
<p>The premier will preside over different meetings and briefings during his stay in the city, with a high-level security meeting focusing on the law and order situation in Balochistan also expected.</p>

<p>Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">accused India</a> of activating its ‚Äúassets‚Äù to inte¬≠nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan.</p>
<p>He had detailed the arrest of a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India as ‚Äúirr¬≠e¬≠futable evidence‚Äù of state-sponsored terrorism directed by Ind¬≠ian military personnel.</p>
<p>On Monday, the ISPR said <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005/3-terrorists-of-indian-proxy-blf-killed-in-balochistan-engagements-ispr">12 terrorists</a> of ‚ÄúIndian proxy‚Äù outfits were killed by security forces in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Deputy Commissioner Yasir Iqbal Dashti had told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the blast occurred when the school bus was near the <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/o5j2xJxqzLLkz6mbA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Khuzdar Zero Point</a>.</p>
<p>The bodies and the injured were taken to the Khuzdar CMH, from where the seriously injured would be referred to medical facilities in Quetta and Karachi, the DC said.</p>
<p>Police, the Frontier Corps (FC) and other law enforcement agencies‚Äô personnel have reached the site of the incident to collect evidence for an investigation.</p>
<p>While a probe was underway, the DC said preliminary findings indicated that the attack was a suicide blast.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack on the Khuzdar school bus, describing it as a cowardly act.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe attack on innocent children in a school bus by terrorists working under Indian patronage is a clear proof of their hostility towards education in Balochistan,‚Äù he said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvnews/urdunewsdetail/6772" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>Expressing deep sorrow over the death of the children, PM Shehbaz said that the terrorists have ‚Äúcrossed all limits of barbarity‚Äù, vowing to bring them to their end.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe sympathies of the entire nation, including mine, are with the families of these innocent children, who were victims of the brutality of terrorists.‚Äù</p>
<p>He directed the security forces to bring the perpetrators to justice, and showed support for the armed forces‚Äô resolve to eradicate terrorism from the country.</p>

                <h2>Security forces ‚Äòfalsely implicated‚Äô in North Waziristan incident: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The military‚Äôs media wing on Wednesday said that security forces were ‚Äúfalsely implicated‚Äù in an incident that took place in Mir Ali tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs North Waziristan district, killing four children.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInitial findings have established that this heinous act has been orchestrated and executed by Indian-sponsored <em>Fitna Al Khwarij</em>,‚Äù the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna">using</a> the term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>The statement comes after locals staged a protest in Mir Ali‚Äôs Hurmuz village on Monday against the killing of four children and a woman, allegedly by a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912113/four-kids-killed-in-north-waziristan-strike">drone strike</a>. A day earlier, police said talks with local elders on the matter were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912175">underway</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFollowing a tragic incident on May 19, 2025, in the general area of Mir Ali, North Waziristan district, which regrettably resulted in civilian casualties, unfounded and misleading allegations have been circulated by certain quarters, falsely implicating Pakistan‚Äôs security forces,‚Äù the ISPR statement said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese claims are entirely baseless and are part of a coordinated disinformation campaign aimed at discrediting the security forces‚Äô steadfast efforts in the ongoing counterterrorism operations.‚Äù</p>
<p>It said that a ‚Äúcomprehensive investigation was promptly initiated‚Äù in response to the accusations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is evident that these elements ‚Äî acting at the behest of their Indian masters ‚Äî  continue to exploit civilian areas and vulnerable populations as shields to conduct their reprehensible acts of terrorism. Such tactics aim to unsuccessfully sow discord between the local population and the security forces, who together remain resolute to uproot the menace of terrorism.‚Äù</p>
<p>It further said that security forces reaffirmed ‚Äútheir commitment to ensuring that the perpetrators of this inhuman act are brought to justice.‚Äù</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the protest against the alleged drone strike continued for a second day today.</p>
<p>Allama Iqbal Dawar, a protest organiser and a local PTI leader, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that negotiations with the local administration were still ongoing after the first day and both sides had not yet reached an agreement.</p>
<p>The organisers said that they would take the protest to Islamabad if their demands were not accepted.</p>
<p>Tribal elders also decided to visit villages in the area to seek support for the possible Islamabad demonstration.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>On Monday, the ISPR said <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005">12 terrorists</a> of ‚ÄúIndian proxy‚Äù outfits were killed by security forces while two personnel were martyred in separate engagements in KP and Balochistan.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908833">seven soldiers</a> were martyred in a blast from an improvised explosive device planted by the ‚ÄúIndian proxy‚Äù terrorist group Balochistan Liberation Army in Kacchi district.</p>
<p>Armed operations and air strikes have become routine in the North Waziristan district amid claims of residents that civilians are targeted in the attacks.</p>
<p>About several such incidents, the local population and human rights organisations have argued that these operations lack transparency and are outside the bounds of due legal process.</p>
<p>In March, at least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901160">11 people</a> were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, but officials said was an operation carried out against militants. According to locals, the deceased were civilians, including women and children, working as shepherds.</p>
<p>An alleged drone attack in the Konrai Raghzai area of Upper South Waziristan district <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860946">killed</a> one person and injured three others in September last year. While the local sources confirmed the drone attack, there was no official confirmation of the drone strike.</p></p>
