            <p><p>The federal cabinet has approved the promotion of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir to Field Marshal, the Prime Minister’s office said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The rank of Field Marshal is the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1355171/special-report-the-changing-of-the-guard-1958-1969">highest rank</a> of armies built on the patron of the British Army. General Mohammad Ayub Khan was conferred the rank of Field Marshal by the presidential cabinet.</p>
<p>“The Government of Pakistan has approved the promotion of General Syed Asim Munir (<em>Nishan-e-Imtiaz</em> Military) to the rank of Field Marshal for ensuring the security of the country and defeating the enemy based on the high strategy and courageous leadership of the Battle of Truth, Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos,” the statement said.</p>
<p>The statement further said that COAS Munir led the army “with exemplary courage and determination and coordinated the war strategy and efforts of the armed forces in a comprehensive manner”.</p>

<p>“Thanks to the unparalleled leadership of the Army Chief, Pakistan achieved a historic victory in the war of justice.”</p>
<p>“In recognition of his outstanding military leadership, courage, and bravery, ensuring Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and courageous defence against the enemy, the Cabinet approved the Prime Minister’s proposal to promote General Syed Asim Munir to the rank of Field Marshal.”</p>
<p>The statement added that PM Shehbaz met President Asif Ali Zardari and took him into confidence regarding this decision.</p>
<p>Accepting the honour, COAS Munir said he was grateful to God for receiving the position, dedicating it to the “entire nation, the armed forces of Pakistan, especially the civil and military martyrs and veterans”.</p>
<p>“I am grateful to the president of Pakistan, the prime minister and the cabinet for their trust,” he said in a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), adding that the honour was the trust of the nation, for which “millions of Asims have sacrificed themselves”.</p>
<p>“This is not an individual honour but an honour for the armed forces of Pakistan and the entire nation,” he said.</p>

            <p><p>The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636267">gruesome murder</a> of Noor Mukadam nearly four years ago that had shaken the nation.</p>
<p>After the ruling by the top court, a presidential pardon under <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part3.ch1.html#:~:text=President%27s%20power%20to%20grant%20pardon%2C%20etc." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Article 45</a> of the Constitution could possibly provide Zahir pardon, or reprieve, or remit, suspend or commute his sentence.</p>
<p>Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636764">tortured</a> before being beheaded. Zahir’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810">death sentence</a> by the trial court had already been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1741974">upheld</a> by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).</p>

<p>A three-member bench, led by Justice Hashim Kakar and including Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Ali Baqar Najafi, presided today over the third hearing of Zahir’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1747988/noor-mukadam-murder-zahir-jaffar-approaches-sc-against-ihc-verdict-upholding-death-sentence">appeal</a> against his death sentence.</p>
<p>The bench upheld Zahir’s death sentence handed by two courts previously over the murder charges under Section 302(b) (premeditated murder) of the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.fmu.gov.pk/docs/laws/Pakistan%20Penal%20Code.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pakistan Penal Code</a> (PPC).</p>
<p>However, it converted the IHC’s decision of a second death penalty over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810#:~:text=sentenced%20to%2025%20years%20of%20rigorous%20imprisonment%20along%20with%20a%20fine%20of%20Rs200%2C000%20under%20Section%20376%20(punishment%20for%20rape)%20of%20the%20PPC">rape charges</a> into life sentence . The high court had turned Zahir’s 25 years of rigorous imprisonment under Section 376 of the PPC into a death sentence.</p>
<p>The 10-year jail term for kidnapping in order to murder under Section 364 of the PPC was reduced to one year. The trial court had also imposed a fine of Rs100,000 in February 2022.</p>
<p>The apex court maintained the earlier orders to Zahir to pay Rs0.5 million to Noor’s legal heir.</p>
<p>The appeals of two co-accused — watchman Mohammad Iftikhar and gardener Jan Mohammad — against their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810#:~:text=Iftikhar%20and%20Mohammad%20Jan%2C%20meanwhile%2C%20were%20each%20sentenced%20to%2010%20years%20of%20rigorous%20imprisonment%20and%20a%20fine%20of%20Rs100%2C000">10-year sentences</a> were also taken up by the SC.</p>
<p>The watchman and gardener’s sentences were reduced, with the bench deciding their detention so far was sufficient.</p>
<p>“Therefore, by virtue of that, both will be released,” said Advocate Shah Khawar, the lawyer for Noor’s father, retired diplomat Shaukat Mukadam.</p>

<p>Zahir’s counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, concluded his arguments today, while Khawar also presented his.</p>
<p>A short order on today’s hearing is yet to be issued. It is expected to detail the court’s decision on an appeal by Shaukat against the acquittal of Zahir’s father, Zakir Jaffer.</p>
<p>During the course of the trial, judges made demeaning comments about Mukadam for spending time alone with Jaffar, with Justice Kakar on Tuesday adding that it was “against our values”, according to <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Farzana Bari, a women’s rights activist who attended the hearing, said the comments imply “that the man has some legitimate right to detain her, which is a harmful and regressive notion”.</p>
<p>“Such judicial attitudes contribute to a long and exhausting struggle for justice, often leading victims to lose hope and give up along the way,” she told the outlet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shafaq Zaidi, a childhood friend of Noor, told <em>AFP</em> outside the court: “This is a victory for all the women of Pakistan. It shows that our justice system can deliver justice and should give women more confidence in the legal process.</p>
<p>“This was our last resort, and it’s hard to put into words what this outcome means to us.”</p>
<p>During the previous hearing, the accused’s lawyer contended that no medical board was formed to assess his client’s mental state. Justice Kakar had observed, “A daughter was mercilessly murdered.”</p>
<p>In October last year, Noor’s father had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867225">urged the SC</a> to take up the murder case pending for more than one and a half years in the top court.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#the-hearing" id="the-hearing" title="Permalink"></a>The hearing</h2>
<p>At the outset of the hearing, Zahir’s counsel contended that any evidence against his client “must be beyond doubt”, arguing that the court could not “go beyond the footage presented in the court”.</p>
<p>He said the prosecution presented the footage on a USB at the IHC, but it could not be played.</p>
<p>At this point, a lawyer for the two co-accused presented his arguments briefly. He detailed their sentences, recalling that the watchman and gardener were accused of “stopping the victim from fleeing”.</p>
<p>Justice Najafi observed, “If the suspects had not stopped the victim, then the situation would have been different.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The lawyer asserted that the two co-accused had “no crime other than being present in the house” at the time of the murder.</p>
<p>“What was the need to work more than [what] the salary [is paid for]?” Justice Kakar remarked.</p>
<p>When the hearing resumed in the afternoon after a break, the counsel of Noor’s father presented his stance.</p>
<p>In his arguments, Khawar asserted that all evidence against the accused was part of the case record. “Noor Mukadam was kept in abduction for 40 hours.”</p>
<p>To this, Justice Kakar inquired, “How can you prove it was an abduction? It could be termed unjust confinement.”</p>
<p>Upon Justice Ibrahim asking the counsel to detail the DNA reports, Khawar said the assessments proved the charges. “Blood samples were taken, the report of the dagger also came positive,” he said.</p>
<p>Shaukat’s lawyer then opposed Zahir’s appeal and concluded his arguments.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Here, the state lawyer came to the rostrum and said, “There should be no forgiveness for this heinous crime. This case should be made exemplary.</p>
<p>“The state views this crime very seriously. This is a very sad tragedy and the state wants such criminals be punished as per law.”</p>
<p>Subsequently, the bench annoucned it decision, dismissing Zahir’s appeal and reducing the sentences of his two household staff to what they have served so far.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#case-history" id="case-history" title="Permalink"></a>Case history</h2>
<p>Noor, 27, was found <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636267">murdered</a> at a residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4 on July 20, 2021. An FIR was registered later the same day against Zahir Jaffer, who was arrested at the site of the murder.</p>
<p>In February 2022, a district and sessions judge <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810">sentenced Jaffer to death</a> for the murder and handed him 25 years of rigorous imprisonment, finding him guilty of rape. His household staff, Mohammad Iftikhar and Jan Mohammad — co-accused in the case — were each sentenced to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>Zahir’s parents, leading businessman Zakir Jaffer and Asmat Adamji, had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1651981">indicted</a> by an Islamabad district and sessions court in October 2021 but were later <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810">acquitted</a> by the court.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1640810/noor-mukadam-murder-therapyworks-owner-5-employees-remanded-in-day-long-physical-custody">Six officials</a> of Therapy Works, whose employees had visited the site of the murder before police, were also among those indicted by the lower court but were later freed of the charges along with the parents. According to the challan, the parents and the therapy workers tried to conceal the crime and attempted to destroy the evidence.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In March 2023, the IHC, dismissing Zahir’s <a class="link--external" href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2348054/zahir-jaffer-moves-ihc-challenging-death-sentence-in-noor-case" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appeal</a>, not only <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1741974">upheld the death sentence</a> but also converted his 25-year jail term into another death penalty. The IHC had also rejected the pleas of the main suspect’s staff challenging their conviction.</p>
<p>The next month, Zahir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1747988/noor-mukadam-murder-zahir-jaffar-approaches-sc-against-ihc-verdict-upholding-death-sentence">approached the SC</a> against the IHC verdict, insisting that his conviction resulted from “erroneous appreciation” of the case evidence and that the high court and trial court could not identify the “fundamental flaws” in the FIR.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#brutal-murder" id="brutal-murder" title="Permalink"></a>Brutal murder</h2>
<p>After an FIR was registered in the case and Zahir was arrested, his parents and household staff were also taken into custody by police on July 24, 2021 over allegations of “hiding evidence and being complicit in the crime”. They were made a part of the investigation based on the statement of Noor’s father but were later acquitted.</p>
<p>In his complaint, Shaukat had stated that he had gone to Rawalpindi on July 19 to buy a goat for Eidul Azha, while his wife had gone out to pick up clothes from her tailor. When he had returned home in the evening, the couple found their daughter Noor absent from their house in Islamabad.</p>
<p>They had found her cellphone number switched off and started a search for her. Sometime later, Noor had called her parents to inform them that she was travelling to Lahore with some friends and would return in a day or two, according to the FIR.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The complainant said he had later received a call from Zahir, whose family were their acquaintances. Zahir had informed Shaukat that Noor was not with him, the FIR said.</p>
<p>At around 10pm on July 20, the victim’s father had received a call from Kohsar police station, informing him that Noor had been murdered.</p>
<p>Police had subsequently taken the complainant to Zahir’s house in Sector F-7/4 where he discovered that his “daughter has been brutally murdered with a sharp-edged weapon and beheaded”, according to the FIR.</p>
<p>Shaukat, who identified his daughter’s body, had sought the maximum punishment under the law against Zahir for allegedly murdering his daughter.</p>
<p>Police later said that Zahir had confessed to killing Noor, while his DNA test and fingerprints also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1640762">showed his involvement</a> in the murder.</p>

Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">strongly denied</a> the allegations and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>. As the situation turned into a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military confrontation</a> between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the Indian army claimed that Pakistan had attempted to target the Golden Temple and the attacks were “successfully thwarted”, <em>The Hindu</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pakistans-drone-and-missile-attacks-targeting-the-golden-temple-in-amritsar-were-thwarted-indian-army/article69594333.ece" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The management of the temple was allowed to deploy guns to “counter potential drone and missile threats from Pakistan”, a senior army official <a class="link--external" href="https://aninews.in/news/national/general-news/head-granthi-of-the-golden-temple-allowed-indian-army-to-deploy-guns-to-thwart-pakistani-missile-drone-attacks-on-it-lt-gen-sumer-ivan-dcunha20250519202421/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>ANI</em>. He was quoted as saying, “Fortunately, we visualised what they [Pakistan] were capable of doing … They were more interested in creating confusion, chaos internally, and hence, we visualised that they would target our civil population and our religious places of worship.”</p>
<p>In a statement today, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said, “We categorically reject the allegations that Pakistan attempted to target the Golden Temple, the most revered place in the Sikh faith.</p>
<p>“We hold all places of worship in the highest esteem and cannot think of targeting a holy site like the Golden Temple.”</p>
<p>He said that India had targeted different places of worship in Pakistan on May 6-7, adding that the allegations “cannot shift attention from this unacceptable act”.</p>
<p>The statement further said, “Pakistan is the proud custodian of many holy sites of the Sikh faith. Every year, it welcomes thousands of Sikh pilgrims from across the world.” He highlighted that the country provides visa-free access to the Gurdwara Sahib Kartarpur through the Kartarpur Corridor.</p>
<p>“In that backdrop, any claim concerning Pakistan’s attempt to target the Golden Temple is absolutely baseless and incorrect,” it added.</p>
<p>On Monday, the FO spokesperson <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911985/operation-bunyanum-marsoos-fo-rubbishes-indian-claims-of-pakistan-using-nuclear-capable-missiles">dismissed</a> reports of the Indian media claiming that Pakistan had used nuclear-capable Shaheen missiles. He said that the Indian army deleted the “misleading video” after realising that the claim was “unsubstantiated”.</p>
<p>“These fabricated stories align with New Delhi’s ongoing efforts to promote a misleading narrative regarding the ceasefire and baseless allegations of so-called ‘nuclear blackmail’ by Pakistan.”</p></p>
