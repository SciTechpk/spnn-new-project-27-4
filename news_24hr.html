            <p><p>At least five people, including an assistant commissioner, were killed and 11 others injured on Wednesday in a bomb explosion in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district.</p>
<p>Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafique told <em>Dawn.com</em> that five people were killed in the explosion targeting a government vehicle on Nawagai Road in Siddiqabad railway attack area of Khar tehsil.</p>
<p>Two policeman and a civilian are among the dead, Rafique said.</p>
<p>“The blast was so intense that the vehicle targeted was completely destroyed,” he said, adding that 11 people injured in the blast and were immediately transported to Khar Hospital.</p>
<p>The DPO said that security had been increased in the area and relief activities were underway.</p>
<p>The deceased include Nawagai Assistant Commissioner Faisal Ismail, Tehsildar Abdul Wakil, subedar Noor Hakim, and police constable Rashid.</p>
<p>Health Adviser Ihtisham Ali strongly condemned the blast and expressed grief over the demise of the assistant commissioner and others in the incident.</p>
<p>He contacted the district health officer and the medical superintendent of the DHQ hospital in Bajaur and enquired after the well-being of the people injured in the attack.</p>
<p>“An emergency has been imposed in Bajaur hospitals and health department staff has been alerted for first aid,” he said.</p>
<p>The health adviser assured the pubic that medical assistance will be provided to the injured in the blast.</p>
<p>KP government spokesperson Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif strongly condemned the incident and said the loss of lives was regrettable.</p>
<p>“The KP chief minister has issued orders for an enquiry into the incident and provide medical facilities to the injured, Saif said.</p>
<p>“Those who are hostile elements to the country will not be allowed to succeed in their nefarious purposes, and will be brought to justice.”</p>
<p>KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah also condemned the incident. He directed the district administration and health department to remain on full alert, provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and utilise all available resources to deal with the emergency situation.</p></p>

            <p><p>Bulls continued their reign over the trading floor at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday as shares scaled the 130,000-point barrier to reach a new high.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index opened on a positive note, rising by 1,430.07 points (1.12 per cent) to reach 129,629.49 points at 10:07am, from the previous close of 128,199.42 points.</p>
<p>Shares then rose further to reach 130,344.03 points at 3:30pm, gaining 2,144.61 points (1.67pc) from yesterday.</p>
<p>The PSX extended its record-breaking <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920553">rally</a> for the fourth consecutive session today, which analysts have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921539">attributed</a> to easing inflation and signs of macroeconomic stability.</p>
<p>The annual inflation rate has dropped sharply to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921571/inflation-slumps-to-9-year-low-at-449pc">nine-year low</a> of 4.49 per cent during the fiscal year 2024-25 from 23.41pc in the previous year. Pakistan is currently experiencing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902445">disinflation</a>, which reflects a slowdown in the rate of inflation, as opposed to deflation, which indicates a general decline in overall price levels.</p>
<p>Optimism around fiscal reforms announced in the federal budget also contributed to the rally.</p>
<p>“Continuation of monetary easing due to falling inflation driven by fiscal discipline, strong external account and focus on structural reforms would keep equities in the limelight,” Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, said yesterday.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921539#:~:text=Prime%20Minister%20Shehbaz%20Sharif%20expressed%20gratitude">statement</a>, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif asserted the KSE-100’s record close reflected growing confidence in the government’s economic policies. He described the index’s performance as a testament to the strengthening and stabilising sentiment surrounding the national economy.</p>

            <p><p>Former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Wednesday again extended an olive branch to India, asking the neighbouring country forge a partnership to pursue peace and jointly combat terrorism.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is ready to forge a historic, phenomenal partnership with India to jointly combat terror,” he said while addressing an international conference on ‘Pakistan Fighting War for the World against Terrorism’ at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute.</p>
<p>“Not as adversaries playing a zero sum game but as neighbours who share a moral and civilisational obligation to save a billion souls from the plague of extremism.</p>
<p>“All it requires is from India’s leadership is to step down from the high horse heading in the abyss and pursue peace with Pakistan.”</p>
<p>Bilawal also called on the Indian leadership to resolve all outstanding dispute including the Kashmir and the water crisis.</p>
<p>“Let us resolve <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911132">Kashmir</a> in accordance with the aspirations of the people. Let us end the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915573">weaponisation</a> of water. And instead build peace as mighty as the Himalayas.</p>
<p>“Let us return to our shared traditions grounded not in hatred but the ancient soil of the Indus valley civilisation. It is not weakness to extend a hand. It is wisdom.”</p>
<p>The PPP chairman has been repeatedly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915997">calling</a> for India and Pakistan to engage in a dialogue to establish peace.</p>
<p>Talking today, the former foreign minister said <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075">terrorism</a> is a global crisis that need to be defeated for a sustainable future. He also highlighted the threat of “digital propaganda” in counter extremism.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is not drifting through the storm of terrorism. We are steering the vessel,” he said, adding that the country has rendered tremendous human and economic loss in this war on terror.</p>
<p>“We are still fighting because the alternate is surrender. And surrender is not a word in Pakistan’s dictionary,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>He also highlighted the rise in militant violence over the past year, saying “2024 was the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1882160">deadliest</a> year in a decade in which 685 service members embraced martyrdom in 444 separate attacks”.</p>
<p>Bilawal also noted the efforts made by the armed forces and security personnel in combatting terrorism.</p>
<p>“Over the past two decades, Pakistan’s armed forces backed by iron willed citizens have broken the backs of Al Qaeda networks, dismantled so-called caliphates such as Daesh, and driven the TTP [Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan] from the fortress to the fox hills.”</p>
<p>“Operation Zarb-e-Azab drained the northern swamp, Raddul Fassad uprooted the sleeper cells in our cities and elsewhere. Today operations in Balochistan sever the connection between separatism and foreign funded terror.”</p>
<h1><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#we-saved-kabul" id="we-saved-kabul" title="Permalink"></a>‘We saved Kabul’</h1>
<p>The former foreign minister said Pakistan supported the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, but instead faced a surge in cross-border <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897228">terror attacks</a>.</p>
<p>“Taliban regime was greeted as an inevitable fact. They promised the world stability, they delivered a 40 per cent surge in militant attacks on Pakistani soil, and a sanctuary for the TTP, BLA, Etim, and others.</p>
<p>“We saved Kabul. Sovereignty confers duty. Stop the exodus of fighters, choke the traffic of arms, and honour the blood price of the Doha accord or be judged by the company you keep.”</p>
<p>Bilawal said the world should learn lessons from Pakistan’s experience and achievements as the country requires development as an “antidote” against counter insurgency.</p>
<p>“We need equitable burden sharing. We asked for structured investment in counter terrorism and counter violent extremism, modern technology and weaponry,” he said. “No counter insurgency has achieved victory without first winning hearts and minds.”</p>
<p>He also delivered a message to the “merchant of hate” within the country, saying “there is no constitutional right to weaponise religion.”</p>

<p>“If the world demands we outlaw militias, it must also demand all that people live free from collective punishment.</p>
<p>“From the Kashmir valley to olive orchards of Palestine, the world must deliver a just peace.”</p>
<p>He said the world has changed drastically since India and Pakistan sat across the table in 2012.</p>
<p>“We have fought and won the most expensive counter terrorism campaign in modern history.  After our removal from FATF gray list, Pakistan stands among the most serious counter terrorism states.</p>
<p>“It is time India recognise this transformation, not as a concession but as an opportunity. Terrorism is a collective menace. No border fence, no nationalist rhetoric, no regional hegemony can shield one nation from a fire it may have help light on the other side.”</p>
<p>He stressed that terrorists have no nationality, religion, caste, or creed, and this menace respects no law. He called for collective global efforts to eliminate terrorism.</p></p>
