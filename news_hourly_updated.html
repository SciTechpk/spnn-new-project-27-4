                <h2>3 ‚Äòkey‚Äô TTP terrorists killed in Swat CTD operation: police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Three wanted terrorists and ‚Äúkey operatives‚Äù of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed during a joint operation of the police and the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) in the Barikot tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Swat district on Friday.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP ‚Äî particularly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773/3-terrorists-killed-during-joint-operation-in-kps-bannu-police">Bannu</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923956/one-killed-2-others-injured-in-explosion-in-kps-lakki-marwat-police">Lakki Marwat</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921636">Bajaur</a> ‚Äî have seen a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a> targeting police stations and posts. In response, the state has also intensified its counterterrorism <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925443/9-terrorists-killed-8-captured-in-malakand-joint-action-by-military-leas-during-four-days">operations</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThree wanted terrorists have been killed in Barikot in a major win for Swat CTD. Eliminating the enemies of regional peace, the CTD has killed three important operatives of the <em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em>,‚Äù KP Police said in a statement today.</p>
<p><em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em> is a term the state uses to refer to the banned TTP.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Among the terrorists was Ajmal, also known as Waqas, a resident of Malook Abad who was reportedly involved in at least nine terrorism-related cases. He was also involved in the killing of Village Defence Council members and carried a bounty of Rs2 million.</p>
<p>The second individual was identified as Matiullah, also known by the aliases Ishaq and Junaid, son of Ibrat Shah from Dabb Sar Martung in Shangla district, who was wanted in two terrorism cases.</p>
<p>The third slain terrorist was Rahimullah Rehmani, alias Rohullah, son of Amanullah, a resident of Sheray in Afghanistan‚Äôs Nuristan province. He, too, was wanted in two separate terrorism cases.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe terrorists were involved in attacks on security forces and assassinations of police personnel,‚Äù said the KP police statement. ‚ÄúA network spreading terrorism with external funding was destroyed, and the terrorists were also wanted in improvised explosive device (IED) attacks and extortion cases.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis CTD operation is a blow to the operational wings of <em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em> in Swat and adjacent areas,‚Äù Malakand Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sher Akbar Khan was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúWe are determined to uproot <em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em>.‚Äù</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Speaking to reporters, Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Umar Khan said that search and strike operations against militants would continue across the district. He added that security has been intensified at all entry and exit points of Swat to prevent any possible infiltration of miscreants.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will not allow the peace and stability of Swat to be disturbed at any cost,‚Äù the DPO asserted.</p>
<p>KP Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed praised the regional police and CTD Swat CTD for striking the ‚Äúoperational command wing‚Äù of <em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em>, according to the police statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOperations against terrorists will be further intensified to establish lasting peace and order in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">surge</a> in terrorist activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. Attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies‚Äô personnel, and security forces.</p>
<p>In a series of incidents in KP yesterday, a police official was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926664/cop-martyred-in-karak-attack-on-bannu-police-station-foiled">martyred</a> in the Karak district while police thwarted a separate late-night terrorist assault on a police station in Bannu‚Äôs Basyakhel area.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP‚Äôs Tipu Gul group <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922269">were killed</a> in a joint operation by the CTD and the police in Lakki Marwat. This came nearly a week after the leader of a peace committee and two of his companions <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921018">were shot dead</a> by terrorists in the same district.</p>
<p>Three terrorists <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916076/3-terrorists-killed-one-cop-martyred-in-gun-battle-with-lakki-marwat-police-local-peace-committee">were also killed</a> in Lakki Marwat‚Äôs Kot Kashmir area during a gun battle with the police and local peace committee, in which a cop was martyred as well.</p>
<p>A total of 670 terror incidents were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881856">recorded in 2024</a>, while 212 militants were killed in counter-terrorism operations, according to a report issued by the CTD.</p></p>

            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Foreign minister says Pakistan-US mineral deal to be finalised soon<br />
‚Ä¢ Ex-State Dept official Elizabeth Horst made acting envoy to Pakistan</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday and discussed trade, investment, counterterrorism cooperation and the clash between India and Pakistan in May, according to officials from both countries.</p>
<p>The meeting ‚Äî the first such engagement between the foreign ministers of the two countries in three years ‚Äî is being considered a breakthrough in diplomacy between Pakistan and the US.</p>
<p>On the same day, the US named an acting ambassador in Islamabad.</p>

<p>In Washington, Mr Dar and Secretary Rubio held their first meeting since working together in May to negotiate a ceasefire that ended a dangerous military standoff between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>In a post shared after the meeting, Mr Dar said he discussed bilateral relations with Secretary Rubio.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe reaffirmed our commitment to the long-term Pakistan-US partnership, with renewed focus on economic, trade, investment, IT/AI, and CT [counterterrorism] cooperation.‚Äù</p>

<p>Secretary Rubio, in a separate post, highlighted key economic and strategic aspects of the meeting.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMet with Pakistani Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister today to discuss expanding bilateral trade and enhancing collaboration in the critical minerals sector,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Both leaders mentioned discussions on regional developments, an apparent hint at the India-Pakistan relationship and clashes in May.</p>
<p>Mr Rubio said he thanked FM Dar for ‚Äúpreserving regional stability‚Äù.</p>

<p>In his post, Mr Dar hailed the ‚Äúconstructive role‚Äù played by the US in reaching the ceasefire.</p>
<p>According to a statement issued by the Pakistan embassy in Washington, Mr Dar said the US role ‚Äúhelped avert a potential nuc¬≠lear confrontation and restored calm to a volatile region‚Äù.</p>
<p>The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to regional peace and ongoing counterterrorism cooperation.</p>
<p>Secretary Rubio recognised Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúunparalleled sacrifices‚Äù in the fight against terrorism and described Islamabad as a ‚Äúconstructive actor‚Äù in efforts to ensure regional stability.</p>
<p><strong>Trade and investment</strong></p>
<p>The talks also addressed the future of bilateral trade and investment.</p>
<p>Both delegations ‚Äî led by their respective foreign ministers and joined by senior officials ‚Äî discussed opportunities in agriculture, energy, technology, and critical minerals.</p>
<p>Mr Dar described Pakistan as an ‚Äúattractive destination‚Äù for American investors and voiced optimism about progress in the ongoing trade dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>US engagement in South Asia</strong></p>
<p>Mr Dar and Secretary Rubio also discussed cooperation at various global forums, including the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>The meeting ‚Äúreaffirmed the importance of close coordination at multilateral fora, including at the UN Security Council,‚Äù and exchanged views on ‚Äúkey regional and global developments,‚Äù Mr Dar said.</p>

<p>Later, in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/event/pakistans-foreign-minister-on-tensions-with-india-and-the-future-of-us-ties/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conversation</a> with <em>NBC News</em>‚Äô Dan De Luce at the Atlantic Council, Mr Dar outlined Islamabad‚Äôs regional outlook and addressed pathways for managing India-Pakistan tensions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor peace in South Asia, we need continued US involvement,‚Äù he said, calling for an ‚Äúopen-eyed‚Äù policy that ‚Äúunderstands the risk of disengagement.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mr Dar highlighted the need for ‚Äúa sustainable mechanism for conflict resolution‚Äù in the region, adding that there could be no peace unless India agrees to hold dialogue on all issues, including Kashmir.</p>
<p>He also revealed the US and Pakistan were close to concluding a deal for extracting minerals from Pakistan and an agreement could be finalised in ‚Äúweeks and days, not months.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to a question about former prime minister Imran Khan‚Äôs incarceration, Mr Dar drew a parallel with the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui, who has spent years in a US prison.</p>
<p>He noted that Pakistan did not interfere in that process because ‚Äúthe Americans had followed their judicial system‚Äù.</p>
<p>Similarly, he said, Mr Khan was sentenced by Pakistan‚Äôs judiciary, which followed the due process of law.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen the due process is followed, others do not have the right to interfere,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>When asked if Pakistan would continue to buy weapons from China, Mr Dar said the country would go for whoever offered a better deal.</p>
<p><strong>New US envoy</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the State Department has appointed Elizabeth Horst as the acting US ambassador to Pakistan.</p>
<p>Ms Horst, a senior career diplomat currently serving as the principal deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, has arrived in Pakistan to take charge of her position.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am back in Pakistan (where I started my diplomatic career 20 years ago), this time for a short stint as the acting ambassador,‚Äù she wrote in a social media <a class="link--external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/elizabeth-horst-538b05224_im-back-in-pakistan-where-i-started-my-activity-7354070999417397248-i7Lq?utm_source=li_share&amp;utm_content=feedcontent&amp;utm_medium=g_dt_web&amp;utm_campaign=copy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat a joy to visit one of the most magical places in Punjab, the Lahore Fort. I saw how US support is helping preserve this magnificent monument and demonstrate our long-term partnership. The people-to-people ties and cultural bonds are what underpin our work.‚Äù</p>

<p>Ms Horst‚Äôs appointment, though temporary, is seen as both strategic and symbolic.</p>
<p>Her arrival signals Washington‚Äôs continued interest in maintaining high-level engagement with Islamabad, even as the Biden administration calibrates its broader South Asia policy.</p>
