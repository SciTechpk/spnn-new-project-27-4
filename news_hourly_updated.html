                <h2>11 suspects arrested in Balochistan couple‚Äôs killing, case transferred to serious crimes wing: police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least 11 suspects, including a tribal leader, have been arrested for their alleged involvement in the killing of a man and a woman in Balochistan after a video of the murder went viral on social media, with the case now handed over to the Serious Crimes Investigation Wing (SCIW), police said.</p>
<p>Superintendent of Police (SP) SCIW Syed Saboor Agha told <em>Dawn.com</em>, ‚ÄúEleven people have been arrested, including a tribal leader who issued directives to shoot the couple, and all of them will appear before a judicial magistrate today.‚Äù</p>
<p>The viral video showed a group of men leading a couple out of vehicles and into a desert before gunning them down with pistols and shooting the bodies. Political figures and activists said it was an ‚Äòhonour‚Äô killing incident. On Sunday, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PakSarfrazbugti/status/1946928844923195709" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced on X</a> that he had directed the Balochistan Police to take immediate action, following which one suspect was apprehended.</p>
<p>According to a first information report (FIR) ‚Äî a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em> ‚Äî registered by the Station House Officer (SHO) Naveed Akhtar at Quetta‚Äôs Hanna-Urak Police Station, he lodged the complaint after receiving the video clip that had gone viral on social media, showing a man and a woman being brutally shot and killed by armed individuals.</p>
<p>SHO Akhtar stated that he, along with his team, reached Balochistan‚Äôs Dagari, situated on the outskirts of Quetta and, upon investigation, discovered that the incident occurred three days before Eidul Azha in the area of Sanjidi in Dagari.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe victims seen in the viral video have been identified as Bano Bibi and Ihsanullah,‚Äù the FIR said, naming eight suspects who allegedly shot the couple dead. The FIR also mentioned 15 other unknown suspects involved in the incident.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, SHO Naveed Akhtar said, ‚ÄúOwing to the nature of the murder, the case has now been transferred to the Serious Crime Investigation Wing for further investigation.‚Äù</p>
<p>Prior to being killed, the victims were allegedly taken to a tribal leader, who declared them guilty of being involved in an ‚Äòimmoral relationship‚Äô (locally termed ‚ÄòKaro Kari‚Äô) and ordered their execution, following which they were taken to the [desert] and shot dead, the FIR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe murder was filmed and uploaded to social media to spread fear and panic among the public,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>According to the FIR, a case was registered against the suspects under Sections 302 (murder), 149 (unlawful assembly), 148 (rioting while armed with a deadly weapon), 147 (rioting) of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.</p>
<p>The incident was widely condemned by politicians, civil society activists, and the public, who termed it ‚Äúbarbaric‚Äù and urged the government to take swift action against the perpetrators.</p>
<p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari called the suspects ‚Äúbeasts‚Äù, saying that they deserved no concessions. ‚ÄúI have faith that the criminals involved in this murder will be brought to justice soon,‚Äù he said, according to the state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/domestic/bilawal-condemns-murder-of-couple-in-balochistan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)</a>.</em>  ‚ÄúThis murder should be a test case for the Balochistan government, as it is gender terrorism.‚Äù</p>
<p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif shared the video in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KhawajaMAsif/status/1946923637686284672" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, with a message for the people of Balochistan. Referring to the growing militancy in the province, he said: ‚ÄúThose who have taken up arms against the state ‚Äî start by raising your voice against the unjust system that surrounds you.‚Äù</p>
<p>He continued that the ones responsible for this ‚Äúoppression are your own brothers, not the travellers and labourers from other provinces‚Äù, pointing out the recent bus attack in Balochistan‚Äôs Kalat district, which left three people dead and other similar incidents in the recent past.</p>
<p>PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman also <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/sherryrehman/status/1946955545946337781" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">condemned</a> the murder in a post on X, labelling it an ‚Äúunforgivable crime‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCrushing the right to marry is a violation of fundamental human rights. Killing in the name of tribal decisions is a despicable act. The cycle of brutality in the name of honour must be stopped,‚Äù she wrote.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBy mercilessly killing the married couple, not only have law and justice been insulted, but the authority of the provincial government has also been challenged,‚Äù Rehman added. ‚ÄúThe chapter of oppression and barbarism under the guise of jirgas must be closed.‚Äù</p>
<p>The senator emphasised that the perpetrators must be brought to justice and that legislation to end ‚Äúoutdated customs‚Äù was indispensable.</p>
<p>Baloch activist Sammi Deen Baloch decried the shooting as an ‚Äòhonour‚Äô killing, appealing to Baloch elders to ‚Äúrespect women‚Äôs decisions‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs a woman, this chilling incident is deeply painful and heart-wrenching for me,‚Äù she wrote on X. ‚ÄúKilling any woman in the name of honour is not only a heinous crime but also the worst humiliation of humanity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI appeal to Baloch and Pashtun tribal elders, influential sections of society, and intellectuals to respect women‚Äôs decisions. Today‚Äôs woman is the same woman who is educated, aware, and fully capable of making decisions about her future.‚Äù</p>
<p>She demanded that the killing be investigated transparently and comprehensively so that the suspects would be brought to justice and ‚Äúno one dares to repeat such a barbaric act in the future‚Äù.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849480">‚Äòhonour‚Äô killings</a> continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881836">Data</a> from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‚Äòhonour‚Äô killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‚Äòhonour‚Äô crimes in the country.</p>
<p>The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‚Äòhonour‚Äô.</p></p>

            <p><p>‚Ä¢ KP‚Äôs Malakand and Hazara divisions, parts of Punjab, Sindh likely to receive rain today<br />
‚Ä¢ PDMA says 135 killed in Punjab<br />
‚Ä¢ Medium to high-level flow expected in rivers from tomorrow</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Authorities are bracing for another spell of rain and thunderstorms, which are expected to hit many parts of the country from today (Monday).</p>
<p>According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the Malakand and Hazara divisions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the southern parts of Punjab and Sindh, eastern Balochistan and parts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) are likely to receive rain and thunderstorms with strong winds.</p>
<p>According to the PMD‚Äôs detailed national forecast, Islamabad may receive rain and thunderstorms at night.</p>
<p>In KP, while most districts will stay hot and humid, scattered rain with thunderstorms and gusty winds are expected in Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Malakand, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Kurram, and Waziristan.</p>
<p>Rain and thunderstorms are forecast for urban centres of Punjab in the south, such as Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan, though overall weather of the province will remain partly cloudy and humid.</p>
<p>Later at night, the rain spell is expected to reach Rawal¬≠pindi, Murree, Gali¬≠yat, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Narowal and Lahore.</p>
<p>In Sindh, where the moderate to heavy rain has alre¬≠ady been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925461/six-people-killed-during-widespread-rains-in-most-districts-of-sindh">reported</a> from some parts, several areas are bracing for more precipitation.</p>
<p>The PMD said Mir¬≠purkhas, Mithi, Tharparkar, Badin, Sujawal, Umerkot, Chhachhro, Padidan, Khair¬≠pur, Karachi, Thatta, Ghotki, Chhor, Sukkur, Kashmore, Shikar¬≠pur, Jacobabad, Larkana, Naushahro Feroze, Sanghar, Dadu, Hyderabad, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Matiari, and Shaheed Benazirabad are all expected to receive rain and thunderstorms, with heavy downpours likely in some areas.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>In Balochistan, while most regions will remain hot and humid, the forecast includes rain and thunderstorms for Barkhan, Sibi, Kohlu, Musakhel, Killa Saifullah, Loralai, Dera Bugti, Nasirabad, Zhob, Kalat, Khuzdar, Awaran, and Lasbela.</p>
<p>For Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, partly cloudy weather with rain and thunderstorms is expected, and heavy rainfall is likely at isolated places in Kashmir.</p>
<p><strong>Rivers in high flood</strong></p>
<p>A separate alert from the country‚Äôs  Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) echoed the warning, saying that  ‚Äúmoderate to strong monsoon activity is likely to start‚Äù over the upper catchments of those same rivers after 36 hours.</p>
<p>The division specifically predicted a medium to high-level flow in the Chenab and  Jhelum rivers, along with their associated nullahs and those of the Ravi river, from July 22 to 24.</p>
<p>The Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Sunday released grim statistics, confirming 135 fatalities and 478 injuries across the province from monsoon-related incidents this year.</p>
<p>The casualties included 99 deaths from building collapses, 19 from drowning, 12 from electrocution and five from lightning strikes.</p>
<p>In response to the dire forecast, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia directed all district administrations to remain on high alert for what he termed a ‚Äúdual threat.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are facing dual threats of urban flooding in cities and flash floods in riverine areas,‚Äù Mr Kathia said, warning that heavy precipitation in upper catchment areas could cause dangerous water level rises in the Sutlej, Ravi, Chenab, Jhelum, and Indus rivers between July 22 to 24.</p>
<p>The Punjab government has also activated its compensation policy, providing financial assistance ranging from Rs 1m to Rs 5m to the families of those who lost loved ones.</p>
