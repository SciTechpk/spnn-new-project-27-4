            <p><p>Flooding at Punjab’s Kalabagh on the Indus river reached a “medium” level on Friday, while low-level floods were reported at four other locations on the river due to heavy monsoon rains and glacial melting, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said on Friday.</p>
<p>Rescue operations continued in Punjab after recent deadly rains wreaked havoc on and claimed at least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924761/section-144-imposed-across-punjab-emergency-in-parts-as-rains-claim-dozens-of-lives-in-past-24-hours">63 lives</a> across the province. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has forecasted that five more such spells of rain are expected in the coming days, leading to rising water levels, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-directs-ndma-ministers-for-climate-planning-to-prepare-comprehensive-disaster-management-plans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The next spell is expected to begin from July 21 and last till July 28, while the fifth is expected in the first week of August, the sixth in the second week of August and the seventh in its third week.</p>
<p>“The flow of water in rivers is increasing due to monsoon rains and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660">glacial melting</a>,” a statement issued by the PDMA spokesperson said.</p>
<p>According to the data released by the Met Office’s Flood Forecasting Division at 1pm, there was a medium-level flood at Kalabagh with “steady” water inflow (447,941 cusecs) and outflow (440,391).</p>
<p>There was a low-level flood at Chashma Barrage and Tarbela Dam, as well as at Guddu and Sukkur barrages in Sindh, as of 12pm. While the water inflows and outflows were falling at Tarbela and Guddu, they were rising at Chashma and steady at Sukkur.</p>

<p>From 12:20pm to 1pm, Nishtar Town received the highest amount of rainfall (21mm), with Johar Town following it closely (19mm). The area near Jail Road recorded 6mm of rain; Iqbal Town, Nakhuda Chowk, Lakhshmi Chowk and Gulberg witnessed 5mm each; while Farrukhabad and Pani Wala Talab reported 4mm each.</p>
<p>Upper Mall, Mughalpura and Qurtaba Chowk received “traces” of rainfall, while the Airport area, Tajpura, Gulshan-i-Ravi, and Samanabad did not record any showers during the period.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Section 144 was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924761/section-144-imposed-across-punjab-emergency-in-parts-as-rains-claim-dozens-of-lives-in-past-24-hours">imposed</a> across Punjab along with a state of emergency in several districts as heavy rains triggered flooding and left dozens dead.</p>
<p>This year’s monsoon intensity “is 60–70 per cent higher than last year, and averaging 65 per cent more than anticipated across the region”, NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik was quoted as saying by <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-directs-ndma-ministers-for-climate-planning-to-prepare-comprehensive-disaster-management-plans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">APP</a></em>.</p>
<p>According to the NDMA’s <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndma.gov.pk/sitrepm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>, monsoon rains since June 26 have killed 181 people across the country and injured 491 people.</p>
<p>PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia directed the administration to stay on high alert.</p>
<p>“PDMA Control Room and District Emergency Operation Centres are monitoring the situation 24/7”, said DG Kathia in a statement, urging the public to take necessary precautionary measures, avoid unnecessary travel, and steer clear of electric wires and poles.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, detailing the rescue efforts for floods in Punjab after the province received record rain, he said that “more than 1000 people were rescued along the Potohar plateau, including 398 citizens in Jhelum, 209 in Chakwal, and 450 in Rawalpindi”.</p>
<p>“No loss of life has been reported yet due to anyone getting caught in the floodwater,” the PDMA DG claimed.</p>
<p>The district administration and Pakistan Army personnel participated in the rescue operations, he added. Citizens were evacuated via helicopters in many areas where rescue boats were unable to reach.</p>
<p>DG PDMA stressed that “monsoon rains are predicted to be more than usual this year”, vowing that all resources would be utilised to protect citizens.</p>
<p>Separately, in a statement issued by its spokesperson, Farooq Ahmad, Punjab Rescue 1122 detailed the casualties and damages that occurred due to the recent monsoon rains since June 25.</p>
<p>It said 109 individuals had lost their lives, 438 were severely injured, 307 were given first aid, and 745 people were provided with rescue services.</p>
<p>The Lahore district recorded the most fatalities, with 24 deaths, while 15 died in Faisalabad, 11 in Sheikhupura, 10 in Rawalpindi, eight in Okara, seven in Bahawalnagar, and 34 died in other districts of Punjab.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 stated that most of the casualties occurred in house collapse incidents  — 351 since June 25 — due to dilapidated buildings. It recorded 61 traffic accidents, 22 electrocutions and four lightning incidents, among others.</p>
<p>According to the statement, 15,000 rescue personnel were on high alert across Punjab with 800 boats.</p>
<p>The majority of casualties were recorded in Punjab, the country’s most populous province, with 103 deaths and 385 injuries. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 40 fatalities, Sindh 20, Balochistan 16 and one death each in Azad Kashmir and Islamabad.</p>
<p>Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the NDMA and the climate and planning ministers to engage the provinces for a comprehensive disaster management plan based on the lessons learnt from this year’s devastating rains and cloudburst events.</p></p>

            <p><p>Security forces have foiled an infiltration attempt by terrorists along the Pak-Afghan border and arrested five “alleged suicide bombers”, state-run <em>PTV News</em> reported on Friday.</p>
<p>Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">witnessed</a> an uptick in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>“Pakistani security forces have foiled an infiltration attempt by <em>Khawarij</em> along the Pak-Afghan border,” <em>PTV News</em> reported, citing security sources.</p>
<p><em>Khawarij</em> is a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna">term</a> the state uses to refer to terrorists.</p>
<p><em>PTV</em> said, quoting security sources, that on July 17, at around 5pm, <em>Khawarij</em> tried to cross the border and enter Pakistan, but the forces, on receiving immediate information, set up checkpoints at various places and prevented them from proceeding ahead with their attempt.</p>
<p>“The <em>Khawarij</em> advanced towards Azizkhel and Mandikhel, but due to the heavy presence of security forces, they were forced to take refuge in the mosque in Besikhel, where the forces immediately surrounded them and forced them to surrender,” the state broadcaster said.</p>
<p>All five suspects arrested are Afghan citizens aged between 15 and 18. Three of them also have Afghan identity cards. They have been shifted to an undisclosed location for further interrogation.</p>
<p>Security authorities have issued an alert in the border areas and are continuing search operations to stop potential terrorists, <em>PTV</em> added.</p>
<p>“Security sources say that India is giving full support to the <em>Khawarij</em> separatist movement to fuel terrorism in Pakistan,” <em>PTV News</em> said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, security forces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922232/30-terrorists-killed-as-forces-thwart-border-breach">foiled</a> another infiltration attempt from Afghanistan by an “Indian proxy”, killing at least 30 terrorists in North Waziristan district, ISPR had said.</p>
<p>On July 9, security forces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908178">killed</a> eight militants attempting to infiltrate from Afghanistan into Bajaur district.</p>
<p>Official sources said the militants were killed in Lowi Mamund tehsil after they tried to cross into the district from Afghanistan’s Kunar province.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921445">witnessed</a> a slight overall decline in militant violence during June 2025 despite several high-profile attacks, according to data released by an Islamabad-based think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss).</p>
<p>The monthly security assessment shows there were a total of 78 militant attacks across the country in June, resulting in at least 100 fatalities, including 53 security personnel, 39 civilians, six militants, and two members of peace committees, the organisation said in a press statement.</p></p>

            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir and Libyan Armed Forces’ Commander in Chief Lt Gen Saddam Khalifa Haftar agreed on their countries’ collaboration in the defence industry, the military’s media affairs wing said on Friday.</p>
<p>Lt Gen Haftar called on COAS Munir at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi today, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7355" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>“Both leaders agreed to undertake defence industrial collaboration and exchange of technical expertise to address contemporary security challenges,” the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>It noted that the meeting “encompassed discussion on matters of mutual interest, evolving regional dynamics, security challenges and matters pertaining to defence cooperation”.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival at GHQ, the Libyan armed forces’ chief laid a floral wreath at the Yadgar-i-Shuhada (martyrs’ monument) to pay homage to the martyrs of the Pakistan Army.</p>
<p>“He was offered a warm welcome, followed by guard of honour by a smartly turned-out contingent of the Pakistan Army,” the statement said.</p>
<p>In May, Libya’s capital of Tripoli witnessed the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911108">worst clashes</a> in years after the killing of a major militia leader. The fighting calmed down two days later after the government announced a ceasefire, residents said.</p>
