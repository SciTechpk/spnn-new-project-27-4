            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday tasked PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to present Pakistan’s “case for peace” on the global arena in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as tensions over last month’s Pahalgam attack continued to build up. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting drones</a> sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, for both sides to finally drop their guns as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> was reached. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911473/islamabad-delhi-gained-nothing-but-miseries-from-wars-pm-shehbaz">offered talks</a>.</p>

<p>The military flare-up saw China expressing solid diplomatic support to Pakistan, but there wasn’t a country other than Israel to stand with India without hyphenating it with Pakistan. Reports said a day ago that finding itself friendless in the conflict, India has started taking revenge on countries who helped Islamabad in the recent military flare-up.</p>
<p>Amid the current situation, Bilawal posted on X that he was contacted earlier today by the prime minister who requested that the former top diplomat “lead a delegation to present Pakistan’s case for peace on the international stage”.</p>
<p>Bilawal said he was honoured to accept the responsibility and remained committed to serving the country in “these challenging times”.</p>

<p>The PPP said the committee would also “inform the international community about Indian aggression and its false propaganda”.</p>

<p>The government has yet to share more details on who else would be included in the delegation and which specific countries would be engaged.</p>
<p>In a similar development, the Indian government announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, later this month to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.</p>
<p>“Members of parliament from different parties, prominent political personalities and distinguished diplomats will be part of each delegation,” said a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2129254" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> from India’s Press Information Bureau.</p>
<p>It said the following Indian lawmakers would lead the seven delegations: Indian National Congress’ Shashi Tharoor; Bharatiya Janata Party’s Shankar Prasad and Baijayant Panda; Dravid Munnetra Kazhagam’s Kanimozhi Karunanidhi; Janata Dal-United’s Sanjay Kumar Jha; Nationalist Congress Party’s Supriya Sule and Shiv Sena’s Shrikant Eknath Shinde.</p>
<p>Pakistan has said Britain and other countries, in addition to the United States, played a major role in de-escalating the fighting. Diplomats and analysts say the ceasefire <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911472">remains fragile</a>.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump said after the ceasefire was struck that talks should take place in a third-country venue but no dates or location for the talks have been announced.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#pm-shehbazs-peace-offer" id="pm-shehbazs-peace-offer" title="Permalink"></a>PM Shehbaz’s peace offer</h2>
<p>A day ago, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered India to sit for a comprehensive dialogue to settle contentious issues, including Kashmir and joi­ntly fight terrorism, remi­nding New Delhi that the neighbouring countries fought three wars in the past and gained nothing but miseries of the people.</p>
<p>“After settling disputes like Kashmir and water distribution, we can talk on trade and counter-terrorism as Pakistan is the worst affected country by terrorism which lost 90,000 lives and over $150 billion economic losses,” PM Shehbaz said while addressing a ceremony marking Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanks­giving Day) at Pakistan Monument.</p>
<p>Addressing the ceremony, PM Shehbaz had said, “We have won the war but we want peace. We have taught our enemy a lesson but we condemn aggression. We want this part of the world to be as prosperous and progressive as others through hard work, undying efforts and living like peaceful neighbours.”</p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry have lauded Iran’s peace efforts in the recent Pakistan-India conflict and warned of “forces” seeking to create a rift among the two brotherly countries.</p>
<p>Just two days after India, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">without</a> any evidence, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack">blamed</a> Pakistan over last month’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, Iran had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">offered to mediate</a> between the two as tensions escalated.</p>
<p>A press release from the PM’s Office said the premier had a telephonic conversation with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.</p>
<p>“During their warm and cordial conversation, the prime minister conveyed his warm regards to Supreme Leader Ayatullah Khamenei and thanked President Pezeshkian for Iran’s sincere and brotherly diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions in South Asia. He particularly thanked the president for his telephone call to the prime minister last month as well as for sending Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to the region during the crisis,” the PMO said.</p>
<p>Strongly condemning India’s unprovoked attacks against Pakistan that led to the deaths of innocent civilians, including women and children, PM Shehbaz said the military had given a “responsible, measured yet befitting and forceful reply to the enemy”.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan had always desired peace and it was in this spirit that it had agreed to the ceasefire understanding with India and would remain committed to upholding it. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s firm resolve to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs.</p>
<p>However, PM Shehbaz expressed his concern over India’s attempt to unilaterally hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, which he pointed out was unlawful and constituted a “red line” for Pakistan as these waters were the lifeline for the nation.</p>
<p>“The prime minister emphasised that Jammu and Kashmir dispute remained the root cause of instability in South Asia. He called for its just resolution, in accordance with the UN Security Council’s resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people, as key to enduring peace in the region.</p>
<p>“The president of Iran expressed heartfelt condolences over the loss of civilian lives. He welcomed the ceasefire understanding, while appreciating Pakistan’s efforts for peace. He said Iran was committed to promoting peace and stability in the region,” the PMO said.</p>
<p>It added that two leaders also exchanged views on Pakistan-Iran bilateral relations and agreed to enhance cooperation in all areas of shared interest, especially trade, connectivity, security and people-to-people contacts.</p>
<p>The Iranian president extended an invitation to PM Shehbaz to undertake an official visit to Tehran, which was accepted.</p>

<p>He added: “We should be aware that there are forces in the region that, with the help of external factors, are seeking to create misunderstanding and confusion among brotherly countries in the region and want to create a rift between friends and brothers.”</p>

            <p><p>US President Donald Trump said on Saturday he would speak to the presidents of Russia and Ukraine on Monday following talks between the two sides at which a Ukrainian official said Moscow’s negotiators voiced new demands before a ceasefire could be agreed.</p>
<p>In Moscow, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies preparations were underway for a conversation between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump.</p>
<p>The talks in Turkiye on Friday were the first time the sides had held face-to-face talks since March 2022, weeks after Russia’s full-scale <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676939">invasion</a> of its smaller neighbour.</p>
<p>A senior Ukrainian official familiar with the talks said Russian negotiators demanded Ukraine pull its troops out of all Ukrainian regions claimed by Moscow before they would agree to a ceasefire.</p>
<p>Trump, writing on Truth Social, said he would speak with Putin to discuss stopping the war at 10am on Monday.</p>
<p>“The subjects of the call will be, stopping the ‘bloodbath’ that is killing, on average, more than 5000 Russian and Ukrainian soldiers a week, and trade,” Trump wrote in capital letters.</p>
<p>He said he would speak afterwards with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and various members of Nato.</p>
<p>“Hopefully, it will be a productive day, a ceasefire will take place, and this very violent war, a war that should have never happened, will end.”</p>
<p>Trump had offered to travel to Turkiye for the talks while in the Gulf last week if Putin would also attend, but Putin sent a team of negotiators instead.</p>
<p>The president has been pressuring Putin and Zelenskiy to agree to a ceasefire in the more than three-year-old war.</p>
<p>The Kremlin declined to comment on the terms that Russia had put forward at Friday’s meeting.</p>
<p>The talks lasted only one hour and 40 minutes and yielded an agreement to trade 1,000 prisoners of war on each side.</p>
<p>The two countries have not specified when that would happen.</p>
<p>Zelenskiy called on Saturday for stronger sanctions on Moscow after a Russian drone killed nine bus passengers in the Sumy region of northeastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>“This was a deliberate killing of civilians,” he said.</p>
<p>“Pressure must be exerted on Russia to stop the killings. Without tougher sanctions, without stronger pressure, Russia will not seek real diplomacy.”</p>
<p>Russia, which denies targeting civilians, said it struck a military target in Sumy. Its defence ministry said Russian troops had captured another settlement in eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke by telephone with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and said he welcomed the “positive role” of the United States in helping to secure a resumption of talks between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>A Russian foreign ministry statement quoted Lavrov as saying contacts would continue.</p>
<p>The US State Department said that during the conversation, Rubio welcomed the prisoner exchange agreement and emphasised Trump’s call for an immediate ceasefire.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#pressing-for-immediate-ceasefire" id="pressing-for-immediate-ceasefire" title="Permalink"></a>Pressing for immediate ceasefire</h2>
<p>Ukraine and Western governments, including the US, have demanded that Russia agree to an immediate, unconditional <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910171/ukraines-allies-set-ultimatum-for-30-day-ceasefire-in-ukraine">ceasefire</a> lasting at least 30 days.</p>
<p>But the Ukrainian source said Moscow’s negotiators had demanded the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, with a ceasefire to take place only after that.</p>
<p>The source said that and other demands went beyond the terms of a draft peace deal that the United States proposed last month after consultations with Moscow.</p>
<p>Peskov declined to comment on the Ukrainian account, saying talks should be conducted “absolutely behind closed doors”.</p>
<p>He said the next steps would be to carry out the prisoner exchange and conduct further work between the two sides.</p>
<p>Peskov said it was possible that Putin could meet Zelenskiy, but only if “certain agreements” were reached, which he did not specify.</p>
<p>Zelenskiy had challenged Putin earlier in the week to meet him in person, an offer the Russian leader <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911300/breakthrough-unlikely-as-putin-declines-to-meet-zelensky-in-turkiye">ignored</a>.</p>
<p>Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said his country, after hosting the talks, was resolved to continue its mediation role.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#ukraine-rallies-support" id="ukraine-rallies-support" title="Permalink"></a>Ukraine rallies support</h2>
<p>After Friday’s meeting, Ukraine began <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911420/ukraine-calls-on-allies-to-keep-pressure-on-russia-after-talks-yield-no-ceasefire">rallying support</a> from its allies to take tougher action against Moscow.</p>
<p>“Once again, Russia is not serious,” British Foreign Secretary David Lammy told <em>Reuters</em> during a visit to Pakistan.</p>
<p>“At what point do we say to Putin, enough is enough?”</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron also said the talks in Istanbul had been fruitless.</p>
<p>“Today, what do we have? Nothing. And so I tell you, faced with President Putin’s cynicism, I am sure that President Trump, mindful of the credibility of the United States, will react.”</p>
<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was working on a new package of sanctions against Moscow, which France said this week should aim to “suffocate” the Russian economy.</p>
<p>But after intensifying sanctions for more than three years already, it is unclear how much more they can achieve.</p>
<p>In their efforts to forge a united front and make Putin accept a ceasefire, Ukraine and its European leaders have been repeatedly thrown off balance by interventions from Trump.</p>
<p>Having told Zelenskiy to accept Russia’s offer of direct talks in Turkiye, Trump said on the eve of the meeting that there could be no movement on peace until he had met with Putin.</p>
<p>The Kremlin says Putin is ready to meet Trump, but such a summit must be carefully prepared. It said there had been no contact between Russia and the US since Friday’s talks.</p></p>
