            <p><p>Two people were killed and at least 11 were injured after an explosion ripped through a market in Balochistan’s Qila Abdullah district on Sunday evening, officials said.</p>
<p>Deputy Commissioner Qila Abdullah Riyaz Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “Two people were killed while 11 were injured in the explosion.”</p>
<p>According to the initial investigation, the explosives were planted in a vehicle, DC Khan said, adding that the bomb disposal squad and law enforcement officials were summoned and an investigation was launched.</p>
<p>“An emergency was declared at the District Health Headquarters in Qila Abdullah, where medical assistance was being provided to the injured,” he said.</p>
<p>In a separate statement given to <em>Dawn.com</em>, Qila Abdullah Levies Risaldar Gulab Khan said, “The blast took place near the Abdul Jabbar Market in the Gulistan area of Qila Abdullah district, resulting in the death of two people and injuries to 11 others.</p>
<p>“After the explosion, Levies personnel and people present at the scene immediately rescued the injured, who were then moved to the District Health Headquarters Chaman for treatment.”</p>
<p>According to the official, officers began an investigation after collecting evidence from the scene.</p>
<p>Condemning the blast, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said he shared the grief of the families of the deceased.</p>
<p>“The war against terrorism is undoubtedly a war of national security,” CM Bugti said in a statement, adding war against terrorism will continue until the last terrorist is eliminated.</p>
<p>“The elements involved in the Gulistan blast will be brought to an end soon,” he added.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind said security forces were present at the spot, the area was being cordoned off, and evidence was being collected.</p>
<p>“The state is taking steps to protect the people by utilising all resources,” Rind said.</p>
<p>The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897969">Balochistan Liberation Army</a>, in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.</p>
<p>In March, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419/jaffar-express-hijacking-state-media-reports-190-rescued-2nd-day-of-operation-underway-in-balochistan">Jaffar Express train</a> was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area, resulting in the deaths of 26 hostages, including 18 security personnel. Five more security personnel were martyred during the operation.</p></p>

            <p><p>A child lost his life, while 11 others were injured in different areas of Khyber Pakhtunkwa after trees and signboards fell due to strong winds and storms, officials said.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmad Faizi said, “A storm hit several KP areas, including Charsadda, Nowshera, Peshawar and Mardan on Sunday evening.”</p>
<p>The storm also hit parts of the capital Islamabad.</p>
<p>Faizi said a 10-year-old boy, Mohammad Hamad, died when a wall of a house collapsed in the Najib Abad area of Charsadda, adding that the injured were moved to the respective areas’ hospitals.</p>
<p>Due to the storm, the electricity supply was suspended in many areas of the city, due to which citizens had to face severe difficulties, he said.</p>
<p>He said that the Disaster Response Team of Rescue 1122 was immediately dispatched to the affected areas and work was underway to remove fallen trees from the roads.</p>
<p>At least three people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904713">killed</a> in Rawalpindi and Gujar Khan last month after an intense hailstorm, accompanied by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904758">heavy rain</a> and gusty winds, battered the region.</p>
<p>Heavy hailstorms <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904643">struck</a> Islamabad and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, causing widespread damage to vehicles, windscreens, and solar panels, while also triggering flash floods following intense rainfall.</p></p>

            <p><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has said Pakistan “will never bow down to Indian hegemony” as the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> with India holds.</p>
<p>“The truth is that India is not the US and Pakistan is not Afghanistan. India is not Israel and Pakistan is not Palestine. Pakistan will never be deterred. It can never be coerced.</p>
<p>“We will never bow down to Indian hegemony. The sooner they realise this, the better it will be for regional peace and the world,” Lt Gen Chaudhry <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/dunya/pakistan-ordu-sozcusu-chaudhry-aaya-konustu-asla-hint-hegemonyasina-boyun-egmeyecegiz/3572052" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> to <em>Anadolu Agency.</em></p>

    </figure></p>
<p>He argued that terrorism, extremism and hatred were India’s internal problems and that the New Delhi government was cracking down on groups including Muslims and Sikhs in the country, which was fuelling more anger, extremism and terrorism.</p>
<p>Earlier, the DG ISPR had said Pakistan is not a violent nation, reaffirming that the country’s top priority was peace as the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> with India holds.</p>
<p>New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating last month’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">strongly denied</a> the allegations and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>. As the situation turned into a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military confrontation</a> between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>“We are not a violent nation, we are a serious nation. Our first priority is peace,” Lt Gen Chaudhry told <em>RT Arabic</em> in an interview, according to <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1923968916050657408" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>PTV News</em></a>.</p>
<p>“Great and sensible powers like the United States understand better what the spirit of Pakistan’s people is,” he added.</p>

<p>Detailing the ceasefire process, the DG ISPR said the Indian defence ministry’s spokesperson “personally requested a ceasefire”. It was unclear if the request was made to the US, which acted as a mediator, or Pakistan.</p>
<p>“We desire peace and stability, so we said, why not?” the military spokesman was quoted as saying by <em>PTV News</em>.</p>
<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry hailed the “tremendous work” done by diplomats by “engaging the international community with great wisdom and in an extraordinary manner”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan, with great maturity, responded promptly, firmly and effectively, forcing the enemy to face reality,” the DG ISPR asserted, referring to the downing of five Indian air jets in response to New Delhi’s deadly strikes on the night of May 6-7.</p>
<p>On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, killing over 30 civilians. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a> and later also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepted</a> dozens of its <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drones</a>.</p>

<p>“The nation and the Pakistan armed forces stood united like an unbreakable wall,” he said.</p>
<p>Recalling the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">events of May 9-10</a>, when the tensions between the two neighbours reached their peak amid airstrikes, the DG ISPR stated: “The enemy fired more missiles on the night of May 9 and 10 to scare us. India forgot that Pakistan’s nation and its forces neither bow nor can be made to bow.</p>
<p>“On the morning of May 10, we responded, targeting only their military objectives with utmost responsibility and caution,” he added.</p>
<p>The military spokesperson stressed, “Not a single civilian target was harmed; it was an appropriate, just and balanced response.”</p>

<p>During his conversation reported by <em>PTV News</em>, Lt Gen Chaudhry emphasised that to understand the Pak-India tensions, it was “essential to look into its background”.</p>
<p>“India is hiding behind a false narrative to conceal the truth,” the ISPR official said. He noted that while the Indian media started blaming Pakistan “within minutes of the Pahalgam incident”, its foreign ministry spokesperson admitted two days later that the investigation was underway.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Where is the wisdom in making allegations without investigation and evidence?” Gen Chaudhry asked rhetorically.</p>
<p>He highlighted that the government had taken a clear stance that if there was any evidence, it should be given to an impartial institution, and Pakistan was ready to cooperate.</p>
<p>“India rejected this logical offer and, acting unilaterally, fired missiles at our mosques, martyring children, women, and elders,” the DG ISPR said.</p>
<p>“The sacred responsibility entrusted to the Pakistan armed forces is to protect the country’s sovereignty and borders,” Lt Gen Chaudhry stated, adding that forces had fulfilled the duty and would “continue to do so at all costs”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>The DG ISPR reiterated the military’s stance that India was “sponsoring terrorism in this region, particularly in Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“India is the real sponsor of ongoing terrorism in Pakistan, whether it is the <em>khawarij</em> or terrorist groups active in Balochistan,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said, referring to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) that the state refers to as <em><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna">Fitna Al Khawarij</a></em>.</p>
<p>Last month, the military’s chief spokesperson had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">detailed</a> that a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India was arrested in Punjab’s Jhelum.</p></p>
