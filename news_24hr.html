            <p><p>US President Donald Trump has said said the escalation between India and Pakistan was a “shame”.</p>
<p>He was the first world leader to react to the tense situation after India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">carried out strikes</a> inside Pakistan which also retaliated and reportedly shot down Indian jets.</p>
<p>“It’s a shame. We just heard about it as we were walking in the doors of the Oval [Office],” he said inside the White House after overseeing the swearing-in ceremony for his special envoy, Steve Witkoff.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>“I guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past. They’ve been fighting for a long time,” the US president added.</p>
<p>“I hope it ends very quickly.”</p>
<p>In a statement, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called for restraint from both countries, Associated Press  reported.</p>
<p>“The Secretary-General is very concerned about the Indian military  operations across the Line of Control and international border. He calls  for maximum military restraint from both countries. The world cannot  afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan,” said  the statement.</p>
<p>The US State Department also said it is “closely monitoring developments,” <em>CNN</em> reported.</p>
<p>“We are aware of the reports, however we have no assessment to offer at this time,” the spokesperson said. “This remains an evolving situation,and we are closely monitoring developments.”</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909071/psx-bleeds-as-fears-of-indian-military-action-come-true' target='_blank'><strong>PSX bleeds as fears of Indian military action come true</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday witnessed yet another bloodbath this year — tumbling by as many as 6,500 points in intraday trade — as investors’ fears of a military action by India against Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">came true last night</a>.</p>
<p>The Pakistani military brought down five Indian jets in retaliation for late-night strikes launched by its neighbouring country at six sites in Punjab and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index decreased by 6,560.82 points, or 5.78 per cent, to stand at 107,007.68 from the last close of 113,568.50 when the market opened at 9:30am.</p>
<p>Due to the massive dip, the market was immediately suspended briefly.</p>
<p>This marked the second-largest intra-day plunge (points-wise), ranking next to the nearly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902788#:~:text=The%20benchmark%20KSE%2D100%20index%20witnessed%20a%20record%20intra%2Dday%20plunge%20(points%2Dwise)%20of%208%2C687.68%20points">8,700-point loss</a> that followed the United States’ <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810">tariff announcement</a> last month.</p>
<p>However, the market started recovering slightly, reaching 112,457.37 points at around 10:34am, before declining to 111,171.92 points at 12pm — nearly 2,400 points below yesterday’s close.</p>
<p>“The market opened under pressure today following Indian strikes on unarmed civilians in Pakistan,” said Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities.</p>
<p>“Some selling has been observed, though volumes remain low as investors assess the evolving situation,” Farooq said, adding that recovery was expected once tensions begin to de-escalate.</p>
<p>Shahbaz Ashraf, chief investment officer at Frim Ventures, also attributed the sell-off to “heightened geopolitical tensions following reports of Indian strikes on multiple Pakistani locations”.</p>
<p>“The flare-up has rattled investor sentiment, with fears of further escalation weighing on the market,” he said. However, Shahbaz added, analysts remained “cautiously optimistic, hoping the conflict will remain short-lived with likely mediation from global powers”.</p>
<p>“Importantly, with macroeconomic indicators showing signs of recovery, market watchers believe this correction could be temporary. Many view the pullback as a potential buying opportunity, especially for long-term investors looking to accumulate quality stocks at lower valuations,” he noted, explaining the gains witnessed later.</p>
<p>Samiullah Tariq, head of research at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, said the impact of today’s selling pressure would be short-term and the market would “recover once this ends”.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, also observed that the PSX was “feeling the impact” of last night’s developments.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Echoing Shahbaz’s opinion, Awais said the plunge “may present a buying opportunity, as we do not expect the situation to escalate further”.</p>
<p>In the past few days, panicky investors have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908797/shares-at-psx-fail-to-sustain-early-gains-dip-by-500-points">continued</a> to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907535/shares-at-psx-slump-on-heightened-pakistan-india-tensions">reduce their holdings</a> as Pakistan had expressed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">heightened possibility</a> of a military action <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">by India</a> in the wake of the latter’s allegations regarding a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.</p>

<p>International rating agency Moody’s has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908608">warned</a> that sustained India-Pakistan tensions could negatively affect Pakistan’s growth.</p>
<p>It also said that escalating tensions could cause a setback to nascent macroeconomic stability and also disrupt Pakistan’s access to foreign funding flows.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Moody’s noted that macroeconomic conditions in India would remain stable. However, it did stress that higher defence spending could impact India’s “fiscal strength and slow its fiscal consolidation”.</p></p>

            <p><p>Pakistan on Wednesday reinforced contingency plans to ensure operational resilience and secure communication lines across financial institutions following Indian attacks and the subsequent stock market dip.</p>
<p>The Pakistani military <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">brought down</a> five Indian jets in retaliation for late-night strikes launched by its neighbouring country at six sites in Punjab and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>The plans were fine tuned at an emergency meeting presided over by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb through video link from London currently on a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908996/aurangzeb-pms-privatisation-czar-in-uk-to-woo-investors">two day visit</a> to promote investment opportunities in the country.</p>
<p>The emergency meeting was convened to assess the current financial landscape in light of escalating regional tensions following the recent belligerent Indian aggression.</p>
<p>The finance minister said: “Pakistan’s financial system remains stable and secure, and all relevant authorities are working in close coordination to uphold national economic integrity in the face of emerging challenges.”</p>
<p>The participants of the meeting were informed that contingency plans have been reinforced to ensure operational resilience and secure communication lines across financial institutions.</p>
<p>The meeting was attended by the governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), the finance secretary, and senior officials from the Finance Division.</p>
<p>In a comprehensive and strategic discussion revolving around the situation and functioning of equity, debt, foreign exchange and interbank markets, the participants conducted a rapid risk assessment and evaluated the current threat perception with an emphasis on ensuring national financial stability and security.</p>
<p>“Recognising the critical importance of market stability, the participants of the meeting reaffirmed the government’s firm commitment to maintaining business continuity across all financial and allied sectors,” the finance ministry said.</p>
<p>Key assurances were extended to stakeholders, underscoring that robust measures are being implemented to safeguard Pakistan’s economic infrastructure and provide calm, clarity, and confidence to the financial markets.</p>
<p>“The participants also emphasised the importance of heightened vigilance against a wide range of threats, with a special focus on cybersecurity and communication infrastructure,” it added.</p>
<p>“To maintain proactive oversight, the meeting decided on regular reviews of the evolving situation. These ongoing evaluations will support the government’s efforts to provide consistent guidance and timely reassurance to the financial markets and the wider business community.”</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) convened an emergent meeting to assess the situation in the wake of geopolitical tension in the region.</p>
<p>“In order to preserve market stability and investor confidence at this time, the SECP reaffirms its commitment to ensure continuity in capital market operations,” a statement read.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Infrastructure Institutions (CMIIs), including the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), National Clearing Company of Pakistan and Central Depository Company, also participated in the meeting. They assured that robust and efficient risk management measures are in place for ensuring smooth functioning of Pakistan’s capital markets.</p>
<p>“In response to the current situation, the SECP has advised all CMIIs to immediately enhance their security protocols and operational continuity measures,” the statement read.</p>
<p>“This includes strengthening cybersecurity defenses across all trading, risk management, clearing, and settlement systems and activating full business continuity plans. The CMIIs were further advised to reinforce their physical security arrangements at all facilities,” the statement added.</p>
<p>“The SECP remains vigilant and will issue further updates, as necessary. Market participants are encouraged to continue operations as usual, with the SECP and CMIIs closely monitoring developments to safeguard market integrity,” it concluded.</p></p>
