            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Pin high hopes for a major relief in upcoming budget<br />
‚Ä¢ Wheat growers alone suffer Rs2.2tr losses since May 2024</p>
<p>LAHORE: The Pakistan Kissan Ittehad (PKI) has issued a stark warning regarding an escalating agricultural <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915139/pki-chief-blames-flawed-policies-for-farmers-dire-state">crisis</a> that has gripped the nation since May 2024, resulting in unprecedented financial losses for farmers and a severe downturn in the country‚Äôs vital agricultural sector.</p>
<p>According to data compiled by the PKI, farmers have collectively sustained a staggering compound loss of approximately Rs2,200 billion in wheat alone between May 2024 and May 2025. This colossal figure represents a significant 23.15 per cent of the total crop sector‚Äôs contribution to GDP, which stood at Rs9,500 billion for FY24. The immense financial strain has severely curtailed farmers‚Äô purchasing power, consequently hindering productivity across other critical crops.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúThe agricultural sector, the backbone of our economy, is teetering on the brink,‚Äù stated Khalid Mahmood Khokhar, President of Pakistan Kissan Ittehad. ‚ÄúThe past year has been catastrophic for our farmers, with plummeting prices and unsustainable production costs pushing many to the wall. This crisis is not merely an agricultural issue; it‚Äôs a national emergency that demands immediate and decisive action.‚Äù</p>
<p>The crisis extends beyond wheat, with other key crops experiencing significant setbacks. According to PKI, cotton production has plummeted to 5.55 million bales this year, a staggering 50pc below target and 34pc lower than the previous year. This drastic decline is projected to inflate the cotton import bill to an alarming $1.9 billion, a massive leap from $448 million last year.</p>
<p>Likewise, the 2025 wheat production is estimated at 28.98 million tonnes, an 8.91pc reduction from last year‚Äôs 31.81m tonnes, representing a shortfall of 2.82m tonnes. This reduction alone accounts for an estimated loss of Rs250bn based on international market values, it claims.</p>
<p>Maize production has declined by 15.4pc to 8.24m tonnes from 9.74m tonnes last year, while sugarcane production has decreased to 84.24m tonnes from 87.64m tonnes.</p>
<p>Mr Khokhar says that the overall production of important crops has seen a collective decrease of 13.49pc in FY25, and the overall agricultural sector growth has nosedived from 6.25pc to a mere 0.56pc since July 2024, highlighting the severe contraction of the sector.</p>
<p>The impact of these production shortfalls is reflected in the nation‚Äôs trade balance for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915349">food items</a>. While Pakistan‚Äôs raw food exports slightly decreased to $6.16bn during July-April 2024-25 compared to $6.23bn last year, the food import bill surged to nearly $7bn in the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, up from $6.82bn in the same period last year. This widening gap underscores the nation‚Äôs increasing reliance on food imports, further straining its foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>Adding insult to injury, the current tax structure places an unfair burden on local farmers, he bemoans. There is zero General Sales Tax (GST) on imported cotton bales, while locally produced seed cotton is subjected to an 18pc GST, creating a disadvantage for domestic growers.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The PKI recommends abolishing further tax burden on the agricultural sector as it cannot withstand any additional tax in the form of GST or Federal Excise Duty (FED).</p>
<p>It also urges the government to immediately announce support or indicative prices for all crops to prevent the exploitation of farmers.</p>
<p>It demands a robust, efficient, and transparent commodity price mechanism, guaranteeing farmers at least a 25pc return on investment (ROI). The 18pc GST on locally produced seed cotton must be abolished immediately to protect cotton growers. Also the 14pc GST on tractors and 18pc on tractor-mounted implements should be abolished without delay, and electricity tariffs for the agricultural sector should be standardised at Rs10 per unit (one unit, one rate).</p>
<p>‚Äô‚ÄôThese measures are not merely suggestions; they are vital for the survival of our farmers and the food security of our nation,‚Äú remarked Khokhar. ‚ÄúThe government must prioritise the agricultural sector and implement these recommendations without delay to avert a complete collapse.‚Äù</p>

            </a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration said it would deploy 2,000 National Guard troops on Saturday as federal agents in Los Angeles faced off against a few hundred demonstrators during a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915984">second day of protests</a> following immigration raids.</p>
<p>Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that the Pentagon was prepared to mobilise active-duty troops ‚Äúif violence continues‚Äù in Los Angeles, saying the Marines at nearby Camp Pendleton were ‚Äúon high alert‚Äù.</p>
<p>Federal security agents on Saturday confronted protesters in the Paramount area in southeast Los Angeles, where some demonstrators displayed Mexican flags. A second protest in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday night attracted some 60 people, who chanted slogans including ‚ÄúICE out of LA!‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump signed a presidential memorandum to deploy the National Guard troops to ‚Äúaddress the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester,‚Äù the White House said in a statement. Trump‚Äôs border czar, Tom Homan, <a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/national-guard-deployed-los-angeles-county-anti-ice-protests-rage-border-czar-tom-homan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Fox News</em></a> that the National Guard would be deployed in Los Angeles on Saturday.</p>

<p>The protests pit Democratic-run Los Angeles, where census data suggests a significant portion of the population is Hispanic and foreign-born, against Trump‚Äôs Republican White House, which has made cracking down on immigration a hallmark of his second term.</p>

<p>Senior White House aide <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/StephenM/status/1931487633957601786" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stephen Miller</a>, an immigration hardliner, described the protests as a ‚Äúviolent insurrection‚Äù.</p>
<p>The administration has not invoked the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/insurrection-act-explained" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Insurrection Act</a>, two US officials told <em>Reuters</em> on condition of anonymity. One said that National Guard troops can deploy quickly, within 24 hours in some cases, and that the military was working to source the 2,000 troops.</p>
<p>The 1807 law empowers a president to deploy the US military to enforce the law and suppress events like civil disorder. The last time it was invoked was during the 1992 Los Angeles riots at the request of the California governor.</p>
<p>Video footage of the Paramount protest showed dozens of green-uniformed security personnel with gas masks at the Paramount protest, lined up on a road strewn with overturned shopping carts as small canisters exploded into gas clouds. Authorities began detaining some protesters, according to <em>Reuters</em> witnesses. There was no official information on any arrests.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNow they know that they cannot go to anywhere in this country where our people are, and try to kidnap our workers, our people ‚Äî they cannot do that without an organised and fierce resistance,‚Äù said 44-year-old protester Ron Gochez.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915984">first round of protests</a> kicked off on Friday night after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conducted enforcement operations in the city and arrested at least 44 people on alleged immigration violations.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that there were about ‚Äú1,000 rioters‚Äù at the protests on Friday.</p>
<p>Reuters could not verify DHS‚Äôs account. Angelica Salas, executive director of immigrants‚Äô rights organisation Chirla, said lawyers had not had access to those detained on Friday, which she called ‚Äúvery worrying‚Äù.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#trumps-immigration-crackdown" id="trumps-immigration-crackdown" title="Permalink"></a>Trump‚Äôs immigration crackdown</h2>
<p>Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870606">pledged</a> to deport record numbers of people in the country illegally and lock down the US-Mexico border, with the White House setting a goal for the ICE to arrest at least 3,000 migrants per day.</p>
<p>But the sweeping immigration crackdown has also caught up people legally residing in the country, including some with permanent residence, and has led to legal challenges.</p>
<p>ICE, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Los Angeles Police Department did not respond to requests for comment on the protests or whether there had been any immigration raids on Saturday.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Television news footage on Friday showed unmarked vehicles resembling military transport and vans loaded with uniformed federal agents streaming through Los Angeles streets as part of the immigration enforcement operation.</p>
<p>Raids occurred around Home Depot stores, where street vendors and day labourers were picked up, as well as at a garment factory and a warehouse, Salas of Chirla said.</p>
<p>Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, condemned the immigration raids.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am deeply angered by what has taken place,‚Äù Bass said in a statement. ‚ÄúThese tactics sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety in our city. We will not stand for this.‚Äù</p></p>
