                <h2>Gunmen intercept prison van in Kalat, kidnap five policemen</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>QUETTA: Gunmen on Saturday freed 10 prisoners, including two convicts and took five police officials captive after they <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908061/armed-men-torch-several-govt-buildings-in-kalat">erected a roadblock</a> near Mangocher on the Quetta-Karachi highway and intercepted the vehicle transporting prisoners to Quetta from Gadani jail.</p>
<p>The authorities were using a private van to transport prisoners; the driver and the vehicle were released by the gunmen.</p>
<p>Officials said that a police team was shifting 10 prisoners to Quetta and the central jail in Mach from Gadani jail.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>When the wagon reached the Mangocher area of the Kalat district in late evening, the armed men were blocking the national highway and inspecting every vehicle, including buses and trucks.</p>
<p>After they came across the prison van, they freed the prisoners and kidnapped five police personnel, who were guarding the van, along with their official weapons.</p>
<p>Two police personnel dressed in plainclothes, however, remained safe.</p>
<p>The prisoners included one condemned prisoner who was awarded a death sentence and another was awarded life imprisonment and both were tried for killing their wives. Other prisoners allegedly involved in drug smuggling were coming to Quetta for their case hearing on May 5.</p>
<p>Officials said that security forces had launched a search operation in the hilly area of Mongochar and the surrounding areas to recover the hostages. No group has claimed responsibility for the incident.</p>

                <h2>Madrassah teacher arrested for allegedly raping minor student in Muzaffargarh</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A madrassah teacher in Muzaffargarh district of Punjab was arrested for allegedly raping an 11-year-old student at a seminary, it emerged on Sunday.</p>
<p>Last year, Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) Sahil’s Six Months Cruel Numbers data <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1851068">revealed</a> that a total of 1,630 cases of child abuse were reported from across the country.</p>
<p>In the first six months of 2024, 862 cases of child sexual abuse, 668 cases of abduction, 82 cases of missing children and 18 cases of child marriages were reported. 48 cases of pornography after sexual abuse were also recorded.</p>
<p>“A case has been registered against a madrassa teacher at the Mirhazar police station,” a police spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The spokesperson continued that the police took immediate action and arrested the suspect.</p>
<p>The first information report (FIR) was registered under Section 376(iii) (rape of a minor) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p>
<p>The teacher took the student to his residential room in the madrassa and raped the student twice, according to the FIR.</p>
<p>“A case was registered on the statement of the child’s mother,” the police spokesperson added.</p>
<p>Last month a 17-year-old girl <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904175">died</a> by suicide after she was allegedly raped and impregnated in Punjab’s Muzaffargarh, police had said.</p>
<p>Last month, police had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903749/punjab-police-arrest-5-suspects-in-muzaffargarh-child-gang-rape-case">arrested</a> five suspects for their alleged involvement in the gang rape of a child in Muzaffargarh, according to an official statement.</p></p>
