            <p><p>Over 200 trapped tourists have been rescued in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer after flash floods triggered by heavy rain swept through the district, the local government spokesperson said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued a landslide alert for various areas in GB, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>A day ago, at least four tourists were killed, two others injured, and 15 went missing due to the floods in Diamer’s Babusar area. The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge have become more visible in GB as cloudburst-induced floods wreaked havoc across the region.</p>
<p>Government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said in a statement, “More than 200 rescued tourists have been shifted to Chilas and provided shelter in hotels and guest houses.”</p>
<p>He added that the tourists were now able to contact their families after being stranded for hours.</p>
<p>The death toll since yesterday currently stands at five, according to Diamer District Commissioner Attaullah Kakar.</p>
<p>Kakar detailed that rescue operations were still underway to look for missing tourists, while four of the five deceased have been identified. According to Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abdul Hameed, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719/four-tourists-killed-15-missing-as-rains-lash-gilgit-baltistan#:~:text=He%20estimated%20that%2020%20to%2030%20tourists%20from%20different%20parts%20of%20the%20country%20might%20be%20missing.">20 to 30 tourists</a> from different parts of the country might be missing.</p>
<p>“The military is participating in the rescue operation and evacuating tourists to safer places,” he said in a statement.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Diamer administration declared a state of emergency along Thack-Babusar Road, suspending all tourist movement between Zero Point and Babusar Top.</p>
<p>A notification by Diamer District Magistrate Ataur Rehman, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, said all travellers “should be stopped at both ends” of the road until further notice.</p>
<p>“All tourists and local residents are strongly advised to evacuate to designated safe zones immediately and to avoid any travel on Babusar Road until its complete rehabilitation,” the notification read.</p>
<p>An emergency control room was also established that will operate “round the clock”. It can be contacted at 05812-920181 and 05812-930037. The district magistrate also ordered six companies to dispatch at least two excavators each to the Babusar area to assist in road rehabilitation and retrieval of bodies, if any.</p>
<p>According to DC Kakar, the Force Command Northern Areas (FCNA) of the Pakistan Army has been providing medical assistance and food to stranded tourists on Babusar via helicopters.</p>
<p>“One of the five bodies will be transported via helicopter later today,” he added.</p>
<p>Muhammad Ali, a local social worker, told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “Thirty vehicles were swept away by the floods, and most people have been rescued by the locals.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>The GB govt spokesperson told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “Babusar road was still blocked due to heavy mud on the road, but authorities have been instructed to reach the area”.</p>
<p>Outlining the damage, Faraq said that “more than 50 houses have been damaged in the flood since yesterday”.</p>
<p>“In Babusar, a wheat depot, a girls’ school, a police checkpoint, a tourism police shelter and four bridges have been washed away, while two mosques and a windmill have also been damaged.”</p>
<p>Faraq shared that construction has begun on the restoration of highways and connecting roads, after the floods damaged a portion of the Karakoram Highway (KKH), leaving thousands of tourists and passengers stranded on both sides.</p>

<p>Skardu Rescue 1122, in its WhatsApp channel, said three people were injured due to the flood in the Sadpara village, while the deluge has also hit the Kharmang district.</p>
<p>Ghulam Muhammad, spokesperson for the Baltistan Division Police Department, said in a statement: “In Deosai, 413 tourist vehicles were stranded on the road connecting Sadpara and Deosai, after it was closed at ten different points due to the floods.”</p>
<p>According to the spokesperson, the stranded people were rescued by the police and shifted to Skardu in the morning after the damaged roads were restored overnight.</p>

<p>On June 26, the GB Disaster Management Authority issued a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">warning</a> of increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glof) and flash floods. The public and tourists were advised to avoid going near rivers, streams and other waterways, and avoid bathing or washing clothes in streams since the water flow can reach dangerous levels.</p>

<p>Separately, rescue efforts were underway after a retired army officer and his daughter went missing after the car they were in was swept away by the rainwater drain in Rawalpindi, according to the police.</p>
<p>Retired Colonel Ishaq Qazi, aged approximately 62–64 years and a resident of Defence Housing Authority Phase 5, “left his home along with his daughter, aged around 25 years, in a grey Honda City vehicle”, said a statement by Islamabad’s Sihala police station.</p>
<p>“Due to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain,” it added.</p>
<p>A search operation by the police, Rescue 1122, DHA Phase 5 staff and a team of divers was underway, the statement said.</p>
<p>A video showed a man steering the vehicle in accumulated floodwater, with a person in the back waving their hand out. The car took a short, sharp slide downwards, after which it got swept away in the water, as some people gathered on a nearby bridge.</p>

<p>Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country.</p>
<p>According to the NDMA’s <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndma.gov.pk/sitrepm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>, monsoon rains since June 26 have killed 234 people across the country and injured 596. Of these, 13 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the agency told <em>AFP</em> that the heavy rains usually start later in the monsoon season.</p>
<p>“Such death tolls are usually seen in August, but this year the impact has been markedly different,” she said.</p>
<p>The majority of casualties were recorded in Punjab, the country’s most populous province, with 135 deaths and 470 injuries. KP reported 56 fatalities, Sindh 24, Balochistan 16, two in Azad Kashmir and one death in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Over 61 per cent of nationwide deaths were caused by house-collapse incidents. Monsoon rains so far have damaged 826 houses and led to the deaths of 203 livestock.</p>

<p>Separately, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) issued an advisory to telecom operators, directing them to ensure uninterrupted services and maintain contingency plans for emergencies amid the ongoing floods.</p>
<p>A press release by the PTA said: “The advisory stresses the protection of telecom infrastructure in high-risk areas, availability of critical resources, immediate reporting of service disruptions, and dissemination of flood-related information to the public.”</p>
<p>“Operators have been advised to ensure the continuity of essential services, deploy trained teams, coordinate with local authorities, and efficiently address consumer complaints in affected regions.”</p>
<p>The PTA also activated its National Emergency Telecommunication Coordination Centre and established contact points at its headquarters and zonal offices for real-time coordination, the statement said.</p>
<p>The authority affirmed it was “closely monitoring the situation and will keep the public updated on service restoration efforts in flood-affected areas”.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925841/young-student-allegedly-beaten-to-death-by-seminary-teachers-in-swat-police' target='_blank'><strong>Young student allegedly beaten to death by seminary teachers in Swat: police</strong></a>
            <p><p>A young student was allegedly beaten to death by his madressah teachers on Monday evening in Swat’s Chaliyar village, according to the police.</p>
<p>Swat District Police Spokesperson Moin Fayaz said in a statement that the victim, Farhan, had missed classes for a few days before the incident occurred.</p>
<p>Police and eyewitnesses said that three teachers reportedly beat Farhan in front of fellow students.</p>
<p>“He had just returned to school after being absent for some days,” said one of Farhan’s classmates, who chose not to be named.</p>
<p>“Our teachers started hitting him hard. Later, they dragged him into a side room and kept beating him. I was called in to bring water. He drank a little, then put his head in my lap — and just went silent.”</p>
<p>Farhan was rushed to the nearest hospital by students and teachers, but doctors declared him dead upon arrival, according to Fayaz.</p>
<p>A first information report (FIR), a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, has been registered against all three suspects under Sections 302 (premeditated murder) and Section 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code, as well as Section 37 (punishment for violence) of the Child Protection Act (CPA).</p>
<p>“One of the suspects has been taken into custody, while efforts are underway to arrest the other two.</p>
<p>“This is a deeply disturbing case. A thorough investigation is ongoing, and we are committed to ensuring justice for the child and his family,” Fayaz said.</p>
<p>Farhan’s uncle, Saddar Ayaz, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that when his nephew was at home, he was afraid to go back to the madressah and did not want to return.</p>
<p>“I took him to the seminary myself, handed him over to the teachers, and went back,” Ayaz said. “Later that evening, one of the teachers called me and told me that my nephew had fallen in the toilet and died.”</p>
<p>Human rights groups and local residents have demanded action — not just to punish those responsible, but to prevent future tragedies.</p>
<p>“Farhan could have been any of our children,” said Haider Ali, a local elder. “He went to study. He never came back.”</p>
<p>Under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act 2010 and its 2018 regulations, corporal punishment is a punishable offence, violation of which can result in up to six months of imprisonment or a Rs50,000 fine, or both.</p>
<p>In May this year, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Private Schools Regulatory Authority, through a <a class="link--external" href="https://psra.gkp.pk/notification/15/detail" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a>, strictly prohibited corporal punishment in all private schools across the province after receiving complaints.</p>
<p>Violations, however, continue to prevail. According to a recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924804/crisis-of-protection-child-rights-violations-surge-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa">report</a> by the KP Child Protection and Welfare Commission (KPCPWC), children across the province were subjected to 33 different forms of abuses, including 14 incidents of corporal punishment.</p>
<p>In April, a seminary teacher in Kasur was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905109">arrested</a> for allegedly beating a student with a hot iron for not memorising his lesson at Bangla Kambovan.</p></p>

            <p><p>At least five children lost their lives in rain-related incidents across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swat district as torrential rains triggered flash floods in various parts of the region, rescue officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning. According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), 221 people have been killed and more than 500 others injured in rain-related incidents since June 26.</p>
<p>According to Rescue 1122 spokesperson Shafiqa Gul, a woman and her two sons were attempting to cross a stream in the Sur Dherai area of Malam Jabba, when her children drowned.</p>
<p>“The mother, holding her 10-month-old baby in her arms, was trying to guide her seven-year-old son across the stream when a flash flood struck. In the chaos, she lost control, and the child in her arms was swept away,” Gul said.</p>
<p>The bodies of the two sons were recovered by rescue personnel after hours of coordinated effort, the official added.</p>
<p>In a separate incident in Gujar Band Shanko area of Madyan, a house collapsed due to heavy rainfall, claiming the lives of three children and seriously injuring a woman.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the emergency call, Rescue 1122 teams rushed to the scene and retrieved the victims from the rubble with assistance from local volunteers, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>They were later taken to the Civil Hospital Madyan, where the injured woman was placed under critical care.</p>
<p>Authorities have issued advisories urging residents, particularly those living in mountainous or low-lying areas, to exercise extreme caution during the ongoing monsoon season.</p>
<p>The district administration said it was closely monitoring weather patterns and has mobilised emergency services to respond to any further incidents caused by the relentless rains.</p>
<p>In June, at least 13 tourists were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920992">swept</a> to their deaths in Swat while sheltering from flash floods on a raised river bank.</p>

<p>A new spell of monsoon rains on Monday hit several parts of the province, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1925692">damaging</a> houses and crops and suspending traffic.</p>
<p>The high flood in Chitral River triggered by the fast melting of glaciers washed six houses and a large chunk of the farmlands of Junali Koch village near Booni town.</p>
<p>In Yarkhon Valley of Upper Chitral, heavy rains wreaked havoc in Arakhan village in Mirgram and severely damaged dozens of houses. According to residents of the affected villages, a large number of livestock were washed away by the flash floods.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Chitral River was flooded, leaving houses and infrastructure in Ayunand and other low-lying areas of Lower Chitral at risk of damage.</p>
<p>In Bajaur tribal district, authorities closed the Jar Bypass Road, which connects the district to the rest of the country via the main Bajaur-Munda Road, to traffic after heavy rains triggered flooding.</p>
<p>District authorities urged people to use Khar-Qazfi Bypass Road to avoid any potential incidents. Rescue 1122 stated that rescuers have been deployed to deal with any emergency eventuality.</p>
<p>The downpour damaged road infrastructure and bridges in some areas and caused suspension of traffic on Darra Tang Road. Goods and public transport vehicles travelling between KP and Punjab were stranded, adding to the troubles of transporters and commuters.</p></p>
