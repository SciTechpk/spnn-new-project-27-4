                <h2>9 terrorists killed, 3 officials injured in joint operation in KP’s Hangu: police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Nine terrorists were killed and three officers including the district police officer were injured in an exchange of fire during an operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Hangu district, police said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906333/3-traffic-cops-injured-in-terrorist-attack-in-kps-lakki-marwat-district-police">witnessed</a> an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Earlier, a statement by KP Inspector General of Police (IGP) Zulfiqar Hameed said that security forces and police carried out a joint operation in Hangu’s Zargari Shinawari area.</p>
<p>“Nine terrorists killed in Hangu operation, District Police Officer Khalid Khan undergoing treatment at the Kohat Combined Military Hospital,” the statement by Kohat Regional Police Officer DIG Abbas Majeed said.</p>
<p>The operation is continuing successfully and full action is being taken against the terrorists, the statement added.</p>
<p>Hangu DPO Khan, who was injured during the operation, is undergoing surgery at the Kohat CMH. His condition is said to be satisfactory, the statement added.</p>
<p>Federal Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Naqvi telephoned DPO Hangu and appreciated his bravery and determination.</p>
<p>“The interior minister said that the nation will never forget the sacrifices of its brave sons and is determined to achieve final victory in the war against terrorism,” the statement added.</p>
<p>“During the operation, there was a heavy exchange of fire between the terrorists and the law enforcement personnel,” the earlier statement by the KP IGP read.</p>
<p>“Security forces fought bravely and killed five terrorists. However, Hangu DPO Khalid Khan, the Doaba station house officer (SHO), and an officer of the security forces were injured in the exchange of fire,” it added.</p>
<p>The statement said that DPO Khan “was hit by three bullets”, while his condition was said to be stable.</p>
<p>Police were making arrangements for a helicopter to airlift DPO Khalid from the Hangu hospital to Peshawar for further treatment, Imran Khan, personal secretary to IG Hameed, told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>IG Hameed spoke to the injured officers and enquired about their well-being, according to the police statement.</p>
<p>“Law enforcement agencies are determined to continue their fight against terrorism,” the statement added.</p>
<p>Pakistan ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents.</p>

<p>On June 21, KP police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918714">killed</a> a terrorist and injured two others belonging to the TTP group in Dera Ismail Khan as they attempted to attack the police.</p>
<p>In May, two policemen were martyred and two were injured in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911459">suicide attack</a> in Peshawar, while in a separate incident, two cops lost their lives as a result of an attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu.</p>
<p>Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773">three</a> “wanted terrorists” were killed during a joint operation between the regional police and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) in Bannu district.</p>
<p>On July 5, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP’s Tipu Gul group were killed in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922269">joint operation</a> by the CTD.</p>

            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925217/karachis-business-community-partially-heeds-strike-call-against-new-fbr-powers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <h2>Karachi’s business community partially heeds strike call against new FBR powers</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The business community in Karachi observed a partial strike on Saturday against the tax measures and arrest powers of the federal tax authority under the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921249">Finance Act FY26</a>.</p>
<p>The call for a countrywide strike was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923375">issued</a> last week by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924204">backed</a> by trade bodies, industrial area associations, petroleum dealers, transporters, and chain store operators. The KCCI protested against what they described as anti-business measures and proposed provincial labour policies.</p>
<p>“A partial strike was observed in Karachi on the call of industrialists and supported by traders of markets against enhancing  FBR’s powers to conduct raids and arrests of businessmen,” All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>All Karachi Tajir Ittehad is an association of markets and shopkeepers in the metropolis.</p>
<p>Mir said that the markets at Gul Plaza, Teen Talwar in Clifton and Nursery remained open. However, the majority of traders have supported the strike, though some of the traders have reservations over the nature of demands, he said.</p>
<p>“The demands of small traders were not included, particularly regarding the raids on shops and closure of shops on the pretext of being in poor condition,” he added.</p>
<p>A leader of the markets in the Old City areas, Sharjeel Goplani, told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “A partial strike was observed as Lea Market, Urdu Bazaar as well as Timber and Furniture markets remained open.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The expanded enforcement <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924164">powers</a> for the FBR include the authority to block high-value financial transactions by non-filers — such as vehicle and property purchases, investment in securities and mutual funds, and opening certain prestigious bank accounts — along with powers to seal unregistered business premises, confiscate goods and recover taxes from firms, including those in the public sector. The move has generated criticism from many quarters.</p>
<p>The Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry had also announced its participation in the strike, condemning the enhanced powers granted to FBR officials and the lack of consultation with the private sector.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the business community appeared <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925146/business-bodies-divided-over-todays-strike-call">divided</a> over the strike with Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry Senior Vice-President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon claiming that chambers and trade associations had agreed to defer the strike following a meeting with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries Haroon Akhtar Khan.</p></p>
