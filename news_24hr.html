            <p><p>The Karakoram Highway (KKH) was reopened on Saturday as aid and rescue operations continued in Gilgit-Baltistan after flash floods battered the region.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719">devastating impacts</a> of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">heat­­waves</a>, erratic weat­her patterns and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660">glacial melting</a> have triggered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a> and intense floods across the region.</p>
<p>On Monday, floods swept through GB’s Babusar area in Diamer district and Naran, causing landslides and leaving many <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926193">stranded</a>. At least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926487">nine people</a> died and more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure were damaged as a result.</p>
<p>In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said: “The Karakoram Highway is open for all types of traffic.”</p>
<p>He recalled that the main artery had been blocked due to landslides and mud flow on Friday, adding that machinery was sent to restore the road.</p>
<p>Faraq further said that rescue and search operations were underway across the region. The recent floods have caused severe destruction in the region, particularly in the Kunduz region and the Ghanche district, he noted.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

<p>“Floods in GB have destroyed many houses, water channels, communication roads, standing crops, shops and electricity poles,” the official said.</p>
<p>He added that the local government has distributed “hundreds of tents, thousands of food packets and medicines to the affected people” across the region.</p>
<p>Speaking about the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">search operation</a> in Babusar, Faraq said, “There may be 10 to 12 missing tourists at the Babusar valley as a search operation was ongoing.”</p>
<p>“The Pakistan Army, GB Scouts, Rescue 1122 and local volunteers are taking part in the operation,” he said, adding that continuous landslides and increasing water flow were hampering the search.</p>
<p>Another rescue operation was underway in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/642478/trekking-to-tranquility">Fairy Meadows</a>, according to the government spokesperson.</p>

<p>“Four stranded tourists at Fairy Meadows near Nanga Parbat basecamp, including one man and three women, were airlifted through Pakistan Army helicopters on early Friday,” he added.</p>
<p>GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan and his cabinet will also hold a press conference today regarding flood disasters and rehabilitation operations, Faraq added.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the National Disaster Management Authority <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/pmd-issues-glof-alert-for-gb-kp-as-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-from-diamer-amid-floods#:~:text=NDMA%20issues%20landslide%20alert">issued</a> a landslide alert for the northern areas of the country. It advised citizens to avoid travelling to mountainous areas and directed authorities to remain alert in case of an emergency.</p>

<p>The GB government had started free and special flights yesterday to evacuate stranded tourists and local people, GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmed Mirza noted.</p>
<p>In a media briefing on Friday, Mirza said 135 people, including 80 tourists, were taken from Skardu to Islamabad through a C-130 flight. “A special C-130 flight will start from Gilgit to Islamabad to shift stranded tourists and local passengers to Islamabad,” he added.</p>
<p>He also said that the GB government made the arrangements with the NDMA and Pakistan Army to “facilitate safe evacuation of tourists, patients, and students who were stranded at multiple locations”.</p>
<p>A helicopter service was also launched to evacuate tourists stranded in the affected areas, he added.</p>
<p>The chief secretary further noted, “The main cause of most of the incidents was melting glaciers and cloudburst.”</p>
<p>He said that the cloudburst-induced <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">destructive flood</a> at Babusar valley washed away around eight kilometres of the road leading to Babusar Top, sweeping away two dozen vehicles and leaving <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/officials-say-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-amid-gb-floods-govt-issues-landslide-alert">hundreds of tourists</a> and locals stranded.</p>

<p>“However, the stranded tourists at Babusar valley and Deosai areas were safely evacuated through timely efforts by locals, Rescue 1122, district administration, the Pakistan Army, Frontier Works Organisation (FWO), and local community volunteers,” he added.</p>
<p>Mirza stated that 12km of roads, 26 bridges, 20 vehicles, water channels, cattle sheds, shops, agricultural lands, crops, private and public properties, irrigation channels, and drinking water supply systems had been damaged in several areas of GB.</p>
<p>“The GB government is effectively dealing with the situation,” he said, asserting the administration was providing aid to the affected places.</p></p>

            <p><p>Health Minister Mustafa Kamal urged international stakeholders to explore partnerships in Pakistan’s rapidly evolving health landscape, highlighting the country’s “immense” potential for investment, state-run <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/26-07-2025/pakistan-presents-immense-opportunities-for-investment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Radio Pakistan</em></a> reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>Representing Pakistan at Boao Forum for Asia’s (BFA) Global Health Forum in Beijing yesterday, the health minister underscored that Pakistan presents “immense opportunities for collaboration, innovation and investment”.</p>
<p>Established in 2001, the <a class="link--external" href="https://en.ghfbfa.cn/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Boao Forum for Asia</a> (BFA) is a non-profit international organisation promoting regional cooperation in Asia. It focuses on health issues related to economic development and wellbeing.</p>
<p>The roundtable featured health ministers from all over the world, who discussed equal access to healthcare and sustainable reforms.</p>

<p>“Pakistan is ready for partnerships in global health,” Kamal said, highlighting the country’s 250 million population, nursing cooperation and digital reforms.</p>
<p>He pointed out that there were “significant opportunities for global collaboration in the health sector”, according to a post on his X account.</p>
<p>The minister noted that Pakistan could play a role in mitigating a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844692">shortage</a> of nurses and paramedics through training and cooperation.</p>
<p>He invited global partners to explore investment avenues, emphasising Pakistan’s commitment to providing strong <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891490">returns</a>, streamlined regulation, and government support.</p>
<p>“Without health, the economy cannot progress,” Kamal said.</p>

<p>The health minister also drew attention to the new Digital System for Licensing and Registration of Medical Devices for the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap), which was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925775">launched</a> by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday.</p>
<p>At the inauguration, the premier noted that the registration of life-saving medical devices and diagnostic products in Pakistan had become a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901711">critical issue</a> earlier this year. He expressed hope that the applications for such equipment would now be decided within 20 days.</p>
<p>Last month, Kamal noted that Pakistan’s healthcare system was riddled with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919214">fundamental flaws</a> and that the solution lay not merely in building hospitals but in improving the entire environment.</p>
<p>The minister has also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924869">called attention</a> towards Pakistan’s high fertility rate, high burden of both communicable and non-communicable diseases, and need to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898284">eradicate polio</a>.</p></p>

            <p><p>Three wanted terrorists and “key operatives” of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed during a joint operation of the police and the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) in the Barikot tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swat district on Friday.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — particularly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773/3-terrorists-killed-during-joint-operation-in-kps-bannu-police">Bannu</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923956/one-killed-2-others-injured-in-explosion-in-kps-lakki-marwat-police">Lakki Marwat</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921636">Bajaur</a> — have seen a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a> targeting police stations and posts. In response, the state has also intensified its counterterrorism <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925443/9-terrorists-killed-8-captured-in-malakand-joint-action-by-military-leas-during-four-days">operations</a>.</p>
<p>“Three wanted terrorists have been killed in Barikot in a major win for Swat CTD. Eliminating the enemies of regional peace, the CTD has killed three important operatives of the <em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em>,” KP Police said in a statement today.</p>
<p><em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em> is a term the state uses to refer to the banned TTP.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Among the terrorists was Ajmal, also known as Waqas, a resident of Malook Abad who was reportedly involved in at least nine terrorism-related cases. He was also involved in the killing of Village Defence Council members and carried a bounty of Rs2 million.</p>
<p>The second individual was identified as Matiullah, also known by the aliases Ishaq and Junaid, son of Ibrat Shah from Dabb Sar Martung in Shangla district, who was wanted in two terrorism cases.</p>
<p>The third slain terrorist was Rahimullah Rehmani, alias Rohullah, son of Amanullah, a resident of Sheray in Afghanistan’s Nuristan province. He, too, was wanted in two separate terrorism cases.</p>
<p>“The terrorists were involved in attacks on security forces and assassinations of police personnel,” said the KP police statement. “A network spreading terrorism with external funding was destroyed, and the terrorists were also wanted in improvised explosive device (IED) attacks and extortion cases.”</p>
<p>“This CTD operation is a blow to the operational wings of <em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em> in Swat and adjacent areas,” Malakand Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sher Akbar Khan was quoted as saying. “We are determined to uproot <em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em>.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Speaking to reporters, Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Umar Khan said that search and strike operations against militants would continue across the district. He added that security has been intensified at all entry and exit points of Swat to prevent any possible infiltration of miscreants.</p>
<p>“We will not allow the peace and stability of Swat to be disturbed at any cost,” the DPO asserted.</p>
<p>KP Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed praised the regional police and Swat CTD for striking the “operational command wing” of <em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em>, according to the police statement.</p>
<p>“Operations against terrorists will be further intensified to establish lasting peace and order in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” he said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">surge</a> in terrorist activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. Attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces.</p>
<p>In a series of incidents in KP yesterday, a police official was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926664/cop-martyred-in-karak-attack-on-bannu-police-station-foiled">martyred</a> in the Karak district while police thwarted a separate late-night terrorist assault on a police station in Bannu’s Basyakhel area.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP’s Tipu Gul group <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922269">were killed</a> in a joint operation by the CTD and the police in Lakki Marwat. This came nearly a week after the leader of a peace committee and two of his companions <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921018">were shot dead</a> by terrorists in the same district.</p>
<p>Three terrorists <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916076/3-terrorists-killed-one-cop-martyred-in-gun-battle-with-lakki-marwat-police-local-peace-committee">were also killed</a> in Lakki Marwat’s Kot Kashmir area during a gun battle with the police and local peace committee, in which a cop was martyred as well.</p>
<p>A total of 670 terror incidents were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881856">recorded in 2024</a>, while 212 militants were killed in counter-terrorism operations, according to a report issued by the CTD.</p></p>
