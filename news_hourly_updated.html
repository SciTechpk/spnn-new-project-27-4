                <h2>PM tasks Bilawal with presenting Pakistan‚Äôs case ‚Äòfor peace‚Äô on global arena</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday tasked PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to present Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúcase for peace‚Äù on the global arena in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as tensions over last month‚Äôs Pahalgam attack continued to build up. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting drones</a> sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, for both sides to finally drop their guns as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> was reached. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911473/islamabad-delhi-gained-nothing-but-miseries-from-wars-pm-shehbaz">offered talks</a>.</p>

<p>The military flare-up saw China expressing solid diplomatic support to Pakistan, but there wasn‚Äôt a country other than Israel to stand with India without hyphenating it with Pakistan. Reports said a day ago that finding itself friendless in the conflict, India has started taking revenge on countries who helped Islamabad in the recent military flare-up.</p>
<p>Amid the current situation, Bilawal posted on X that he was contacted earlier today by the prime minister who requested that the former top diplomat ‚Äúlead a delegation to present Pakistan‚Äôs case for peace on the international stage‚Äù.</p>
<p>Bilawal said he was honoured to accept the responsibility and remained committed to serving the country in ‚Äúthese challenging times‚Äù.</p>

<p>The government has yet to share more details on who else would be included in the delegation and which specific countries would be engaged.</p>
<p>In a similar development, the Indian government announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, later this month to present the country‚Äôs stance on terrorism and ‚Äúproject India‚Äôs national consensus‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMembers of parliament from different parties, prominent political personalities and distinguished diplomats will be part of each delegation,‚Äù said a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2129254" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> from India‚Äôs Press Information Bureau.</p>
<p>It said the following Indian lawmakers would lead the seven delegations: Indian National Congress‚Äô Shashi Tharoor; Bharatiya Janata Party‚Äôs Shankar Prasad and Baijayant Panda; Dravid Munnetra Kazhagam‚Äôs Kanimozhi Karunanidhi; Janata Dal-United‚Äôs Sanjay Kumar Jha; Nationalist Congress Party‚Äôs Supriya Sule and Shiv Sena‚Äôs Shrikant Eknath Shinde.</p>
<p>Pakistan has said Britain and other countries, in addition to the United States, played a major role in de-escalating the fighting. Diplomats and analysts say the ceasefire <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911472">remains fragile</a>.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump said after the ceasefire was struck that talks should take place in a third-country venue but no dates or location for the talks have been announced.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#pm-shehbazs-peace-offer" id="pm-shehbazs-peace-offer" title="Permalink"></a>PM Shehbaz‚Äôs peace offer</h2>
<p>A day ago, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered India to sit for a comprehensive dialogue to settle contentious issues, including Kashmir and joi¬≠ntly fight terrorism, remi¬≠nding New Delhi that the neighbouring countries fought three wars in the past and gained nothing but miseries of the people.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter settling disputes like Kashmir and water distribution, we can talk on trade and counter-terrorism as Pakistan is the worst affected country by terrorism which lost 90,000 lives and over $150 billion economic losses,‚Äù PM Shehbaz said while addressing a ceremony marking Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanks¬≠giving Day) at Pakistan Monument.</p>
<p>Addressing the ceremony, PM Shehbaz had said, ‚ÄúWe have won the war but we want peace. We have taught our enemy a lesson but we condemn aggression. We want this part of the world to be as prosperous and progressive as others through hard work, undying efforts and living like peaceful neighbours.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>PM Shehbaz, DG ISPR hail Iran‚Äôs peace efforts amid Pak-India escalation</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry have lauded Iran‚Äôs peace efforts in the recent Pakistan-India conflict and warned of ‚Äúforces‚Äù seeking to create a rift among the two brotherly countries.</p>
<p>Just two days after India, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">without</a> any evidence, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack">blamed</a> Pakistan over last month‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam, Iran had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">offered to mediate</a> between the two as tensions escalated.</p>
<p>A press release from the PM‚Äôs Office said the premier had a telephonic conversation with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring their warm and cordial conversation, the prime minister conveyed his warm regards to Supreme Leader Ayatullah Khamenei and thanked President Pezeshkian for Iran‚Äôs sincere and brotherly diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions in South Asia. He particularly thanked the president for his telephone call to the prime minister last month as well as for sending Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to the region during the crisis,‚Äù the PMO said.</p>
<p>Strongly condemning India‚Äôs unprovoked attacks against Pakistan that led to the deaths of innocent civilians, including women and children, PM Shehbaz said the military had given a ‚Äúresponsible, measured yet befitting and forceful reply to the enemy‚Äù.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan had always desired peace and it was in this spirit that it had agreed to the ceasefire understanding with India and would remain committed to upholding it. He reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs firm resolve to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs.</p>
<p>However, PM Shehbaz expressed his concern over India‚Äôs attempt to unilaterally hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, which he pointed out was unlawful and constituted a ‚Äúred line‚Äù for Pakistan as these waters were the lifeline for the nation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prime minister emphasised that Jammu and Kashmir dispute remained the root cause of instability in South Asia. He called for its just resolution, in accordance with the UN Security Council‚Äôs resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people, as key to enduring peace in the region.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe president of Iran expressed heartfelt condolences over the loss of civilian lives. He welcomed the ceasefire understanding, while appreciating Pakistan‚Äôs efforts for peace. He said Iran was committed to promoting peace and stability in the region,‚Äù the PMO said.</p>
<p>It added that two leaders also exchanged views on Pakistan-Iran bilateral relations and agreed to enhance cooperation in all areas of shared interest, especially trade, connectivity, security and people-to-people contacts.</p>
<p>The Iranian president extended an invitation to PM Shehbaz to undertake an official visit to Tehran, which was accepted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, DG Chaudhry told <em>IRNA</em> in an <a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85835207/Exclusive-Pakistani-military-spokesperson-Islamabad-appreciates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> published today, the first by any Pakistani armed forces‚Äô spokesperson to an Iranian outlet, that ‚ÄúPakistan is fully grateful to the international community, and we are especially grateful to brotherly countries, including the Islamic Republic of Iran.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added: ‚ÄúWe should be aware that there are forces in the region that, with the help of external factors, are seeking to create misunderstanding and confusion among brotherly countries in the region and want to create a rift between friends and brothers.‚Äù</p>

<p>According to <em>IRNA</em>, Lt Gen Chaudhry spoke about the latest developments in South Asia as well as the ‚Äúimportance of regional and international diplomacy to help de-escalate tensions‚Äù. He also ‚Äúfocused‚Äù on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">recent visit</a> of FM Araghchi to Islamabad, the report added.</p>
<p>During his visit to Islamabad, Araghchi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">met with</a> PM Shehbaz and Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir.
