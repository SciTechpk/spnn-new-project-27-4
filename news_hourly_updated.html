            </a>
            <p><p>A state of emergency has been declared in several districts of Punjab as heavy rains triggered flooding, the spokesperson Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924232">issued</a> a warning of torrential rains with wind-thundershowers that will last throughout the country till July 17.</p>
<p>Wasa Director General Tayyab Farid said that ‚Äúrivers have overflowed due to heavy rains in Rawalpindi, Chakwal and surrounding areas,‚Äù leading to a flood situation.</p>
<p>According to the Punjab Rescue spokesperson Farooq Ahmed, heavy rains have left 33 dead across the province in the past 24 hours, while another 176 people have been injured.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt least 13 people have died in Lahore, eight in Faisalabad, four in Pakpattan, three in Sheikhupura and Okara and one person each in Nankana Sahib and Sahiwal,‚Äù said the Punjab Rescue spokesperson.</p>
<p>Citizens have been advised to avoid unnecessary travel, stay away from power lines and open manholes, said Wasa DG.</p>

<p>In a statement, the PDMA warned that strict action will be taken against those gathering or bathing near Leh Nullah. It also announced a local holiday in Rawalpindi in light of the emergency.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Jhelum, rescue operations were underway to evacuate citizens trapped in floodwaters in Dhok Badar village of the district.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOver 40 people have been rescued so far‚Äù, said PDMA DG, adding that rescue operations will continue until all citizens are safely evacuated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan army personnel and rescue teams are currently rushing the citizens to safe locations,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>In case of any emergency, citizens are advised to contact the CDA and district administration on 16 and 1334, respectively.</p>

                <h2>PSX reaches new intraday peak of 138,000 points</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday continued its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924716/psx-rebounds-on-hopes-of-ratings-upgrade">renewed</a> bullish momentum as it crossed the 138,000 points during intraday trade.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,785.25 points, or 1.31 per cent, to stand at 138,165.21 points at 11:57am, from the previous close of 136,379.96 points.</p>
<p>The PSX had staged a modest recovery yesterday as investors resumed buying, encouraged by the formation of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924499">high-level committee</a> to address the business community‚Äôs concerns over the recently introduced taxation measures.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The development has helped the KSE-100 index gain momentum despite the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924723/businesses-gear-up-for-nationwide-strike">July 19 strike call</a> by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry to protest against the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917240">powers</a> to arrest and prosecute businessmen introduced in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292">federal budget</a>.</p>
<p>Investor confidence was also reinforced by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb‚Äôs recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924444">briefing to Moody‚Äôs</a> on Pakistan‚Äôs improved macroeconomic outlook and financial stability, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924716/psx-rebounds-on-hopes-of-ratings-upgrade#:~:text=bolstered%20optimism%20for%20a%20potential%20ratings%20upgrade%20in%20Moody%E2%80%99s%20upcoming%20review.">bolstering optimism</a> for a potential ratings upgrade in the credit rating agency‚Äôs upcoming review.</p>
