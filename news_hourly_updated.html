                <h2>Mostly children among 13 dead in KP monsoon spell over last 48 hours: PDMA</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least 13 people died, including nine children, and three were injured over the last 48 hours in monsoon rain-related incidents across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the provincial disaster management authority (PDMA) said in a damage report on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities.</p>
<p>The monsoon death toll since the end of June <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930">surged</a> to 234, according to the National Disaster Mana¬≠gement Authority (NDMA). Heavy rains triggered flash floods in several districts of KP and Gilgit-Baltistan, damaging homes and increasing water levels in rivers and streams.</p>
<p>Over the last 48 hours, Swat has recorded the highest toll as six children and one woman died owing to flash floods and a house collapsing, while a woman and child were injured, the KP PDMA report said.</p>
<p>Three people died in Buner, which experienced heavy rain with thunder and lightning. A woman and her child died in a thunder strike, while an eight-year-old boy was swept away. ‚ÄúThe dead body has been recovered by the locals,‚Äù the PDMA said.</p>
<p>Incidents caused by heavy rains in Bajaur claimed the lives of a man and a child. The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925908#:~:text=In%20Bajaur%20tribal%20district%2C%20two%20brothers%20died%20after%20being%20swept%20away%20by%20downpour%2Dinduced%20floods%20in%20the%20Lowi%20Mamund%20tehsil.">victims</a> were brothers, aged 21 and five.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTheir mother was successfully rescued while the bodies of both brothers were recovered,‚Äù the PDMA quoted the Bajaur Deputy Commissioner‚Äôs Office as saying.</p>
<p>Per the report, a woman also died in Upper Kohistan, while a child was injured in Torghar as heavy rains caused a roof to collapse. A total of 19 houses had been damaged due to the heavy downpour, out of which two were completely destroyed and 17 sustained partial damage.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe current spell of heavy rains is likely to continue intermittently until July 25,‚Äù the report said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe PDMA has already sent a letter to all district administrations to take precautionary measures in view of the weather situation, and has directed that relief activities be intensified in affected districts to provide immediate relief to all victims,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>The authority directed that all tourists be apprised of the weather and to take precautionary measures.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe public should contact the free helpline 1700 for any untoward incident, weather situation updates and information,‚Äù the report added.</p>
<p>On Monday, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925684/cm-orders-officials-to-remain-vigilant-as-more-rains-forecast">directed</a> the district administration to remain on high alert after forecasts indicated more monsoon rains in the province.</p>
<p>He instructed all relevant departments to take precautionary measures to deal with potential risks such as floods and landslides.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829">warned</a> of a heightened risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as over 200 stranded tourists were rescued from GB‚Äôs Diamer district as heavy floods battered the region.</p>

<p>All tourists who were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20250%20tourists%20and%20passengers%20stranded%20at%20the%20Babusar%20Highway%20have%20been%20rescued%20by%20the%20Diamer%20district%20administration%2C%20volunteers%2C%20police%2C%20Rescue%201122%20and%20army%2C%20according%20to%20GB%20government%20spokesperson%20Faizullah%20Faraq.">stranded</a> on the Babusar Highway have been rescued and are currently in Chilas city, according to Gilgit-Baltistan spokesperson Faizullah Faraq.</p>
<p>He said the search operation for those who were missing is still ongoing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Karakoram Highway has been closed again at one or two points, which has left thousands of travellers stranded at various places across the highway,‚Äù Faraq said.</p>
<p>He noted that local private hotel owners, as well as the government, have arranged for free accommodation for tourists.‚Äú</p>
<p>Work is underway to restore the Silk Road up to Bisham, Faraq said.</p>
<p>He added that GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan would visit the affected area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBabusar Highway today to personally review the damage caused by flooding and see the problems faced by tourists.</p>
<p>The spokesperson also said that the chief minister will issue important orders regarding flood disasters and rehabilitation of the victims.</p></p>

            <p><p>Incarcerated PTI Founder Imran Khan‚Äôs sons met with United States President Donald Trump‚Äôs key aide <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881184">Richard Grenell</a> on Tuesday as they kicked off a campaign calling for their father‚Äôs release from prison.</p>
<p>Imran‚Äôs sons ‚Äî Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim Khan, 26 ‚Äî <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910789">called attention</a> to their father‚Äôs incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Imran, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a> since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831">¬£190 million</a> corruption case and also faces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845818">pending</a> trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.</p>
<p>Grenell, US special presidential envoy for special missions ‚Äî known for publicly calling for Imran‚Äôs release ‚Äî posted on X that he had met with Sulaiman and Kasim in California, urging them to ‚Äústay strong‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere are millions of people around the world who are sick of political prosecutions. You are not alone.‚Äù</p>

<p>Imran‚Äôs sons also met with Dr Asif Mahmood, a Pakistani American physician who has been playing a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1747390#:~:text=Dr%20Asif%20Mahmood%2C%20a%20Pakistani%20American%20physician%20who%20is%20playing%20a%20key%20role%20in%20the%20campaign%20to%20win%20over%20Americans">key role</a> in the PTI‚Äôs campaign to win over Americans.</p>
<p>Dr Mahmood, vice chairman of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), shared a picture showing he also met with Grenell, along with the ex-premier‚Äôs sons.</p>
<p>‚ÄúImmense pride for [Kasim] and Sulaiman Khan for their bravery in fighting for their father, former prime minister Imran Khan‚Äôs freedom,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He also praised Grenell for ‚Äústanding for justice and principle‚Äù and called for unity to free the PTI founder.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Imran‚Äôs sister Aleema Khan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922952/imran-shuns-dialogue-plans-nationwide-protest#:~:text=Ms%20Khan%20said%20that%20Imran%E2%80%99s%20sons%2C%20Qasim%20and%20Suleiman%2C%20will%20go%20to%20the%20US">said</a> the two brothers will go to the US to highlight injustices meted out to their father before coming to Pakistan to become part of a movement calling for the ex-premier‚Äôs release.</p>
<p>Although the government has not officially commented on the matter, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan">told</a> <em>Dawn.com</em> that Article 16 of the Constitution, which grants the right to gather, was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Malik also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923089">said</a> that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals, and that if they ‚Äúviolate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled‚Äù.</p>
<p>There were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan">conflicting</a> statements from PML-N leaders as well on whether the duo would be allowed entry into Pakistan, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they should be allowed to come and ‚Äúcarry out their activities‚Äù, but within the limitations of the law.</p></p>
