            <p><p>US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday Washington hoped that India’s response to the recent attack in occupied Kashmir does not lead to a broader regional conflict.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">civilian</a> and military leadership have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">rejected</a> the accusation and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>“Our hope here is that India responds to this terrorist attack in a way that doesn’t lead to a broader regional conflict,” Vance said in an <a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6372190741112" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> on <em>Fox News</em>’ ‘Special Report with Bret Baier’ show.</p>
<p>“And we hope, frankly, that Pakistan, to the extent that they’re responsible, cooperates with India to make sure that the terrorists sometimes operating in their territory are hunted down and dealt with,” Vance added.</p>
<p>Top US leaders, including President Donald Trump, have condemned the attack, calling it “terror” and “unconscionable,” while expressing support for India without directly blaming Pakistan.</p>
<p>India is an important US partner as Washington aims to counter China’s rising influence. Pakistan remains Washington’s ally even as its importance diminished after the 2021 US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1643653">withdrawal</a> from neighbouring Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In recent days, Washington <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907094/us-in-touch-with-india-and-pakistan-urges-work-toward-responsible-solution">urged</a> India and Pakistan to work with each other to de-escalate tensions and arrive at a “responsible solution.” India has blamed Pakistan for the attack. Islamabad denies responsibility and is calling for a neutral probe.</p>
<p>The US State Department has said it was in touch with the nuclear-armed neighbours at multiple levels and Secretary of State Marco Rubio held calls on Wednesday with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.</p>
<p>“This government is in constant communication,” State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters at her daily news briefing</p>
<p>“We are asking for a responsible resolution from both parties.”</p>
<p>“As the President articulated to Prime Minister Modi last week, the US stands strong with India against terrorism, and Prime Minister Modi has our full support,” she said.</p>
<p>Bruce said Secretary Rubio encouraged both countries to work toward a responsible solution that maintains long-term peace and regional stability in South Asia.</p>
<p>“We continue to be in touch with the governments of both countries, as I mentioned, at multiple levels.”</p>
<p>Hindu nationalist Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1907470">vowed</a> to punish those responsible and Jaishankar has told Rubio that the perpetrators should be brought to justice. Pakistan says military action by India was imminent.</p>
<p>After the attack, India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274">suspended</a> the Indus Water Treaty, and both countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907663#:~:text=PAF%E2%80%99s%20prompt%20response.-,Airspace%20concerns,-With%20tensions%20running">closed airspace</a> to each other’s airlines.

<p>Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations, Asim Iftikhar Ahmad met UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday and discussed the latest developments in the region.</p>
<p>“The discussion focused on the evolving security situation in South Asia as well as the imperative of de-escalation and the efforts being made to that effect,” a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PakistanUN_NY/status/1918037479095189670" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> issued by the Pakistan Mission to the UN said.</p>
<p>“The ambassador reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and stability,” it added.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric was asked at a UN briefing whether Guterres planned on travelling to India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Dujarric replied that the UN chief had offered his good offices during his phone calls to PM Shehbaz and Jaishankar in the wake of the attack.</p>
<p>“So I don’t think there would be any travel until there’s a clear message that, as in any instance where we have high tensions between two countries, that they’ve both accepted his good offices,” he added.</p></p>

            <p><p>• Tourists stopped from entering Neelum Valley, other areas near LoC<br />
• Govt orders religious seminaries to shut for 10 days<br />
• Sections of Karachi, Lahore airspace will remain closed for eight hours daily throughout the month of May</p>
<p>MUZAFFARABAD / RAWALPINDI: With the threat of an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">Indian escalation</a> looming over Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), its prime minister indicated on Thursday that his government was considering imposing an emergency in the territory if something untoward happens.</p>
<p>Also on Thursday, authorities stopped tourists from entering Neelum Valley and other sensitive areas near the Line of Control (LoC) in view of the security situation.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>The government has ordered all religious seminaries in the region to remain closed for 10 days, while the owners of hotels, guesthouses, restaurants, and marriage halls have pledged to place their establishments at the military’s disposal in case India launches an attack.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pakistan announced that certain sections of airspace over the two largest cities — Karachi and Lahore — will remain closed for eight hours a day throughout the month of May.</p>
<p>In addition, flights to and from destinations in Gilgit-Baltistan continued to face disruptions due to the closure of airspace in that region.</p>
<p><strong>Preparedness plans</strong></p>
<p>Speaking during a session of the Legislative Assembly on Thursday, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq said his administration was monitoring the situation on the Indian frontier.</p>
<p>He assured the House that his government had made arrangements to ensure the availability of food, medicines, and other basic necessities in the 13 constituencies located along the LoC.</p>
<p>“We have established an Emergency Response Fund and transferred Rs1bn into it… arrangements have been made to ensure food, medicines, and other essential supplies,” he said, adding that administrations and residents in the border areas had been directed to stock rations for two months.</p>
<p>In addition, official and private machinery was being deployed to keep roads open in the LoC constituencies of Neelum, Jhelum, Poonch, Haveli, Kotli and Bhimber.</p>
<p>Additionally, the State Disaster Management Authority, Rescue 1122, and Civil Defence had been directed to remain prepared for any emergency.</p>
<p>Stating that India had been exposed before the world as a terrorist state, Mr Haq urged the nation to remain vigilant, warning that the “vile adversary could resort to any ghastly act.”</p>
<p>“I assure you that if India commits any kind of aggression, the government, the people, and all political and religious parties and leaders are fully prepared to respond to its aggressive designs,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr Haq added that Indian occupation forces had resorted to unprovoked firing along the LoC on Thursday and had been given a strong and timely response by the army.</p>
<p>Later in the day, PM Haq hosted a multi-party meeting at his official residence, where participants, including leaders from outside the Legislative Assembly, ren­ewed the resolve to teach India a befitting lesson in the event of any aggression.</p>
<p><strong>Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>Also on Thursday, authorities began stopping tourists from entering the Neelum Valley and other sensitive areas near the LoC.</p>
<p>Many visitors who were unaware of the fresh restrictions were turned back from the Marbal checkpost, and even AJK residents who were not local to these areas were stopped from proceeding further.</p>
<p>In Leepa Valley, officials advised residents to avoid areas near the LoC and urged them to cooperate with law enforcement agencies to ensure their safety.</p>
<p>Separately, the government ordered all religious seminaries to remain closed for 10 days, citing a heatwave.</p>
<p>However, official sources indicated that the decision was based on intelligence rep­orts suggesting India mi­ght target such institutions, under the pretext</p>
<p>of hitting militant training centres. “We are dealing with such a cunning, cruel, and conspiratorial enemy that no vile act can be ruled out,” said Minister for Law Mian Abdul Waheed.</p>
<p>In a related development, the Joint Action Committee of Hotels, Guesthouses, Restaurants, and Marriage Halls of AJK held an emergency meeting to express solidarity with the army.</p>
<p>Chaired by Raja Ilyas, the meeting included members from Kotli, Mirpur, Bagh, Rawalakot, and Neelum, some of whom joined via video link.</p>
<p>Participants pledged to hand over their establishments to the Pakistan Army through the AJK prime minister if India launched an attack.</p>
<p><strong>Airspace closures</strong></p>
<p>Pakistan has also decided to close certain sections of the airspace over Karachi and Lahore between 8am and 4pm (local time) for the month of May “due to operational reasons”.</p>
<p>The restrictions will not be applicable on Sundays.</p>
<p>New Delhi had earlier closed its airspace to Pakistani planes on Wed­nesday, a few days after Islamabad banned Indian planes from overflying.</p>
<p>“Affected routes are located between flight levels 9,000 and 25,000 feet,” according to the latest Notice to Airmen (Notam) issued by the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA).</p>
<p>The decision affects selected corridors within the FIRs rather than a complete shutdown, and is being implemented as a precautionary security measure, officials added.</p>
<p>Although authorities say the closure will not significantly disrupt commercial flight operations, as aircraft will be rerouted via alternative flight paths during the restricted hours, these hours are considered peak times for domestic flights.</p>
<p>The closure comes in addition to restrictions already in place in the skies over Gilgit-Baltistan, as PIA flights from Islamabad to Gilgit-Skardu were cancelled for a second day on Thursday. The airspace was unavailable between 1:30am and 10pm on Thursday.</p>
<p>Separately, rain and windstorms in northern parts of Pakistan disrupted the flight schedule, with as many as five international and domestic flights delayed and diverted to other cities due to bad weather in Islamabad.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907938/air-india-sees-pakistan-airspace-ban-costing-it-600m-over-a-year-seeks-aid' target='_blank'><strong>Air India sees Pakistan airspace ban costing it $600m over a year, seeks aid</strong></a>
            <p><p>Air India expects to face around $600 million in additional costs if a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906341/indian-airlines-hit-by-ripple-effects-of-pakistan-ban-on-using-airspace">ban</a> from Pakistan’s airspace lasts for a year, and has asked the federal government to compensate it for the hit, a company letter seen by <em>Reuters</em> shows.</p>
<p>Indian airlines are bracing for higher fuel costs and longer journey times after Pakistan shut its airspace to the neighbouring country’s carriers in a tit-for-tat retaliation following an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir last week.</p>
<p>Air India on April 27 asked the Indian government for a “subsidy model” proportionate to the economic hit, estimating a loss of more than 50 billion Indian rupees ($591m) for each year the ban lasts, according to a letter sent by the airline to the Civil Aviation Ministry seen by <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>“Subsidy for affected international flights is a good, verifiable and fair option … the subsidy can be removed when the situation improves,” the letter said.</p>
<p>“The impact on Air India is maximum due to airspace closure, due to additional fuel burn…additional crew.”</p>
<p>Air India declined to comment. India’s Civil Aviation Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Air India’s letter was sent after the government asked its executives to assess the impact of the airspace ban on Indian carriers, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p>The Tata Group-owned airline is in the midst of a multi-billion dollar turnaround after a period of government ownership, and growth is already constrained by jet delivery delays from Boeing and Airbus. It reported a net loss of $520m in fiscal 2023-2024, on sales of $4.6bn.</p>
<p>Air India, which has a 26.5 per cent market share in India, flies to Europe, the United States and Canada, often crossing Pakistan’s airspace. It operates many more long-haul routes than bigger domestic rival IndiGo.</p>
<p>Data from Cirium Ascend shows IndiGo, Air India and its budget unit Air India Express had roughly 1,200 flights combined from New Delhi scheduled for Europe, the Middle East and North America in April.</p>
<p>The Indian government is considering options to reduce the hit to the airline industry from the closure of Pakistan’s airspace, three other people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>One of the sources said Indian carriers met with the Civil Aviation Ministry to work on possible solutions, including flying over difficult terrain closer to China, and some tax exemptions.</p>
<p>In its letter, Air India asked the government to liaise with Chinese authorities for certain overflight clearances, without elaborating.</p>
<p>It also asked the government to approve the carrying of extra pilots on flights on the United States and Canada to account for longer travel times.</p></p>
