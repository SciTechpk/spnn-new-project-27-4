            <p><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is unveiling the annual federal budget on Tuesday, expected to balance growth, austerity, and taxation, during a National Assembly session chaired by Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq.</p>
<p>As soon as the session began, opposition members started chanting slogans.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>At the beginning of his speech, the finance minister said: “This budget is being presented during a historic moment, as the country pressed on through difficult times.”</p>
<p>“This budget is being presented at a historic time when the nation showed unity [and] determination,” he said, mentioning the recent Pak-India conflict.</p>
<p>“The spirit with which we protected our national sovereignty, we need to ensure our financial security in the same way,” he stressed.</p>
<p>He continued through the noisy session: “Pakistan has now achieved economic stability and is moving towards a Pakistan that is prosperous”.</p>
<p>The minister highlighted the current account surplus, remittances and the stability of the rupee while also mentioning the positive reports from international credit rating agencies Moody’s and Fitch that upgraded Pakistan’s rating.</p>
<p>The federal budget for fiscal year 2026 has a total outlay — the sum of expenditures and net lending of funds — of Rs17.573 trillion, representing a 6.9 per cent decrease from the previous year’s budget.</p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; padding: 89.29% 0px 0px; overflow: hidden;"></div>
<p>Aurangzeb said that it was unavoidable to aim for a 14pc tax-to-GDP ratio and added that achieving the national targets was “impossible without the transformation of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).”</p>
<p>Detailing that transformation, the minister listed B2B e-voicing, AI-based audit selection systems for sales and income tax, e-billing and faceless audits, and a new central control unit to centralise data collection, among other steps.</p>
<p>Expanding upon the results, he said 390,000 high-value non-filers of tax were identified through data integration, with Rs300m recovered. The minister further highlighted that there was a 100pc increase in the number of tax filers, taking the revenues to Rs105bn.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#what-have-the-elite-done" id="what-have-the-elite-done" title="Permalink"></a>‘What have the elite done?’</h2>
<p>Prior to the session, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, following a meeting of the federal cabinet, questioned the contributions made to the national exchequer by the country’s elite economic group, ahead of the presentation of the budget for FY26.</p>
<p>“Today, the federal cabinet will discuss the budget and give its approval. In the previous quarter year, the entire nation has faced these challenges. This is in no way an ordinary achievement.</p>
<p>“The sacrifices the common man has made, the burden the salaried class has borne in the previous budget. They say ‘we are salaried [class] but still gave Rs400bn to the treasury […] what have the elite and the wealthy groups contributed compared to us?’,” he added.</p>
<p>“This is a question that the elite, including me, have to answer,” the premier noted.</p>
<p>He further said, “Pakistan is standing at a point where we have to take off,” adding that the country’s stability indicators were satisfactory.</p>
<p>“Be it the inflation rate, be it the policy rate, your exports increased, your remittances have seen a quantum jump, your IT exports have increased, and they have a lot of potential to increase.”</p>

            <p><p>The provincial government on Tuesday said it has decided to implement strict rules to improve traffic flow and prohibit parking on Karachi’s I.I. Chundrigarh Road — often known as the city’s ‘Wall Street’ — to tighten traffic regulation enforcement and improve road safety.</p>
<p>Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah issued the instructions after receiving a briefing on traffic management in the metropolis, a statement issued by his spokesperson, Abdur Rasheed Channa, said.</p>
<p>According to the statement, parking will be prohibited on I.I. Chundrigar Road, beginning from Shaheen Complex to the Merewether Tower. CM Shah also directed the authorities concerned to ban parking for all types of vehicles from Muhammad Bin Qasim Road to Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road up to the S.M. Law College.</p>
<p>I.I. Chundrigar Road, a major road in the city’s central business district, is often referred to as Karachi’s “Wall Street”. The road is a significant financial hub, serving as the location for the Pakistan Stock Exchange, major banks, and other financial institutions.</p>
<p>The chief minister was informed by traffic police authorities that parking on pavements and main roads will be banned alike, but motorists will be allowed to park their vehicles on Railway Ground.</p>
<p>Murad said that action should be taken against traffic rules violations and illegal parking, and vehicles with fancy or illegal number plates should be confiscated.</p>
<p>CM Sindh was informed that a crackdown is underway against vehicles with unregistered or non-standard number plates, and only official number plates will be acceptable. Deputy Inspector General of Police (Traffic) Pir Muhammad Shah assured the chief minister that police were taking action to ensure the implementation of traffic rules.</p>
<p>The Sindh government had recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915821">approved</a> a set of changes, including a ban on four-seater rickshaws, mandatory third-party vehicle fitness checks, and sharp increases in traffic violation fines.</p>
<p>The government made it mandatory to acquire fitness certification for both commercial and non-commercial vehicles, and outsourcing vehicle fitness evaluations to third parties. It also decided to ban the sale of tinted windows, fancy lights, and sirens, whether online or at physical shops.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915847">Fine</a> were also imposed. For wrong-way driving, the approved fines were set at Rs200,000 for government vehicles, Rs100,000 for other four-wheelers and Rs25,000 for motorcycles.</p>
<p>Driving a vehicle without a valid licence will cost a fine of Rs25,000 for motorcyclists and Rs50,000 for car drivers. One-wheeling or drifting will result in a Rs100,000 fine for a first-time offence, going up to Rs200,000 and Rs300,000 for repeated violations, the government said.</p>
<p>These decisions were taken in the backdrop of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895007">surge</a> in traffic accidents, particularly involving <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903332">dumpers</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908095">water tankers</a> that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024.</p></p>

            <p><p>Ten people died on Tuesday after a suspected shooter opened fire in a school in the southeastern Austrian city of Graz, the local mayor was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Several students and at least one adult, as well as the suspected shooter, were among the dead, Mayor Elke Kahr confirmed to the Austrian press agency <a class="link--external" href="https://apa.at/news/zehn-tote-bei-attacke-in-schule-in-graz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>APA</em></a>.</p>
<p>School shootings are much more rare in Europe than in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879262">United States</a> but in recent years, Europe has been shaken by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889723">attacks</a> at schools and universities, that were not connected to terrorism.</p>
<p>“Currently, a police operation is underway … The reason for the deployment was that gunshots were heard in the building,” the police said on X, confirming the attack in the city of Graz.</p>
<p>Police and interior ministry officials could not immediately be reached by <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>“The situation is very unclear at the moment,” police sources told Austria’s <em>APA</em> news agency.</p>
<p>EU top diplomat Kaja Kallas declared herself “deeply shocked” Tuesday by reports of the shooting.</p>
<p>“Every child should feel safe at school and be able to learn free from fear and violence,” Kallas <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/kajakallas/status/1932379758517445024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on X. “My thoughts are with the victims, their families and the Austrian people in this dark moment.”</p>

<p>Attacks in public are rare in the Alpine nation of almost 9.2 million people. It ranks among the ten safest countries in the world, according to the Global Peace Index.</p>
<p>In January 2025, an 18-year-old man fatally stabbed a high school student and a teacher at a school in northeastern Slovakia.</p>
<p>In December 2024, a 19-year-old man stabbed a seven-year-old student to death and injured several others at a primary school in Zagreb, Croatia.</p>
<p>In December 2023, an attack by a student at a university in central Prague left 14 people dead and 25 injured.</p>
<p>A few months earlier that year, a 13-year-old gunned down eight fellow classmates and a security guard at an elementary school in downtown Belgrade.  Six children and a teacher were also injured. The shooter contacted the police, who arrested him.</p>
<p>In 2009, nine pupils, three teachers and three passers-by were killed in a school shooting at Winnenden in southern Germany by a former pupil who then killed himself.</p></p>

            <p><p>Florence in Italy could hit 39C as hot weather sweeps continent, while parts of South Africa brace for snow</p><p>The severe thunderstorms that have been lashing parts of Europe over recent days are expected to give way to high temperatures this week. Several regions could climb to 10C (50F) above seasonal norms, with Italy braced for the full force of the heat. Florence in Tuscany is forecast to soar to a sweltering 39C on Thursday and across the weekend.</p><p>Germany, France and Belgium will also face hot weather from Wednesday, with widespread highs at least 9C above the June average. Many other parts of Europe are forecast to experience temperatures 5-7C above normal. This is the result of a high-pressure system creating a heat dome over the region, whereby sinking air compresses and warms as it descends, trapping heat near the surface.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/09/weather-tracker-storms-summer-heat-europe-south-africa">Continue reading...</a></p>
