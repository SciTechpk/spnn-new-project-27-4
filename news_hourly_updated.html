                <h2>ECP disqualifies 3 PTI lawmakers following their convictions</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday notified the disqualification of three PTI lawmakers over their convictions in various cases, according to documents available with <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>Last week, a Lahore anti-terrorism court acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi while <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925887">sentencing</a> Dr Yasmin Rashid, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry and others to 10 years in prison over a May 9 riots case related to violence on Sherpao Bridge.</p>
<p>According to the notifications, Chaudhry, member of the National Assembly (MNA) Mohammad Ahmed Chatta and member of the Provincial Assembly  (MPA) of Punjab Ahmad Khan were disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution (a person shall be disqualified from being elected [if] ‚Ä¶ he has been, on conviction for any offence involving moral turpitude, senteced to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years).</p>
<p>The first notification acknowledged Chaudhry‚Äôs conviction in the case ‚ÄòThe State vs Dr Yasmin Rashid, etc‚Äô, reading: ‚ÄúAs a consequence, Senator Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhry, has become disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan for being member of [the] Senate.</p>
<p>‚ÄúResultantly, Notification No.F.3(2)/2021-Cord. dated 10th March, 2021 to the extent of Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhary, as Senator, is hereby recalled with immediate effect,‚Äù the notice added, referring to the document notifying Chaudhry‚Äôs seat.</p>
<p>The second notice also acknowledged Chatta and Khan‚Äôs 10-year sentences on July 22, but in the case ‚ÄòThe State vs Zafarullah Khan and others‚Äô.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs a consequence, Mohammad Ahmed Chattha, MNA from NA-66 Wazirabad and Ahmad Khan, MPA, Provincial Assembly Punjab from PP-87 Mianwali-Ill have become disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution ‚Ä¶ for being members of National Assembly and Provincial Assembly of Punjab respectively,‚Äù the ECP notification read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúResultantly, notification No.F.2(5)/2024-Cord(1) dated 16th February 2024 to the extent of Mohammad Ahmed Chattha and notification No. F.2(6)/2024-Cord dated 17th February, 2024 to the extent of Ahmad Khan as returned candidates, are hereby recalled with immediate effect.‚Äù</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ah¬≠¬≠med Khan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921937">filed</a> a reference with the ECP against 26 PTI legislators over ‚Äòunparliamentary conduct‚Äô during the assembly‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920928">session</a> on June 27.</p>
<p>The disqualification reference was moved against the same lawmakers who were suspended for disrupting Chief Mi¬≠¬≠nister Maryam Nawaz‚Äôs speech and causing chaos in the house.</p>
<p>However, the speaker formally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925367">rejected</a> the petitions following successful negotiations between the government and the opposition.</p>
<p>In 2023, PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1769083">disqualified</a> for five years following his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">conviction</a> in the Toshakhana case.</p>
<p>In a notification, the ECP cited a court order and declared Imran disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution read with Section 232 of the Elections Act, 2017.</p></p>

                <h2>Finance minister heads to US for final trade negotiations</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has departed for the United States to engage in high-level negotiations aimed at concluding the Pakistan‚ÄìUS trade dialogue, the finance ministry announced in a press release on Monday.</p>
<p>Auran¬≠gzeb and US Trade Representative Jami¬≠eson Greer <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914442">launched</a> the negotiations through a telephonic conference call on reciprocal tariffs in May, agreeing to get into technical discussions in the coming weeks. The talks began after the US proposed a 29‚ÄØper cent duty on Pakistani exports and later temporarily suspended the decision.</p>
<p>By July, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925309">talks</a> in Washington had entered their final phase. Aurangzeb described the dialogue as ‚Äúvery‚ÄØconstructive,‚Äù emphasising a shared commitment to resolving outstanding issues and moving toward finalising a broad economic framework.</p>
<p>During this visit, the finance minister will lead concluding discussions with senior US officials including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Greer.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe aim is to formalise a comprehensive trade agreement expected to yield mutual economic benefits for both nations,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>The finance ministry highlighted that robust trade and economic ties remained the backbone of Pak-US ties.</p>
<p>It noted that the US is still Pakistan‚Äôs largest trading partner.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan is eager to expand cooperation into non-traditional sectors such as information technology, agriculture, and minerals ‚Äî all offering significant growth potential,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>It concluded that Pakistan seeks to boost bilateral trade beyond traditional goods by encouraging US investment in critical sectors, including energy and mining.</p></p>
