                <h2>Budget 2025-26: After sugar, FBR sets its sights on tobacco sector</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Langrial says new 15pc tax rate on passive income aims to address disparity with active business earnings<br />
‚Ä¢ Political leadership and intel agencies‚Äô help enlisted to ensure compliance, root out corruption</p>
<p>KARACHI: Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial on Wednesday detailed a sweeping overhaul of the country‚Äôs tax compliance system, vowing to crack down on non-compliant sectors, expand <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913558">digital monitoring</a>, and address longstanding loopholes in the tobacco, retail and passive income tax regimes.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Geo News</em>, Mr Lan¬≠g¬≠rial said that the government‚Äôs re¬≠¬≠cent enforcement drive in the sugar sector had resulted in a 39 per cent increase in tax collection without any change in tax rates, and that si¬≠¬≠milar measures are now being rol¬≠led out across other key industries.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe story of non-compliance in the tobacco sector will fundamentally change, just as it did in sugar,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He acknowledged that raising tax rates on the formal sector often led to market erosion by the informal sector, but said the government‚Äôs solution is to target non-compliant businesses directly.</p>
<p>‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878800">Sugar mills</a> that were non-compliant have gone out of business due to our monitoring. We are now achieving almost 100 per cent compliance in most parts of the country,‚Äù Mr Langrial said.</p>
<p>He also revealed that the Intelligence Bureau was tasked with monitoring FBR teams to prevent collusion and corruption. ‚ÄúThanks to the IB, we took several actions against black sheep within our own ranks,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Mr Langrial said similar monitoring has begun in the poultry sector, where initial checks revealed significant under-reporting of production and tax evasion. ‚ÄúOne month of monitoring revealed millions of rupees in income tax evasion,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>On the issue of passive income, Mr Langrial said a new 15pc tax rate on passive income, compared to 29pc on active income, in an effort to address the bias against business investment and encourage investment.</p>
<p>Mr Langrial also addressed comparisons between the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916440">salaried</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916465/tax-relief-for-property-buyers-but-not-for-sellers">construction</a> sectors, noting that such comparisons are misleading.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere exists a salaried sector inside construction, and sectors can‚Äôt be compared with types of income,‚Äù he said, emphasising the complexity of tax policy across different industries.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are saying that a person who has Rs50 million in the bank will be taxed at 15pc. This is an attempt to address the discrimination between active and passive income,‚Äù he said.</p>

                <h2>Karachi‚Äôs K-IV water project pushed back 10 years or more by ‚Äòpaltry‚Äô budget allocation</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Centre sets aside Rs3.2bn in budget for FY26 against requirement of Rs40bn for completion of water supply scheme<br />
‚Ä¢ JI says federal govt has ‚Äòliterally shelved‚Äô the project<br />
‚Ä¢ Sharjeel expresses concerns over earmarking of ‚Äòinadequate‚Äô funds</p>
<p>KARACHI: Lingering for over two decades, the much-delayed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1848037">K-IV water project</a> now faces another major setback as the federal government has allocated only Rs3.2 billion in the budget against the required amount of Rs40bn for the scheme, sparking fears that the city may have to wait for ‚Äúanother 10 years‚Äù or more for the completion of the plan.</p>
<p>Officials associated with the project, speaking on the condition of anonymity, have expressed deep frustration over the paltry allocation, warning that the funding shortfall has derailed any realistic timeline set for the project‚Äôs completion.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOver 63 per cent of the work is already done, and with proper funding, we were confident of wrapping it up within a year,‚Äù said one senior official. ‚ÄúBut with just Rs3.2bn, we are now staring at a scenario where it could take another 10 years to complete. This delay is devastating for a city already facing an acute <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910397">water shortage.</a>‚Äù</p>
<p>Now, with that timeline missed and funds inadequate for the current fiscal year, experts and stakeholders fear that the K-IV would be held in limbo for years to come.</p>
<p>For a city of over 20 million, already grappling with severe water shortages and infrastructure failures, the delay has real and immediate consequences.</p>

<p>‚ÄúKarachi can‚Äôt wait another decade,‚Äù warned one project insider. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just a budget line ‚Äî this is about water, survival, and dignity for millions.‚Äù</p>
<p>The K-IV project, originally launched in the early 2000s to address Karachi‚Äôs chronic water supply problems, has witnessed multiple revisions, cost escalations, and bureaucratic hurdles. Despite renewed federal attention in recent years, the latest budget allocation has cast dark shadow on its future.</p>
<p>Adding weight to the criticism, former federal minister for planning, development, reforms and special initiatives Asad Umar ‚Äî who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1693961">oversaw</a> the K-IV project during the PTI government from 2018 to 2022 ‚Äî said the current allocation shows the government lacks commitment.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Rs3.2bn allocation suggests the government isn‚Äôt serious about building the project,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs merely a political statement, not a development commitment. There was a real momentum. We had a vision and a timeline. This setback is unfortunate.‚Äù</p>
<p>It was Mr Umar who had pushed the K-IV forward during his tenure, recommending to the then prime minister Imran Khan that the federal government take over the full funding of the project, eliminating the previous cost-sharing arrangement with the Sindh government.</p>
<p>Under his supervision, the planning ministry had tasked Wapda with completing the project and assigned August 14, 2023, as the proposed inauguration date.</p>
<p><strong>PPP, JI express concerns</strong></p>
<p>Islamabad‚Äôs latest move has also triggered a kind of rift between two key federal allies ‚Äî the PML-N and the PPP.</p>
<p>The Sindh government of PPP has expressed strong reservations over the ‚Äúinadequate allocation‚Äù in the federal budget, saying it is taking the matter very seriously and in the process of reviewing the entire budget.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have serious concerns not only about this project but also the K-4 initiative,‚Äù said Sindh Information and Transport Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon. ‚ÄúThe funds allocated are highly inadequate. The Pakistan Peoples Party is taking these issues seriously and will thoroughly review the budget.‚Äù</p>
<p>He stressed the need for fiscal discipline and smarter resource management at the federal level.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve submitted formal proposals to the prime minister and urged the federal government to cut down on unnecessary expenditures,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf revenue is not increasing, it becomes essential to control expenditures. All spending must be managed wisely; otherwise, we‚Äôre putting our entire fiscal policy at risk.‚Äù</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jamaat-i-Islami leader Monem Zafar echoed similar frustrations during a press conference.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAgainst the backdrop of the severe water crisis in Karachi, the K-IV project became the most important plan for the city‚Äôs future,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut it seems the federal government has literally shelved it.‚Äù</p>
<p>He referred to the ‚Äúdisparity‚Äù in funding priorities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSome Rs133 billion was allocated to the Water Resources Division, yet only Rs3.2 billion was earmarked for the K-IV. That‚Äôs just 2.5 per cent of the division‚Äôs total budget. This clearly shows that those in the corridors of power don‚Äôt want to grant Karachi and Karachiites more than a symbolic fraction ‚Äî no more than Zakat or alms,‚Äù said the JI leader.</p>
