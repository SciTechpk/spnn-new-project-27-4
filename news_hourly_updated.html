            <p><p>One person survived as over 200 people were killed when an Air India plane bound for London with 242 people on board crashed minutes after taking off from the western city of Ahmedabad on Thursday, authorities said, in the world‚Äôs worst aviation disaster in a decade.</p>
<p>The plane came down in a residential area, crashing onto a medical college hostel outside the airport during lunch hour. It was headed for Gatwick Airport, south of the British capital.</p>
<p>City police chief GS Malik told <em>Reuters</em> that 204 bodies had been recovered from the crash site. There were no reports of survivors being found, and the <em>Indian Express</em> newspaper <a class="link--external" href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ahmedabad-plane-crash-live-updates-air-india-flight-boeing-london-passengers-death-casualties-rescue-2739697-2025-06-12" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> all 242 on board had perished, citing police.</p>
<p>The majority of the people on board are feared dead, a top official in the Directorate General of Civil Aviation <a class="link--external" href="https://theprint.in/india/ahmedabad-air-india-plane-crash-many-feared-dead-bodies-being-retrieved/2655314/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>The Print</em>.

<p>Malik said the bodies recovered could include both passengers and people killed on the ground.
Relatives had been asked to give DNA samples to identify the dead, state health secretary Dhananjay Dwivedi said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAt this moment, our primary focus is on supporting all the affected people and their families. We are doing everything in our power to assist the emergency response teams at the site and to provide all necessary support and care to those impacted.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Air India chairman noted an emergency centre had been activated and a support team had been set up for families seeking information.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda said on X ‚Äú<a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/JPNadda/status/1933099565369983233" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">many people</a>‚Äù have died in the crash.</p>
<p>Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu directed ‚Äúall aviation and emergency response agencies to take swift and coordinated action‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRescue teams have been mobilised, and all efforts are being made to ensure medical aid and relief support are being rushed to the site,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy thoughts and prayers are with all those on board and their families.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said a formal investigation had been opened into the cause of the deadly air crash.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFollowing the tragic incident in Ahmedabad, a formal investigation has been initiated by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB),‚Äù he said in a statement, saying the government probe followed protocols set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).</p>
<p>At the crash site, search teams worked into the early hours of Friday, scouring the wreckage for clues, as well as to locate the black box flight recorders, which should provide information on the plane‚Äôs final moments.</p>
<p>New Delhi‚Äôs government said it was also setting up ‚Äúa high-level committee comprising experts from multiple disciplines to examine the matter‚Äù and to ‚Äúwork to strengthen aviation safety and prevent such incidents in future‚Äù, Kinjarapu added.</p>
<p>Boeing said it was aware of initial reports and was working to gather more information.</p>
<p>In a separate <a class="link--external" href="https://boeing.mediaroom.com/news-releases-statements?item=131554" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on its website, it said, ‚ÄúWe are in contact with Air India regarding Flight 171 and stand ready to support them. Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders and all affected.‚Äù</p>
<p>Additionally, General Electric (GE) Aerospace, whose engines are often <a class="link--external" href="https://www.geaerospace.com/commercial/aircraft-engines/genx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">used</a> for Boeing 787-8 airliners, wrote on X that they were ‚Äúdeeply saddened‚Äù by the crash and extended their sympathies to the families of those on board.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have activated our emergency response team, and we are prepared to support our customer and the investigation,‚Äù the company wrote.</p>

                <h2>‚ÄòI can solve anything‚Äô: Trump once again offers to be arbitrator in Kashmir dispute</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump on Thursday once again offered to arbitrate the Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India, echoing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916481/trump-willing-to-work-on-kashmir-issue-confirms-us-state-dept">comments</a> made by the US State Department a day prior.</p>
<p>Trump had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910785/fo-reiterates-support-for-trump-offer-to-resolve-kashmir-issue">offered</a> to work on the Kashmir issue after he brokered a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914608">ceasefire</a> between the two nuclear powers following their most intense <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military confrontation</a> in decades. In a message lauding the countries‚Äô leaders for achieving peace, he remarked, ‚ÄúI will work with both of you to see if, after a ‚Äòthousand years‚Äô, a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir.‚Äù</p>
<p>Responding to a question on the steps the US plans to take in the wake of Trump‚Äôs offer, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce noted, ‚Äú[Trump] has been the only one to bring certain people to the table to have conversations that nobody thought was possible,‚Äù remaining hopeful that the Kashmir issue can also get resolved.</p>
<p>Fielding questions after a bill-signing ceremony on Thursday, the US president said that he ‚Äústopped a war‚Äù between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEventually they were gonna go nuclear ‚Ä¶ and I stopped it, I called each leader ‚Ä¶ and I spoke to them and talked about trade,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not trading with us if you go to war ‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre going to start throwing nuclear weapons around.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey were both unbelievable. They understood it exactly, they stopped. I stopped that war with phone calls and trade,‚Äù Trump added.</p>
<p>He further said that India is negotiating a trade deal in Washington, and a Pakistani delegation would arrive ‚ÄúI think next week‚Äù.</p>
<p>In response to another question, Trump said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to get them together. I told them, India and Pakistan ‚Ä¶ they have a longtime rivalry over Kashmir. I told them ‚ÄòI can solve anything.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will be your arbitrator. I will be your arbitrator. I can solve anything.‚Äù</p>

<p>Pakistan and India have been at odds since the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> in occupied Kashmir, which saw the killing of 26 tourists. New Delhi, without any evidence, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">blamed</a> Islamabad for the attack, while the latter strongly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">denied</a> the claims and offered a neutral probe. The two nations then fought a four-day conflict before the US brokered a ceasefire on May 10.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Pakis¬≠tan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">launched</a> a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent conflict with India, and counter New Delhi‚Äôs growing lobbying presence there. As part of its global outreach, the team <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916519">visited</a> London and will also visit Brussels.</p>
