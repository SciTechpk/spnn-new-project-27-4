                <h2>Pakistan, Iran aim to boost bilateral trade to $10bn: PM Shehbaz</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday said that the Pakistani and Iranian leadership were eager to raise bilateral trade volume between the two countries to $10 billion at the earliest, according to a joint statement.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Iran share close ties and have signed multiple <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1829340">agreements</a> across sectors such as energy and trade.</p>
<p>The announcement was made as the two countries signed 12 agreements and memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with PM Shehbaz and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian ‚Äî who is in Islamabad on a two-day official <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928047">visit</a> ‚Äî addressing a joint press briefing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBoth countries signed a number of documents to transform them into agreements and to realise the potential of $10bn trade target, adding that the respective delegations from the two sides would further hold detailed meetings to move forward in this regard,‚Äù according to the state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/global/pakistan-iran-keen-to-boost-bilateral-trade-volume-to-10bn-pm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)</a></em>.</p>
<p>During the bilateral meeting, which took place before the joint press briefing, both sides discussed the broad aspects of their bilateral ties, brotherly relations, religious and cultural ties, and held comprehensive talks to further boost them.</p>
<p>Speaking during the joint press briefing, PM Sharif condemned how Israel, on June 13, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/israel-iran-conflict">attacked</a> Iran‚Äôs nuclear sites. According to the Iranian government, 610 people were killed during the war, while rights groups put the figure at 974.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIsrael, without any rhyme or reason, unleashed aggression against Iran, which was not only strongly condemned by the government of Pakistan but by the entire 240 million Pakistani people, as there was no reason for Israel to stoke war,‚Äù PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>According to the report, the prime minister also expressed his condolences on the martyrdom of Iranian generals, scientists and civilians during the conflict and prayed for the departed souls and the injured for their early recovery.</p>
<p>He also lauded the Iranian leadership for showing bravery and wisdom during the Israeli aggression and said the Iranian forces and the people faced the aggression and exposed the Israeli defence system with volleys of retaliatory missile attacks.</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs principled stance over Iran‚Äôs right to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925977/iran-rules-out-giving-up-its-nuclear-programme">nuclear programme</a> for peaceful purposes under the UN charter, saying that Pakistan would stand by its stance.</p>
<p>In the fight against terrorism, he said both sides shared views that it could not be tolerated at any cost. ‚ÄúIf anyone in Iran was affected by terrorism, it was akin to a victim of terror in Pakistan,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The premier further said that the two brotherly countries would take effective measures to eliminate terrorism.</p>
<p>The prime minister, on behalf of the people and the government of Pakistan, welcomed the president on his maiden visit to Pakistan.</p>
<p>In his remarks, President Pezeshkian expressed gratitude for the position adopted by the parliament, government and the people of Pakistan for supporting Iran during the 10-day Israeli aggression.</p>
<p>He said the bonds of affinities and affection between the two countries and nations were deeply rooted in religion, culture and history, citing poetic verses of Allama Muhammad Iqbal, in which he stressed upon unity among the Muslim countries.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAdvancing the neighbourhood policy is among the priorities of Iran‚Äôs foreign policy, as Pakistan is not only our neighbour but also a brotherly country,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>The president expressed his satisfaction that, fortunately, serious and sincere efforts were being initiated by both sides for cooperation in diverse fields, and to take their current trade volume of $3bn to the projected target of $10bn.</p>
<p>President Pezeshkian said that his government was determined to take steps to implement these agreements, while the development of land, sea and air routes would facilitate trade.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWelcoming the Iranian president, the deputy prime minister/foreign minister reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs deep commitment to its historic and brotherly ties with Iran, emphasising their strong foundations in shared history, common cultural heritage, faith, and mutual respect,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>President Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan‚Äôs support and reaffirmed Iran‚Äôs resolve to improve bilateral collaboration in various areas of shared interest. He also looked forward to meaningful discussions with Pakistani leaders to further reinforce the political and economic ties between the two friendly nations, the FO said.</p>

<p>Separately, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal and the Iranian Minister for Industry, Mines and Trade, Mohammad Atabak, also had a high-level discussion on Sunday, where the two sides agreed to accelerate trade, remove border bottlenecks, and build trust-based partnerships across priority sectors, according to a statement from the commerce ministry.</p>
<p>Minister Kamal suggested organising targeted trade delegations that include representatives from federal and provincial chambers of commerce, enabling focused discussions on market access and regulatory facilitation, according to the statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve done this model successfully in Belarus and elsewhere,‚Äù he was quoted in the statement as saying. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do the same for Iran, starting with sectors that show the greatest potential for mutual benefit.‚Äù</p>
<p>The ministers also expressed a shared commitment to increasing the use of existing trade corridors and border facilities. Emphasis was placed on maximising the potential of neighbourhood trade, with Kamal highlighting how ASEAN countries have benefited enormously by trading within their region.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGeography is an advantage. Pakistan and Iran must utilise this discount of distance. If we don‚Äôt, we lose both time and cost benefits,‚Äù he stated.</p>
<p>Atabak also highlighted ongoing discussions about increasing Pakistani exports to Iran and encouraged swift follow-up on newly signed agreements.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTraders and industrialists in both countries are ready. They trust each other. What they need now is a clear and consistent facilitation mechanism from our side,‚Äù he noted.</p>
<p>Kamal said that beyond bilateral gains, such connectivity could expand to Turkey, Central Asia, Russia, and even parts of the Middle East, creating an economic bloc of substantial power and resilience.</p>
<p>Atabak supported the idea of holding a dedicated business-to-business (B2B) day during every high-level visit and offered to bring Iranian business groups to Pakistan for in-depth meetings, the statement said.</p>
<p>The two ministers acknowledged the historic depth of Pakistan-Iran relations, expressing that recent regional and global developments have pushed both nations closer together.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWithout the rapid engagement and determination from you and your team, we wouldn‚Äôt have reached this stage. The momentum we‚Äôve built must now be translated into structured trade outcomes,‚Äù Minister Atabak said while praising the Pakistani government‚Äôs proactive role in facilitating bilateral trade progress.</p>
<p>Kamal echoed similar sentiments, noting that both governments, as well as the private sector, had shown strong will and passion to work together.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a moment in diplomacy when the iron is hot ‚Äî and this is that moment. We must act swiftly. Delays only complicate things,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He emphasised that formalities follow passion and political will, and highlighted that Pakistan is ready to deepen its economic relationship with Iran through structured channels like the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/global/pakistan-iran-keen-to-boost-bilateral-trade-volume-to-10bn-pm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joint Economic Commission (JEC)</a>, regular B2B exchanges, and sector-focused delegations.</p>
<p>Both ministers agreed on the importance of identifying specific sectors such as agriculture, livestock, services, energy, and cross-border logistics for future collaboration.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the human element of bilateral ties, both sides underscored the cultural and linguistic commonalities between the people of Pakistan and Iran.</p>
<p>The ministers agreed to fast-track the next session of the JEC, ensure participation from both public and private stakeholders, and prioritise border facilitation and trade logistics.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith high-level political alignment and mutual trust, Pakistan and Iran appear poised to enter a new phase of strategic economic partnership that could reshape regional trade dynamics,‚Äù the statement said.</p></p>

            </a>
            <p><p>Experts from various professions assailed systemic injustice in Pakistan on Sunday, stressing the need for legal and civil institutions to be supportive and have a holistic approach.</p>
<p>At a plenary session of the <a class="link--external" href="https://habib.edu.pk/imagining-futures/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Imagining Futures Conference</a> taking place at Karachi‚Äôs Habib University from August 1-4, subject experts and stakeholders discussed human rights and civil liberties in Pakistan.</p>
<p>As the session began exploring Pakistan‚Äôs legal landscape, National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) Chairman Rabiya Javeri highlighted: ‚ÄúKnowledge is capital.‚Äù</p>
<p>However, she stressed, people should be aware of their rights but the ‚Äúsystem is messed up‚Äù.</p>
<p>Responding to a query from the audience about whether knowledge really guaranteed protection if women such as ex-premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1378568/who-killed-benazir-bhutto">Benazir Bhutto</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912155/sc-upholds-zahir-jaffers-death-sentence-in-noor-mukadam-murder-case">Noor Mukadam</a> could be murdered, Javeria pointed out: ‚ÄúEmpowerment through education or skills needs to be integrated into systems [‚Ä¶] educational, financial, judicial systems have to support you.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOnly 41 per cent of women raped report it, and even out of those, they back off due to societal pressure,‚Äù the NCHR chair said. Noting the low rate of conviction in rape cases (<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894972/conviction-rates-critically-low-in-gender-based-violence-cases-report">0.5pc</a> according to a recent report), she said: ‚ÄúWho will they go to? <em>System hi itna kharab hai, holnaak hai</em> (the system itself is so broken and horrifying).‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe system has to be responsive,‚Äù Javeri stressed, noting the need for human rights impact assessments for projects and systematic and gendered planning in budgets.</p>
<p>She underscored that this aspect needed to be embedded in ‚Äúservice providers‚Äù, which include lawyers, courts, police and teachers, among others.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHuman rights are god-given rights. Nobody can take them away.‚Äù</p>
<p>Javeri detailed certain cases she had come across during her role at NCHR, including one where a woman had gotten her daughter ‚Äî a Master‚Äôs student in her 30s ‚Äî abducted and sent to a rehabilitation centre.</p>
<p>The mother‚Äôs reason to do so, as told by Javeri, sent shivers down the audience‚Äôs spines: the daughter did not want to get married, had cats as pets (as if that‚Äôs somehow relevant), and a so-called doctor termed her ‚Äúdepressed‚Äù.</p>
<p>The case, Javeri noted, highlighted how ill-equipped responders and people involved in dealing with such situations are. There is a lack of regulation of mental health cases, with every other person presenting themselves as psychologists, and anybody can term someone a ‚Äú<em>pagal</em>‚Äù (mad).</p>
<p>Other speakers on the panel were Police Service of Pakistan‚Äôs Superintendent (SP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1662841/us-embassy-nominates-islamabad-polices-amna-baig-for-international-women-of-courage-award">Amna Baig</a>; Karachi Bar Association Treasurer <a class="link--external" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=https://pk.linkedin.com/in/advocate-haseebullah-panhwar-7857aa100&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiZ3I644-6OAxWd9AIHHUO7C8AQFnoECBsQAQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;usg=AOvVaw3HOmPHAHAuUIo632OHs0po" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Haseebullah Panhwar</a>; rights activist and academic <a class="link--external" href="https://habib.edu.pk/AHSS/abira-ashfaq/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Abira Ashfaq</a>; and Air Commodore (retired) <a class="link--external" href="https://www.rashidabad.org/profile/air-cdr-shabbir-ahmed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shabbir Ahmed Khan</a>, founder of <a class="link--external" href="https://rmwo.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rashid Memorial Welfare Organisation</a>. The session was moderated by <a class="link--external" href="https://www.undp.org/pakistan/our-team" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rana Kaiser Ishaque</a> from the United Nations Development Programme in Pakistan.</p>
<p>SP Baig, who was among the first responders who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636267">arrested</a> Noor Mukadam‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912155/sc-upholds-zahir-jaffers-death-sentence-in-noor-mukadam-murder-case">murderer</a> Zahir Jaffer from the crime scene, pointed out that the case was still being discussed four years later ‚Äúbecause she was educated‚Äù, compared to other ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926223/bahawalnagar-man-held-for-torturing-wife-to-death">worse cases</a>‚Äù she had seen while serving in Punjab.</p>
<p>While Baig believed that knowledge empowers people, she also noted that politicians and policymakers did not fully understand social equity.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIf culture is repressive, it will be reflected in your public service systems, such as police,‚Äù she said, explaining that approaching a police station was linked to a woman‚Äôs dignity in Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs how the police and LEAs (law enforcement agencies) have been portrayed over time. [But] there are women on the other side as well,‚Äù she assured the women attending the session, and suggested that it should be taught to people how to report to the police.</p>
<p>The police officer brought attention to a lesser-known term ‚Äî tech-facilitated gender-based violence <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906339/3171-complaints-of-tech-facilitated-gender-based-violence-reported-in-2024-drf">(TFGBV)</a> ‚Äî which not only means violence done using technology but also women being killed for even using social media platforms.</p>
<p>An image of a young girl that most people following the news have seen popped up in the audience‚Äôs minds; the recent murder of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915163/faisalabad-suspect-held-for-17-year-old-social-media-influencers-islamabad-murder-over-repeated-rejections">Sana Yousaf</a> that rightly ignited fury among women across the country.</p>

<p>Ashfaq, a human rights activist and an associate professor at Habib University, took aim at the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866652/icj-derides-blow-to-judicial-independence-as-26th-constitutional-amendment-becomes-law">26th Amendment</a>, noting it had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908065/suo-motu-facility-no-longer-available-constitutional-bench-judge">snatched away</a> the suo motu power that had allowed judges to take notice of public issues.</p>
<p>She also underscored the lack of legal education: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know how courts, bureaucracy and parliamentary systems function. These are basic things. We haven‚Äôt gotten out of slogans to look at economic justice, climate justice.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou have rolled back protective laws. We think about taxing property rather than thinking that housing is a right,‚Äù Ashfaq pointed out. Similarly, she wondered, ‚ÄúWhere is the right to food?‚Äù</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Panhwar, ready with his arguments, comprehensively but succinctly listed the troubles afflicting Pakistan‚Äôs judicial system.</p>
<p>A serious matter, but an apt chuckle from the audience as the moderator quipped ‚ÄúPakistan is also a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901963/a-hard-state">hard state</a>‚Äù as Panhwar described the local codes as ‚Äúhard laws‚Äù.</p>
<p>The lawyer pointed out that Articles 8 to 28 of the Constitution guaranteed several rights such as freedom of expression and movement, and that Pakistan was a signatory to various international conventions, but ‚Äúwe do not see any kind of implementation at all here‚Äù.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Panhwar called out the ‚Äúruling parties‚Äù for bringing the 26th Amendment that now gave them <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866480#:~:text=3%20stated%20above.-,Appointment%20of%20SC%20judges,-The%20JCP%2C%20besides">more votes</a> to decide who gets to be a judge in the superior courts.</p>

<p>Retired Air Commodore Ahmed offered some words of wisdom, which one would want to blast on loudspeakers at public service institutions across the country.</p>
<p>The creation of Pakistan has given us complete independence, he said, but ‚Äúwe have denied and killed that over time through our actions and self-interest‚Äù.</p>
<p>He stressed, ‚ÄúIf we are addressing a problem, then we must address it holistically.‚Äù</p>
<p>The retired officer also offered us, and Pakistan, hope: ‚ÄúAll negative, all dark. But there is a silver lining; that we are talking about it.‚Äù</p></p>
