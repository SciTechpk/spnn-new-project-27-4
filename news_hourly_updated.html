<p>In a post shared after the meeting, Mr Dar said he discussed bilateral relations with Secretary Rubio.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe reaffirmed our commitment to the long-term Pakistan-US partnership, with renewed focus on economic, trade, investment, IT/AI, and CT [counterterrorism] cooperation.‚Äù</p>

<p>In his post, Mr Dar hailed the ‚Äúconstructive role‚Äù played by the US in reaching the ceasefire.</p>
<p>According to a statement issued by the Pakistan embassy in Washington, Mr Dar said the US role ‚Äúhelped avert a potential nuc¬≠lear confrontation and restored calm to a volatile region‚Äù.</p>
<p>The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to regional peace and ongoing counterterrorism cooperation.</p>
<p>Secretary Rubio recognised Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúunparalleled sacrifices‚Äù in the fight against terrorism and described Islamabad as a ‚Äúconstructive actor‚Äù in efforts to ensure regional stability.</p>
<p><strong>Trade and investment</strong></p>
<p>The talks also addressed the future of bilateral trade and investment.</p>
<p>Both delegations ‚Äî led by their respective foreign ministers and joined by senior officials ‚Äî discussed opportunities in agriculture, energy, technology, and critical minerals.</p>
<p>Mr Dar described Pakistan as an ‚Äúattractive destination‚Äù for American investors and voiced optimism about progress in the ongoing trade dialogue.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFor peace in South Asia, we need continued US involvement,‚Äù he said, calling for an ‚Äúopen-eyed‚Äù policy that ‚Äúunderstands the risk of disengagement.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mr Dar highlighted the need for ‚Äúa sustainable mechanism for conflict resolution‚Äù in the region, adding that there could be no peace unless India agrees to hold dialogue on all issues, including Kashmir.</p>
<p>He also revealed the US and Pakistan were close to concluding a deal for extracting minerals from Pakistan and an agreement could be finalised in ‚Äúweeks and days, not months.‚Äù</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to a question about former prime minister Imran Khan‚Äôs incarceration, Mr Dar drew a parallel with the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui, who has spent years in a US prison.</p>
<p>He noted that Pakistan did not interfere in that process because ‚Äúthe Americans had followed their judicial system‚Äù.</p>
<p>Similarly, he said, Mr Khan was sentenced by Pakistan‚Äôs judiciary, which followed the due process of law.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen the due process is followed, others do not have the right to interfere,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>When asked if Pakistan would continue to buy weapons from China, Mr Dar said the country would go for whoever offered a better deal.</p>
<p><strong>New US envoy</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the State Department has appointed Elizabeth Horst as the acting US ambassador to Pakistan.</p>
<p>Ms Horst, a senior career diplomat currently serving as the principal deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, has arrived in Pakistan to take charge of her position.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am back in Pakistan (where I started my diplomatic career 20 years ago), this time for a short stint as the acting ambassador,‚Äù she wrote in a social media <a class="link--external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/elizabeth-horst-538b05224_im-back-in-pakistan-where-i-started-my-activity-7354070999417397248-i7Lq?utm_source=li_share&amp;utm_content=feedcontent&amp;utm_medium=g_dt_web&amp;utm_campaign=copy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat a joy to visit one of the most magical places in Punjab, the Lahore Fort. I saw how US support is helping preserve this magnificent monument and demonstrate our long-term partnership. The people-to-people ties and cultural bonds are what underpin our work.‚Äù</p>
