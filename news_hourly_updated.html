<p>‚ÄúI have ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that,‚Äù Trump said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114954549017557270" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on Truth Social.</p>

<p>Trump and Medvedev, who is deputy chairman of Russia‚Äôs Security Council, traded taunts in recent days after Trump on Tuesday said Russia had ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927617">10 days from today</a>‚Äù to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine or be hit, along with its oil buyers, with tariffs.</p>
<p>Moscow, which has set out its own terms for peace in Ukraine, has shown no sign that it will comply with Trump‚Äôs deadline.</p>
<p>Medvedev on Monday accused Trump of engaging in a ‚Äúgame of ultimatums‚Äù and reminded him that Russia possessed Soviet-era nuclear strike capabilities of last resort after Trump told Medvedev to ‚Äúwatch his words‚Äù.</p>

<p>Medvedev has emerged as one of the Kremlin‚Äôs most outspoken anti-Western hawks since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in 2022. Kremlin critics deride him as an irresponsible loose cannon, though some Western diplomats say his statements illustrate the thinking in senior Kremlin policy-making circles.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow hoped for more peace talks with Ukraine but that the momentum of the war was in its favour, signalling no shift in his stance despite a looming sanctions deadline from Washington.</p>
<p>Trump has said he will impose new sanctions on Moscow and countries that buy its energy exports ‚Äî of which the biggest are China and India ‚Äî unless Russia moves by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927617">August 8</a> to end the three-and-a-half-year war.</p>
<p>Trump has expressed mounting frustration with Putin, accusing him of ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922956">bullshit</a>‚Äù and describing Russia‚Äôs latest attacks on Ukraine as ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù.</p>
<p>Putin, without referring to the Trump deadline, said three sessions of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926159">peace talks</a> with Ukraine had yielded some positive results, and Russia was expecting negotiations to continue.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAs for any disappointments on the part of anyone, all disappointments arise from inflated expectations. This is a well-known general rule,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut in order to approach the issue peacefully, it is necessary to conduct detailed conversations. And not in public, but this must be done calmly, in the quiet of the negotiation process.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said Russian troops were attacking Ukraine along the entire front line and that the momentum was in their favour, citing the announcement by his defence ministry on Thursday that Moscow‚Äôs forces had captured the Ukrainian town of Chasiv Yar after a 16-month battle.</p>
<p>Ukraine denied that Chasiv Yar was under full Russian control.</p>
<p>Kyiv has, for months, been urging an immediate ceasefire, but Russia says it wants a final and durable settlement, not a pause. Since the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911511">peace talks</a> began in Istanbul in May, it has conducted some of its heaviest air strikes of the war, especially on the capital Kyiv.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian government has said the Russian negotiators do not have the mandate to make significant decisions and that President Volodymyr Zelensky has called on Putin to meet him for talks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe understand who makes the decisions in Russia and who must end this war. The whole world understands this too,‚Äù Zelensky said on Friday on X, reiterating his call for direct talks between him and Putin.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe United States has proposed this. Ukraine has supported it. What is needed is Russia‚Äôs readiness.‚Äù Russia says a leaders‚Äô meeting could only take place to set the seal on agreements reached by negotiators.</p>

<p>Ukraine and its European allies have frequently said they do not believe Putin is really interested in peace and have accused him of stalling, which the Kremlin denies.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will repeat once again, we need a long and lasting peace on good foundations that would satisfy both Russia and Ukraine, and ensure the security of both countries,‚Äù Putin said, adding that this was also a question of European security.</p>
<p>Putin was speaking alongside his ally Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, at talks on an island in Lake Ladoga that is the site of a famous Russian monastery.</p>
<p>Russian TV earlier showed the two men greeting monks at the Valaam Monastery, where they have met several times before, and holding candles during the chanting of prayers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ukrainian rescuers recovered more than a dozen more bodies from the rubble of a collapsed apartment block in Kyiv overnight, bringing the death toll from Russia‚Äôs worst air strike of the year on Ukraine‚Äôs capital to 31.</p>
<p>A two-year-old was among the five children found dead after Thursday‚Äôs sweeping Russian drone and missile attack, Zelensky said on Friday, announcing the end of a more than 24-hour-long rescue operation.</p>
<p>A total of 159 people were wounded in the multi-wave strike, in which Russia launched more than 300 drones and eight missiles early on Thursday, the latest in a campaign of fierce strikes on Ukrainian towns and cities.</p>

<p>The worst damage was to an apartment building that partially collapsed in the Sviatoshyn district in western Kyiv. Damage was also reported in at least three other districts of the capital.</p>
<p>Natalia Matviyenko, 65, sitting near the damaged apartment building, said she did not place much faith in Trump‚Äôs tough rhetoric.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTrump just says, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm upset with President Putin‚Äôs behaviour.‚Äô And what? No results,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>The US leader, who returned to power on a pledge to swiftly end the war, has in recent weeks rolled back his earlier conciliatory approach toward Moscow and signalled openness to arming Ukraine.</p>
<p>But a diplomatic effort to end the war has stalled, with Moscow not backing down from what Kyiv and its allies describe as maximalist demands.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="http://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#will-putin-listen" id="will-putin-listen" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòWill Putin listen?‚Äô</h2>
<p>On Friday, mourners laid flowers and lit candles at the wrecked apartment block, where rumbling excavators hoisted heavy pieces of rubble. The makeshift shrine included brightly coloured stuffed animals.</p>
<p>Oksana Kinal, 43, who was placing flowers to honour a co-worker who had been killed alongside a son, said she hoped Trump would follow up on his threat but also expressed doubt.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think America has a lot of points of leverage that can be used against Russia,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut will Putin listen to this? I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù</p>
<p>Kyiv‚Äôs air force said on Friday that Ukrainian air defences had destroyed more than 6,000 drones and missiles across the country in July alone.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe world possesses every instrument required to ensure Russia is brought to justice,‚Äù Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko wrote on X on Friday. ‚ÄúWhat is lacking is not power but will.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>Opposition alliance calls for grand national dialogue between political parties, new charter of democracy</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Friday called for a grand dialogue between all political parties of the country and a new charter of democracy between them.</p>
<p>The TTAP had held its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927866">multi-party conference</a> on Thursday, appealing for a new social contract to restore the Constitution and democracy, claiming that government officials had blocked access to the original venue in Islamabad, forcing them to relocate. The alliance was forced to move its conference to a private farmhouse after authorities placed barriers at its intended venue, Tulip Banquet Hall.</p>
<p>The coalition of six opposition parties formed last year, had formalised its organisational structure last month and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924669">declared blanket support</a> for all anti-government protests.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference today on the second day of the conference held at his farmhouse, TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar presented the alliance‚Äôs resolution.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe parties participating in the TTAP and its All-Party Conference (APC) agreed that at this time there is an urgent need for a new democratic charter among all political parties and political forces,‚Äù the resolution read, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs a result of the constant attacks of the hybrid system, the Constitution of Pakistan, the human rights given in it from Articles 8 to 11, and the parliamentary democratic system have become meaningless and today the social contract between the people and the state has been shattered.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTherefore, for the new charter, a complete consensus should be reached among all the political forces in the country after a national dialogue.‚Äù</p>
<p>The TTAP said that political consensus was needed on the following aspects: supremacy of the Constitution and Parliament, rule of law, independence of the judiciary, appointment of a free and independent Election Commission and fair elections, the situation in Balochistan, the situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the former tribal areas, the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, inter-provincial relations and water distribution, inter-relations of political parties and investigation of all illegal administrative actions, freedom of the media, rights of women and minorities and international relations.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Criticising yesterday‚Äôs events, the TTAP strongly condemned the conference‚Äôs cancellation at the Islamabad hotel by the administration and declared that this action was a blow to the constitutional and legal rights of citizens.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe APC expressed deep concern over the current constitutional, political and economic situation of the country. Today, no class or nationality living in the country is satisfied, the farmers are devastated, the salaried class is under the burden of taxes and the business class is leaving the country and transferring its capital abroad.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe poverty rate in the country has increased to an alarming level and currently about 45 per cent of Pakistan is forced to live below the poverty line and the purchasing power of the middle class has decreased by 58pc. The unemployment rate has reached an alarming level of 22pc, while the same rate among the youth is more than 30pc.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis has never been the case in the history of Pakistan. All the participating parties of the conference decided that a comprehensive and common strategy is needed to bring the country out of the current channels,‚Äù the resolution stated.</p>
<p>The alliance demanded an end to the ‚Äúwave of fascism and political manipulation‚Äù in the country.</p>
<p>It also condemned the ‚Äúunjust imprisonment‚Äù of PTI founder Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi, demanding their early release and immediate appointment of their pending cases in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and the Supreme Court for immediate hearing.</p>
<p>The opposition moot also lashed out at the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">recent sentencing</a> against scores of PTI leaders and workers, including the National Assembly and Senate opposition leaders, saying yesterday was a ‚Äúdark day in the political and democratic history of Pakistan in this regard and it once again shows that this hybrid system wants the complete elimination of the opposition in the country‚Äù.</p>
<p>On constitutional supremacy, the alliance criticised the recent amendments made to the Constitution and called for their removal. The moot also called for the dismantling of the Special Investment Facilitation Council, alleging that the rights and resources of the provinces were usurped through it.</p>
<p>Regarding the rule of law, the TTAP said that corruption in civil institutions and ‚Äúundue and illegal interference by political and defence institutions‚Äù had led to a loss of public trust and undermining of professional capabilities, which was causing a deterioration in the situation of law and order in the country.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile the justice system needs reforms, the concept of the rule of law has been severely shaken as a result of interference in the justice system, which needs to be corrected and the public‚Äôs trust restored.‚Äù</p>
<p>In particular, the moot said that the independence of the judiciary was reduced to a mere slogan after the 26th amendment and ‚Äúkangaroo courts are now busy only in the work of cleaning up the houses of the powerful‚Äù.</p>
<p>The TTAP said there was an urgent need to completely abolish the 26th amendment, take direct steps to prevent all interference in the judiciary and devise an uncontroversial system of appointment of judges to purify the judiciary and restore the reputation of the institution.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe letter of six judges of the Islamabad High Court has opened the floodgates for the demands of judicial independence in Pakistan. These judges are the heroes of the Pakistani people and we strongly condemn the actions taken against them and fully support their stand,‚Äù the alliance said, referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1824028/ihc-judges-detail-brazen-meddling-in-letter-to-supreme-judicial-council">letter</a> written by six IHC judges alleging institutional interference and pressure in judicial work.</p>
<p>On the security situation in Balochistan and KP, the moot said the prevailing conditions in the former were a wound for the country that needed to be urgently addressed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe first right to the province of Balochistan and its resources belongs to its residents ‚Ä¶ We demand that the illegally missing persons across Pakistan and especially in Balochistan be immediately brought to justice. The illegal private militias present across Pakistan, especially in Balochistan and KP, who are backed by the authorities, should be immediately dismantled and the policy of extrajudicial killings should be immediately stopped and the right to a fair trial given in the Constitution should not be deviated from in any way.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPolitical prisoners, including Dr Mahrang Baloch, should be released in full. Only civil law enforcement agencies should be given responsibility for maintaining law and order. Also, immediate steps should be taken to eliminate the harassment of Baloch students studying in educational institutions across Pakistan in the name of law and order and to eliminate the hateful prejudice against them,‚Äù the resolution said.</p>
<p>Responding to the conference, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar dismissed it as a rote development to sabotage the economy whenever important diplomatic events were due, such as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928047/iranian-president-to-visit-pakistan-on-saturday-fo">upcoming visit</a> of the Iranian president.</p>
