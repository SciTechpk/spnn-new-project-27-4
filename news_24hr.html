            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Tuesday rejected claims of Pakistani nationals being involved in the Ukraine conflict after a statement by Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
<p>Zelensky <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928754/pakistani-mercenaries-fighting-for-russia-claims-zelensky">claimed</a> on Monday that his troops in northeastern Ukraine were fighting foreign “mercenaries” from various countries, including China, Pakistan and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/pakistan-rejects-baseless-and-unfounded-allegations-of-the-involvement-of-pakistani-nationals-in-the-conflict-in-ukraine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by the FO today said Pakistan “categorically rejects the baseless and unfounded allegations of the involvement of Pakistani nationals in the conflict in Ukraine”.</p>
<p>“To date, Pakistan has not been formally approached by the Ukrainian authorities, nor has any verifiable evidence been presented to substantiate such claims.”</p>
<p>The statement added that the government would take up this matter with the Ukrainian authorities, “and seek clarification in this regard”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan reaffirms its commitment to the peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict through dialogue and diplomacy, in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter,” the statement said.</p>

<p>In a post on X on Monday, Zelensky said: “We spoke with commanders about the frontline situation, the defence of Vovchansk, and the dynamics of the battles.</p>
<p>“Our warriors in this sector are reporting the participation of mercenaries from China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and African countries in the war. We will respond.”</p>

<p>The Russia-Ukraine war began when President Vladimir Putin ordered the latter’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676939">invasion</a> on Feb 24, 2022.</p>
<p>The government has on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1737577">separate</a> occasions <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1776567">rebuffed</a> allegations that the country was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1789255/pakistan-signed-contracts-with-two-us-companies-for-arms-sales-to-ukraine-claims-bbc-report">providing arms</a> to Ukraine.</p>
<p>During a visit to Pakistan in July 2023, then-Ukra­inian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1765927#:~:text=%E2%80%98No%20arms%20deal%20with%20Ukraine%E2%80%99">rejected</a> similar reports, clarifying that the two nations had no deals for the supply of arms and ammunition.</p>
<p>Initially taking a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1678013">neutral</a> stance on the matter and maintaining that in its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1839772">diplomatic moves</a> till last year, Pakistan has called for <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/foreign-correspondent/pakistan-calls-for-meaningful-dialogue-diplomacy-to-end-escalating-ukrainian-conflict/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">de-escalation</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926704">ceasefire</a> in recent months as the war crossed the three-year mark.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928833/occupation-of-kashmir-defining-conflict-in-the-region-pm' target='_blank'><strong>Occupation of Kashmir ‘defining conflict’ in the region: PM</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Calling India’s illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir the defining conflict of the South Asia region, and a driver of its rogue behavior, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has termed the continued denial of basic human rights, dignity and identity to Kashmiris living under illegal occupation “a recipe for regional instability”.</p>
<p>The prime minister, in a message on Youm-i-Istehsal — the anniversary of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1498227/india-revokes-occupied-kashmirs-special-autonomy-through-rushed-presidential-decree">revocation</a> of India-held Kashmir’s special status by the Narendra Modi government on Aug 5, 2019 —  reiterated “strongest condemnation” of India’s illegal and unilateral actions to alter the demographic structure and political landscape of the India-occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>He also flayed India’s efforts to silence genuine Kashmiri leaders as part of the wider hegemonic and extremist agenda that informs its illegal occupation of the disputed region.</p>
<p>“The imprisonment of Kashmiri leaders and activists, including Shabbir Ahmed Shah, Muhammad Yasin Malik and Masarrat Alam Bhatt will never dim the resolve of our Kashmiri sisters and brothers,” he added.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Ahead of Youm-i-Istehsal, ISPR says India’s repressive actions, belligerent posture and incendiary rhetoric only exacerbate regional instability</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also reasserted Pakistan’s unflinching stance, moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>On the occasion, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir along with the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, Chief of Naval Staff, Chief of Air Staff, and the Pakistan armed forces reaffirmed their unwavering solidarity with the resilient and courageous people of India-held Kashmir.</p>
<p>According to an Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) statement, the armed forces of Pakistan fully support the legitimate and ongoing struggle of the Kashmiri people for their inalienable right to self-determination, as enshrined in international law and UN Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p>Separately, Kashmir Affairs Minister Amir Muqam, while addressing a presser, slammed Indian efforts to convert the Kashmiri Muslims into a disempowered community in their own land. Ever since Aug 5, 2019, he said, the Indian government had taken scores of measures aimed at changing the demographic structure and political disposition of occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>Some of the newly-introduced or modified laws pertain to issuance of domicile certificates to non-Kashmiris and ownership of land and property by the outsiders, he said.</p>
<p>The delimitation of electoral constituencies has also been changed and the lieutenant governor has been given more powers in administrative matters, he added.</p>

            <p><p>PESHAWAR: Elders from Bajaur and Mohmand tribal districts on Monday assured authorities of full cooperation to eliminate terrorism from the region, declaring it the “enemy of all.”</p>
<p>They, however, opposed any <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927438">military offensive</a> and forced displacement in the region for the sake of peace.</p>
<p>The elders gathered in a “consultative jirga” on the law and order situation in the province here with Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur in the chair.</p>
<p>This is the second such gathering, held in line with the declaration of the July 24 multi-party conference.</p>

<p>The first jirga, also presided over by the chief minister, was held on August 2 with elders from Orakzai and Khyber districts, Darra Adamkhel tehsil of Kohat district and subdivision Hassankhel of Peshawar district, at the Chief Minister’s House here. The participants opposed any military operation and forced displacement in the region.</p>
<p>They wondered if authorities would promise in writing that the military operation would eradicate terrorism from the region forever and that there would be no such action in the future.</p>

<p>Monday’s gathering was attended by adviser to the chief minister Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, Senator Noorul Haq Qadri, the chief secretary, police chief, the relevant commissioners, deputy commissioners and senior police officials, according to an official statement from the Chief Minister’s Secretariat.</p>
<p>The participants thoroughly discussed the law and order situation in Bajaur and Mohmand tribal districts and made several recommendations.</p>
<p>The participants expressed their commitment to peace, saying they want peace, so the government should ensure it.</p>
<p>They said that they’re ready to fully cooperate with authorities for the elimination of terrorism, which was the enemy of all.</p>
<p>The participants opposed military operations or forced displacement, saying such actions are unacceptable.</p>
<p>They recommended the formation of a broad-based and empowered jirga, comprising representatives from the federal and provincial governments, tribal elders and all key stakeholders, to engage in meaningful dialogue with the Afghan government and people to ensure the long-term eradication of terrorism in the region.</p>
<p>The participants said that the initiative of local jirgas was a positive step and called for it to be made more effective so that its outcomes could benefit other regions as well.</p>
<p>The chief minister reportedly asked them about the options available for restoration of peace other than military operations against terrorism.</p>
