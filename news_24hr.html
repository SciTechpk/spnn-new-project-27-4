            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said Pakistan won the war but sought peace and invited India to live as a “peaceful neighbour”, as the country celebrated Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’s success with a ceremony.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan began after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> air strikes on Pakistan, causing civilian casualties. Both sides exchanged missiles over the following week, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> tensions. An <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">American intervention</a> led to a ceasefire. On Monday, the directors general of military operations held the <a class="link--external" href="https://On%20Monday,%20the%20director%20general%20of%20military%20operations%20for%20both%20sides%20held%20the%20first%20round%20of%20talks%20via%20hotline%20after%20the%20ceasefire." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first round of talks</a> after the ceasefire.</p>
<p>Today’s ceremony, marking the Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanksgiving Day), was held at the Pakistan Monument in Islamabad and attended by PM Shehbaz, armed forces chiefs, and other civil and military leaders. It began with the recitation of the Holy Quran, opening speeches, a flypast, and national songs.</p>
<p>Beginning his speech, PM Shehbaz praised the martyrs, their families, his cabinet members, service chiefs, and the nation for successfully responding to the Indian aggression.</p>
<p>“We have won the war but we want peace. We have taught our enemy a lesson but we condemn aggression, he said. “We want this part of the world to be as prosperous and progressive as others through hard work, undying efforts and living like peaceful neighbours.”</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said he had had a meeting with the services chiefs on the night between May 9 and 10, in which it was decided that since the enemy had crossed “the last limit” and rejected Pakistan’s offer of an international investigation, a “measured response” must be given.</p>
<p>He detailed that around 2:30am that night, the army chief had told him on a secure telephone call that India had launched its ballistic missiles on Pakistan.</p>
<p>“He told me, ‘Mr prime minister, grant us permission to strike the enemy with such force that they never forget it’”.</p>
<p>The premier added that later that night after Pakistan retaliated, the army chief had told him: “We have given a befitting response and now we are being requested for a ceasefire. So, what do you think?”</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said that he had responded: “What could be greater than landing a blow that leaves the enemy’s head spinning and desperate for a ceasefire? Go ahead and accept the offer.”</p>
<p>“This is a brief account of a long story from that day,” he said.</p>
<p>He informed the audience that the technology used by the Pakistan Air Force had stunned the enemy and sent the trust and confidence of allies soaring. “This is a historic development that God brought about within a matter of hours,” PM Shehbaz said, adding that the military’s prowess was being talked about from the United States to Japan.</p>
<p>The premier said no major power can now block Pakistan’s path, with the entire nation united from Peshawar to Karachi, standing behind and supporting the army. He also reiterated his gratitude to allied nations for their efforts in achieving the ceasefire.</p>
<p>He went on to say that the conflict solved nothing, only bringing more poverty, unemployment and other problems to both sides.</p>
<p>“The lesson is that we have to sit down at the table like peaceful neighbours and settle our outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir. Without resolving these issues, I don’t think we will have peace in this part of the world on a long-term basis.</p>
<p>“If we want permanent peace then we need permanent solutions of Jammu and Kashmir and water distribution. Then once we resolve these issues, the sky’s the limit. We can talk of trade, exchange of business communities and cooperate in the field of counter-terrorism,” the prime minister emphasised.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Youm-i-Tashakur began with special prayers in mosques, followed by a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/GovtofPakistan/status/1923271405564469276" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">31-gun salute</a> in the federal capital and a 21-gun salute at provincial capitals, according to <em>Radio Pakistan</em>.</p>
<p>The main ceremony of Youm-i-Tashakur was also held at the Pakistan Monument in Islamabad. PM Shehbaz was the chief guest at the ceremony, while the chairman joint chiefs of staff committee and the army chief were also present there.</p>

<p>In a statement, PM Shehbaz said that the brave and professional armed forces have written a “golden chapter” in military history by giving an effective and forceful response to the enemy and foiling the enemy’s intentions, state media  <em>Pakistan Television</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvnews/urdunewsdetail/6422" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. He added that innocent Pakistani citizens were martyred in this cowardly attack.</p>
<p>“In response to the enemy’s aggression, our falcons struck such effective blows that the enemy’s military bases, weapons depots and air bases were turned into ruins,” the premier continued.</p>
<p>He also praised the leadership of Chief of Army Staff General (COAS) Syed Asim Munir and paid tributes to Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu and his falcons as well as the security of the maritime borders of the Pakistan Navy under the leadership of Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf.</p>

The ceremony was attended by various provincial ministers, advisers, special assistants, chief secretary and other officials.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media, CM Murad said that seven individuals from Sindh were martyred during the conflict with India, including six personnel of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) in Bholari and one civilian from Ghotki. He announced compensation of Rs10 million each for the families of the martyrs and Rs1 million for the injured.</p>

            <p><p>Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan on Friday urged India to maintain the ceasefire agreed with Pakistan, warning that the country would respond if the neighbour resumed aggression.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">American intervention</a> for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>The nation observed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911376/nation-observes-youm-i-tashakur-to-honour-armed-forces">Youm-i-Tashakur</a> across the country today to honour the armed forces and the people for the victory in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910381">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a> — a part of Marka-i-Haq — against India.</p>
<p>During his weekly press conference today, the spokesperson said: “The recent announcement of a Pakistan-India ceasefire is a positive development. We urge India to faithfully adhere to its implementation.”</p>
<p>He said Pakistan appreciated the role of friendly countries in facilitating the ceasefire and reiterated support for US President Donald Trump’s announcement on engaging with Pakistan and India to seek a resolution to the Kashmir dispute.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said the ceasefire was achieved by the role of several countries. “India’s portrayal of Pakistan as acting out of despair and frustration of Pakistan is baseless,” he added.</p>

<p>He informed that the military operations chiefs of both countries had maintained periodic contact since May 10 and both had agreed on a “structured mechanism for phased de-escalation”.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said that Pakistan had also returned a constable of the Indian Border Security Force on Wednesday as a gesture of “goodwill” in return for a sepoy of the Pakistan Rangers.</p>
<p>He said that at a time when the internal community was promoting regional peace and stability, “India’s rhetoric reflects a persistent tendency to distort facts, justify aggression and cast unwarranted aspersions on Pakistan’s nuclear assets.”</p>
<p>In contrast, the spokesperson said that “Pakistan is a responsible state and remains committed to the ceasefire and taking necessary steps towards de-escalation and regional stability.”</p>
<p>He requested Pakistan’s international partners to ensure India honoured its commitments and refrained from further aggression due to its “belligerent posture”. “Should India resume hostilities, Pakistan will have no choice but to respond,” he warned.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said Pakistan always believed in dialogue and the restoration of peace and wanted a solution to all issues, including occupied Kashmir, through negotiations.</p>

<p>Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and discussed regional developments, including the ceasefire.</p>
<p>Dar appreciated the UK’s constructive role in de-escalation.</p>
<p>The two also reviewed bilateral ties and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening relations and enhancing economic and trade cooperation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had a meeting with United States Acting Ambassador to Pakistan Natalie Baker that focused on key issues of mutual interest, bilateral relations, and expanding cooperation between the two countries, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>Both sides exchanged views on the post-ceasefire situation between Pakistan and India with Naqvi expressing gratitude to Trump and the American ambassador for their pivotal role in bringing about the ceasefire.</p>
<p>“The credit for the ceasefire between two nuclear powers goes to President Donald Trump,” he said.</p>
<p>He emphasised that President Trump had rendered a great service to humanity by helping avert a catastrophic conflict in the region.</p>
<p>The interior minister also appreciated the US president’s positive remarks regarding Pakistan’s leadership.</p>
<p>“We welcome President Trump’s encouraging thoughts about Pakistan’s leadership,” Naqvi stated.</p>
<p>Reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening ties with the US, Naqvi said, “We want to further enhance mutual cooperation with the US across various sectors”.</p>
<p>In response, Baker said the US valued its strong relationship with Pakistan.</p>
<p>“We have excellent ties with Pakistan and look forward to continuing cooperation in multiple fields,” she said.</p>

            <p><p>A sessions court in Rawalpindi sentenced a man to death on Friday for raping a woman.</p>
<p>Additional Sessions Judge Afshan Ijaz Sufi announced the verdict today, sentencing the convict to be hanged to death under Section 17 of the Anti-Rape (Investigation &amp; Trial) Act, 2021.</p>
<p>The judge also imposed a fine of Rs200,000 and ordered him to pay Rs500,000 in compensatory damages to the victim. In case of failing to pay, the convict will be sentenced to six months’ additional imprisonment.</p>
<p>The first information report of the case was lodged at the Saddar Beroni police station on July 20, 2024, under Pakistan Penal Code Section 376iii (punishment for rape of a minor) on the complaint of the victim’s mother.</p>
<p>The mother said she worked as a housemaid and had left her 21/22-year-old daughter and nine-year-old son at home when the culprit had entered around noon and raped the former. The woman said her children had raised a hue and cry with her son alerting someone who called her up and informed her about the incident.</p>
<p>The woman had urged the police for the strictest of punishment to be meted out to the culprit.</p>
<p>In February, a Rawalpindi additional sessions judge had convicted a man of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893013">raping his niece</a>, sentenced him to life imprisonment and awarded a Rs500,000 fine.</p>
<p>Rape laws in Pakistan have seen significant reforms, particularly with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1595907">Anti-Rape Ordinance 2020</a>, which introduced special courts for expedited trials, mandated medico-legal examinations within six hours, and established a national sex offender registry.</p>
<p>However, systemic challenges persist, as over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1624732">80 per cent</a> of suspected sex offenders are acquitted due to deficient investigations, weak prosecutions, and societal prejudices.</p></p>
