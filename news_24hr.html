            <p><p>RAWALPINDI: A toddler who went missing while playing in the street was found dead in a sewerage line in Ratta Amral on Thursday,  allegedly murdered by a boy, a close relative of the little girl.</p>

<p>Maryam, one-year-old girl, while playing outside her house in Mohalla Qazian Ratta Amral with other children, went missing.</p>

<p>After the disappearance, Maryam’s parents started a search for her, but failing to find clues, her grandmother, Ms Musarat Bibi, sought police help and registered a case under the relevant section of the law.</p>

<p>During the search, the missing girl’s body was found in the main sewerage line of Dhoke Ratta on Thursday. The local police reached the spot and shifted the body to the District Headquarters Hospital for post-mortem. An investigation launched to ascertain the facts behind the tragic death of the little girl.</p>

<p>Later on, police arrested the accused, who was identified as Azan Sultan, 10 and a half years old, and lived in the same house. The accused boy was shifted to the protection bureau by the local court.</p>

<p>During the initial investigation, the accused revealed that he had picked up the girl and put her head in the sewerage line water, which claimed her life. The police investigating officer said while quoting the accused as: “I didn’t like her.”</p>

<p>Police said that the CCTV footage helped the police to trace the accused as he could be seen picking up the girl from the street and taking her away. The girl’s body was handed over to her parents after the postmortem.</p>

<p>The girl’s father was an employee in the cantonment board. The father of the accused is an addict, as his mother had left his house and resided with her parents. </p>

            <p><p>Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to cut off government contracts to Elon Musk’s companies and the world’s richest man suggested the US president should be impeached, marking a stark end to an unlikely alliance and leaving onlookers wondering what was next.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914033">hostilities</a> between the former allies intensified when the president criticized Tesla CEO Musk in the Oval Office and the pair then lobbed verbal barbs at each other on their social media platforms: Trump’s Truth Social and Musk’s X.</p>
<p>“The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump posted.</p>
<p>Tesla shares closed down over 14 per cent on Thursday, losing about $150 billion in market value in the largest single-day decline in value in its history.</p>
<p>Minutes after the closing bell, Musk replied, “Yes,” to a post on X saying Trump should be impeached, an unthinkable move in Congress where Trump’s Republicans hold majorities in both chambers.</p>

</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The trouble between the two started brewing days ago, when Musk denounced Trump’s sweeping tax-cut and spending <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912732">bill</a>.</p>
<p>The president initially held his tongue while Musk campaigned to torpedo the bill, saying it would add too much to the nation’s $36.2 trillion in debt.</p>
<p>Trump broke his silence on Thursday, telling reporters he was “very disappointed” in Musk.</p>
<p>“Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” Trump said.</p>
<p>As Trump spoke, Musk responded in real time on X.</p>
<p>“Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930667528696828120" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Musk, who spent nearly $300 million backing Trump and other Republicans in last year’s election.</p>
<p>In another post, Musk asserted that Trump’s signature tariffs would push the US into a recession later this year.</p>

<p>Musk’s businesses also include rocket company and government contractor SpaceX and its satellite unit Starlink.</p>
<p>Musk, whose space business plays a critical role in the US government’s space program, said that as a result of Trump’s threats he would <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930718684819112251" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">begin decommissioning</a> SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft. Dragon is the only US spacecraft capable of sending astronauts to the International Space Station. Late on Thursday, Musk backed off the threat.</p>
<p>And in a sign of a possible detente to come, Musk subsequently <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930798791806050496" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>: “You’re not wrong,” in response to billionaire investor Bill Ackman saying Trump and Musk should make peace.</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#punching-back" id="punching-back" title="Permalink"></a>Punching back</h2>
<p>Trump and Musk are both political fighters with a penchant for using social media to attack their perceived enemies, and many observers had predicted a falling out.</p>
<p>Musk had become one of Trump’s most visible advisers as <a class="link--external" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1892748&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjusoOngNyNAxV6YEEAHbShKVcQFnoECBkQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0tNrfyso1xR9c5bRAX-fQK" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">head</a> of the Department of Government Efficiency, which mounted a sweeping and controversial effort to downsize the federal workforce and slash spending.</p>
<p>After leaving that role, Musk this week targeted what Trump has named his “big, beautiful bill”, calling it a “disgusting abomination” that would deepen the federal deficit.</p>
<p>His attacks amplified a rift within the Republican Party that could threaten the bill’s prospects in the Senate.</p>
<p>Nonpartisan analysts say Trump’s bill could add $2.4tr to $5tr to the nation’s $36.2tr in debt.</p>
<p>A prolonged feud between the pair could make it harder for Republicans to keep control of Congress in next year’s midterm elections if it leads to a loss of Musk’s campaign spending or erodes support for Trump in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>“Elon really was a significant portion of the ground game this last cycle,” said a Republican strategist with ties to Musk and the Trump administration who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>“If he sits out the midterms, that worries me.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Musk posted that “in November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.”</p>
<p>Musk had already said he planned to curtail his political spending in the future. Musk’s increasing focus on politics provoked widespread protests at Tesla sites, driving down sales while investors fretted that Musk’s attention was too divided.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722/air-force-credits-cobras-with-six-iaf-kills' target='_blank'><strong>Air force credits Cobras with ‘six IAF kills’</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Just past midnight on May 7, a low hum of tension filled the Combat Operations Centre at Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Headquarters in Islamabad.</p>
<p>On radar screens, dozens of Indian Air Force (IAF) fighters began clustering to the north, maneuvering with unmistakable intent.</p>
<p>Within minutes, Pakistan’s skies were alive with scrambling fighter jets — including the most recently inducted J-10C aircraft, flown by one of its most storied units: No. 15 Squadron, the “Cobras.”</p>
<p>Nearly a month later, the PAF formally acknowledged what many had speculated — that it was the Kamra-based 15 Squadron that led the charge in <a class="link--external" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824&amp;ved=2ahUKEwij3MXXityNAxUbUKQEHQKwGA0QFnoECCAQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw16SeImTvkSfG8xjGvkESUg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shooting down</a> six Indian Air Force (IAF) jets during what’s now considered one of the largest air-to-air engagement in South Asia in more than half a century.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Pilots from Kamra-based No. 15 Squadron expected to be decorated at a formal ceremony later this month</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eighteen of the squadron’s 20 J-10C aircraft took part in the mission, executing a high-risk intercept against a large-scale Indian formation as part of Pakistan’s defensive response.</p>
<p>In a post released by the PAF’s media directorate, the Cobras were hailed for their legacy and professionalism: “From heroic air battles in the 1965 war, where Flt Lt Imtiaz Bhatti downed two Indian Vampires, to Cold War-era vigilance during the Soviet-Afghan War, the squadron has always remained combat-ready… Now equipped with J-10C 4.5+ generation fighters, the Cobras continue to embody precision, courage, and aerial dominance.”</p>
<p>The May 7 confrontation — triggered by India’s launch of Operation Sindoor following a deadly attack in Pahalgam — saw more than 120 aircraft take to the skies from both sides.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>According to the Pakistani military’s official account, the six Indian aircraft downed included three Rafales, a MiG-29, a Mirage-2000, and a Su-30MKI — all hit by PL-15 BVR missiles fired from PAF J-10C fighters. Each launch was executed by pilots from the 15 Squadron, who are expected to be publicly named and decorated at a formal ceremony later this month.</p>
<p>A senior PAF official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, confirmed: “The pilots involved in the operation will be honoured soon. These are some of the finest aviators in our ranks — and their performance speaks for itself”.</p>
<p>The engagement, insiders say, was the result of a calculated bait-and-counter strategy. With credible intelligence of an impending Indian incursion, the PAF deployed four defensive counter-air formations and monitored over 60 Indian aircraft using its electromagnetic spectrum management systems.</p>
<p>“We fought the battle on our terms,” the official added. “Our kill chain was fully ac­­tive. When the command shifted, while aircraft were airborne, from ‘Deter’ to ‘As­­sure Kill, Deny Own Loss,’ the Cobras carried out their mission with precision and control.”</p>
<p>Among the targets prioritised were the Rafales — the pride of the IAF since their induction in 2019. “The Indians expected the Rafales to be game chan-gers,” the official said. “So we made them our first target.”</p>
<p>The Indian response was initially evasive. On May 11, IAF Director General of Air Operations, Air Marshal A.K. Bharti, downplayed the situation, merely stating that “losses are a part of combat” and insisting all pilots had returned safely.</p>
<p>But the facade cracked during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on May 31, when India’s Chief of Defence Staff, Gen Anil Chauhan, was compelled to admit the losses, attributing them to “tactical errors.”</p>
<p>The admission triggered a storm of criticism back home. In a bid to contain the fallout, Gen Chauhan resorted to baffling cricket metaphors to explain away the embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>History of the Cobras</strong></p>
<p>The No. 15 Squadron is no stranger to high-stakes operations. Established in 1956, the unit claimed Pakistan’s first confirmed aerial kill in 1959. It played a pivotal role in the 1965 and 1971 wars and later took on patrol and interdiction duties along the Durand Line during the Soviet-Afghan conflict.</p>
<p>Prior to the latest aerial engagement, the squadron participated in the 2019 Operation Swift Retort - Pakistan’s measured response to India’s Balakot airstrike. In that mission, two Mirage-VPAs from the Cobras conducted precision strikes using H-4 SOW glide bombs on open terrain adjacent to the Narian Army Base in the Rajouri Sector of Indian-Occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>Following that mission, the Cobras underwent a significant transformation. In 2022, they became the first PAF squadron to transition from aging Mirage aircraft to the more advanced Chinese-built Chengdu J-10C multirole fighters. The older Mirages were reassigned to the newly established No. 50 Squadron, while the Cobras’ elevation to J-10C operators marked their formal recognition as Pakistan’s frontline aerial strike unit.</p>
<p>The induction of the J-10C — equipped with AESA radar, advanced datalinks, and BVR capabilities - dramatically expanded the squadron’s operational envelope, allowing it to perform both air superiority and precision strike roles across a wide spectrum of missions.</p>
<p>Adding to the unit’s prestige is the fact that the current Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu is a former commander of No. 15 Squadron. On the night of May 7, it was Sidhu himself who was directing combat operations from the PAF’s nerve centre in Islamabad, personally monitoring every move.</p>
<p>“The Cobras are our sharpest fang,” one official said. “They’ve defended this nation in every war. May 7 was no exception — only this time, the stakes were even higher.”</p>
<p>Back at their base in Kamra, the mood is one of pride tempered by professionalism. The PAF’s official statement ended with a sober affirmation: “Throughout its distinguished history, No. 15 Squadron has demonstrated unwavering operational resilience and tactical excellence.”</p>
