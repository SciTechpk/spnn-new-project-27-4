<p>• CM Gulbar says region lacks funds to tackle flood damage<br />
• Seven districts affected; Diamer worst hit by daily flash floods<br />
• Villagers flee Rajanpur, Bhakkar, Layyah, Muzaffargarh as low-lying districts in Punjab submerged</p>
<p>GILGIT / LAHORE / DERA GHAZI KHAN: Gilgit-Balti­stan Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan on Saturday appe­aled to the federal government for Rs7 billion in emergency funds to deal with climate-induced <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926487/at-least-9-dead-as-floods-landslides-continue-to-ravage-gb-officials">disasters</a> that have caused damages exceeding Rs20bn across the region.</p>
<p>Speaking at a press conference at the CM House in Gilgit, the chief minister said the GB government lacks the financial capacity to handle the unprecedented disasters.</p>
<p>CM Khan was accompanied by GB Home Minister Shams Lone, GB Assembly member Jamil Ahmed, Special Assi­stant on Infor­mation Eman Shah and Special Assistant on GB Disaster Management Auth­ority Muhammad Ali Quaid.</p>
<p>He said unprecedented floods had impacted seven districts, with Diamer being the worst affected. “People in GB are facing daily flood events. At least one flood occurs every day,” he said.</p>
<p>He said that so far, 10 fatalities and four injuries have been reported. Seven deaths were reported from Babusar, two from Thore Valley (Dia­mer) and another from Astore district.</p>
<p>The chief minister said that 300 homes were destroyed, 200 were partially damaged, 40 water channels in 30 villages were swept away and 15 kilometres of roads, bridges, agricultural land, crops and public and private infrastructure were severely damaged.</p>
<p>He noted that only Rs1bn was allocated in the GB budget for emergencies and that the local government is also burdened with Rs3bn in liabilities from past disaster rehabilitation efforts.</p>
<p>“I appeal to the prime minister of Pakistan to immediately release at least Rs7bn to restore roads, electricity, water channels and to undertake other essential relief efforts,” the chief minister said and requested the premier to visit the region.</p>
<p>He recalled that the federal government provided Rs3bn during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921651">2022 floods</a>, but criticised the previous GB administration for misusing the funds, with the exception of a model village established for flood victims in Ghizer’s Bubor area.</p>
<p>“This year’s disasters are beyond our resources. I urge the federal government to help the people of GB,” he added, while also appealing to non-governmental and international organisations for support. A formal request has been sent to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Karakoram Highway, which was blocked at Chilas on Saturday, was reopened for traffic on Sunday. However, flash flood events continued to be reported across GB.</p>
<p>In Fairy Meadows near Nanga Parbat, a flash flood swept away over 200 goats, sheep and surrounding greenery. Rescue 1122 reported multiple flash floods in the Shigar district on Saturday, affecting crops and infrastructure in Qaimabad Tisar, Chatron and Garam Chashma.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Residents said flash floods disrupted road access, mobile networks and electricity. In Kondus village of Ghanche district, a devastating landslide destroyed over 50 homes. Survivors are in dire need of shelter, food, medical care and internet access.</p>
<p>Flood-affected communities in Diamer and elsewhere are facing severe shortages of clean drinking water and essential supplies.</p>
<p><strong>Punjab grapples with flooding</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, thousands of residents across several districts in Punjab were displaced on Saturday as widespread flooding inundated low-lying areas. In some regions, such as Rojhan tehsil of Rajanpur, residents resorted to hiring private boats after failing to receive government assistance.</p>
<p>Several villagers in Bhakkar, Layyah, Multan and Muzaffargarh also had to leave due to a medium-level flood. All their crops were damaged due to the flood, and their houses were also surrounded by water.</p>
<p>The hundreds of people living in the catchment areas of the rivers Sindh and Chenab also had to migrate on their own, along with their cattle, struggling to find fodder and shelter. They protested the government’s lack of relief efforts.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In Layyah, the third flood wave in the Indus River raised water levels to 450,000 cusecs. A protective embankment near the under-construction Taunsa Bridge collapsed, submerging adjacent villages and farmlands. Rescue machinery, including a multimillion-rupee excavator, was at risk of being lost.</p>
<p>Dera Ghazi Khan Commissioner Chaudhry Ashfaq told <em>Dawn</em> that the situation was under control and that the excavator would be recovered once the water receded. Relief camps have been set up in Karor tehsil of Layyah at several locations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dera Ghazi Khan Deputy Com­missioner Usman Khalid said water levels were expected to remain stable by evening and noted that seven relief camps had been established in Taunsa. He confirmed that no mass evacuations had occurred yet.</p>
<p>Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb visited flood-hit areas in Pindi Bhattian and Hafizabad, where dozens of villages were submerged due to heavy rains. She met with residents, announced one-month rations for affected families and inspected medical and livestock camps.</p>
<p>She said a survey had been conducted to assess flood damage and pledged to provide financial assistance in a transparent manner. Emergency measures have been implemented in affected areas, with residents advised to relocate from dilapidated structures.</p>
<p>Earlier, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Punjab issued flood warnings for the Chenab and Jhelum rivers and their tributaries, anticipating rising water levels from July 28 to 31.</p>
<p>Punjab’s Relief Com­missioner Nabil Javed directed local officials and departments, including agriculture, irrigation, health, livestock and transport, to remain on high alert and ensure that emergency arrangements, including food, shelter and clean water, were in place.</p>
<p>PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia urged the public to follow safety advisories and cooperate with authorities during emergency evacuations. He assured that the government would provide full support to both people and their livestock.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926848/sbp-eases-account-opening-pushes-for-digital-inclusion' target='_blank'><strong>SBP eases account opening, pushes for digital inclusion</strong></a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has directed banks to open new accounts within two days as part of efforts to enhance financial inclusion and improve customer experience.</p>
<p>In a statement, the SBP said it has simplified the account opening process for both individuals and businesses, and instructed regulated entities (REs) to offer digital payment acceptance solutions to merchants operating in-store and online.</p>
<p>“State Bank has advised regulated entities to ensure that the turnaround time for new account opening does not exceed two days for the general public,” said the statement, adding that customers should be able to track the status of their applications, ensuring greater transparency and user-friendliness.</p>
<p>The SBP has issued a consolidated framework for customers, aimed at simplifying and standardising account opening procedures, rationalising documentation requirements, and enabling digital and convenient interfaces across multiple customer touchpoints.</p>
<p>“These measures are part of SBP’s ongoing efforts to expand financial inclusion and enhance customer convenience,” the central bank stated.</p>
<p>According to PwC’s Banking Publication 2024, released by A.F. Ferguson &amp; Co, Pakistan’s financial inclusion rate rose to 60pc in 2023. The country now accounts for 4pc of the world’s unbanked adult population, down from 9pc in 2021.</p>
<p>In recent years, the SBP has introduced several initiatives to broaden access to financial services, including branchless banking, Asaan accounts, digital onboarding, and specialised accounts for freelancers, overseas Pakistanis, and remittance recipients.</p>
<p>The new framework allows customers to open all types of bank accounts through digital channels, making the process more secure, efficient, and accessible.</p>
<p>In addition, the SBP has directed banks and REs to ensure all merchants— new and existing — are equipped with at least one digital payment acceptance method. These may include Raast QR codes, Point of Sale (POS) terminals, or e-commerce/Raast checkout options to facilitate digital payments for both physical and online purchases.</p>
<p>To promote low-cost adoption among smaller businesses, the SBP has asked REs to classify merchants into micro, small, and registered categories, tailoring support accordingly.</p>

            <p><p>QUETTA: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) sent the mother of a woman <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925555">shot</a> in the name of ‘honour’ to prison on judicial remand on Saturday.</p>
<p>Police produced Gul Jan Bibi before Judge Muhammad Ali Mobeen of the ATC-I after the expiry of her <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926410/mother-of-main-accused-remanded-in-quetta-honour-killing-case">two-day physical remand</a> and the investigation officer informed the court that she was not required for further investigation.</p>
<p>After the initial arguments from both sides, the jud­ge sent the woman on judicial remand.</p>
<p>Gul Jan Bibi was arrested after her video statement went viral, in which she defended the killing of her daughter, Bano Bibi, and a man in the name of ‘honour’ in Dagari, on the outskirts of Quetta.</p>
<p>“They were killed according to the Baloch traditions and customs and we have not committed any sin by killing them,” Gul Jan Bibi said about the incident that shook the nation after videos of a group of men shooting the victims surfaced online earlier this month.</p>
<p>So far, around 15 people, including the tribal chief of Satakzai tribe, Sardar Sherbaz Khan Satakzai, have been arrested. However, the prime accused, Jalal Satakzai, who allegedly opened fire and killed his elder sister, and the man, could not be arrested.</p>
<p><strong>Protest</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, human rights organisations and civil society staged a protest on Saturday to condemn the killings.</p>
<p>The protest was jointly organised by the Women Action Forum, National Commission on Human Rights, HRCP and Bol Utho Group.</p>
<p>A large number of human rights activists and members of civil society gathered in front of the Quetta Press Club. They took out a rally led by rights activists Prof Farkhanda Auran­g­zeb, Huma Fouladi, Seema Batool, Hameeda Noor and others.</p>
<p>The protesters condemned the incident and said honour killings were an intolerable act.</p>
<p>They demanded that all those involved in this crime be brought to justice.</p>
<p>“Nobody has the right to take law in his hand and kill people in the name of so-called honour,” Ms Aurangzeb said.</p>
<p>The protesters urged the government to protect women from such atrocities.</p>
