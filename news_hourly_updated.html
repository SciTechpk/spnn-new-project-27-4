                <h2>Assistant commissioner among 5 killed in Bajaur blast</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least five people, including an assistant commissioner, were killed and 11 others injured on Wednesday in a bomb explosion in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Bajaur district.</p>
<p>Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafique told <em>Dawn.com</em> that five people, including two policemen and a civilian, were killed in the explosion targeting a government vehicle on Nawagai Road in Siddiqabad railway attack area of Khar tehsil.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe blast was so intense that the vehicle targeted was completely destroyed,‚Äù he said, adding that 11 people were injured in the blast and immediately transported to Khar Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>The DPO said that security was increased in the area and relief activities were underway.</p>
<p>The deceased include Nawagai Assistant Commissioner Faisal Ismail, Tehsildar Abdul Wakil, Subedar Noor Hakim, and police constable Rashid.</p>
<p>KP Health Adviser Ihtisham Ali strongly condemned the blast and expressed grief over the demise of the assistant commissioner and others in the incident.</p>
<p>He contacted the district health officer and the medical superintendent of District Headquarters Hospital Khar Bajaur and enquired about the well-being of those injured in the attack.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAn emergency has been imposed in Bajaur hospitals and health department staff has been alerted for first aid,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The health adviser assured the pubic that medical assistance would be provided to the injured.</p>
<p>KP Inspector General of Police (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed sought a report on the blast from the Malakand regional police officer (RPO).</p>
<p>He also ordered to speed up intelligence-based operations against the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group and directed the Counter-Terrorism Department‚Äôs additional inspector general of police to send a special team to Bajaur.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA special branch is obtaining intelligence related to the incident,‚Äù Hameed said, adding that according to initial information, the TTP targeted the assistant commissioner‚Äôs vehicle.</p>
<p>Hameed said that teams were formed ‚Äúto arrest the elements involved in the incident while all necessary evidence is being collected from the spot‚Äù, adding that bomb disposal teams were present on site.</p>
<p>Those elements disturbing the country and province‚Äôs peace will be strictly dealt with, the KP police chief said.</p>
<p>KP government spokesperson Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif strongly condemned the incident and said the loss of lives was regrettable.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe KP chief minister has issued orders for an enquiry into the incident and to provide medical facilities to the injured,‚Äù Saif said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThose who are hostile elements to the country will not be allowed to succeed in their nefarious purposes and will be brought to justice.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>PSX scales 130,000 barrier as record-breaking rally continues</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Bulls continued their reign over the trading floor at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday as shares scaled the 130,000-point barrier to reach a new high.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index opened on a positive note, rising by 1,430.07 points (1.12 per cent) to reach 129,629.49 points at 10:07am, from the previous close of 128,199.42 points.</p>
<p>Shares then rose further to reach 130,344.03 points at 3:30pm, gaining 2,144.61 points (1.67pc) from yesterday.</p>
<p>The PSX extended its record-breaking <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920553">rally</a> for the fourth consecutive session today, which analysts have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921539">attributed</a> to easing inflation and signs of macroeconomic stability.</p>
<p>The annual inflation rate has dropped sharply to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921571/inflation-slumps-to-9-year-low-at-449pc">nine-year low</a> of 4.49 per cent during the fiscal year 2024-25 from 23.41pc in the previous year. Pakistan is currently experiencing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902445">disinflation</a>, which reflects a slowdown in the rate of inflation, as opposed to deflation, which indicates a general decline in overall price levels.</p>
<p>Optimism around fiscal reforms announced in the federal budget also contributed to the rally.</p>
<p>‚ÄúContinuation of monetary easing due to falling inflation driven by fiscal discipline, strong external account and focus on structural reforms would keep equities in the limelight,‚Äù Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, said yesterday.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921539#:~:text=Prime%20Minister%20Shehbaz%20Sharif%20expressed%20gratitude">statement</a>, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif asserted the KSE-100‚Äôs record close reflected growing confidence in the government‚Äôs economic policies. He described the index‚Äôs performance as a testament to the strengthening and stabilising sentiment surrounding the national economy.</p>
