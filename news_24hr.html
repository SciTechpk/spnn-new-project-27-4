            <p><p>At least six tourists were killed in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer district as heavy floods battered the region, while a search for missing visitors was underway, an official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudburst-induced</a> floods wreaked havoc across the region. The flood-related <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829">death toll</a> in the region rose to five on Tuesday, after four lost their lives and 15 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719">went missing</a> on Monday.</p>
<p>GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that rescue teams recovered another body in Babusar valley, taking the total number of deaths to six. “The search operation to locate the remaining tourists at Babusar is underway,” he added.</p>
<p>According to Rescue 1122, GB’s Ghanche district experienced floods in various areas. Flash floods in Kandos villages damaged a dozen homes, a dispensary, mosques, agricultural land and crops, it said.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 also stated that flash floods in Sikarkoi damaged several houses and other infrastructure in Dass Mohallah and the surrounding areas in Gilgit.</p>

<p>Separately, rescue teams on Thursday recovered the body of a retired colonel who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/pmd-issues-glof-alert-for-gb-kp-as-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-from-diamer-amid-floods#:~:text=Two%20swept%20away%20in%20Rawalpindi%E2%80%99s%20DHA'">went missing</a> after his car was swept away by floodwaters and slipped into a drain in Rawalpindi last week, while a search for his daughter continues, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>Rescue efforts have been underway since Tuesday, when Retired Colonel Ishaq Qazi, aged approximately 62–64 years, and his 25-year-old daughter went missing after the car they were in was swept away by rainwater.</p>
<p>District Emergency Officer (DEO) Sibghatullah said, “The body of Ishaq had been found near the Soan River bridge, while rescue operations are underway to look for his daughter.”</p>
<p>Earlier today, Sibghatullah had said that rescue operations had entered a third day to search for the duo, while parts of their car had been found.</p>
<p>“Rescue 1122 found the bonnet and a door of the car under the Soan River bridge,” he said.</p>
<p>According to a statement by Islamabad’s Sihala police station on Tuesday, the duo were in a grey Honda vehicle and were residents of Defence Housing Authority’s Phase 5.</p>
<p>“Due to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain,” the police statement from Tuesday said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, two girls were among four people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925919">swept away</a> in separate incidents due to flash flooding in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>Pakistan experiences <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925461">monsoon rainfall</a> from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>Last week, Section 144 was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924761">imposed</a> across Punjab along with a state of emergency in several districts as heavy rains triggered flooding and claimed over 60 lives across the province in 24 hours.</p>

<p>On the other hand, residents of a housing society blocked Rawalpindi’s Grand Trunk Road after the rescue teams could not recover the body of a teenager who had drowned a day earlier.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, a 17-year-old boy drowned while crossing a nullah near the Metro City Housing Society. He was walking on a small passage when high-speed torrents swept him away in deep waters.</p>
<p>Two of his relatives jumped in the water to rescue him, but they told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the water was moving at high speed and the boy could not be saved.</p>
<p>Gujar Khan assistant superintendent of police and assistant commissioner also reached the spot and called the Rescue 1122 team, who were unable to retrieve the body as of the filing of this report. The residents of the area blocked the GT Road, citing the “inaction and incapacity of Rescue 1122 in recovering the victim’s body after many hours”.</p></p>

            <p><p>A bogie of a Quetta-bound Bolan Mail train was “partially damaged” on Thursday after an explosion struck a railway track in Balochistan’s Sibi district, officials said.</p>
<p>The 3Up train usually departs Karachi City Station in the day and arrives the next day in Quetta, with over 20 stops on its way, according to Pakistan Railways’ <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakrailways.gov.pk/train" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>“The railway track between Bakhtiarabad and Damboli areas was blown up with explosives, resulting in the Bolan Mail heading from Karachi to Quetta being hit,” station master Murtaza told reporters in Sibi.</p>
<p>He added that bogie No. 7 of the train was “partially damaged” in the incident. The train reached the Sibi railway station safely, he confirmed.</p>
<p>A statement by Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Quetta Railway divisional superintendent, said: “We were informed that a blast occurred on the track at KM No. 200 between Damboli and Dangra while train 3UP was passing.</p>
<p>“However, the train passed safely and is now reaching Sibi. Train 40UP has been controlled at DMJJ (Dera Murad Jamali Station) as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents when train tracks were blown up, targeting the province’s transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>Train services betw­een Quetta and the rest of the country were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900566">restored</a> on March 27, after they were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897306/all-trains-to-and-from-balochistan-suspended">suspended</a> due to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419">unprecedented hijacking</a> of the Pesha­war-bound Jaffar Express earlier that month.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897595/balochistan-standoff-ends-after-all-jaffar-express-hostages-rescued#:~:text=In%20all%2C%2021%20passengers%20lost%20their%20lives%2C%20while%20four%20FC%20personnel%20were%20martyred%2C%20the%20ISPR%20DG%20said.">21 passengers</a> and four security personnel. “All 33 terrorists” were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.</p>
<p>In June, a powerful explosion of a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks caused four bogies of the Jaffer Express to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917945">derail in Jacobabad</a>. No one was hurt in the incident.</p>
<p>In April, the 3UP train was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904018">stopped</a> at Jacobabad railway station due to security reasons.</p></p>

            <p><p>Javelin ace Arshad Nadeem could miss two upcoming Diamond League championships next month as he undergoes post-surgery rehabilitation in London, in the hopes of a full recovery ahead of the Tokyo World Athletic Championships this September.</p>
<p>The Olympic champion was set to travel to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912524">England</a> this month to prepare for the World Championships, ahead of the Diamond League meet in Silesia, Poland on August 16 and Zurich, Switzerland on Aug 27-28.</p>
<p>Last week, however, he underwent surgery on his calf muscle to address a recurring injury. The interventional procedure was done by Dr Ali Bajwa at Spire Hospital in Cambridge, United Kingdom.</p>

<p>“We are now doing rehab work with a physiotherapist in London,” <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850440/its-all-or-nothing-for-arshad-nadeem-in-paris">Arshad Nadeem</a>’s coach, Salman Butt, told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>“This is a two-week plan before we test ourselves for going back to regular workouts,” Butt added.</p>
<p>“We are trying to achieve good form for the World Championship in Tokyo and maybe compete in one competition before Tokyo if Arshad regains good form by then.”</p>
<p>It was after his fifth-place finish at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics that Butt began coaching Arshad. A gold medal at the World Championships will complete his trifecta after he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850946">won gold</a> at last year’s Paris Olympics and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1703858">2022 Commonwealth Games</a> in Birmingham.</p>
<p>He won a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1772632&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjXxqGVptWOAxVoA9sEHZcAK_oQFnoECCEQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0BC-426YtHHBPAXoTft2w1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">silver medal</a> at the previous edition of the World Championships in Budapest in 2023, behind Indian rival Neeraj Chopra.</p>
<p>In an earlier conversation with <em>Dawn.com</em>, Butt had noted that the rehabilitation process would take about two weeks. Ahead of the surgery, he said that Arshad was pain-free and his team had adopted a quick remedy.</p>
<p>“We contacted our doctor at Cambridge, got an appointment within three days, and had an MRI done,” Butt had said, adding that he was grateful for the expedited process. At the time, it was unclear whether Arshad would recover in time for the Diamond League championships in Poland and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Arshad made this year’s international debut in style when he won <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914503">gold</a> with an 86.40m throw at the Asian Athletics Championship in Gumi, South Korea, in May. A month later, he was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917504">named</a> in Forbes’ 30 Under 30 Asia List for what they called a “stunning show” at the Olympics.</p>
<p>Despite his mammoth successes, Arshad has maintained a relatively low profile at international meets compared to competitors like Julian Weber and Neeraj Chopra, particularly owing to injury.</p>
<p>Last June, he pulled out of the Paavo Nurmi Games in Finland due to a mild calf muscle <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1843768#:~:text=last%20month%20following%20a%20mild%20calf%20muscle%20injury.">injury</a>, but returned to competition in July at the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844599">Paris Diamond League</a> ahead of the Olympics.</p>
<p>The Asian Athletics Championship in May is his first and only competition of the year so far. He has not competed at a Diamond League yet, putting him out of the league’s <a class="link--external" href="https://www.diamondleague.com/results-standings/standings/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">standings</a> topped by Weber and Chopra with 15 points each.</p></p>
