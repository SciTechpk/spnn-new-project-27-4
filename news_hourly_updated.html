                <h2>Country‚Äôs June inflation likely to remain between 3-4pc: finance ministry</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The finance ministry, in its monthly economic outlook <a class="link--external" href="https://www.finance.gov.pk/economic/economic_outlook_june2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> on Monday, said that the consumer price index (CPI) inflation was expected to remain in the range of 3 to 4 per cent in June.</p>
<p>Last month, depicting a cautious outlook towards growth in Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM), the Ministry of Finance (MoF) had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914180">presented</a> a rising trajectory for inflation during May and June.</p>
<p>The year-on-year consumer inflation rate in May was the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915110">highest</a> since Dece¬≠m¬≠ber, indicating a rebound in inflation after months of slowdown. According to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, the CPI inflation had stood at 3.46pc in May 2025 as compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInflation is expected to remain within the range of 3.0-4.0pc for June 2025,‚Äù said the finance ministry in its Monthly Economic Update and Outlook (June 2025) report.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said that the finance ministry‚Äôs inflation projections were in line with their expectations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe projected the inflation to remain at 3.2pc in June, the analyst said.</p>
<p>The report said that the outlook for LSM in the coming months appeared to be positive, supported by encouraging trends in high-frequency indicators such as cement dispatches and automobile sales.</p>
<p>Sales of cars, sport utility vehicles, pickups and vans <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916830">clocked</a> in at 14,762 units in May, reflecting a rise of 35pc year-on-year and 39pc month-on-month.</p>
<p>However, the finance ministry also stated that LSM showed a mixed performance in April 2025, registering a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 2.3pc while contracting by 3.2pc on month-on-month (MoM) basis.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe uptake in loans to the private sector businesses suggests rising production activities and improved investor confidence,‚Äù the report continued.</p>
<p>With regards to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911531">current account surplus</a>, the report stated that the external account position continued to improve during the July-May period of the fiscal year 2024-25 on account of rising remittances and exports.</p>
<p>It stated that on the external front, higher remittances and exports will continue to keep the current account in surplus for FY 2025.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In the agriculture sector, the report said that quality seeds and mechanisation are expected to boost agricultural output.</p>
<p>‚ÄúImports of agricultural machinery rose by 10pc, worth $69.2 million in July‚ÄìApr FY2025, indicating rising mechanisation,‚Äù the report said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb unveiled the <a class="link--external" href="https://finance.gov.pk/survey/chapter_25/Highlights.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25</a>, exuding confidence that the country‚Äôs economy would be able to post growth of 2.7pc in the outgoing fiscal year for the gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>The National Accounts Committee showed Pakistan‚Äôs GDP growth at 1.37pc for the first quarter of FY25, 1.53pc for the second, and 2.4 for the third. This implies that the economy would need to post a growth rate of 5.5pc in the three months of April-June to get to the 2.7pc figure announced by the finance minister.</p>
<p>The GDP growth figure, however, is still lower than 3.6pc, marking the third successive year of the government missing its targeted figure.</p>

                <h2>Israel steps up Gaza bombardment ahead of White House talks on ceasefire</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Palestinians in northern Gaza reported one of the worst nights of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921129">Israeli bombardment</a> in weeks after the military issued mass evacuation orders on Monday, while Israeli officials were due in Washington for a new ceasefire push by the Trump administration.</p>
<p>A day after US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920718/trump-signals-gaza-ceasefire-possible-next-week">urged</a> an end to the 20-month-old conflict, a confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was expected at the White House for talks on a Gaza ceasefire, Iran, and possible wider regional diplomatic deals.</p>
<p>But on the ground in the Palestinian enclave, there was no sign of fighting letting up.</p>
<p>‚ÄúExplosions never stopped; they bombed schools and homes. It felt like earthquakes,‚Äù said Salah, 60, a father of five children, from Gaza City. ‚ÄúIn the news, we hear a ceasefire is near, on the ground, we see death, and we hear explosions.‚Äù</p>
<p>Israeli tanks pushed into the eastern areas of the Zeitoun suburb in Gaza City and shelled several areas in the north, while aircraft bombed at least four schools after ordering hundreds of families sheltering inside to leave, residents said.</p>
<p>At least 25 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Monday, health authorities said, including 10 people killed in Zeitoun.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The Israeli military said it struck militant targets in northern Gaza, including command and control centres, after taking steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians.</p>
<p>The heavy bombardment followed new evacuation orders to vast areas in the north, where Israeli forces had operated before and left behind wide-scale destruction.</p>
<p>The military ordered people there to head south, saying that it planned to fight Hamas fighters operating in northern Gaza, including in the heart of Gaza City.</p>
<p>Later on Monday, health officials at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis said at least 13 people had been killed southwest of Gaza City, bringing Monday‚Äôs death toll to at least 38.</p>
<p>Medics said most of the casualties were hit by gunfire, but residents also reported an airstrike. There was no immediate comment by the Israeli military on the incident.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#next-steps" id="next-steps" title="Permalink"></a>Next steps</h2>
<p>A day after Trump called to ‚ÄúMake the deal in Gaza, get the hostages back‚Äù, Israel‚Äôs strategic affairs minister, Ron Dermer, a confidant of Netanyahu‚Äôs, was expected on Monday at the White House for talks on Iran and Gaza, an Israeli official said.</p>
<p>In Israel, Netanyahu‚Äôs security cabinet was expected to convene to discuss the next steps in Gaza.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>On Friday, Israel‚Äôs military chief said the present ground operation was close to having achieved its goals, and on Sunday, Netanyahu said new opportunities had opened up for recovering the hostages, 20 of whom are believed to still be alive.</p>
<p>Palestinian and Egyptian sources with knowledge of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914784">latest ceasefire efforts</a> said that mediators Qatar and Egypt have stepped up their contacts with the two warring sides, but that no date has been set yet for a new round of truce talks.</p>
<p>A Hamas official said that progress depends on Israel changing its position and agreeing to end the conflict and withdraw from Gaza. Israel says it can end the offensive only when Hamas is disarmed and dismantled. Hamas refuses to lay down its arms.</p>
<p>Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said that Israel has agreed to a US-proposed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914292/us-proposes-60-day-ceasefire-for-gaza-hostage-prisoner-swap-plan-shows">60-day ceasefire</a> and hostage deal, and put the onus on Hamas.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIsrael is serious in its will to reach a hostage deal and ceasefire in Gaza,‚Äù Saar told reporters in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The US has proposed a 60-day ceasefire and the release of half the hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and the remains of other Palestinians. Hamas would release the remaining hostages as part of a deal that guarantees ending the conflict.</p>
<p>The conflict began when Hamas fighters stormed into Israel on October 7 2023, killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took 251 hostages back to Gaza in a surprise attack that led to Israel‚Äôs single deadliest day.</p>
<p>Israel‚Äôs subsequent military assault has killed more than 56,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to the Gaza health ministry, has displaced almost the whole 2.3 million population and plunged the enclave into a humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>More than 80 per cent of the territory is now an Israeli-militarised zone or under displacement orders, according to the United Nations.</p></p>
