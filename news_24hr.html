            <p><p>• Seven die, almost two dozen homes damaged in Balochistan; six drown in Islamabad, Pindi<br />
• KP records six deaths in Malakand, Karak, Buner and Manshera<br />
• PM orders authorities to remain on their toes as NEOC forecasts ‘moderate to heavy monsoon rainfall’ till 10th</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Amid heavy monsoon rains, the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) on Monday issued an alert for heavy rainfall and a flood-like situation in various parts of the country over the next two days, while 19 people lost their lives in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi due to extreme weather.</p>
<p>Moderate to heavy monsoon rainfall is expected till July 10, particularly in the catchment areas of all major rivers, which will likely cause flash flooding in various regions of Pakistan, according to the NEOC. The alert also prompted the prime minister to order the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and other authorities to remain on high alert to deal with potential emergency situations, particularly floods.</p>
<p>In Balochistan, at least seven people were killed and many others were injured as a result of the fresh monsoon spell over the past 48 hours, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said. Almost 22 districts of Balochistan have been affected by the rain, and PDMA has already issued an alert of heavy rains and flash floods. The PDMA confirmed seven deaths. It said that 22 houses were damaged while five houses were destroyed.</p>
<p>The areas which were badly affected by the monsoon spell included Awaran, Jhal Magsi, Khuzdar, Musakhail, Qila Saif­ullah, Barkhan, Kohlu, Loralai, and parts of Zhob and Sherani districts. “At least 22 districts of northern, southern and central Balochistan were affected while the monsoon spell is continuing in these districts,” said the PDMA officials.</p>
<p>“Washuk district bordering Iran was badly affected, where standing crops were washed away and many houses were damaged, which rendered a large number of people homeless,” officials confirmed and added that the rain also damaged solar panels in Loralai and Surab.</p>
<p>At least six people including three children drowned in rain-related incidents in different parts of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, police and emergency services reported.</p>

<p>In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, six persons lost their lives in Malakand, Buner, Manshera and Karak districts.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz directed the National Disaster Management Authority, rescue agencies, and adm­inistrative authorities to remain on high alert to cope with any potential emergency.</p>
<p>He also expressed concern that the operation of the Tarbela Dam spillways may increase flooding in the lower districts along the Indus River.</p>
<p><strong>Potential riverine flooding</strong></p>
<p>According to NEOC’s forecast, increased water flows are expected in all major rivers, including Kabul, Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab. Currently, low flood levels are being observed at Tarbela, Kalabagh, and Chashma on the Indus River, while Taunsa is also expected to reach the low flood mark. River Chenab is likely to experience low flood levels at Marala and Khanki stations. River Kabul at Nowshera is expected to rise to low flood levels, while Swat and Panjkora Rivers, along with their associated streams and nullahs, may swell due to rainfall in their catchment areas. River Jhelum, along with its tributaries, is expected to experience elevated inflows, resulting in localised flash floods. Inflows at Mangla Dam on River Jhelum are projected to reach the low flood limit.</p>
<p>Hill torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur districts may once again become active, generating medium to high flows.</p>
<p>In Balochistan, nullahs and seasonal streams in the northeastern districts, including Jhal Magsi, Kachi, Sibi, Qila Saifullah, Zhob, and Musakhail are also likely to experience high flows.</p>
<p>In Gilgit-Baltistan, the Hunza and Shigar rivers may see increased water discharge.</p>

            <p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he has nominated Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, presenting the US president with a letter he sent to the prize committee.</p>
<p>“He’s forging peace as we speak, in one country, in one region after the other,” Netanyahu said at a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922520">dinner</a> with Trump at the White House.</p>
<p>Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514">nominations</a> from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years, and has made no secret of his irritation at missing out on the prestigious award.</p>
<p>The Republican has complained that he had been overlooked by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">mediating role</a> in conflicts between India and Pakistan, as well as Serbia and Kosovo.</p>
<p>In June, Pakistan has also decided to formally recommend Trump for the coveted prize, given his role in de-escalating the India-Pakistan conflict.</p>
<p>“At a moment of heightened regional turbulence, President Trump demonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi which de-escalated a rapidly deteriorating situation, ultimately securing a ceasefire and averting a broader conflict between the two nuclear states that would have had catastrophic consequences for millions of people in the region and beyond,” a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918550">statement</a> from the government had said.</p>
<p>Trump has also demanded credit for “keeping peace” between Egypt and Ethiopia and brokering the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements aiming to normalise relations between Israel and several Arab nations.</p>
<p>He campaigned for office as a “peacemaker” who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging more than five months into his presidency.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922672/govt-lifts-bar-on-corporate-earnings-of-bureaucrats' target='_blank'><strong>Govt lifts bar on corporate earnings of bureaucrats</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday opened an avenue for senior bureaucrats to amass virtually unlimited financial gains, while simultaneously imposing austerity measures on these very entities.</p>
<p>In a notification, the finance ministry said that an earlier order dated July 10, 2014 which capped earnings through board meetings of corporate entities at Rs1 million per annum, stood “withdrawn ab-initio” — meaning it was never issued.</p>
<p>The order, issued on June 12, 2024 with the approval of the then-federal cabinet, said that “government servants appointed to the board of companies/organisations and who become entitled to [a] fee, shall only be allowed to retain remuneration to a maximum of Rs1m in a financial year”.</p>
<p>Any amount in excess of Rs1m so received was required to be deposited by the officer in the government treasury.</p>
<p>The decision on capping meeting fees was originally announced by then finance minister Ishaq Dar almost a decade ago.</p>
<p>That order remained in the field for a couple of years and then ignored. It was categorically reiterated last year, but has now been ‘withdrawn ab-initio’, meaning that the amounts earned throughout FY2024-25 would become legalised as the earnings of those officers.</p>
<p>The finance ministry issued another notification for continuation of austerity measures, which have now also been extended to federal government’s attached departments, SOEs and statutory bodies including regulatory authorities.</p>
<p>In case of SOEs, “these austerity measures shall be considered a direction of the federal government under Section 35 of the SOEs (Governance &amp; Operations) Act 2023 and under the relevant sections of their respective organic laws in the case of statutory bodies”, the notification said.</p>
<p>The restrictions include a complete ban on purchase of all types of vehicles. The ban also includes creation of new posts, treatment abroad and non-obligatory foreign visits at government expense.</p>
<p>Separately, the ministry also notified an increase of 7pc in net pension of all civil pensioners, including civilians paid from defense estimates, as well as retired armed forces personnel and civil armed forces personnel.</p>
