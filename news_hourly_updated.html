                <h2>11 soldiers martyred, 78 wounded while defending Pakistan in Indian attack: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least 11 soldiers were martyred and 78 wounded while defending Pakistan against India‚Äôs ‚Äúunprovoked and reprehensible dastardly attacks‚Äù during the recent escalation between the neighbours, said the military‚Äôs media wing in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan under the banner of Operation Sindoor, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>On Saturday, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">announced</a> that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), 40 civilians ‚Äî including seven women and 15 children ‚Äî were killed in Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.</p>
<p>The martyrs from the Pakistan Army include Naik Abdul Rehman, Lance Naik Dilawar Khan, Lance Naik Ikramullah, Naik Waqar Khalid, Sepoy Muhammad Adeel Akbar and Sepoy Nisar, as per the statement.</p>
<p>The martyrs from the Pakistan Air Force include Squadron Leader Usman Yousuf, Chief Technician Aurangzeb, Senior Technician Najeeb, Corporal Technician Farooq, and Senior Technician Mubashir.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan Armed Forces mounted a resolute response under the banner of Marka-i-Haq, delivering precise and notch-up retributive strikes through Operation Bunyanum Marsoos‚Äù, stated the ISPR in its statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTheir noble sacrifice of martyrs is an enduring symbol of courage, devotion, and unwavering patriotism ‚Äî etched forever in the nation‚Äôs memory,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúLet there be no ambiguity: any attempt to challenge Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty or territorial integrity, ever again, shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response.‚Äù</p>
<p>Paying tribute to the martyred civilians and military personnel, the ISPR offered heartfelt prayers for the recovery of the injured.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet there be no ambiguity: any attempt to challenge Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty or territorial integrity, ever again, shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response,‚Äù the statement read while reaffirming that the nation ‚Äúremains resolute in the face of aggression.‚Äù</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz Sharif has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910450/nation-celebrates-befitting-response-to-aggression">announced</a> that Youm-e-Marka-i-Haq will be observed every year on May 10 on the ‚Äúmagnificent success‚Äù of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. Friday, May 16, 2025, will be observed as a day to pay tribute to the armed forces for achieving magnificent success on the defence front and to bow before God in gratitude, he added.</p></p>

                <h2>PSL matches to resume from May 17: PCB chairman</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Tuesday announced that the remaining eight matches of the HBL Pakistan Super League (PSL) ‚Äî postponed due to the conflict with India ‚Äî would resume from May 17, with the final scheduled for May 25.</p>
<p>The PSL was first <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909572">moved</a> to the UAE and subsequently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909898">postponed</a> after an Indian drone crashed close to the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium last week.</p>
<p>In a post on X today, Naqvi stated that the league will pick up from where it left. ‚ÄúLet the aura take over as we unite and celebrate the spirit of cricket,‚Äù he wrote.</p>

<p>Earlier, it was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910621/psl-resumption-hinges-on-foreign-players-return">reported</a> that the six PSL franchises have reached out to players, who were flown from the country on a charter flight over the weekend as the cross-border skirmishes with India intensified last week, to return after a ceasefire agreement was reached.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe franchises are in negotiations with their foreign players regarding the tentative dates of May 17 to 25 with Raw¬≠a¬≠lpindi proposed to be the ve¬≠nue for the remaining matc¬≠hes,‚Äù sour¬≠ces told <em>Dawn</em> on Monday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs soon as the franchises confirm the availability of the foreign players, the PCB will announce the schedule of the remaining matches after getting the approval from chairman Mohsin Naqvi,‚Äù sources added.</p>
<p>With no international cricket during the proposed window, the PCB remains hopeful that the foreign players will return.</p>
<p>However, reports suggested that Australian players might not be open to the idea of returning to Pakistan or India, which also saw its T20 tournament ‚Äî the Indian Premier League ‚Äî <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909693/ipl-cricket-tournament-suspended-over-india-pakistan-tensions-indian-media">suspended</a> due to the escalating hostilities.</p>
<p>While most Australian players in both countries left for home, former Australia batter Ricky Ponting ‚Äî now coach of IPL side Punjab Kings ‚Äî deboarded his flight home following the ceasefire agreement.</p></p>
