<p>In the morning, Iran launched a fresh wave of attacks, state media said, after Israel‚Äôs military reported it detected inbound missiles from Tehran. This followed an initial salvo of over 100 missiles late on Friday night.</p>
<p>A senior Iranian military official, General Ahmad Vahidi, said ‚ÄúOperation True Promise 3‚Äù ‚Äî as the retaliatory strikes are dubbed ‚Äî will continue for as long as necessary‚Äú, according to Iranian state media <em>IRNA</em>.</p>

<p>Air raid sirens and explosions rang out across Israel overnight, with its military calling on residents to take refuge in bomb shelters in the morning.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said dozens of missiles ‚Äî some intercepted ‚Äî had been fired in the latest salvos from Iran.</p>
<p>A man and a woman were killed in Israel and dozens were wounded by a missile that landed near their homes, Israel‚Äôs ambulance service <a class="link--external" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/death-toll-in-direct-iranian-missile-hit-rises-to-two/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>
<p>Rescue teams were searching the rubble of apartment buildings that were destroyed in Rishon Lezion, a city outside of Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Israel‚Äôs Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter said ‚Äúsome 40 people‚Äù, besides the woman, were injured by the Iranian strikes.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe expect that the Iranians, who have a considerable volume of ballistic missiles, somewhere in the neighbourhood of 2,000, will continue to fire them,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIsrael is in war, not with the people of Iran ‚Ä¶ we are in a war against a regime that is intent on achieving nuclear power,‚Äù Leiter said.</p>
<p>He added that Israel wouldn‚Äôt know ‚Äúprecisely how much‚Äù damage it could inflict on Iran‚Äôs nuclear infrastructure until its forces ‚Äúcontinue and complete the campaign‚Äù. ‚ÄúAsk me that question in four or five days,‚Äù the envoy added.</p>
<p>Brigadier General Ahmadi Vahidi, a top advisor to the commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, claimed his country hit three Israeli airbases that were used as launch sites for attacks on Iran, the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/06/14/3334994/israel-s-nevatim-ovda-tel-nof-airbases-struck-by-iran-general" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tasnim</a></em> news agency reported.</p>
<p>Gen Vahidi said the sites included the Nevatim and Ovda airbases, in which the Israeli regime‚Äôs command and control, as well as the electronic warfare centre, were located. Other sites, he added, included the Tel Nof airbase near Tel Aviv, Israel‚Äôs defence ministry, as well as its industrial and military centres in the capital.</p>

<p>It added that other targets included ‚Äúmilitary-industrial facilities instrumental in producing missiles and other weaponry for the Zionist regime‚Äôs army to commit crimes against the resistant nations of the region ‚Äî particularly the oppressed people of Palestine and Gaza‚Äù.</p>

<p>Smoke was billowing above skyscrapers in downtown Tel Aviv, an <em>AFP</em> journalist reported, as Iran‚Äôs Revolutionary Guard said it had attacked dozens of targets in Israel.</p>
<p>Israel‚Äôs firefighting service said its teams were responding to the aftermath of Iranian missile strikes, including working to rescue people trapped in a high-rise building.</p>
<p>Resident Chen Gabizon told <em>AFP</em> he ran to an underground shelter after receiving an alert notification.</p>

<p>The <em>Fars</em> news agency said two projectiles hit Tehran‚Äôs Mehrabad airport, and Iranian media said flames were reported there today. Close to key Iranian leadership sites, the airport hosts an air force base with fighter jets and transport aircraft.</p>
<p>Israel <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/idfonline/status/1933764330454913407" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed</a> it struck dozens of targets in Tehran overnight, which included ‚Äúsurface-to-air missile infrastructures as part of an effort to dismantle‚Äù air defence capabilities around Iran‚Äôs capital, <em>Al Jazeera</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://aje.io/auoxkc?update=3773777" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Stating that dozens of fighter jets took part in the strikes, the Israeli army claimed: ‚ÄúFor the first time since the beginning of the war, over 1,500km from Israeli territory, the [Israeli air force] struck defence arrays in the area of Tehran.‚Äù</p>
<p>Iranian forces shot down Israeli drones on a reconnaissance mission over the northwest, state media reported, as exchanges of fire between the two sides continued.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIslamic fighters (Iranian forces) in the Salmas border region successfully shot down Israeli drones that had violated the country‚Äôs airspace,‚Äù state television said, adding that the ‚Äúdrones had entered Iranian airspace on espionage and reconnaissance missions‚Äù.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs ambassador to the UN said on Friday that 78 people had been killed and 320 wounded in the first wave of strikes by Israel.</p>

<p>Iran said earlier it had activated its air-defence system and explosions could be heard across the capital.</p>
<p>Iran had confirmed that above-ground sections of the Natanz enrichment plant had been destroyed, but the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said radiation levels outside the site ‚Äúremained unchanged‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMost of the damage is on the surface level,‚Äù said Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI) spokesperson Behrouz Kamalvandi.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there was only limited damage to the Fordow and Isfahan nuclear sites, Iran said.</p>
<p>It confirmed that its Fordow nuclear facility sustained limited damage following recent attacks, the semi-official <em>ISNA</em> news agency reported today, citing a spokesperson for the country‚Äôs atomic energy organisation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere has been limited damage to some areas at the Fordow enrichment site,‚Äù Kamalvandi said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe had already moved a significant part of the equipment and materials out, and there was no extensive damage and there are no contamination concerns.‚Äù</p>
<p>Dozens of people took to the streets of Tehran overnight to cheer their country‚Äôs military response, with some waving national flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans.</p>
<p>Separately, <em>IRNA</em> said the country‚Äôs forces downed two Israeli fighter jets during a massive Israeli air raid, although Israel denied this.</p>

<p>US officials said they were helping Israel defend against the missile attacks, even as Washington insisted it had nothing to do with Israel‚Äôs strikes on Iran.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump agreed on a call with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer that ‚Äúdialogue and diplomacy‚Äù were needed to calm the crisis, Starmer‚Äôs office said.</p>
<p>Trump also spoke with Netanyahu on Friday, US officials said, without elaborating.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs missile salvo came hours after Israel said its widespread air raids had killed several top Iranian generals, including most of the senior leadership of the IRGC‚Äô air force.</p>
<p>It had launched several rounds of strikes that hit about 200 targets, including nuclear facilities and air bases.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to bring Israel ‚Äúto ruin‚Äù during a televised address.</p>

<p>In Israel, Netanyahu issued a statement calling on the Iranian public to unite against their own government. But he also warned more attacks were coming.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the past 24 hours, we have taken out top military commanders, senior nuclear scientists, the Islamic regime‚Äôs most significant enrichment facility and a large portion of its ballistic missile arsenal,‚Äù Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Iran said the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906722">dialogue</a> with the US over Tehran‚Äôs nuclear programme is ‚Äúmeaningless‚Äù after Israel‚Äôs biggest-ever military strike against its longstanding enemy, but said it is yet to decide on whether to attend <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">planned talks</a> on Sunday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe other side (the US) acted in a way that makes dialogue meaningless. You cannot claim to negotiate and at the same time divide work by allowing the Zionist regime (Israel) to target Iran‚Äôs territory,‚Äù state media quoted foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei as saying on Saturday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is still unclear what decision we will make on Sunday in this regard,‚Äù Baghaei was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>He said Israel ‚Äúsucceeded in influencing‚Äù the diplomatic process and the Israeli attack would not have happened without Washington‚Äôs permission, accusing Washington of supporting the attack.</p>

<p>Iran earlier accused the US of being complicit in Israel‚Äôs attacks, but Washington denied the allegation and told Tehran at the United Nations Security Council that it would be ‚Äúwise‚Äù to negotiate over its nuclear programme.</p>
<p>Tehran said Washington would be ‚Äúresponsible for consequences‚Äù as the US warned Iran not to attack its personnel or interests, stressing that it was not involved in the Israeli attacks.</p>
<p>The conflict raised questions as to whether Sunday‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">sixth round of talks</a> planned between the US and Iran to seek a deal on Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme would go ahead in Oman.</p>
<p>Iran has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a> that its uranium enrichment programme is for anything other than civilian purposes, rejecting allegations from the US and Israel that it is secretly developing nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Netanyahu claimed Israeli intelligence had concluded that Iran was approaching the ‚Äúpoint of no return‚Äù on its nuclear programme. Israel had called for global action after the IAEA accused Iran on Thursday of non-compliance with its obligations.</p>
<p>Iran currently enriches uranium to 60 per cent, far above the 3.67pc limit set by a largely moribund <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1194411">2015 agreement</a> with major powers, but still short of the 90pc threshold needed for a nuclear warhead.</p>

<p>After months of urging Israel not to strike Iran while he worked toward a nuclear deal, Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-tells-reuters-its-unclear-if-iran-still-has-nuclear-program-2025-06-13/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Reuters</em></a> in a phone interview on Friday that he and his team had known the attacks were coming ‚Äî and still saw room for an accord.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe knew everything, and I tried to save Iran [from] humiliation and death. I tried to save them very hard because I would have loved to have seen a deal worked out,‚Äù Trump said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey can still work out a deal, however, it‚Äôs not too late,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs shifting stance around the Israeli strikes, which he called ‚Äú<a class="link--external" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-tells-abc-israel-strikes-iran-excellent-warns/story?id=122807155" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">excellent</a>‚Äù and ‚Äú<a class="link--external" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/12/politics/trump-israel-iran-strike#:~:text=called%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20strikes%20on%20Iran%20overnight%20%E2%80%9Ca%20very%20successful%20attack" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">very successful</a>‚Äù in a series of media interviews on Friday, offered one of the most striking examples yet of how he conducts high-stakes negotiations through both frank public rhetoric and behind-the-scenes maneuovers.</p>

<p>Last month, an improvised explosive device (IED) had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910961">detonated</a> outside the residence of MNA Zeb, partially damaging the house, police had said.</p>
<p>Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafique, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the rocket was fired at the residence of MNA Mubarak Zeb in Bajaur.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, it struck the MNA‚Äôs neighbour‚Äôs house, resulting in damage to the house walls and gate,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>He said that a search operation is underway in the area to track down the terrorists who launched the rocket at Zeb‚Äôs house.</p>
<p>Zeb was one of the PTI-backed independent candidates that the party decided to take action against after they <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867076">voted in favour</a> of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, against their party stance.</p>
