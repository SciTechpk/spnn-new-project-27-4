                <h2>Iran says Israel attack ‚Äòdeclaration of war‚Äô following strikes on nuclear facilities, missile factories</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Iran said Israel‚Äôs deadly strikes on its military and nuclear facilities on Friday were a ‚Äúdeclaration of war‚Äù and called on the UN Security Council to act.</p>
<p>Israel launched widescale strikes against Iran early on Friday, saying it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders and that this was start of a ‚Äúprolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.‚Äù</p>
<p>Iran promised a harsh response and Israel said it was working to intercept about 100 drones launched towards Israeli territory in retaliation.</p>
<p>But around 0800 GMT (1pm PKT), Israeli media said an order to citizens to remain near protected areas had been lifted, suggesting that most or all the drones had been neutralised.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Key developments so far:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Iran says top commanders, including Hossein Salami, killed</li>
<li>Israel says military intercepting drones fired from Iran in response</li>
<li>At least 95 casualties so far, including women and children</li>
<li>Iran‚Äôs supreme leader appoints new military commanders</li>
<li>Trump urges Iran to make deal, warns of more ‚Äúdeath and destruction‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>In a letter to the United Nations, Iran‚Äôs Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the attack as a ‚Äúdeclaration of war‚Äù and ‚Äúcalled on the UN Security Council to immediately address this issue‚Äù, the ministry said.</p>
<p>An Israeli security source said Israeli Mossad commandos had operated deep inside the Islamic Republic before the attack and the Israeli spy agency and military had led a series of covert operations against Iran‚Äôs strategic missile array.</p>
<p>Israel also established an attack-drone base near Tehran, the source added.</p>
<p>The military said it had carried out a large-scale strike against Iran‚Äôs air defences, destroying ‚Äúdozens of radars and surface-to-air missile launchers‚Äù. Iranian media and witnesses reported explosions including at the main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs elite Revolutionary Guards Corps said its top commander, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916918/who-was-hossein-salami-the-revolutionary-guards-chief-killed-in-israeli-attacks">Hossein Salami</a>, had been killed and state media reported the unit‚Äôs headquarters in Tehran had been hit. Several children were killed in a strike on a residential area in the capital, they said.</p>
<p>At least 95 people were wounded in Israel‚Äôs attack and taken to medical centres in 12 different provinces that were targeted, national emergency services spokesperson Mojtaba Khaledi told state TV.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei swiftly appointed new Revolutionary Guards and armed forces chiefs to replace those killed in targeted Israeli strikes on Friday.</p>
<p>In separate decrees, Khamenei named Mohammad Pakpour to replace Salami as commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and Abdolrahim Mousavi to replace Mohammad Bagheri as chief of the armed forces general staff.</p>
<p>A senior adviser to Khamenei was wounded during the attack, state media reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAli Shamkhani, an advisor to the supreme leader‚Ä¶ was injured in today‚Äôs attack by the Zionist regime,‚Äù according to state TV.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a recorded video message: ‚ÄúWe are at a decisive moment in Israel‚Äôs history.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMoments ago Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel‚Äôs very survival. This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.‚Äù</p>

<p>Khamenei said in a statement that Israel had ‚Äúunleashed its wicked and bloody‚Äù hand in a crime against Iran and that it would receive ‚Äúa bitter fate for itself‚Äù.</p>
<p>An Israeli military official said Israel was striking ‚Äúdozens‚Äù of nuclear and military targets including the facility at Natanz in central Iran. The official claimed Iran had enough material to make 15 nuclear bombs within days.</p>

<p>The United States said it had no part in the operation, which raises the risk of a fresh escalation in tensions in the Middle East, a major oil producing region.</p>
<p>Alongside extensive air strikes, Israel‚Äôs Mossad spy agency led a series of covert sabotage operations inside Iran, <em>Axios</em> reported, citing a senior Israeli official. These operations were aimed at damaging Irans strategic missile sites and its air defence capabilities.</p>
<p>At least six nuclear scientists were killed in Israel‚Äôs attacks, media outlets in the Islamic Republic reported.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs <em>Tasnim</em> news agency named the six scientists including Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, who was the president of the Islamic Azad University of Iran. Fereydoun Abbasi, a former head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, was also among the scientists killed, it added.</p>
<p>Later in the day, the organisation added that most of the damage from Israeli air strikes targeting its underground uranium enrichment facility at Natanz was at ground level.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMost of the damage is on the surface level,‚Äù said the organisation‚Äôs spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi, adding that there had been ‚Äúno casualties‚Äù at the facility where the enrichment centrifuges are housed underground.</p>
<p>A fresh round of explosions was heard in northwestern Iran, state television reported, following Israel‚Äôs wave of early morning strikes on multiple cities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA few minutes ago, new explosions were heard in East Azerbaijan,‚Äù the broadcaster said, as the <em>Tasnim</em> news agency said an earlier wave of strikes had hit 10 sites in the province, killing at least three people.</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump urged Iran to ‚Äúmake a deal‚Äù, warning that there will be more ‚Äúdeath and destruction‚Äù after Israel launched deadly strikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,‚Äù Trump said on his Truth Social platform.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIran must make a deal, before there is nothing left‚Ä¶ just do it before it‚Äôs too late,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Iran to make a deal over its nuclear programme, saying that there was still time for the country to prevent further conflict with Israel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,‚Äù Trump said in a post on Truth Social.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Trump said that Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb and that the US was hoping to get back to the negotiating table, in an interview with <em>Fox News</em> after the start of the Israeli air strikes on Iran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will see,‚Äù <em>Fox News</em> reporter Jennifer Griffin quoted Trump as saying in a post on X.</p>
<p>Trump would convene a meeting of the National Security Council on Friday morning, the White House said. He had said on Thursday an Israeli strike on Iran ‚Äúcould very well happen‚Äù but reiterated his hopes for a peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>The US military is planning for the full range of contingencies in the Middle East, including the possibility that it might have to help evacuate American civilians, a US official told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs armed forces spokesperson said Israel and its chief ally the United States would pay a ‚Äúheavy price‚Äù for the attack, accusing Washington of providing support for the operation.</p>
<p>While the US tried to distance itself from Israel‚Äôs military operation, an Israeli
official told public broadcaster Kan that Israel had coordinated with Washington on Iran.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States was not involved in the strikes and Tel Aviv had acted unilaterally for self-defence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,‚Äù Rubio said in a statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said he was ready to travel to Iran to assess the situation there after Israel‚Äôs strikes hit the sprawling nuclear complex at Natanz.</p>
<p>In a statement to a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency‚Äôs Board of Governors, Grossi said the other main enrichment centre in Iran, Fordow, was not hit and neither was another nuclear facility in Esfahan, citing Iranian authorities.</p>
<p>There are no elevated radiation levels at Natanz, he added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid further escalation. I reiterate that any military action that jeopardizes the safety and security of nuclear facilities risks grave consequences for the people of Iran, the region, and beyond,‚Äù Grossi said in his statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have indicated to the respective authorities my readiness to travel at the earliest to assess the situation and ensure safety, security and non-proliferation in Iran.‚Äù</p>
<p>He did not say what the extent of the damage at Natanz was or what parts of the site were hit. The site includes a vast underground uranium enrichment plant and a smaller, above-ground pilot enrichment plant.</p>
<p>Iran is enriching to up to 60 per cent purity, close to the roughly 90pc of weapons grade, at the pilot plant, but it is producing smaller quantities of that material there than at Fordow, a site dug into a mountain that military experts have said would be difficult for Israel to destroy through bombardment.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDespite the current military actions and heightened tensions, it is clear that the only sustainable path forward ‚Äî for Iran, for Israel, the entire region, and the international community ‚Äî is one grounded in dialogue and diplomacy to ensure peace, stability, and cooperation,‚Äù Grossi said.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Grossi said that nuclear facilities ‚Äúmust never be attacked‚Äù.</p>
<p>The UN nuclear watchdog said that Iranian authorities told it that no increase in radiation levels have been observed at the Natanz uranium enrichment site following Israeli strikes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIranian authorities have informed the IAEA‚Ä¶ that no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site,‚Äù the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a post on X, after earlier confirming that the facility was ‚Äúamong targets‚Äù of the strikes.</p>
<p>It added that Iran‚Äôs only nuclear power plant in the southern port city of Bushehr had not been targeted.</p>
<p>However, Iran‚Äôs atomic energy organisation confirmed in a statement that its  nuclear facility in Natanz had been damaged, but investigations have not shown any radioactive or chemical contamination outside the site.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe attack has damaged several parts of the facility. Investigations are ongoing to assess the extent of damages,‚Äù the statement said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Israel‚Äôs neighbouring country Jordan‚Äôs military said it intercepted drones and missiles that had violated the kingdom‚Äôs airspace.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRoyal Air Force aircraft and air defence systems intercepted on Friday morning a number of missiles and drones that entered Jordanian airspace,‚Äù a military statement said.</p>
<p>Air raid sirens sounded in the Jordanian capital after Israel‚Äôs attack on Iran, while the public security directorate urged people to stay at home.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAdhere to the guidelines and stay in your homes,‚Äù said an announcement on loudspeakers in Amman.</p>
<p>Jordan had earlier said it would not allow its airspace to be violated and vowed not to become a ‚Äúbattleground‚Äù in any regional conflict. ‚ÄúJordan has not and will not allow any violation of its airspace, reaffirming that the Kingdom will not be a battleground for any conflict,‚Äù government spokesperson Mohammad Momani told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>The government meanwhile condemned Israel‚Äôs attack, with foreign ministry spokesperson Sufian Qudah warning of ‚Äúthe consequences of such escalatory actions‚Äù.</p>
<p>Jordan also called the attack ‚Äúa blatant violation of the sovereignty of a United Nations member state and a clear breach of international law and the UN Charter‚Äù.</p>
<p>Tel Aviv‚Äôs Ben Gurion Airport was closed until further notice, and Israel‚Äôs air defence units stood at high alert for possible retaliatory strikes from Iran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFollowing the pre-emptive strike by the State of Israel against Iran, a missile and UAV (drone) attack against the State of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate time frame,‚Äù Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.</p>
<p>Israeli military Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir said tens of thousands of soldiers had been called up and ‚Äúprepared across all borders‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are amidst a historic campaign unlike any other. This is a critical operation to prevent an existential threat, by an enemy who is intent on destroying us,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Israeli Minister Gideon Saar was holding ‚Äúmarathon of calls‚Äù with counterparts around the world regarding Israel‚Äôs attack on Iran, the foreign ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Pakistan was among several countries and international actors which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916907/world-reacts-to-israeli-strike-on-iran-over-nuclear-activity">condemned</a> Israel‚Äôs strikes, with the Foreign Office calling it ‚Äúunjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel.‚Äù</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned ‚Äúin the strongest possible terms today‚Äôs unprovoked attack on Iran by Israel.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI convey my deepest sympathies to the Iranian people on the loss of lives in this attack. This grave and highly irresponsible act is deeply alarming and risks further destabilising an already volatile region,‚Äù he <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/CMShehbaz/status/1933418673362120803" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a post on X.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe urge the international community and the United Nations to take urgent steps to prevent any further escalation that could imperil regional and global peace.‚Äù</p>

<p>The National Assembly also unanimously passed a resolution against Israel‚Äôs attack on Iran, which was jointly presented by the government and opposition.</p>
<p>The attacks triggered sharp falls in stock prices in Asian trade on Friday, led by a selloff in US futures, while oil prices jumped as investors scurried to safe havens such as gold and the Swiss franc.</p>
<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned any military escalation in the Middle East, said deputy UN spokesperson Farhan Haq.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Secretary-General asks both sides to show maximum restraint, avoiding at all costs a descent into deeper conflict, a situation that the region can hardly afford,‚Äù Haq said.</p>

<p>The incident follows the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916728/">crash</a> of an Air India flight in Ahmedabad on Thursday shortly after takeoff, in which more than 265 people were killed.</p>
<p>AOT did not provide details on the bomb threat. Air India did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Indian airlines and airports were inundated with hoax bomb threats last year, with nearly 1,000 hoax calls and messages received in the first 10 months, nearly 10 times that of 2023.</p>

<p>Investigators recovered a black box recorder from the crash site on Friday of a London-bound passenger jet that ploughed into a residential area of India‚Äôs Ahmedabad city, killing at least 265 people on board and on the ground.</p>
<p>The Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner had issued a mayday call shortly before it crashed around lunchtime on Thursday after lifting barely 100 metres (330 feet) from the ground.</p>
<p>One man on board the plane, which was carrying 242 passengers and crew, miraculously survived Thursday‚Äôs fiery crash, which left the tailpiece of the aircraft jutting out of the second floor of a hostel for medical staff from a nearby hospital.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInitially, I too thought that I was about to die, but then I opened my eyes and realised that I was still alive,‚Äù survivor Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, a British citizen, told national broadcaster <em>DD News</em> from his hospital bed.</p>
<p>The nose and front wheel of Air India flight 171 landed on a canteen building where students were having lunch, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Deputy Commissioner of Police Kanan Desai said that 265 bodies had been counted so far, which suggested that at least 24 people were killed on the ground. The toll could rise further as more body parts are recovered.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe official number of deceased will be declared only after DNA testing is completed‚Äù, Home Minister Amit Shah said in a statement late on Thursday. DNA samples will be taken from family members of the dead who live abroad, he said.</p>
<p>Air India said there were 169 Indian passengers, 53 British, seven Portuguese, and a Canadian on board the flight bound for London‚Äôs Gatwick airport, as well as 12 crew members.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the devastated neighbourhood on Friday and was also pictured by survivor Ramesh‚Äôs bedside.</p>
<p>Ramesh, who suffered burns and other injuries, said: ‚ÄúEverything happened in front of me, and even I couldn‚Äôt believe how I managed to come out alive from that.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWithin a minute after takeoff, suddenly‚Ä¶ it felt like something got stuck‚Ä¶ I realised something had happened, and then suddenly the plane‚Äôs green and white lights turned on.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Indian government is also considering grounding Air India‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916742/787-dreamliner-boeings-flagship-long-distance-plane">Boeing 787</a> fleet, Indian <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/india-may-ground-boeing-787-8-fleet-after-ahmedabad-tragedy-sources-952092" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">broadcaster</a> <em>NDTV</em> reported earlier on Friday, a day after one of the airline‚Äôs aircraft of the same make crashed in Ahmedabad city, killing more than 240 people.</p>
<p>The fleet will likely be grounded for a safety review, <em>NDTV</em> reported, citing sources.</p></p>
