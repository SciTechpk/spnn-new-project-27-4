                <h2>India attacks Pakistan‚Äôs air bases, Pakistan retaliates</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Early morning missile attacks from India prompted a retaliatory response from Pakistan, which has termed its new operation against its neighbouring country as ‚ÄòBunyan-un- Marsoos‚Äô.</p>
<p>At around 3:30am on Saturday, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has said that India has targeted the Pakistan Air Force‚Äôs (PAF) Nur Khan (Chaklala, Rawalpindi), Murid (Chakwal) and Rafiqui (Shorkot in Jhang district) air bases, adding that all assets of the air force remained safe.</p>
<p>While speaking at a press conference, he said that India was ‚Äúpushing the whole region towards a dangerous war with its madness, aggression and deceit‚Äù. The DG ISPR also said that India had fired missiles at Afghanistan and used drones to conduct attacks as well.</p>
<p>The military spokesperson said that ‚Äúthe majority‚Äù of Indian missiles fired at PAF‚Äôs airbases were intercepted by air defence systems of the armed forces.</p>
<p>He noted that the few Indian missiles that were not intercepted and ‚Äúsneaked in‚Äù have ‚Äúnot been able to cause any damage‚Äù to PAF‚Äôs flying assets as per the initial damage assessment reports.</p>
<p>The DG ISPR said that the air defence systems of the armed forces were able to ‚Äúsuccessfully prevent the desired objectives of India‚Äù.</p>
<p>He said the missiles and drone attacks by India on Afghanistan shortly after attacks on the territory of Indian Punjab were ‚Äúpart of a larger sinister plan to push the region and beyond into havoc‚Äù.</p>
<p>The DG ISPR said that the PAF has the electronic signatures of all Indian missiles, including ‚Äúfrom where they were initiated and what was targeted‚Äù.</p>
<p>The military‚Äôs chief spokesperson assured the nation that the armed forces are ‚Äúvigilant and thwarting all these cowardly acts of aggression by Indians‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese blatant acts of aggression by India actually reflect the paranoia within Indian mindset which continues to grow after failure of each of this act and the paranoia continues to also grow once it realises that they cannot break the resolve and will of the people of Pakistan which actually strengthens and further grows with each such cowardly act.‚Äù</p>
<p>He further said that this ‚Äúgrowing frustration and paranoia‚Äù of the Indians would be ‚Äúfurther compounded‚Äù.</p>
<p>At 4:38am, state-run <em>PTV News</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1920986800597668347" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that the Pakistani military had launched its counter-attack against Indian aggression.</p>

<p>At 5:52am, <em>PTV News</em> and <em>Radio Pakistan</em> said that the Pakistani military has destroyed a storage site of the Brahmos missiles in India‚Äôs Beas region as part of its retaliatory operation ‚ÄòBunyan-un-Marsoos‚Äô.</p>
<p>In a statement, they reported that attacks were ongoing at more places in India.</p>
<p>The statement added that an air base in Udhampur and an airfield in Pathankot were also destroyed.</p>

<p>Federal Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan also confirmed that Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos has been launched against the ‚Äúenemy‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLong live Pakistan ‚Äî May Allah protect our falcons,‚Äù the minister <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/abdul_aleemkhan/status/1921005151843676521" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a post on X.</p>
<p>PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said that Pakistan had responded with precision and strategic integrity by targeting only Indian military targets tonight.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn tonight‚Äôs unprovoked attack by India once again, civilian populations have been indiscriminately attacked in Pakistan,‚Äù Rehman said. ‚ÄúThis is the clear difference.‚Äù</p>
<p>At 6:13am, <em>PTV News</em> said in a video update that the storage site of the Brahmos was destroyed.</p>

<p>At 6:50am IST (6:20am PKT), <em>The Times of India</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-pakistan-tensions-live-updates-loc-military-bases-border-airstrikes-drone-attacks-jammu-rajasthan-punjab-blackout/liveblog/121015783.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that explosion-like sounds were heard in Punjab‚Äôs Pathankot district early on Saturday morning,</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe blasts, reported around 5am, however, have not yet been officially acknowledged by authorities. A blackout was enforced in Pathankot on Friday night, with officials urging residents to remain indoors as a precautionary measure,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p><em>PTV News</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1921014733466906801" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> at 6:29am that Pakistani drones were active in the skies of India‚Äôs capital New Delhi.</p>
<p>Soon after, the government <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/GovtofPakistan/status/1921016805595763101" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X that Pakistan had targeted key Indian military installations in a ‚Äúbefitting response‚Äù as part of its retaliatory operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos‚Äô.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese actions are being carried out in response to India‚Äôs initial attack, which was an assault on our homeland, people and sovereignty,‚Äù the statement said, referring to Indian missile strikes against the PAF‚Äôs three airbases.</p>
<p><em>PTV News</em> further reported at 7:13am that PAF‚Äôs JF-17 Thunder‚Äôs hypersonic missiles have destroyed India‚Äôs S-400 system in Adampur. It added that the S-400 air defence system is worth approximately $1.5 billion.</p>
<p><em>PTV News</em> also said that most Indian websites, including the BJP‚Äôs official website and the Border Security Forces (BSF), have been hacked as Pakistan‚Äôs counterattack continues.</p>
<p>Other hacked websites included the Crime Research Investigation Agency, the Mahanagar Telecommunication Company Limited, the Bharat Earth Movers Limited, All India Naval Technical Supervisory Staff Association, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, Unique Identification Authority of India.</p>
<p>‚ÄúData leaked sites include Indian Air Force, Maharashtra Election Commission and others,‚Äù the statement added. ‚ÄúIn addition, more than 2,500 surveillance cameras have also been hacked.‚Äù</p>

<p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar spoke to <em>Geo News</em> around 7am and said that Pakistan is operating on the defensive and had no choice but to retaliate to India‚Äôs military actions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe <em>tamasha</em> [circus] that India has done in the past three days, we will not let India claim hegemony. The Pakistan Armed Forces and government are determined that this will not happen.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis operation that we started today, it will all end in some way. It all depends on what India wants,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan had no choice, so our civil military leadership made the decision following the attack on Nur Khan Air Base. No more patience. We are just giving them a response.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve exhibited a lot of patience so far. There is a threshold which we cannot go beyond, especially when it comes to hypocrisy and double standards,‚Äù he said.</p>

‚Ä¢ Saudi minister arrives in Islamabad with message of concern, calls for de-escalation</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: South Asia ‚Äî home to nearly one-fifth of the world‚Äôs population ‚Äî can ill-afford the irresponsible actions like the ones being <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">carried out</a> by India, Pakistan‚Äôs Foreign Office <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909746/unfortunate-that-indias-reckless-conduct-brought-two-nuclear-armed-states-closer-to-major-conflict-fo">said</a> on Friday.</p>
<p>At the weekly press briefing, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said: ‚ÄúIt is most unfortunate that India‚Äôs reckless conduct has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict.‚Äù</p>
<p>His remarks came ahead of a meeting between Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir and PM Shehbaz Sharif and other top state functionaries. The Saudi official had travelled to Pakistan on Friday after completing an official visit to India.</p>
<p>According to the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office (PMO), Riyadh‚Äôs emissary ‚Äúexpressed heartfelt condolences over the loss of precious civilian lives‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>He said the kingdom was deeply concerned about the current situation in South Asia, and reiterated his country‚Äôs call for de-escalation, as well as peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes between Pakistan and India, in accordance with international law and the UN Security Council‚Äôs relevant resolutions, the PMO said.</p>
<p>While discussing the prevailing situation in South Asia, the PM strongly condemned India‚Äôs missile and drone strikes against Pakistan that had resulted in the martyrdom of scores of innocent civilians, including women and children, as well as damage to civilian infrastructures.</p>
<p>He stressed that India‚Äôs unprovoked and unjustified acts of aggression had violated Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity, and seriously endangered regional peace and stability.</p>
<p>Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar received Adel Al-Jubeir at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and exchanged views on the evolving regional situation.</p>
<p><strong>FO briefing</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, at the weekly briefing, the FO spokesperson said that in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, the Indian leadership has ‚Äúonce again used the bogey of terrorism to advance its sham narrative of victimhood, jeopardising regional peace.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs jingoism and war hysteria should be a source of serious concern for the world,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>The spokesperson reiterated that Pakistan rejected any attempt to link it to the attack in Pahalgam.</p>
<p>He noted that a number of countries and international organisations had called on both countries to exercise restraint over the past two weeks, and it was ‚Äúhighly deplorable that India did not pay heed to these calls‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe international community should hold India accountable for its irresponsible, unlawful and belligerent conduct,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe assertion that Pakistan escalated the situation through the Pahalgam attack of April 22 is totally absurd. To date, India has not been able to produce any credible and verifiable evidence of Pakistan‚Äôs involvement in the attack.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo the contrary, the acts of aggression committed by its armed forces had the approval and support of its entire government,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThus, it is India that has escalated the situation by violating Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty and killing civilians.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that ‚Äúthe Pakistani forces did not attack Pahalgam, but the Indian forces did attack multiple locations in Pakistan,‚Äù adding that Pakistan reserves the right to take all measures in its self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter.</p>
<p>The spokesperson noted that on April 26, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had called for a ‚Äúneutral and transparent‚Äù investigation into the Pahalgam attack, yet ‚ÄúIndia chose the path of belligerence and aggression.‚Äù</p>
<p>The FO spokesperson also said Indian claims of targeting terrorists or terrorist infrastructure ‚Äúare blatantly false [and] it is a matter of record that Indian strikes resulted in the martyrdom of civilians, including women and children.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mr Khan said ‚Äúthe current Indian dispensation is bent upon weaponising water; holding in abeyance of IWT is unilateral and illegal.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan is an agrarian economy. Millions of people are dependent on the water being regulated by the treaty. The Indian decision is equivalent to an attack on the people of Pakistan and the economy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor Pakistan, the Indian announcement is of no legal consequence. The treaty remains enforced and fully binding on the parties,‚Äù he said.</p>
