                <h2>Defence Minister Asif blasts ‚Äòwestern hypocrisy‚Äô, says Iran never initiated war with Israel</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has strongly condemned the Israeli aggression towards Iran and criticised the Western world‚Äôs ‚Äúdouble standard‚Äù, saying that the International Atomic Energy Agency‚Äôs (IAEA) performance was ‚Äútainted with hypocrisy and a selective approach‚Äù.</p>
<p>Asif earlier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919222/pakistan-stands-firm-with-iran-asif">stressed</a> that Pakistan stood in ‚Äúcomplete solidarity‚Äù with Iran amid Israel‚Äôs unprovoked and ‚Äúunjustified aggression‚Äù against Tehran, which began on June 13 and escalated over 12 days. The conflict intensified after the US intervened by striking three of Iran‚Äôs nuclear sites. Tehran first responded by launching missiles at Tel Aviv, then targeted US bases in Qatar following the American strikes. On Tuesday morning, US President Donald Trump announced that Iran and Israel had reached a ‚Äúceasefire‚Äù.</p>
<p>Israel, without evidence, claimed that its initial strike on Iran was ‚Äúpreventive‚Äù, meant to address an immediate, inevitable threat from the Islamic Republic‚Äôs part to construct a nuclear bomb. Tel Aviv also suggested that the IAEA report released on June 12, which condemned Iran for material violations of its Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) commitments until the early 2000s, constituted such an emergency. However, the IAEA also seemed to reject that claim, since there was nothing in the report that was not already known to the relevant parties, according to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/6/15/the-real-reason-israel-attacked-iran" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a>.</em></p>
<p>In an <a class="link--external" href="https://www.irna.ir/news/85871529/%D9%88%D8%B2%DB%8C%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D9%BE%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%BA%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D9%88-%D8%A2%DA%98%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B3-%D8%A8%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%84%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B1%DA%98%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%A2%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%87" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with an Iranian state-run news agency <em>IRNA</em> in Islamabad, Asif said, ‚ÄúUnlike Iran, the Westerners have destroyed the opportunity for diplomacy and are the cause of the beginning of the aggressions of the Zionist regime and the United States.‚Äù</p>
<p>The defence minister emphasised that Iran‚Äôs approach had been ‚Äúvery constructive‚Äô and Tehran never sought confrontation, adding that Israel wanted to ‚Äúovershadow the region to push the situation towards war‚Äù.</p>
<p>He added that ‚Äúa regime that is not even a member of the NPT and there is no monitoring and inspection of its nuclear arsenals, can do anything and has the authorisation to carry out any aggression and attack on Palestine, Gaza, Yemen and now against Iran.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll these countries are the targets of these deliberate and reckless actions of Tel Aviv, which is not held accountable by the IAEA,‚Äù Asif further said.</p>
<p>He condemned Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúterrorist attacks and the US aggressive crime against Iran‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">nuclear facilities</a>‚Äù, considering these actions contrary to international law, the UN Charter and humanitarian norms.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think the situation has escalated to a dangerous level, especially over the past few weeks when Iran continuously emphasised the need for negotiations and participation in this entire process, and that the Iranians have never left the negotiating table,‚Äù he was quoted as saying by <em>IRNA</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIran has never initiated the war, but both the destruction of diplomacy and the initiation of the war were carried out by the other side (America and Israel), which led to the illegitimate aggression of Israel against the nation,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Asif further said, ‚ÄúIt is ridiculous that the West always wants Iran to return to the negotiating table, because the Iranians did not leave the negotiating table, but have always demanded interaction and negotiations.‚Äù</p>
<p>He noted that even when Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was negotiating with the Europeans, another aggression against the country took place.</p>
<p>Asif said Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúcontinued aggression against Palestinians had now reached Iran‚Äù, calling it a ‚Äúconspiracy planned and implemented by the Zionist regime‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIranians stand with Palestine, and this is never a crime. Human dignity and the defence of religious values must be followed by the international community, and they must stand against Israeli aggression and rush to help the Palestinians,‚Äù he reaffirmed.</p>
<p>He added that the US and Israel were trampling on all international laws, human values and traditions, and ‚Äúmassacring children, women, old and young in Gaza‚Äù.</p>
<p>The defence minister told the people of Iran to stand firm and steadfast because ‚ÄúGod is with them and all nations in the world feel the pain of the Iranian nation because this is a crime and a clear aggression against Iran, and these crimes will definitely be responded to.‚Äù</p></p>

                <h2>5 dead, 7 injured as bus catches fire after collision with petrol-carrying rickshaw in Quetta</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Six people were killed and seven were injured after a passenger bus caught fire after colliding with a loader rickshaw carrying petrol on the Western Bypass in Quetta, police said on Monday.</p>
<p>Fatal road accidents on highways <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906089">occur frequently</a> in Pakistan, mainly due to overspeeding, hazardous overtaking and disregard for traffic rules.</p>
<p>According to Shalkot Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Athar Rashid, ‚ÄúIn the tragic incident, five passengers on the bus were killed and seven others were injured.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that the bodies of the deceased had become unrecognisable due to the burns.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe injured were taken to the Bolan Medical Complex and Civil Hospital, and two of them are in critical condition,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>DSP Rashid added that the local bus was going from Nawan area to Hazarganji when the accident occurred at the Raisani area on the Western Bypass, adding that the bus caught fire after colliding with a petrol-laden loader rickshaw.</p>
<p>In a statement, Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind expressed sorrow over the incident.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe express our heartfelt sympathy to the families of the passengers who died in the tragic accident,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe injured are being provided with immediate and the best medical assistance. Treatment and facilities are being ensured for them.‚Äù</p>
<p>Rind said that an investigation was launched into the incident, stating, ‚ÄúStrict action will be taken against those responsible once the investigation is completed.‚Äù</p>
<p>He also said that all possible help and support will be provided to the affected families.</p>
<p>Separately, Adviser on Local Government Hamza Zehri also extended condolences to the bereaved families, directing authorities to provide facilities to the injured.</p>
<p>He said, ‚ÄúNo one will be allowed to play with the lives and property of citizens. [The] Metropolitan Corporation should seize mini petrol pumps and installations established in densely populated areas of the city.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThose responsible for the Western Bypass incident will be identified and punished,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>In April, a bus driver was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903481">burnt alive</a> and seven passengers were injured as their bus caught fire after hitting a mini-truck laden with pesticides at Gojra on the M-4 motorway near Nawan Lahore interchange.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a fatal collision between two cars near Dhabeji on the Karachi-Thatta section of the National Highway <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884245">claimed</a> four lives, among them a newly-wed man and his mother, and left six injured when the vehicles caught fire following the accident.</p></p>
