            <p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he has nominated Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, presenting the US president with a letter he sent to the prize committee.</p>
<p>The move comes as Israel continues its onslaught on Gaza, which has so far killed 57,523 Palestinians. Last year, the UN-backed International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1874034">issued</a> arrest warrants for Netanyahu, citing allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court said he, along with ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, “intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival”, including food, water, medicine, fuel, and electricity.</p>
<p>“He’s forging peace as we speak, in one country, in one region after the other,” Netanyahu said at a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922520">dinner</a> with Trump at the White House.</p>

<p>Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514">nominations</a> from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years and has made no secret of his irritation at missing out on the prestigious award.</p>
<p>The Republican has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514#:~:text=Trump%20complains%20about%20not%20getting%20Nobel%20prize%20for%20%E2%80%98stopping%E2%80%99%20multiple%20wars">complained</a> that he had been overlooked by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">mediating role</a> in conflicts between India and Pakistan, as well as Serbia and Kosovo.</p>
<p>In 2024, he <a class="link--external" href="https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/trump-grumbles-about-obama-s-nobel-peace-prize-and-claims-he-deserved-it-more/ar-AA1sVZiM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">insisted</a> that he was more deserving of a Nobel than ex-president Barack Obama, and complained how it was unfair that “anybody else” but him would have been honoured with one.</p>
<p>In June, Pakistan had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514/govt-to-recommend-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize-for-decisive-diplomatic-intervention-in-india-pakistan-crisis">decided</a> to formally recommend Trump for the coveted prize, given his role in de-escalating the India-Pakistan conflict when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">US mediation</a>.</p>
<p>However, as the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">joined</a> Israel’s war with Iran and launched attacks on three Iranian nuclear facilities, Pakistani lawmakers, activists, authors and ex-diplomats <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919128/fazl-others-urge-govt-to-review-decision-to-nominate-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize">criticised the move</a>. A resolution was also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919467#:~:text=In%20the%20resolution,in%20the%20region.%E2%80%9D">submitted</a> in the Senate by the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl to rescind the decision but led to no tangible outcome as Pakistan had not officially submitted the nomination.</p>

<p>Trump has also demanded credit for “keeping peace” between Egypt and Ethiopia and brokering the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements aiming to normalise relations between Israel and several Arab nations.</p>
<p>He campaigned for office as a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20what%20I%20want%20to%20be%3A%20a%20peacemaker%20and%20unifier.">peacemaker</a>” who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging more than five months into his presidency.</p></p>

            <p><p>As people continue to be evacuated from nearby structures following a deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050">building collapse</a> in Karachi’s congested Lyari neighbourhood that left <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922486/death-toll-in-lyari-building-collapse-stands-at-27-as-rescue-operation-ends-on-3rd-day">27 people dead</a>, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said on Wednesday it would not be possible for the government to provide housing to all residents living in dilapidated buildings.</p>
<p>The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market collapsed on Friday morning, with the rescue operations concluding on Sunday. The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, with the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) saying it had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=SBCA%20says%20issued%20multiple%20prior%20notices%20to%20vacate%20building">issued multiple prior notices</a> to residents to vacate the structure since 2023.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>GeoNews</em>, Memon said that there were 740 dilapidated buildings across Sindh, out of which 51 were in “extremely dangerous” condition, out of which 11 buildings had been vacated.</p>
<p>“Orders have been issued to vacate the others in the next 48 hours for residents’ safety,” Memon said.</p>
<p>“However, it won’t be possible for the government to provide housing to all residents living in dilapidated buildings,” the minister said, adding that there was no such law obligating the government to do so.</p>
<p>“Nonetheless, the government in the past had provided temporary shelters to flood victims and Covid-19 patients for quarantine,” he added.</p>
<p>“Whatever space is available with the government, we will provide that for housing to the most deserving residents who have no other option available [for housing].”</p>
<p>Memon’s comments come a day after the Sindh government announced the suspension of SBCA Director General Ishaque Khuhro over the building collapse.</p>
<p>According to Local Government (LG) Minister Saeed Ghani, other SBCA officials who were suspended included the director, deputy director and building inspectors assigned to Lyari. He also noted that the Sindh government has announced Rs1 million in compensation to the families of the 27 deceased people.</p>
<p>Major opposition parties — the PTI, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and Jamaat-i-Islami — have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922336/sindh-govt-sbca-earn-oppositions-ire-over-lyari-tragedy">condemned</a> the PPP’s Sindh government, the SBCA and other authorities, accusing them of “criminal negligence” that led to the disaster.</p>
<p>They not only demanded compensation and alternative residences for the affected families but also called for the registration of manslaughter cases against the officials responsible for the tragedy.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#previous-deadly-building-collapses" id="previous-deadly-building-collapses" title="Permalink"></a>Previous deadly building collapses</h2>
<p>In April, a 10-year-old girl <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907402/minor-girl-dies-in-building-collapse">died</a> when a three-storey building in Bhains Colony suddenly collapsed, while a man and a woman were pulled alive from the debris.</p>
<p>In October 2023, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1780534/five-killed-as-another-building-going-up-illegally-collapses">five people</a> were killed and four others injured when an under-construction building collapsed in Shah Faisal Colony.</p>
<p>The city witnessed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1579454/2-killed-10-injured-as-second-building-collapses-in-karachi-in-less-than-72-hours">two</a> such <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1578939">incidents</a> within 72 hours in September 2020, claiming the lives of at least three people and injuring over a dozen.</p>
<p>Lyari also faced a similar incident in June 2020, when <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1562672">22 people</a> were killed after a five-storey residential building housing about 40 apartments <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1561975/1-dead-4-injured-after-residential-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari-neighbourhood?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20dawn-news%20%28Dawn%20News%29">collapsed</a>.</p>
<p>A building collapse in Karachi’s Gulbahar area in March 2020 killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1539325">27 people</a>. A similar 2011 incident in Lyari’s Musa Lane neighbourhood took <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/650268/death-toll-from-karachi-building-collapse-at-33">33 lives</a>.</p></p>

            <p><p>Four people were killed and two others were injured after a fire broke out in a house located in Peshawar’s Kochi Bazar on Tuesday morning, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>Spokesperson for Rescue 1122 Bilal Ahmed Faizi said in a statement, “Six people were rescued from the fire in critical condition and taken to the hospital.</p>
<p>“However, four of them succumbed to their injuries. They have been identified as Rafiq, Shehnaz, Riaz and his wife.”</p>
<p>Faizi added that the firefighters and ambulances reached the site of the incident soon after receiving information and started rescue operations.</p>
<p>“The firefighters initially rescued three people trapped in a house adjacent to a market and transported them to the hospital for medical assistance,” Faizi detailed in the statement.</p>
<p>During the rescue efforts, two firefighters fainted due to the blazing flames. They were taken to the Lady Reading Hospital for treatment, where their condition became stable, he said.</p>
<p>Six fire vehicles and 40 personnel participated in the firefighting efforts, the rescue official continued.</p>
<p>“Firefighters faced extreme difficulty as the house was located in a congested area with narrow alleyways. After hectic efforts, the rescue official confirmed that the flames had been brought under control and the cooling process was underway.”</p>
<p>Fire incidents usually occur due to a combination of human negligence, faulty infrastructure, poor safety standards, and environmental factors. Peshawar has faced frequent residential and commercial fires and periodic industrial infernos.</p>
<p>In October 2024, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867860">fire</a> at a tissue paper factory in the Hayatabad area was doused after more than 26 hours in an operation involving 130 fighters and 31 fire tenders.</p>
<p>The rescue team said the fire erupted as a huge quantity of polythene was stashed inside the factory, which melted due to the fire, and the blaze was difficult to douse.</p>
<p>In June 2024, a fire broke out]<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1842781">2</a> in the Nauthia Phattak area of Peshawar, destroying at least 80 shops mostly selling used goods and injuring three people.</p>
<p>The officials said the fire erupted at one of the makeshift structures before engulfing the adjacent shops, which mostly dealt in secondhand clothes, shoes and curtains, and a power transformer.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 workers and firefighters from Peshawar, Nowshera, Khyber and Charsadda districts controlled the fire in six hours with around 80,000 litres of water and foam.</p>
<p>Around 110 personnel took part in the operation. Rescue officials said the wooden cabins caught fire due to strong winds and fire engulfed three markets before being brought under control.</p></p>
