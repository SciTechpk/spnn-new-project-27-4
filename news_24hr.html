            <p><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Monday said Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur was “in contact” with the relevant administration over the incident of protesters being shot in Khyber district’s Tirah Valley.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927004">Seven people</a> were shot on Sunday after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926949">demonstration</a> outside the Brigade Headquarters in Bagh-Maidan Markaz against the death of a minor girl in a mortar strike in Tirah’s Zakhakhel.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the “firing on peaceful citizens by khawarij” — a term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). However, according to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927004#:~:text=Security%20personnel%20guar%C2%ADding%20the%20installation%20reportedly%20opened%20fire%20to%20control%20the%20crowd%2C%20according%20to%20sources.">sources</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926949#:~:text=some%20of%20the%20protesters%20alleged%20that%20the%20forces%20at%20the%20gates%20fired%20at%20them">protesters</a>, security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly had opened fire to control the crowd.</p>
<p>Besides the seven killed, at least 16 others also received bullet injuries, sources said. There has been no official statement from the local administration or the military about the mortar strike or Sunday’s killings.</p>
<p>“The chief minister is in constant contact with the relevant administration,” CM Gandapur’s public relations adviser, Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, said in a statement today.</p>
<p>He said the KP chief minister was “monitoring” the Tirah incident himself. “The KP government is extremely saddened over the incident,” Saif added.</p>
<p>“The provincial government is standing side by side with the affected families in this moment of sorrow and grief,” the official asserted.</p>

<p>Saif also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926565/saif-blasts-parties-boycotting-mpc-says-militancy-shared-challenge">again</a> slammed the KP opposition parties for not attending a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926456/gandapur-rails-against-good-taliban-bad-taliban-distinction">multi-party conference</a> (MPC) held last week over the security situation in the province, stressing that the moot had been organised “to prevent such incidents”.</p>
<p>The statement recalled that the provincial government will be holding a series of jirgas with tribal elders next week, including one in Peshawar. This is also based on the MPC’s decision to convene a jirga comprising elders, parliamentarians and stakeholders from each district.</p>
<p>According to CM Gandapur, a grand jirga, whose members will be nominated by the first jirga, would be organised 15 days after that to devise a strategy to implement the MPC’s declaration.</p>

<p>On Sunday, hundreds of tribesmen had brought the body of a girl, who they claimed was killed in a mortar strike in the Darbar locality of Peer Mela in Zakhakhel a day earlier, to the Brigade Headquarters.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Sources and eye-witnesses said the situation turned violent when an angry mob, comprising mostly young men, ignored calls by local elders to remain calm.</p>
<p>They first torched an excavator parked outside Brigade Headquarters, then tried to force open its main gate, following which security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly opened fire to control the crowd, according to sources.</p>
<p>However, in a statement from his office, PM Shehbaz said TTP terrorists were behind the incident as he expressed his grief over the “martyrdom of innocent and peaceful civilians”. The statement, carried by state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/27-07-2025/pm-expresses-grief-over-deaths-of-civilians-in-tirah-valley" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> and <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-expresses-grief-over-martyrdom-of-innocent-citizens-in-firing-in-tirah-valley/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">APP</a></em>, did not mention any protest.</p>
<p>He directed the authorities to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured.</p>
<p>“The nefarious designs of terrorists cannot shake our resolve,” the premier asserted, reaffirming the government’s commitment to eliminate terrorists and terrorism.</p>

<p>Videos circulating on social media showed an excavator on fire. Some protesters were also seen pelting stones at the Brigade Headquarters while trying to forcibly open the main gate.

<p>The injured were transported to the Frontier Corps Hospital in Shah Kas Jamrud, Dogra Hospital in Bara and Hayatabad Medical Complex in Peshawar. One of the injured is said to be in critical condition.</p>
<p>Following the incident, security officials met with a delegation of Tirah elders at Brigade Headquarters and announced compensation for the victims on their demand. The KP government has also announced separate Rs10 million for the deceased and Rs2.5m for the injured.</p>
<p>Security officials said the local sector commander met with the Tirah elders and assured them of his full support in meeting their legitimate demands.</p>

<p>Residents in Peer Mela have claimed that mortar shelling by security forces has so far killed at least three persons over the last 10 days. They claimed that mortars were being fired as security forces conducted operations against armed militant groups in Zakhakhel, Shalobar, Adakhel and Malakdin Khel localities.</p>
<p>While a report on the mortar strike that was being protested could not be found, similar incidents in the Zakhakhel area took place in <a class="link--external" href="https://voicepk.net/2025/04/38196/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">April</a> this year and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878779">December 2024</a>, killing a child in each.</p>

            <p><p>The Babusar Highway was partially reopened on Monday as the search for missing people continued after heavy rains last week prompted flash floods in Gilgit-Baltistan.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719">devastating impacts</a> of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">heat­­waves</a>, erratic weat­her patterns and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660">glacial melting</a> have triggered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a> and intense floods across the region.</p>
<p>On July 21, floods swept across GB, causing landslides and leaving many <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926193">stranded</a>, and damaging more than <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926487">500 houses</a>, roads and other infrastructure.

<p>In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said: “The Babusar-Naran Highway has been reopened for one-way traffic.”</p>
<p>He noted that heavy machinery was used to reopen it, while work for complete restoration was underway. He also advised passengers to be cautious and avoid unnecessary travel.</p>
<p>Faraq further said, “Several families, including five members of a TV anchor’s family, have contacted the government about the missing people and appealed for help in the search.”</p>
<p>The wallet of the TV anchor Shabana Liaquat was found among the flood debris, which also included her and her child’s student cards, he added.</p>
<p>“The provincial government has enlisted the help of Pakistan Army sniffer dogs to search for those buried under the rubble,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Separately, the National Highway Authority (NHA) initiated swift road restoration operations in northern areas after orders by Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/road-restoration-underway-in-northern-areas-on-federal-ministers-orders/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">APP</a></em> reported.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Aleem said that key highways, including the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad (N-15) and Skardu-Jaglot Road, were blocked due to landslides and cloudburst. “NHA teams have cleared multiple obstruction points, ensuring partial restoration of traffic and improved accessibility for travellers,” he said.</p>
<p>The minister described the 242-kilometre-long N-15 as a “critical route for tourism and regional connectivity”, which was blocked at various locations.</p>
<p>According to officials, landslides along the route were successfully cleared, while restoration work from Naran to Babusar Top and Chilas was ongoing, he added.</p>
<p>Communication Secretary Ali Sher Mehsud and NHA chairman were present on-site to oversee the restoration activities, the report said.</p>
<p>“We are committed to restoring all major highways at the earliest,” Mehsud said, adding that travel towards Kaghan and Naran had resumed.</p>
<p>NHA managed to clear 20 out of 25 landslide-affected points on the Skardu-Jaglot Road.</p>
<p>“To maintain pace, NHA has placed all field officers on 24-hour alert, cancelled staff leave and activated its emergency response plan across Gilgit-Baltistan. Heavy machinery remains operational across the region to tackle any further disruptions,” the report added.</p>

<p>According to the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC), rain was expected in Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, and Shigar areas of GB, as well as in Muzaffarabad, Neelum Valley, and Bagh in Azad Jammu and Kashmir during the forecast period.</p>
<p>“These rains may lead to flooding, while heavy showers in hilly regions may also trigger landslides,” it stated.</p>
<p>In Chitral Valley, Buni and Reshun areas, rainfall combined with melting glaciers may raise the water flow of River Chitral, according to NEOC. “Urban flooding is also likely in Muzaffarabad and Bagh due to heavy downpours,” it added.</p></p>

            <p><p>Thailand and Cambodia’s leaders agreed to an “unconditional” ceasefire on Monday, after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926486">five days of combat</a> along their jungle-clad frontier that has killed at least 36 people.</p>
<p>More than 200,000 people have fled as the two sides fired artillery, rockets and guns in a battle over the long-disputed area, which is home to a smattering of ancient <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/802836">temples</a>.</p>
<p>The flare-up was the deadliest since violence raged sporadically from 2008-<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/604355/thai-cambodia-border-fighting-damages-temple">2011</a> over the territory, claimed by both sides because of a vague demarcation made by Cambodia’s French colonial administrators in 1907.</p>
<p>Reading a joint statement from the leaders of both countries after peace talks, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926916">Malaysian</a> Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said they had agreed “an immediate and unconditional ceasefire” with effect from midnight on Monday (10:00 pm PKT).</p>
<p>“This is a vital first step towards de-escalation and the restoration of peace and security,” he said at a press conference in Malaysia’s administrative capital Putrajaya, flanked by Thai acting Prime Minister <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921922">Phumtham Wechayachai</a> and Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Manet.</p>
<p>Anwar said a meeting of military commanders from both sides would take place on Tuesday morning, before the countries’ cross-border committee would meet in Cambodia on August 4.</p>
<p>As the deal was being announced, an <em>AFP</em> journalist in the Cambodian city of Samraong — 17 kilometres from the fraught frontier — reported hearing continuing artillery blasts.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#very-good-results" id="very-good-results" title="Permalink"></a>‘Very good results’</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump — who both nations are courting for trade deals to avert the threat of eye-watering tariffs — intervened over the weekend, and said both sides had agreed to “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926693">quickly work out</a>” a truce.</p>
<p>“Today we had a very good meeting and very good results,” said Cambodia’s Hun Manet, thanking Trump for his “decisive” support and saying the truce would serve as “a foundation for future de-escalation”.</p>
<p>Ahead of the summit, Thailand and Cambodia had traded <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926445/12-killed-as-thailand-cambodia-fight-deadly-battles-following-border-flare-up">fresh fire</a> and barbed accusations.</p>
<p>Cambodia’s defence ministry spokeswoman Maly Socheata said it was “the fifth day that Thailand has invaded Cambodia’s territory with heavy weapons and with the deployment of a lot of troops”.</p>
<p>As he departed Bangkok airport, Phumtham told reporters he did not believe Cambodia was “acting in good faith”.</p>
<p>After the talks hosted by Anwar — chair of the ASEAN bloc of which both Thailand and Cambodia are members — Phumtham called for the truce to be “carried out in good faith by both sides”.</p>
<p>“Thailand decides for peaceful resolution, while continuing to protect our sovereignty and the lives of our people,” he said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#highly-tense" id="highly-tense" title="Permalink"></a>‘Highly tense’</h2>
<p>On the eve of the talks, Thailand’s military said Cambodian snipers were camped in one of the contested temples, and accused Phnom Penh of surging troops along the border and hammering Thai territory with rockets.</p>
<p>It said there was fighting at seven areas in the rural region, marked by a ridge of hills surrounded by wild jungle and fields where locals farm rubber and rice.</p>
<p>“The situation remains highly tense, and it is anticipated that Cambodia may be preparing for a major military operation prior to entering negotiations,” the Thai military statement read.</p>
<p>Thai King <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1289776">Maha Vajiralongkorn</a> marked his 73rd birthday on Monday, but a notice in the country’s Royal Gazette said his public celebrations scheduled for Bangkok’s Grand Palace had been cancelled amid the strife.</p>
<p>Trump has threatened both countries with high levies in his global tariff blitz unless they agree to independent trade deals — but said he would “look forward” to signing them once “peace is at hand”.</p>
<p>Each side had already agreed to a truce in principle, while accusing the other of undermining peace efforts and trading allegations about the use of cluster bombs and targeting of hospitals.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#nationalist-sentiment" id="nationalist-sentiment" title="Permalink"></a>Nationalist sentiment</h2>
<p>Thailand says nine of its soldiers and 14 civilians have been killed, while Cambodia has confirmed eight civilian and five military deaths.</p>
<p>The Thai military said it had returned the bodies of 12 Cambodian soldiers killed in combat.</p>
<p>More than <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926498/thailand-warns-of-war-with-cambodia-as-138000-flee-fighting">138,000 people</a> have fled Thailand’s border regions, while around 140,000 have been driven from their homes in Cambodia.</p>
<p>With the skirmish enflaming nationalist sentiments, Thailand warned its citizens to “refrain from any kind of violence, whether in speech or action” against Cambodian migrants living in the country.</p></p>
