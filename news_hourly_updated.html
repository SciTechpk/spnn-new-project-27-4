            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Diplomat says military dialogue aimed at making truce ‚Äòsustainable‚Äô<br />
‚Ä¢ ISPR DG believes ceasefire can ‚Äòhold easily‚Äô<br />
‚Ä¢ Confirms CBMs from both sides<br />
‚Ä¢ Says Indian policy on Kashmir not working</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> reached between Pakistan and India following days of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military confrontation</a> does not have an expiry date, officials from both countries confirmed, putting to rest the speculations that the truce would lapse this weekend unless renewed.</p>
<p>Rumours of a Sunday deadline gained traction after Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Pakistan‚Äôs Senate last Thursday that the directors general of military operations (DGMOs) from both sides had agreed during a May 14 conversation to extend the ceasefire <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911216">until May 18</a>.</p>
<p>Media outlets then widely reported that the ceasefire was set to expire. However, officials from both sides clarified on Sunday that no DGMO talks were scheduled for the day and that the ceasefire, originally brokered through intensive US diplomacy, remained in force without a set end date.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is no expiry date to the break in hostilities, as reaffirmed in the DGMOs interaction of May 12,‚Äù an Indian official said, countering speculations of an imminent breakdown.</p>
<p>There was no official statement from the Pakistan Army, but a diplomat on the condition of anonymity said the ceasefire remained in effect and carried no set time frame for expiration. He said the discussions of the DGMOs were aimed at ‚Äúmaking the ceasefire sustainable‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The May 10 ceasefire came after the most serious escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours in over two decades, with cross-LoC shelling, drone incursions, and air force strikes pushing both sides to the brink. The United States, led by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, played a key role in mediating the truce, with support from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Initial violations were reported on the day following the ceasefire. But since then, military commanders have engaged in constructive dialogue. The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1910624">May 12 call</a> between Pakistan‚Äôs Maj Gen Kashif Abdullah and India‚Äôs Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai focused on reinforcing mutual commitments to avoid any aggressive or hostile actions, officials said.</p>
<p>In that conversation, the two sides had agreed to begin a phased reduction of forward deployments and regular troops along the international border, restoring the usual peacetime arrangement where the border is manned primarily by Pakistan‚Äôs Rangers and India‚Äôs Border Security Force.</p>
<p>Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said both DGMOs ‚Äúhave maintained periodic contact since May 10‚Äù and agreed to develop a structured mechanism for de-escalation.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>While Islamabad views the ceasefire as a potential stepping stone toward broader peace talks on long-standing issues like the Kashmir dispute and water rights, India has taken a more rigid stance.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the ceasefire as a ‚Äútemporary pause,‚Äù and Defence Minister Rajnath  Singh declared that ‚ÄúOperation Sindoor is not over yet ‚Ä¶ Pakistan is on probation‚Äù.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄòCeasefire will hold easily‚Äô</strong></p>
<p>In comments underscoring Pakistan‚Äôs stance, military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry told <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/2601190/pakistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Arab News</a></em> that the ceasefire was holding.</p>
<p>The DG ISPR also reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs longstanding position on Kashmir, warning that the dispute remains a flashpoint unless resolved through dialogue.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúAs far as Pakistan army is concerned, this ceasefire will hold easily and there have been confidence-building measures in communication between both the sides,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf any violation occurs, our response is always there ‚Ä¶ but it is only directed at those posts and those positions from where the violations of the ceasefire happen. We never target civilians. We never target any civil infrastructure.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>Conflict potential persists</strong></p>
<p>On a separate, the Pakistani military spokesman also warned of far-reaching consequences if India attempts to follow through on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911383">threats to cut Islamabad‚Äôs share</a> of the Indus River water system.</p>
<p>Last month, New Delhi unilaterally suspended the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">1960 Indus Waters Treaty</a>, blaming Pakistan for a deadly militant attack in Indian-Occupied Kashmir, an allegation Pakistan denies.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTheir policy on Kashmir ‚Äî of oppression and trying to internalise it ‚Äî is not working,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúTill the time Indians don‚Äôt sit and talk about Kashmir, then (as) two countries sit, and we find a solution to it, the conflict potential is there.‚Äù ‚ÄúI hope that time doesn‚Äôt come, but it will be such actions that the world will see and the consequences of that we will fight for years and decades to come,‚Äù the army spokesperson said. ‚ÄúNobody dares stop water from Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>The waters treaty, brokered by the World Bank, has survived multiple wars between the two neighbours and is considered one of the most successful water-sharing agreements globally. Its potential unravelling adds a dangerous new tier to an already volatile regional equation.</p>

                <h2>Questions raised over Rs2.2bn vehicle spending in FBR reforms</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Planning Commission urges review of expenditure amid austerity measures<br />
‚Ä¢ FBR defends procurement of 179 vehicles, says it‚Äôs essential to operational needs across terrains</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: The Planning Commission has raised concerns over the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1888804/purchase-of-over-1000-vehicles-for-fbr-stopped-senate-panel-told">procurement of 179 vehicles</a>, including 15 fully bulletproof units, under the Federal Board of Revenue‚Äôs (FBR) Rs41 billion Revenue Raises Project, urging a review of the Rs2.237bn expenditure in light of the Finance Division‚Äôs austerity measures.</p>
<p>Funded by a $150 million World Bank loan at an annual interest rate of 2.5 per cent over 30 years, the project is a cornerstone of the Prime Minister‚Äôs FBR transformation plan. Despite its strong economic indicators ‚Äî boasting benefit-cost ratios of 42 to 70 and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 130pc to 195pc ‚Äî the Planning Commission flagged lax scrutiny in its implementation, particularly regarding vehicle procurement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAn amount of Rs2,237.5m has been proposed for procurement of 179 vehicles of different makes at a unit cost of Rs12.5m for Digital Enforcement Units without provision of specifications of vehicles,‚Äù the Planning Commission pointed out and demanded its rationalisation ‚Äúin light of austerity measures of Finance Division‚Äù.</p>
<p>The FBR, however, defended the procurement, claiming it was essential to operational needs across varied terrains, where the digital enforcement stations would be established.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúThe proposed vehicles represent the minimum essential specifications necessary for effective field operations, with no inclusion of luxury features. The selection strictly adheres to functional utility for anti-smuggling activities,‚Äù the revenue authority said. The project is expected to be completed in June 2027.</p>
<p>The estimated cost savings from the project‚Äôs investments in information communication technology (ICT) hardware, taking into account the project‚Äôs investment in the new equipment and the associated operational and maintenance costs, would have been estimated at $100m in nominal terms.</p>
<p>This investment in FBR‚Äôs data centre and network equipment has been described as unavoidable in averting the failure of the organisation‚Äôs ICT systems. ‚ÄúIf the FBR does not invest in these upgrades soon, it will incur costs of around $200m to rebuild the data centres,‚Äù the FBR advocated.</p>
<p>The Planning Commission noted that the end-of-period target for time spent on customs clearance at the border is set at 48.5 hours against the baseline of 97.5 hours. It said the project‚Äôs benefit-cost ratio ranges from 42 to 70, and the internal rate of return from 130pc to 195pc.</p>
<p>The programme, originally envisaged in 2017, aims to achieve a 17pc tax-to-GDP ratio, which still struggles at about 10pc ‚Äî well below the Asia-Pacific average of 19.3pc.</p>
<p>The change in the base year of national accounts will further reduce Pakistan‚Äôs tax-to-GDP ratio. Some studies observed that 64pc of economic activities are undocumented, leading to a loss of billions of rupees in tax collection, the Planning Commission observed, adding that the country‚Äôs tax system was overregulated, with the large number of taxes stifling businesses.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe cost of documentation of tax compliance even for a small business is around Rs250,000,‚Äù the Planning Commission said and noted that cash circulation in Pakistan was 28pc compared to 18pc in India and 17pc in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The Planning Commission called for reforms aimed at simplifying tax procedures, reducing the number of levies, and accelerating the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1876817">digitisation of the tax system</a> to integrate it with broader economic activity.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The project also envisages mobile tax facilitation services, initiatives for improved taxpayer compliance, establishing a forum for technical consultations with provincial tax authorities on tax harmonisation, staff capacity-building, bac¬≠k¬≠up power equipment upgradation, and control rooms and monitoring systems.</p>
<p>The FBR has recently adopted Strategic Plans for the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) and Pakistan Customs. Key components of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1863314">transformation plan</a> include value chains‚Äô digital transformation, introduction of tracking technology, implementation support for digital transformation, and value chain implementation support.</p>
<p>In addition, 37 digital enforcement stations will be equipped with hard and soft interventions to counter smuggling.</p>
<p>Out of these 37 stations, 24 will be established on the Indus and Hub rivers and surrounding areas to work as a protective wall, supported by three mobile enforcement units. Additionally, 10 stations will be set up at strategically located checkpoints in Balochistan.</p>
<p>The Customs Tracking System will be integrated with existing databases, which would be important in identifying and targeting people or vehicles involved in transporting smuggled goods on which duties and taxes have not been paid.</p>
<p>The FBR expects its reform efforts to generate an additional $81bn by the end of fiscal year 2028-29. The project also covers replacement of end-of-life ICT equipment, cloud infrastructure, updated software licences, data warehousing, business intelligence tools, and complete LAN and VoIP connectivity for field offices.</p>
<p>As part of the Rs2.237bn allocation, the FBR will also procure 350 bulletproof jackets and helmets for operational personnel.</p>
<p>The tax authority defended its expanded resource needs by pointing to a fourfold increase in the number of tax filers, from 1.5m in 2017 to over 6m by the end of June 2024. It also cited the growing volume of third-party data being gathered to broaden the tax base and identify defaulters.</p>
