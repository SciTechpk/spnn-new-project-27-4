                <h2>Trump warns he will ‚Äòsubstantially‚Äô raise tariffs on India over Russian oil purchases</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Monday he will substantially raise tariffs on India over its purchases of Russian oil.</p>
<p>Trump last week said he would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927587">impose</a> a 25 per cent tariff on goods imported from India and added that the world‚Äôs fifth-largest economy would also face an unspecified penalty, but gave no details. Later, Trump mou¬≠nted a sharp attack and said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.‚Äù</p>
<p>Over the weekend, two Indian government sources told <em>Reuters</em> that India will keep purchasing oil from Russia despite Trump‚Äôs threats. In turn, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928504/top-trump-aide-accuses-india-of-financing-russias-war-in-ukraine">accused</a> India of effectively financing Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine by purchasing oil from Moscow.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114971053091282290" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on Truth Social today, Trump assailed New Delhi for buying Russian oil and then selling it.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia is not only buying massive amounts of Russian oil, they are then, for much of the oil purchased, selling it on the open market for big profits,‚Äù Trump wrote. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBecause of this, I will be substantially raising the tariff paid by India to the USA,‚Äù the US president wrote.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch    media--uneven  media--stretch">
        <div class="media__item  "><img alt="" src="https://i.dawn.com/primary/2025/08/0420124603ecab5.png" /></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927843">India</a>, the world‚Äôs third-largest oil importer, is the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854116">biggest buyer</a> of seaborne Russian crude, a vital revenue earner for Russia as it wages war in Ukraine for a fourth year.</p>
<p>The US levy on India exceeds those agreed by some other nations in deals with the Trump administration. For example, the tariff on Vietnam is set at 20pc and on Indonesia at 19pc, with levies of 15pc on Japanese and European Union exports.</p>
<p>Last week, Trump said Washington had reached a trade deal with India‚Äôs arch-rival Pakistan that Islamabad said would lead to lower tariffs on its exports.</p>
<p>Since India‚Äôs short but deadly conflict with Pakistan in May, New Delhi has been unhappy about Trump‚Äôs closeness with Islamabad and has protested, casting a shadow over trade talks.</p>
<p>Despite former public displays of bonhomie between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has taken a slightly harder stance against the US in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the India-Pakistan ceasefire he announced on social media on May 10, but India disputes his claim that it resulted from his intervention and trade threats.</p>
<p>By declaring the Indian economy dead in the water, Trump has put Modi and his party in a bind. Until recently, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was canvassing support for the US president‚Äôs election. Its supporters were holding special prayers and muttering mystical chants for Trump‚Äôs victory. There was at least one temple created where a sculptured image of Trump was worshipped.</p>
<p>But Trump has ignored the lavish praise and called out India‚Äôs energy imports from Russia and its tariff regime as non-negotiable.</p>
<p>The Indian government said it was trying to figure out a response by consulting all the ‚Äústakeholders‚Äù, a euphemism for angry businesses whose hopes were riding on Modi‚Äôs daring ability to play both sides of the street.</p>
<p>That appears to have hit a dead-end.</p></p>

                <h2>PM Shehbaz announces Rs4bn for mapping damage, reconstruction of GB after floods</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday announced Rs4 billion for mapping damage to infrastructure in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and reconstruction efforts following recent floods in the region.</p>
<p>The prime minister was on a one-day visit to GB to review monsoon damages and distribute relief funds to flood-affected people. The devastating impacts of climate cha¬≠nge became more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921009/at-least-8-dead-13-injured-in-rain-related-incidents-across-gb-punjab-and-sindh-officials#:~:text=two%20sisters%20died%20after%20being%20swept%20away">late June</a>.</p>
<p>The situation worsened when deadly floods <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20so%20far%2C%2010%20fatalities%20and%20four%20injuries%20have%20been%20reported.%20Seven%20deaths%20were%20reported%20from%20Babusar%2C%20two%20from%20Thore%20Valley%20(Dia%C2%ADmer)%20and%20another%20from%20Astore%20district.">10 people</a>, mostly tourists, have lost their lives, with between 10 and 15 tourists still missing.</p>
<p>A statement posted on the X account of state broadcaster <em>PTV News</em> said PM Shehbaz emphasised the need for timely preparation to deal with natural disasters and announced a Rs4bn fund for infrastructure restoration and the activation of a 100-megawatt solar project soon. The PM also laid the foundation stone for a Daanish School.</p>

<p>Addressing a cheque distribution ceremony for flood affectees, he recalled, ‚ÄúA huge cloudburst occurred here, as a result of which there were immense rains and floods.‚Äù</p>
<p>Noting the loss of lives and the damage caused to people‚Äôs property, the premier prayed for those who died and for the speedy recovery of the injured.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have come here specifically to express my sympathies and to assure you that I will keep coming here till you get resettled in your homes,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Noting that Pakistan was in the ‚Äúred zone‚Äù of 10 countries most vulnerable to climate change, the prime minister underscored that both federal and GB governments had to work around the clock to combat climate change.</p>

<p>He ordered the early completion and functioning of the advanced weather warning system in GB and noted that Pakistan required preparedness to ward off damage and losses from climate change and weather-related disasters.</p>
<p>The prime minister said that he was visiting GB, along with cabinet members, to express sympathy with the affected families and assured them that they would be rehabilitated, adding that the federal government departments and the relevant departments in GB would work closely for this purpose.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said he had directed the chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority to conduct mapping of the damages and submit a report in this regard, adding that he would visit the area in August.</p>
<p>Earlier, the prime minister distributed cheques containing compensation amounts among the family members of those who lost their loved ones in the recent rains and floods.</p>
<p>Chief Minister Gilgit Baltistan Haji Gulbar Khan, in his remarks, highlighted the damages, rescue and relief activities in the region after recent floods.</p>
<p>Minister for Kashmir Affairs, GB and States and Frontier Regions Engineer Amir Muqam lauded the prime minister for his commitment and dedication to the public welfare projects.</p>
<p>He said, contrary to the past, GB‚Äôs budget had now been increased to Rs186 billion annually.</p>

<p>Earlier today, PM Shehbaz chaired a review meeting on the damages caused by the recent monsoon rains. He termed the destruction caused by cloodbursts in Diamer and other areas as ‚Äúunfortunate‚Äù.</p>
<p>He emphasised that an advanced weather alert system must be established for tourist destinations based on seasonal forecasts, according to the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-orders-advance-weather-alert-system-for-tourist-destinations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan</a></em>.</p>

<p>The prime minister said local populations should be resettled away from natural water passageways to help prevent emergencies in the future.</p>
<p>He also ordered the NDMA and the climate change ministry to jointly establish a forecasting and monitoring centre for GB in the coming months.</p>
<p>A comprehensive system must be developed for immediate rescue and assistance in emergency situations, the premier stressed. He instructed the NDMA to ensure close cooperation with provincial governments and relevant institutions to enhance rescue and relief efforts.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll rehabilitation measures for those affected by the recent monsoon must be completed promptly,‚Äù PM Shehbaz asserted, issuing directives for a survey of damage to roads and infrastructure, and the restoration of communication links in all affected areas on a priority basis.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Climate Change informed the meeting about progress on the ongoing installation of an early warning system for glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs), with the premier ordering its completion in two months.</p>
<p>Regarding the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928659/funerals-held-in-absentia-for-missing-tourists-in-gbs-babusar-after-14-days-of-search-efforts#:~:text=After%20deadly%20floods%20swept%20across%20GB%E2%80%99s%20Babusar%20area%20on%20July%2021%2C%20the%20deaths%20of%20seven%20people%20had%20been%20confirmed%20but%2012%20remained%20missing">July 21 heavy rains</a> in GB‚Äôs Thak-Babusar, Thor, Kundus, and Ishkoman areas, the meeting was informed that over 600 people were rescued, while damaged roads were repaired and reopened to restore connectivity, <em>APP</em> reported.</p>

<p>Five tent villages were established for rescue operations, and 10 helicopters, along with two C-130 aircraft, were deployed to transport stranded tourists and individuals to safe locations.</p>
<p>Additionally, PM Shehbaz instructed Water Minister Mian Muhammad Mueen Wattoo to remain in GB to complete consultations and planning for a better water management system.</p>

<p>Addressing the meeting, PM Shehbaz stressed that he had issued ‚Äúclear‚Äù directives to Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik and his team to work on the matter.</p>
<p>He highlighted that Malik has attended various conferences on climate change and secured funds for resilient infrastructure in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Emphasising that the ministry had a key role in ‚Äúmitigating the changes arising from climate change‚Äù across the country, the premier noted that the NDMA was originally established for relief, rescue and rehabilitation work once a disaster strikes.</p>
<p>He recalled that the communication secretary had spent six days in GB as he oversaw the restoration of roads damaged by the rains.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan‚Äôs contribution to global emissions is negligible, but despite this, it is among the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891272">top 10 countries</a> that are facing destruction and losses due to global warming,‚Äù PM Shehbaz noted.</p>

<p>Recalling the devastating <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1724134">2022 floods</a>, he said, ‚ÄúAfter that, each year such destruction comes in less or greater intensity.‚Äù</p>
<p>In 2022, the country witnessed the most devastating floods in its history, which killed 1,700 people, affected 33 million people, washed away swathes of agricultural lands, and incurred <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1721343">losses</a> worth $30 billion, according to governmental estimates.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz hailed the work of various federal authorities ‚Äî including the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the ministries of communication, water, GB, climate change, and international coordination ‚Äî in assisting with the relief work.</p>
<p>The prime minister vowed to visit GB once the monsoon rains end to lay the foundation stone of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1822414">Daanish Schools</a> he had promised. ‚ÄúWe will also discuss other development projects with you and decide on them,‚Äù he assured the GB government.</p>
<p>He said the solar power project, which he was personally overseeing, had been greenlit by the Central Development Working Party and awaited approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will try to ensure this project‚Äôs completion as soon as possible under my own monitoring.‚Äù</p>

<p>The visit comes after PM Shehbaz chaired a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928144">high-level meeting</a> last week to review the monsoon damage, where he reaffirmed the federal government‚Äôs full support for relief and recovery efforts in GB and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).</p>
<p>Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik, Kashmir Affairs and GB Minister Amir Muqam, Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Inter-Provincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, and PM‚Äôs coordinator on GB Shabbir Ahmed Usmani are accompanying the premier.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prime minister will meet with the victims of rains and floods in Gilgit and distribute relief funds,‚Äù <em>PTV</em> said.</p>
<p>In a statement on the occasion, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said, ‚ÄúThe hopes of flood affectees are attached to the prime minister. GB has faced losses worth more than Rs20 billion due to the worst destruction caused by the floods.‚Äù</p>
<p>As floods and landslides hit GB in late July, CM Gulbar had appe¬≠aled to the federal government for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838">Rs7bn in emergency funds</a> to deal with climate-induced disasters.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCooperation from the federal government plays the role of oxygen for GB,‚Äù the official said, stressing that ‚Äúhomeless people with wrecked houses and eroding settlements were looking forward to remedies for their wounds‚Äù.</p>
<p>Terming PM Shehbaz‚Äôs visit a ‚Äúgood omen‚Äù, Faraq welcomed the premier to the region.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922323/maximum-temperature-record-shattered-in-gbs-chilas-and-bunji-pmd">heat¬≠¬≠waves</a>, erratic weat¬≠her patterns and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928021">glacial melting</a> have triggered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a> and intense floods across the region.</p>
<p>Five members of a family trapped due to a flood four days ago in GB‚Äôs Ghizer District were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928659/5-family-members-stranded-due-to-floods-in-gb-rescued-after-4-days">rescued today</a>, the region‚Äôs Rescue 1122 said.</p>

<p>On Friday, a <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">glacier burst</a> in GB‚Äôs Bagrot Valley led to the death of a 12-year-old boy, while his father was injured. The same day, Rescue 1122 officials said one person was rescued, while three other family members <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928144#:~:text=Tragedies%20mount%20in%20GB">went missing</a> after they had attempted to rescue a man who had jumped into the Ghizer River.</p>
