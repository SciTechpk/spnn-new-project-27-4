                <h2>Bulls dominate as PSX climbs over 1,000 points upon boost in investor sentiment</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Bulls maintained a hold of the trading floor at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday as shares gained over 1,000 points, continuing their upward momentum following de-escalation between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>The KSE-100 index opened with a gain of 2,769 points to stand at 120,067.12 points from the previous close of 117,297.73 at 9:30am. By 3pm, the index stood at 118,605.98 points, up 1.12 per cent.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Finally, the index closed at 118,575.88 points, up 1.09pc or 1278.15 points compared to yesterday.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the PSX <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910505/psx-opens-up-over-9pc-as-ceasefire-with-india-holds">gained a record 9pc</a>, with the market mirroring the restored calm in the region after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">Pakistan-India ceasefire</a>. The development, announced by US President Donald Trump on Saturday, followed four days of tit-for-tat strikes between the nuclear-armed neighbours, as well as diplomacy and pressure from Washington.</p>
<p>Commenting on today‚Äôs surge, Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities said: ‚ÄúInvestor sentiment, initially lifted by the ceasefire, has been further boosted by Trump‚Äôs announcement to promote trade with both India and Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúEnergy stocks are gaining on expectations of a Rs1.5 trillion injection linked to the resolution of the circular debt. However, the market has yet to price in the potential impact of the International Monetary Fund tranche release and a policy rate cut to below 12pc,‚Äù he commented.</p>
<p>Yousuf M Farooq, research director at Chase Securities, also said that the market was factoring in improved macroeconomic indicators, lower interest rates and the potential reduction in super tax which would like boost corporate earning across the board.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith economic stability returning, the market‚Äôs price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is expected to gradually rerate to reflect these positive developments,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, also concurred that the market performed well in continuation of Monday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCeasefire, lower interest rate, IMF board approval, better corporate result expectations and a favourable budget expectation are driving market sentiment,‚Äù he said.</p></p>

                <h2>11 soldiers martyred, 78 wounded while defending Pakistan in Indian attack: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least 11 soldiers were martyred and 78 wounded while defending Pakistan against India‚Äôs ‚Äúunprovoked and reprehensible dastardly attacks‚Äù during the recent escalation between the neighbours, said the military‚Äôs media wing in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan under the banner of Operation Sindoor, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>On Saturday, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">announced</a> that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), 40 civilians ‚Äî including seven women and 15 children ‚Äî lost their lives in the Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.</p>
<p>The martyrs from the Pakistan Army include Naik Abdul Rehman, Lance Naik Dilawar Khan, Lance Naik Ikramullah, Naik Waqar Khalid, Sepoy Muhammad Adeel Akbar and Sepoy Nisar, as per the statement.</p>
<p>The martyrs from the Pakistan Air Force include Squadron Leader Usman Yousuf, Chief Technician Aurangzeb, Senior Technician Najeeb, Corporal Technician Farooq, and Senior Technician Mubashir.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan Armed Forces mounted a resolute response under the banner of Marka-i-Haq, delivering precise and notch-up retributive strikes through Operation Bunyanum Marsoos‚Äù, stated the ISPR in its statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTheir noble sacrifice of martyrs is an enduring symbol of courage, devotion, and unwavering patriotism ‚Äî etched forever in the nation‚Äôs memory,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúLet there be no ambiguity: any attempt to challenge Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty or territorial integrity, ever again, shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response.‚Äù</p>
<p>Paying tribute to the martyred civilians and military personnel, the ISPR offered heartfelt prayers for the recovery of the injured.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet there be no ambiguity: any attempt to challenge Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty or territorial integrity, ever again, shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response,‚Äù the statement read while reaffirming that the nation ‚Äúremains resolute in the face of aggression.‚Äù</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz Sharif has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910450/nation-celebrates-befitting-response-to-aggression">announced</a> that Youm-e-Marka-i-Haq will be observed every year on May 10 on the ‚Äúmagnificent success‚Äù of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. Friday, May 16, 2025, will be observed as a day to pay tribute to the armed forces for achieving magnificent success on the defence front and to bow before God in gratitude, he added.</p></p>
