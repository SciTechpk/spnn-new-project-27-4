            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924143/pti-protests-aim-to-destabilise-country-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>PTI protests aim to destabilise country: Sanaullah</strong></a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Monday criticised the PTI for seeking dialogue with the establishment instead of talking with politicians, suggesting the party only wanted to “destabilise the country with protests”.</p>
<p>His statement came as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, a day prior, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923918">called</a> on state institutions to engage in dialogue with the PTI but demanded that they hold themselves accountable. Gandapur and the PTI’s top leadership were on a visit to Lahore to formally launch a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923856/pti-brass-gathers-in-lahore-to-kick-start-aug-5-movement">movement</a> to seek the release of party founder Imran Khan and devise a strategy for its nationwide protest, which will reach its crescendo on August 5 — marking two years since the ex-premier was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a>.</p>
<p>Since Imran’s incarceration in several cases, which he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1890696#:~:text=He%20claimed%20that%20four%20convictions%20against%20him%20were%20politically%20motivated">claims</a> are politically motivated, his party’s relationship with the government and the establishment has turned <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832432">sour</a>. The PTI has held several <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875003/day-of-clashes-in-islamabad-ends-in-pti-protesters-retreat">protests</a> over the last year, most of which escalated into <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1857709">violence</a> after facing state repression.</p>
<p>Sanaullah said that Gandapur’s words made it clear that the PTI wanted to “destabilise the country, right after Marka-i-Haq” (referring to the recent Pakistan-India escalation) and the government’s “success in economic revival, which lent Pakistan an opportunity for stability”.</p>
<p>“Besides this, it is unknown what other agenda they have,” he added.</p>
<p>Referring to the planned 90-day and August 5 protests, Sanaullah said, “If they remain peaceful, then it’s fine (…) it is their democratic right. But if they take the law into their own hands and attempt to destabilise the country (…) then the law will take its due course.”</p>
<p>He added that this destabilisation “has been their (PTI’s) agenda from the beginning”, referring to the party demonstrating outside the International Monetary Fund (IMF) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1821812">offices</a> against their granting of an emergency <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845536">loan</a> to Pakistan.</p>
<p>He dismissed the notion that the government, despite being relatively stable now, would consider being more generous in negotiations for Imran’s release, saying that “it had nothing to do with generosity and that the case was proceeding according to the rules of the court.”</p>
<p>He pointed out how it was the PTI’s own stance in previous negotiations that Imran’s release would not be discussed, as the PTI founder himself expressed the desire to be acquitted on his own merit.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>According to Sanaullah, the government was ready to hold talks with the PTI on other issues, but he said that according to the party’s recent calls for negotiations, it “does not want dialogue with the government, but with the establishment”.</p>
<p>“They are not willing to sit down with either political parties or politicians to solve issues,” he said. “They are still stuck on their own agenda, seeking the establishment’s help to put them back into power. They are not ready for political dialogue.”</p>
<p>Asked what counter-demands the government might hold in negotiations, he said, “We have only one wish, one effort, one fight: the revival of Pakistan’s economy and its success, such that every citizen’s wellbeing is ensured and it is included on the map of the world as a welfare state.”</p>
<p>Sanaullah added that the government was ready to sit with the PTI and other parties for talks to ensure the stability required for this effort if they were willing to cooperate.</p>
<p>“It is in everybody’s mutual interest, the opposition and government’s, and everybody should agree on a ‘charter of economy’ on certain basic matters,” he said. “We are ready for any understanding or agreement in this regard.”</p>
<p>The previous day, on <em>Geo News’</em> programme “Naya Pakistan”, Sanaullah had questioned the PTI’s intention of holding negotiations alongside heavy protesting, saying, “If they want to talk, then what is the need for the 90 days, the August 5 [protests] and the march towards Lahore?”</p>
<p>However, he stated that the PTI would be granted legal permission to protest by the local administration if they remained peaceful.</p>
<p>“If they move towards violence, the law will take its course,” he added.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924133/cybercrime-agency-raids-illegal-call-centre-in-islamabad-arrests-five-foreign-nationals' target='_blank'><strong>Cybercrime agency raids illegal call centre in Islamabad, arrests five foreign nationals</strong></a>
            <p><p>The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) conducted a successful raid last night on an illegal call centre in Islamabad and arrested five foreign nationals, according to a press release issued on Monday.</p>
<p>The NCCIA press release stated that more than 60 people were working at the call centre, of which five foreign nationals were arrested during the raid.</p>
<p>“In addition to these arrests, the NCCIA will take further legal action against those who provided facilities and security to these individuals,” the statement said.</p>
<p>A spokesperson reiterated the agency’s resolve to continue its operations against all such illegal activities that amount to a violation of the country’s laws.</p>
<p>A first information report (FIR) was registered on Sunday by complainant Aamir Azeem Abbasi regarding a “task-based scam resulting in financial loss”.</p>
<p>According to the FIR, a reliable source informed that a criminal gang was operating a call centre located in Sardar Plaza, G-10 Markaz, Islamabad.</p>
<p>An inquiry concluded that the call centre activities were carried out “with active connivance of each other by impersonating as representatives of a fake and dubious online earning company.”</p>
<p>The FIR further stated “ulterior motives to extort money, contact persons of different nationalities and lure them into a dubious easy-money-making scheme.”</p>
<p>Equipment used in the execution of the digital scam was found and taken into possession by NCCIA Islamabad.</p>
<p>“The accused persons could not present any lawful justification” and confessed to working as a gang to perform electronic fraud via extortion and impersonation.“</p>
<p>The gang used internet downloaded and AI-generated photos and fake personas to “initiate conversations with isolated or vulnerable individuals through social media such as Facebook, Telegram and WhatsApp through victim hunting.”</p>
<p>The operation, per the FIR, was a multi-tier set-up consisting of scammers that chat with victims initially, Telegram receptionists who receive collated information on the victims to lure them in for more advanced tasks, finance managers, who managed crypto accounts for receiving fraudulent funds generated via local and international scams, and “killers”, who reside in foreign countries like Cambodia and empty victims’ bank accounts under the pretext of online earning.</p>
<p>The FIR concluded that the accused gang extorted “huge amounts of money from local Pakistani as well as international victims by accessing their confidential information and misusing such data for extorting money. This fraudulent money is layered via cryptocurrency wallets.”</p>
<p>The raid follows a similar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922894/149-arrested-for-online-fraud-in-raid-on-factory-in-faisalabad">incident</a> last week where the NCCIA claimed to have arrested 149 persons, including 48 Chinese and nationals of some other countries, for their alleged involvement in online fraud during a raid on a factory in Faisalabad.</p>
<p>Days after the arrest, a Faisalabad special court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923236/87-online-scam-suspects-on-physical-remand-in-faisalabad">allowed</a> a five-day physical remand of 87 suspects, including 18 women, allegedly involved in various cybercrimes, and sent 62 others to the district jail on a 14-day judicial remand, on the request of the NCCIA.</p>
<p>Last month, 18 suspects believed to be involved in a high-profile online scam were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920408/online-loan-scam-gang-busted-18-remanded-in-nccia-custody">arrested</a> and produced before a Karachi court. A judicial magistrate remanded them into the custody of the NCCIA for interrogation.</p>
<p>In May, the NCCIA, in coordination with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Dutch police, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911691">arrested</a> 21 suspects involved in cybercrime operations and digital fraud worth millions of dollars in Multan and Lahore.</p></p>

<p>Pakistan experiences Monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>In Bajaur, a woman died after the boundary wall of her house collapsed due to heavy rain and gusty winds, according to the PDMA report, while in Khyber district, two children were swept away in a flash flood after heavy rains.</p>
<p>Per the report, Rescue 1122 officials found the body of one of the children, adding that efforts were underway to find the other missing child. Another child — who was injured after being struck by lightning  — was taken to the hospital and is now in a stable condition.</p>
<p>In Kohat, a man died after the roof of his house caved in, while two children. aged seven and 12,  died as a result of a wall collapse in Malakand.</p>
