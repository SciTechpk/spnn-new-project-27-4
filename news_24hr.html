            <p><p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday hailed Pakistan’s nuclear capability as ensuring the country’s sovereignty, especially during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">recent hostilities</a> with India.</p>
<p>With a public holiday, the nation is celebrating Youm-i-Takbeer to mark the historic day of May 28, 1998 when Pakistan joined the ranks of nuclear powers after atomic tests in the hills of Chagai, Balochistan. Pakistan became the seventh nuclear nation in the world and the first Muslim state to have a nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz emphasised that Youm-i-Takbeer was more than a celebration and was a solemn reminder of Pakistan’s resolve to safeguard its sovereignty, according to his <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/on-youm-e-takbeer-pm-shehbaz-vows-economic-strength-national-unity/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> carried by the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em>.</p>
<p>He linked this year’s commemoration with what he described as Pakistan’s recent success in defending itself from “an unjustified war imposed by India”. Appreciating the nation’s spirit during the confrontation, the premier said, “The joys of Youm-i-Takbeer have further increased for a nation filled with victory.”</p>

<p>President Zardari also observed: “In today’s evolving regional security situation, our nuclear capability continues to serve as a credible minimum deterrent that guarantees our peace and ensures that no one can undermine our sovereignty and national security.”</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://ppp.org.pk/pr/33946/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, he highlighted that the 1998 achievement was not “merely a demonstration of our technological advancement — it was a calculated decision to ensure peace through strength, to maintain the strategic balance in South Asia, and to protect our nation against any external aggression”.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz, in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/CMShehbaz/status/1927598634952200309" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, said: “We thank Allah Almighty for His countless blessings and for granting us yet another glorious victory in the face of recent Indian aggression.”</p>

<p>“We commend our valiant armed forces for their unwavering resolve and determination to defend the nation’s frontiers against all external and internal threats.</p>
<p>“In the same spirit of unity and resolve, we pledge to build Pakistan into a strong economic power that would become the envy of the world,” the premier vowed.</p>
<p>He hailed his brother and then-PM Nawaz Sharif for making “Pakistan’s defence invincible with his bold and courageous decision in 1998 to go ahead with a peaceful nuclear test in the face of strong opposition from many powerful countries”.</p>
<p>He also paid tribute to former president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto for his “visionary leadership”, as well as “brilliant scientists and engineers who turned the vision and aspirations of the entire nation into reality”.</p>
<p>In his special statement on the occasion, PM Shehbaz urged the nation to carry the spirit of Youm-i-Takbeer beyond defence and into economic transformation.</p>
<p>Thanking patriotic Pakistanis, he said, “I salute the nation, which made immense sacrifices for the completion of the nuclear programme and wrote a proud story of its determination and faith.”</p>
<p>Reflecting on the historic nuclear tests conducted during Nawaz’s tenure, Shehbaz noted that the decision to respond with six nuclear tests, compared to India’s five, was a demonstration of “iron resolve” in the face of global pressure and sanctions.</p>
<p>“Mr Nawaz Sharif represented the aspirations and national interests of the entire nation … and made our geographical borders impregnable forever,” the premier stressed.</p>
<p>The premier also paid glowing tribute to the architects of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, including Bhutto and Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan. He invoked the leadership of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and said, “National history is a witness that the people and political leadership of Pakistan have always made the impossible possible.”</p>
<p>Twenty-seven years ago, a team of Pakistani scientists led by Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan and Dr Samar Mubarakmand carried out nuclear tests in the Raskoh Hills in Chagai, upon <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1369428">Nawaz’s decision</a> in response to Indian nuclear tests.</p>

<p>In his message on the occasion, President Zardari noted that Pakistan “demonstrated its strategic patience and commitment to peace” in the face of recent unprovoked Indian aggression.</p>
<p>“Our calibrated response, under Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, was measured and effective, which forced the enemy to cease its hostile actions.”</p>
<p>He reaffirmed that Pakistan did not seek conflict and was committed to the principles of peaceful coexistence and respect for international law. “This day serves as a reminder of our commitment to safeguarding the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of our beloved country,” the president said.</p>
<p>President Zardari also paid a rich tribute to Pakistani scientists, engineers, as civil and military leadership. He also appreciated Bhutto for laying the foundation of the nuclear programme and ex-premier Benazir Bhutto’s role in further strengthening it.</p>

<p>The armed forces of Pakistan, along with the chairman joint chiefs of staff committee and the services chiefs, extended heartfelt felicitations to the nation on the 27th anniversary of Youm-i-Takbeer.</p>
<p>According to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Youm-i-Takbeer commemorated the momentous occasion in 1998 when Pakistan emerged as a nuclear power, restoring the strategic balance in South Asia and asserting its sovereign right to self-defence.</p>
<p>The statement said this historic achievement epitomises the nation’s resolve, unity, and unwavering pursuit of a dignified and peaceful existence.</p>
<p>“Pakistan’s strategic capability is a national trust, reflecting the collective aspirations of its people. The commemoration of Youm-e-Takbeer is a tribute to the foresight of visionary leadership, the brilliance of our scientists and engineers, and the countless contributions of all those who rendered Pakistan’s defence unassailable,” it added.</p>
<p>“Let this day renew our collective pledge to remain vigilant, united, and resolute in our commitment to the security, progress, and prosperity of our beloved homeland.”</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913826/consumers-to-bear-burden-as-k-electric-allowed-to-build-recovery-losses-into-tariff' target='_blank'><strong>Consumers to bear burden as K-Electric allowed to build recovery losses into tariff</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: In a major policy departure, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Tuesday approved K-Electric’s request to incorporate unrecovered bills into its consumer tariff — starting with a recovery shortfall of 6.75 per cent in 2023-24, gradually declining to 3.5pc by 2029-30.</p>
<p>Nepra set K-Electric’s base tariff at Rs40 per unit for the fiscal year 2023-24, which is almost 40pc higher than even the national average tariff of about Rs28 per unit in 2025-26 for the 10 public sector power distribution companies (Discos).</p>
<p>The delta between the Discos’ average and K-Electric’s tariff is transferred to the taxpayers through the federal budget in the form of tariff differential subsidy.</p>
<p>In a detailed determination, the regulator changed K-Electric’s tariff mechanism based on 100pc recovery of bills and instead allowed recovery losses in the tariff, starting from 6.75pc in FY24 and gradually declining to 3.5pc by F30.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">

</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, the Discos’ tariff is still based on a 100pc recovery of bills. The judgement on K-Electric indicated that a similar charge may be coming up for Discos’ tariff in the shape of higher costs to honest consumers.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“To ensure sufficient liquidity in the power market and to align the collection targets with current market realities, the authority has decided to allow recovery loss to K-Electric,” Nepra said, directing K-Electric to ensure collection of 93.35pc of FY24 billing, 93.6pc in FY25, 94.4pc in FY26, 95.19pc in FY27, 95.7pc in FY28, 96.10pc in FY29, and 96.5pc in FY30.</p>
<p>The loss recovery allowance, starting at 93.25pc, was opposed by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division). Although it supported the loss recovery allowance through tariff, apparently to claim similar dispensation for government-owned Discos, it said a lower recovery ratio should be allowed, starting with 96.7pc, and an increase in commercial losses should be benchmarked against efficient Discos to arrive at reasonable targets.</p>
<p>Nepra set the total average tariff at Rs39.97 per unit for FY24, which included a power purchase cost of Rs31.96, transmission cost of Rs2.86, distribution cost of Rs3.31, and supply margin of Rs2.28, with a negative prior-year adjustment of 44 paise per unit to ensure total revenue requirement of Rs606 billion.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the above tariff is based on almost half of the power supply from the national grid; otherwise, K-Electric’s average base rate would have been much higher.</p>
<p>This determination covers a total power dispatch of 17,768 gigawatt-hours (GWh) — 48pc sourced from the national grid, 42pc from K-Electric’s own generation, and 9.9pc from private suppliers.</p>
<p>K-Electric’s total revenue requirement determined by Nepra at Rs606.92bn for FY24 included a supply margin Rs34.68bn, operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) allowance at Rs5.91bn, negative working capital adjustment of Rs1.244bn, recovery loss of Rs36.25bn, gross margin of Rs40.92bn, and net margin of Rs34.68bn after a negative prior-year adjustment of Rs6.69bn.</p>
<p>The power regulator noted that K-Electric’s previous multi-year tariff (MYT) for 2017-23 did not allow any provision on account of recovery loss. Instead, actual write-offs were allowed subject to prescribed criteria.</p>
<p>Considering that FY24 had already lapsed and FY25 was almost 10 months gone, K-Electric’s actual recovery for FY24 remained at 91.5pc, whereas FY25 was expected to close at 90.5pc, it said. The financial impact of these under-recoveries was around Rs40bn and Rs57bn, respectively.</p>
<p>“The authority noted that return allowed to K-Electric for its distribution function is around Rs21.6bn, meaning thereby that effectively K-Electric would be incurring losses for the first two years of MYT, if no recovery loss is allowed to K-Electric. This may compromise the financial viability of the company, which is neither in the interest of the consumers nor power system as whole,” Nepra said.</p>
<p>The regulator said that Discos were not allowed any recovery loss, but the federal government had the power to levy surcharges to offset the inefficiencies of Discos arising from high losses and under-recoveries. However, no such option is available for K-Electric, as it can only charge the regulated tariff.</p>
<p>It said the National Electricity Policy 2021 empowered Nepra to revisit the target for collections and align with the current market realities through “efficient tariff structures for sufficient liquidity in the power market” as “international precedents also suggest that 100pc billing recovery is generally not mandated”.</p>
<p><strong>Solar projects</strong></p>
<p>In a separate development, Nepra approved bidding results of K-Electric’s two solar-powered plants with a combined capacity of 150 megawatts, promising the lowest-ever rates in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Under the determination, Master Textile Mills Limited has been declared the lowest bidder at the lowest offered tariff of Rs11.6508 (4.0363 US cents) per kilowatt-hour for the 50MW Winder project, and Rs11.21 (3.8826 US cents) per kWh for the 100MW Bela project.</p>
<p>The two projects are estimated to bring savings, both in terms of cost and forex outflow, in both national and K-Electric’s grids, by displacing the existing expensive generation, Nepra said.</p>
<p>It added that energy cost savings due to fuel displacement were estimated at Rs2.3bn annually, amounting to a total of Rs57.8bn over the life of the projects. Additionally, the projects are estimated to generate annual foreign exchange savings of $17.01 million, totalling $425.2m in savings over their lifespan.</p>

            <p><p>SpaceX’s Starship rocket roared into space from Texas on Tuesday but spun out of control about halfway through its flight without achieving some of its most important testing goals, bringing fresh engineering hurdles to CEO Elon Musk’s increasingly turbulent Mars rocket programme.</p>
<p>The 400-foot tall (122 metre) Starship rocket system, the core of Musk’s goal of sending humans to Mars, lifted off from SpaceX’s Starbase, Texas, launch site, flying beyond the point of two previous explosive <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896361">attempts</a> earlier this year that sent debris streaking over Caribbean islands and forced dozens of airliners to divert course.</p>
<p>For the latest launch, the ninth full test mission of Starship since the first attempt in April 2023, the upper-stage cruise vessel was lofted to space atop a previously flown booster — a first such demonstration of the booster’s reusability.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>But SpaceX lost contact with the 232-foot lower-stage booster during its descent before it plunged into the sea, rather than making the controlled splashdown the company had planned.</p>
<p>Starship, meanwhile, continued into suborbital space but began to spin uncontrollably roughly 30 minutes into the mission. The errant spiraling came after SpaceX cancelled a plan to deploy eight mock Starlink satellites into space — the rocket’s “Pez” candy dispenser-like mechanism failed to work as designed.</p>
<p>“Not looking great with a lot of our on-orbit objectives for today,” SpaceX broadcaster Dan Huot said on a company livestream.</p>
<p>Musk was scheduled to deliver an update on his space exploration ambitions in a speech from Starbase following the test flight, billed as a livestream presentation about “The Road to Making Life Multiplanetary.” Hours later, he had yet to give the speech and there was no sign that he intended to do so.</p>
<p>In a post on X, Musk touted Starship’s scheduled shutdown of an engine in space, a step previous test flights achieved last year. He said a leak on Starship’s primary fuel tank led to its loss of control.</p>
<p>“Lot of good data to review,” he said.</p>
<p>“Launch cadence for next three flights will be faster, at approximately one every three to four weeks.”</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#risk-tolerant" id="risk-tolerant" title="Permalink"></a>Risk-tolerant</h2>
<p>The recent setbacks indicate SpaceX is struggling to overcome a complicated chapter of Starship’s multibillion-dollar development. But the company’s engineering culture, widely considered more risk-tolerant than many of the aerospace industry’s more established players, is built on a flight-testing strategy that pushes spacecraft to the point of failure, then fine-tunes improvements through frequent repetition.</p>
<p>Starship’s planned trajectory for Tuesday included a nearly full orbit around Earth for a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean to test new designs of its heat shield tiles and revised flaps for steering its blazing re-entry and descent through Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>But its early demise, appearing as a fireball streaking eastward through the night sky over southern Africa, puts another pause in Musk’s speedy development goals for a rocket bound to play a central role in the US space programme.</p>
<p>NASA plans to use the rocket to land humans on the moon in 2027, though that moon programme faces turmoil amid Musk’s Mars-focused influence over US President Donald Trump’s administration.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#mishap-probe" id="mishap-probe" title="Permalink"></a>Mishap probe</h2>
<p>Federal regulators had granted SpaceX a licence for Starship’s latest flight attempt four days ago, capping a mishap investigation that had grounded Starship for nearly two months.</p>
<p>The last two test flights — in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885963">January</a> and March — were cut short moments after liftoff as the vehicles blew to pieces on ascent, raining debris over parts of the Caribbean and disrupting scores of commercial airline flights in the region.</p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration expanded debris hazard zones around the ascent path for Tuesday’s launch.</p>
<p>The previous <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1790466">back-to-back</a> failures occurred in early test-flight phases that SpaceX had easily achieved before, in a striking setback to a program that Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur who founded the rocket company in 2002, had sought to accelerate this year.</p>
<p>Musk, the world’s wealthiest individual and a key supporter of US President Donald Trump, was especially eager for a success after vowing in recent days to refocus his attention on his various business ventures, including SpaceX, following a tumultuous foray into national politics and his attempts at cutting government bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Closer to home, Musk also sees Starship as eventually replacing the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as the workhorse in the company’s commercial launch business, which already lofts most of the world’s satellites and other payloads to low-Earth orbit.</p></p>
