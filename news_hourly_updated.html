                <h2>DG ISPR says ‚ÄòIndian-sponsored terrorists‚Äô behind Khuzdar attack</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has reiterated that ‚ÄúIndian state-sponsored terrorism against Pakistan‚Äù ‚Äî which has been ongoing since the inception of the country ‚Äî was also responsible for the recent attack in Balochistan‚Äôs Khuzdar.</p>
<p>On May 21, at least six people, including three students, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912572/bla-and-ttp-are-indian-proxies-govt-will-prove-indias-involvement-in-khuzdar-bus-attack-asif">slain</a> while over 40 others ‚Äî mostly students ‚Äî were injured after a bomb targeted a school bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the army‚Äôs top brass, during the 270th Corps Commander Conference (CCC), had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912622/armys-top-brass-vows-to-stop-externally-sponsored-terrorists-from-destroying-national-peace-ispr">pointed out</a> India‚Äôs involvement in the incident, vowing that the armed forces will prevent the country‚Äôs peace from being compromised by ‚Äúexternally-sponsored terrorism.‚Äù</p>
<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry was addressing a press conference in Islamabad today alongside the Interior Secretary, Captain (retd) Khurram Muhammad Agha.</p>
<p>Speaking about Indian involvement in terrorist incidents in Pakistan, which the DG ISPR maintained had been happening since the ‚Äúinception of the country‚Äù, he said that in 2009, the Pakistani government had handed a dossier containing ‚Äúirrefutable evidence‚Äù to the Indian prime minister.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe publicly disclosed documents that were released in 2010 are part of history. In 2016, the world saw another ugly face of India-sponsored terrorism in Balochistan in the name of Kulbushan Jadhav, a serving Indian naval officer,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen in 2019, a dossier full of evidence was presented to the United Nations.
Very recently, the international media has seen confessions and acknowledgement of multiple surrendered terrorists of this <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em>, a government-designated term for all terror outfits in Balochistan.</p>
<p>At the start of the press conference, Interior Secretary Agha also said that whatever happened on May 21 was on the orders of Hindustan, carried out by the terrorists of <em>Fitnah Al Hindustan</em>, referring to the attack on a school bus in Khuzdar in Balochistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the aftermath of the despicable terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar in the early morning of May 21, this cowardly attack targeted innocent children of our future resulting in the tragic loss of six children and injuries to 31 others.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet me be unequivocal that this was not an attack on a bus alone, it was an attack on our values, on our education and the very fabric of our society.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn behalf of the government of Pakistan, I extend my deepest condolences to the families of the victims, we share their grief and we stand by them in this hour of immense suffering. The Ministry of Interior in close cooperation with the provincial authorities and the law enforcement agencies are looking into all of this dastardly attack.‚Äù</p>
<p>Agha said initial findings confirm that this attack is a continuity of a broader pattern of violence sponsored by India through <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em> operating under the tutelage and intelligence of the Indian intelligence agency, RAW [Research and Analysis Wing].</p>
<p>‚ÄúHaving miserably failed in the so-called Operation Sindoor, the terror proxies of Hindustan have been tasked to accentuate their heinous attacks of terrorism in Balochistan and elsewhere. Let me be absolutely clear here, the people of Pakistan will not let them succeed. Pakistan and its people, particularly in Balochistan reject this nefarious design. The state has the capacity and the will to dismantle these networks and bring the perpetrators and their handlers to justice. Such actions will have consequences.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said in the past couple of years, having suffered immense casualties in their attempts against hard targets, <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em> has resorted to hitting soft targets wayfarers, labourers working on development projects, infrastructure and machinery to paint a picture of loosening control of the State.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMuch against the tradition and culture of the Baloch, these terrorists have stooped so low that innocent school children have now been targeted.
I assure you that the State in collaboration with the provincial governments and the state apparatus will defeat them.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese Indian-sponsored terrorists have no place in Pakistan and our national discourse. We have ‚Ä¶ commitment to bring an end to this violence. Our resolve is firm and our response will be decisive. They will not succeed.‚Äù</p>
<p>In the same vein, the DG ISPR said that India was ‚Äúplanning and instructing‚Äù the terrorist activities taking place in Pakistan, adding that the funding for the activities was also provided by India.</p>
<p>He continued that the attack in Balochistan had nothing to do with the Baloch identity, rather it was just India‚Äôs provocation.</p>
<p>The DG ISPR highlighted the attack on the Chinese envoy in Karachi in Oct 2024. He said, ‚ÄúThe Indian social media accounts affiliated with RAW posted about the attack prior to the attack.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that the same thing happened during the hijacking of Jaffar Express. ‚ÄúBefore the Jaffer Express incident occurred, they were saying: ‚ÄòKeep an eye on Pakistan today and tomorrow‚Äô.‚Äù</p>
<p>He pointed out that the Indian media was ‚Äúcelebrating‚Äù the attack in Khuzdar. ‚ÄúThese are all Indian accounts, affiliated with RAW [and] posting for BLA [Balochistan Liberation Army] and <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat kind of a country celebrates acts of terrorism?‚Äù</p>
<p>Speaking on the May 6 and 7 Indian attacks, which resulted in civilian deaths in Pakistan, he said, ‚ÄúNever in modern history,  have you seen any nation, any media celebrating the killing of children and women the way they are celebrating.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is the low moral fibre and level that the current Indian political elite has brought the society to.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOne of the proxies of the <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em> on May 11 issued a press release,‚Äù the DG ISPR said, displaying a post from BLA.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey say ‚ÄòIf we receive political, diplomatic and defence support from India‚Äô; They say ‚ÄòWe assure India to attack the western border [‚Ä¶] BLA and the entire nation is ready to attack from the western border. We will become its [India‚Äôs] practical and military arm‚Äô.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that RAW made BLA issue this press release ‚Äúbecause they are unable to deter the state of Pakistan ‚Ä¶ They attack but the resolve of Pakistani people has not diminished.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWill we get deterred from the <em>Fitna al Hindustan</em> with such press releases and cowardly actions? Absolutely not. Never,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis nexus [and] <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em> have no relation to the Baloch identity and Pakistan. They are related to them [India]. They are their masters and perpetrators. This the evil face of <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em>.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWho is the state-sponsored terror in this region?‚Äù he said, adding that the world can see now but they [India] blame Pakistan. ‚ÄúThey [India] do this to hide from their own terrorism.‚Äù</p>
<p>He further said, ‚ÄúInstead of refraining from their oppression of minorities or finding a solution, they are doing terrorism in Pakistan and the region.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey are externalising internal issues and when anyone asks for evidence, they do not have evidence. Who is the state sponsor of terrorism and the epicentre of destabilisation in this region?‚Äù he questioned.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Indian state-controlled media. Their media is not free, but controlled by the state,‚Äù he said, adding that those who were questioning media freedom in Pakistan were now aware of how free it was, compared to the ‚Äúconditions of media in a so-called democracy [India].‚Äù</p>
<p>To a question about a policy to counter <em>Fitnah al Hindustan</em>, the DG ISPR replied: I would say that one-liner policy is that the nation, this iron wall, we fought in a gallant and exemplary manner against the Indian military aggression on the night of [May] 6 and 7 and you saw it again on May 10.</p>
<p>This steel wall needs to be in unison turned against the forces of terrorism.‚Äú</p>
<p>The DGR ISPR further said: ‚ÄúWe need to understand certain facts. Why did the Indians feel the need to do this military escalation? One of the very important reasons was that all elements of national power over the last two years have gelled together.‚Äù</p>
<p>Answering a question about the Baloch Yakjehti Committee and its leader Dr Mahrang Baloch, the military spokesperson said that the media needed to ‚Äúunmask‚Äù the group and its membership.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUnmask the BYC and Mahrang Baloch‚Äôs evil faces,‚Äù Lt Gen Chaudhry said. ‚ÄúThey talk about human rights but terrorists have no relation to human rights or religion.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey talk about human rights and missing persons, but when we kill terrorists, we identify them with DNA. They often turn out to be missing persons themselves,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>DG ISPR also questioned the group when they attempted to take custody of the bodies of terrorists killed during the Jaffer Express hijacking in March.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWho is she and who are they to take terrorists‚Äô bodies?‚Äù He emphasised.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe state will prosecute; they have a process,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIt is now clear that the BYC is a proxy of terrorism. Terrorists and their proxies have to be dealt with in the way that any nation deals with proxies. There is no doubt; there should be absolute clarity on that.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>Pakistan rubbishes Indian PM Modi‚Äôs bid to link Islamabad with terrorism</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office on Friday categorically rejected the ‚Äúbaseless, provocative, and irresponsible allegations‚Äù made by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who in a heated speech accused Pakistan of carrying out terrorist attacks in his country.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between New Delhi and Islamabad came as tensions over last month‚Äôs Pahalgam attack continued to build up, as India ‚Äîwithout evidence ‚Äî blamed Pakistan for the attack. On the night of May 6-7, India launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting</a> drones sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat</a> strikes on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns and declare a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">ceasefire</a>. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">offered talks</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Indian premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912761/no-water-for-pakistan-from-indian-rivers-modi">said</a> that Pakistan would not get water from rivers over which India has rights.</p>
<p>According to a statement <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1925764355250950294/photo/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued</a> by the FO on X today, ‚ÄúPakistan categorically rejects the baseless, provocative, and irresponsible allegations made by the Indian prime minister during a recent public address in Rajasthan.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe remarks, replete with distortions, misrepresentations, and inflammatory rhetoric, are clearly aimed at stoking regional tensions for narrow political gains,‚Äù the FO said, adding that such statements not only reflect a deliberate attempt to mislead the public but also violate the norms responsible statecraft.</p>
<p>‚ÄúResorting to threats and boasting about military action against a sovereign nation is a grave breach of the United Nations Charter and established principles of international law,‚Äù the FO said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis dangerous approach undermines regional peace and stability,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The foreign ministry said that Pakistan remained a ‚Äúconsistent and proactive partner in the global fight against terrorism‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAny insinuation seeking to associate Pakistan with acts of terrorism is factually incorrect and patently misleading,‚Äù it continued.</p>
<p>It noted that the Indian premier‚Äôs tactic was ‚Äúoften employed to divert attention from India‚Äôs own internal challenges‚Äù, adding that the Indian attempts to mask its ‚Äúserious human rights violations‚Äù in occupied Kashmir by scapegoating Pakistan were well-documented and increasingly recognised by the international community.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe plight of the Kashmiri people and their just struggle for self-determination cannot be obscured by aggressive rhetoric and political deflection.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pakistan urged the Indian leadership to ‚Äúexercise responsibility and restraint‚Äù, the FO said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEscalatory statements and belligerent posturing serve no purpose other than exacerbating tensions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRather than resorting to fictitious narratives and warmongering for electoral mileage, India should demonstrate maturity by resolving outstanding disputes through peaceful dialogue and diplomacy,‚Äù the FO noted.</p>
<p>It added that Pakistan remained firmly committed to ‚Äúpeaceful coexistence, regional stability, and constructive engagement‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, our desire for peace should not be misconstrued as weakness,‚Äù it said, adding that the people and the armed forced were ‚Äúfully prepared and capable of defending the country‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAny misadventure or aggression will be met with a resolute and proportionate response,‚Äù the FO added.</p>
<p>It said that Pakistan has demonstrated its resolve in the past and will do so again, if required.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe international community must take serious note of India‚Äôs aggressive posture and hate-driven narratives that threaten regional peace,‚Äù it said, adding that it was ‚Äúimperative to discourage such rhetoric and actions to preserve stability in South Asia‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGlorification of conflict benefits no one, and the path to lasting peace lies in dialogue, mutual respect, and adherence to international law,‚Äù it concluded.</p></p>
