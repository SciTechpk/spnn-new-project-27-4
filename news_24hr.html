            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929333/nepra-slashes-uniform-tariff-by-rs189-for-aug-oct' target='_blank'><strong>Nepra slashes uniform tariff by Rs1.89 for Aug-Oct</strong></a>
            <p><p>The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Thursday notified a decrease of Rs1.89 in the uniform tariff for the next three months.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/Ex-WAPDA%20DISCOS/2025/TRF-100%20XWDISCOS%20PERIODIC%20ADJUSTMENT%20FY%202024-25%2007-08-2025%2012380-83.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a> dated August 7 and available with <em>Dawn.com</em> said that the authority “decided to allow the application of instant quarterly adjustments on the consumers of K-Electric as well, with the same applicability period.</p>
<p>“Accordingly, the instant quarterly adjustment of negative Rs1.8881/kWh (per kilowatt hour) shall also be charged from the consumers of K-Electric except life line and prepaid consumers, to be recovered in a period of three months [from] August 2025 to October 2025.”</p>
<p>Nepra stated that this discount will be applied to bills for the applicable period issued before the notification, adding that distribution companies (Discos) will comply with court orders.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nepra also notified a negative fuel cost adjustment (FCA) of Rs0.78 per unit for consumers of all ex-Wapda distribution companies (XWDiscos) except for K-Electric (KE) in their bills for August.</p>
<p>According to a separate Nepra <a class="link--external" href="https://nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/Ex-WAPDA%20DISCOS/2025/TRF-100%20XWDISCOS%20FCA%20JUN%202025%2007-08-2025%2012350-66.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a> — also dated August 7 and available with <em>Dawn.com</em> — the authority decided on an FCA of Rs0.78 for the month of June 2025 based on variations in fuel charges in the approved tariffs of XWDiscos.</p>
<p>Nepra decided that the FCA “shall be applicable to all consumer categories except lifeline consumers, protected consumers, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and pre-paid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for pre-paid tariff”, the notification read.</p>
<p>The notification stated that XWDiscos would reflect the June FCA in the billing month of August 2025, which would be shown separately on consumers’ bills based on the units billed to them in June.</p>
<p>“In case any bills of August 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in [the] subsequent month,” Nepra added.</p>
<p>“While effecting the Fuel Charges Adjustment, the concerned XWDiscos shall keep in view and strictly comply with the orders of the courts, notwithstanding this order.”</p>
<p>In another notification from today, Nepra replied to a request from the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA-G) seeking a monthly FCA for June, finding that based on the information provided, the actual pool fuel cost was Rs.7.68 per kilowatt hour (kWh) against the reference fuel cost component of Rs.8.3341 per kWh</p>
<p>“The actual fuel charges, as claimed by CPРА, for the June 2025 decreased by Rs.0.65 per kWh as compared to the reference fuel charges,” the notification read.</p>
<p>Today’s notifications come in the wake of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928756">Nepra hearing</a> discussing complaints of overbilling and requests for a negative FCA.</p>
<p>The regulator had called the public hearing on the request of XWDiscos seeking a negative quarterly adjustment of Rs1.80 per unit to refund about Rs53.4 billion to consumers from August to October. The refund stems from savings in capacity payments during the fourth quarter (April-June) of FY2025.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929324/na-passes-bill-to-establish-pakistan-land-port-authority' target='_blank'><strong>NA passes bill to establish Pakistan Land Port Authority</strong></a>
            <p><p>The National Assembly passed the Pakistan Land Port Authority Bill 2025 on Thursday to facilitate the movement of goods and people across border crossing points.</p>
<p>With the bill’s approval, Pakistan would become the third South Asian country, after Bangladesh and India, to have a land port authority. The Bangladesh Land Port Authority was created in 2002, while India did so in March 2012.</p>
<p>“The House discussed and passed the Pakistan Land Port Authority Bill, 2025,” the NA’s official X account said. The bill was moved by Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry on behalf of Interior Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi.</p>
<p>Once approved by the Senate and signed by President Asif Ali Zardari, the bill will establish the Pakistan Land Port Authority, which would function as a statutory body responsible for inter-agency coordination to facilitate the movement of goods and people across border crossing points.</p>
<p>As MNA Ali Zahid, who was chairing the session, ordered the clause-by-clause reading of the bill, PPP’s Syed Naveed Qamar noted that his party had reservations on some clauses.</p>

</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“The legislative committee of the party went through the bill and suggested a whole number of amendments in the bill to make it a better authority,” Qamar, chairman of the NA’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, said.</p>
<p>“[…] We have accepted the bill after going through a lot of deliberations and negotiations with the committee,” Qamar noted.</p>
<p>On the invitation of Zahid, Qamar read out amendments to at least 12 clauses of the legislation, each of which Chaudhry said he had no objection to. They were individually moved before the House and voted in favour of, and subsequently, the bill was passed as well.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#the-pakistan-land-port-authority-bill" id="the-pakistan-land-port-authority-bill" title="Permalink"></a>The Pakistan Land Port Authority Bill</h2>
<p>The PPP government made the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/775056/land-port-authority-for-cross-border-trade">first attempt</a> to establish a land port authority in 2012 under the ambit of the commerce ministry, while the PTI government made the <a class="link--external" href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2335944/plpa-to-start-operation-in-february-2022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">second attempt</a> in 2021.</p>
<p>The PML-N government had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1287704/formation-of-land-port-authority-discussed">discussed</a> the matter during its previous tenure in 2016, with various models of upgraded border posts for covered cargo at Jamrud, Taftan and Sost mulled.</p>
<p>In December 2024, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar moved the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.na.gov.pk/uploads/documents/6763fef237324_339.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bill</a> on behalf of Naqvi, but at the time, Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah had not referred it to the relevant committee.</p>

<p>The proposed legislation will provide a framework for the declaration, regulation, security and oversight of all land ports for promoting trade, fostering free competition, implementing border control and protecting the country’s strategic interests.</p>
<p>The port authority will establish a robust mechanism to carry out effective coordination with border agencies for trade facilitation in pursuance of commitments under international agreements and conventions for improved land port efficiency and regional port competitiveness.</p>
<p>The bill also proposes the establishment of a 16-member governing council for supervising the authority.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no single agency for the coordinated functioning of various government authorities and service providers at international border points. This lack of coordination sometimes causes a delay in the flow of goods and passengers.</p>
<p>High-tech equipment is also needed to be installed at land ports to check illegal immigration and smuggling of goods.</p></p>

            <p><p>A massive blaze at a factory in the Karachi Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) near Landhi that injured eight people and damaged at least three other factories was brought under control on Thursday after hours of rescue efforts, officials said.</p>
<p>Fire incidents are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1873202">common</a> in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1872866/fire-erupts-in-high-rise-near-chundrigar-road">metropolis</a> due to the absence of adequate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1873091/fire-erupts-in-model-colony-warehouse-after-cylinder-blast">fire safety measures</a> in buildings.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “A total of 20 fire tenders with two snorkels, five ambulances and water boozers were engaged in the fire that was controlled at 4pm.”</p>
<p>The rescue official detailed that they received information about the incident at 10am, following which hectic efforts remained underway till the fire was put out in the evening. However, cooling work continued.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Some repair/construction work was also underway at the factory, whose structure ostensibly appeared to be weak,” Haseeb said. He added that eight factory workers who were removing goods, despite warnings from firemen not to do so, were injured as part of the building collapsed.</p>
<p>“They did not give any heed to such warnings, probably [because] they were under strict instructions from the factory management to remove the goods from it and shift the same to a safer place,” the Rescue 1122 official explained.</p>
<p>According to the rescue spokesperson, the factory staff told the firemen that some welding work was ongoing in the five-storey building’s basement, which triggered the fire. Further investigation into the incident was underway.</p>
<p>Haseeb noted: “It was a vast area and wind direction was heavy, which caused rapid spread of the fire, and resultantly, three adjoining factories also caught fire.”</p>
<p>While the structure of those three factories was intact, they sustained damage. However, the first building from which the fire originated was completely destroyed.</p>
<p>The Rescue 1122 spokesperson estimated there were 1,200 workers who worked in the said factories and were evacuated safely.</p>
<p>Haseeb said some fire tenders were dispatched initially, but realising the gravity of the problem, more fire tenders were called from the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s Fire Brigade and Rescue 1122.</p>
<p>“The injured were taken to a nearby hospital via Edhi ambulance,” Rescue 1122 said in a statement earlier today.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the fire and directed officials to take immediate steps to save people on a priority basis.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>He directed all fire brigades and rescue agencies to take immediate action, while Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi was tasked with a thorough inquiry into the cause.</p>
<p>The chief minister assured factory owners and workers affected by the incident of full assistance.</p>
<p>CM Shah was informed that many employees were present inside the factory when the blaze broke out, but rescue teams successfully evacuated all personnel safely.</p>
<p>The chief minister was informed that one individual was injured during the building collapse and issued directives to provide immediate medical aid to the victim.</p>
<p>A massive <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916181">fire</a> that broke out at a factory in KEPZ in June was brought under control after 36 hours. The blaze destroyed three factories completely and left five people injured, including four firefighters who sustained burns and injuries from falling debris, the officials said.</p>
<p>A similar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903361">incident</a> took place in April. No casualties were reported, but four people, including one firefighter, were affected by smoke inhalation, while 12 fire tenders worked for four hours to bring the fire under control.</p>
