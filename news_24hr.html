            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920880/indian-ban-fails-to-hit-pakistans-trade' target='_blank'><strong>Indian ban fails to hit Pakistan’s trade</strong></a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: India’s attempt to disrupt Pakistan’s external trade by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908171">banning</a> ships carrying Pakistani goods from anchoring at its ports has failed to yield the desired impact, according to shipping industry representatives.</p>
<p>On May 2, India imposed a ban on ships carrying goods originating from or destined for Pakistan, barring them from entering Indian ports or transiting through Indian territory. The move followed military aggression under ‘<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988">Operation Sindoor</a>’ launched on May 7, which ended within four days due to Pakistan’s forceful <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">retaliation.</a></p>
<p>While India initially sought to hurt Pakistan’s trade flows, the outcome fell short of expectations. Shipping companies reportedly adapted by separating cargo bound for and from Pakistan, thereby avoiding dependence on Indian ports.</p>
<p>Importers, however, said the Indian ban has resulted in longer shipping times and higher freight charges.</p>
<p>“Mother vessels are not coming to Pakistan due to this Indian action, which delays our imports by 30 to 50 days,” said Javed Bilwani, President of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He added that importers are now relying on feeder vessels, which raises costs.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Shipping delays push up costs, but exporters report minimal impact on overall trade</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exporters also reported a spike in shipping and insurance costs following the Indian aggression. However, they said the overall impact on exports remains minimal.</p>
<p>“There is no significant impact on exports after the Indian aggression, except for a rise in insurance costs. Shipping charges had already gone up even before the escalation,” said Aamir Aziz, an exporter of textile made-ups.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s exports are heavily reliant on imported inputs for value addition. With the government maintaining tight controls on imports to conserve foreign exchange, any disruption in supply chains has broader economic implications.</p>
<p>However, Pakistan Ship’s Agents Association Secretary General Syed Tahir Hussain dismissed claims that mother vessels have stopped calling at Pakistani ports.</p>
<p>“You can see mother vessels at Karachi and Port Qasim,” he said. “Feeder vessels are also sufficient to handle Pakistan’s trade volume, as they can carry between 6,000 and 8,000 containers — well above the current level of our exports and imports.”</p>
<p><strong>Trade with India</strong></p>
<p>Formal trade relations between Pakistan and India have remained <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1499076">frozen</a> since 2019. Bilateral trade declined from $2.41bn in 2018 to $1.2bn in 2024. Pakistan’s exports to India decreased from $547.5 million in 2019 to just $480,000 in 2024.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, unofficial trade is thriving. <em>Al Jazeera</em>, quoting the India-based Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), reported last month that unofficial Indian exports to Pakistan are estimated at $10bn per year.</p>
<p>This parallel trade has been facilitated through alternate routes, including ports in Dubai (UAE), Colombo (Sri Lanka), and Singapore.</p>
<p>India’s exports include pharmaceuticals, petroleum products, plastics, rubber, organic chemicals, dyes, vegetables, spices, coffee, tea, dairy items, and cereals. Pakistan’s key exports to India consist of copper, glassware, organic chemicals, sulphur, fruits and nuts, and certain oilseeds.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920890/sc-decision-upholding-transfer-of-judges-to-ihc-challenged' target='_blank'><strong>SC decision upholding transfer of judges to IHC challenged</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Five judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) have challenged the Supreme Court’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918159/sc-constitutional-bench-dismisses-pleas-against-transfer-of-ihc-judges">decision</a> to uphold the transfer of three judges from other high courts to the federal capital.</p>
<p>The appeal was filed on Saturday, two days before the Judicial Commission of Pakistan’s (JCP) meeting to appoint chief justices to at least three high courts on July 1.</p>
<p>In its judgement anno­unced on June 19, the Supreme Court’s Const­itutional Bench, had held by a majority of 3-2 that the transfer of three judges to IHC from Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan high cou­rts was within the framework of the Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>The Constitutional</strong></p>
<p>Ben­ch had also partially sent the matter to the president to determine seniority amongst judges, based on their service records.</p>
<p>Now, IHC’s justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz, who originally challenged the transfers, have filed an intra-court appeal (ICA) against the June 19 judgement.</p>
<p>The ICA, jointly moved by senior counsel Muneer A. Malik and Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed, urged the court to set aside the order in the interest of justice.</p>
<p>While the appeal is heard, the Supreme Court should grant an interim relief against the judgment, the applicants pleaded.</p>
<p>The five judges have requested the Supreme Court not to consider justices Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, Khadim Hussain Soomro and Muhammad Asif as judges of IHC until they take fresh oaths in accordance with Article 194 Justice Dogar is also the acting chief justice of IHC.</p>
<p>The appeal contended that Section 3 of the Islamabad High Court Act 2010 only provides for the appointment of judges to the IHC from other provinces but makes no reference to transfers.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The appeal contended that the June 19 order impermissibly reads in “permanent” in Article 200(1) and (2) of the Constitution when no such language was contained in the provision.</p>
<p>The appeal pleaded that the constitutional bench had misunderstood the provisions of Article 200 by reading sub-article (1) in isolation from other provisions of the article by not holding that transfers envisioned in Article 200(1) were only for a temporary and time-specified period.</p>
<p>The order also failed to interpret of articles 200 and 175A, without scuttling and undermining the powers of JCP under Article 175A of the Constitution, the appeal argued adding the independence of judiciary does not allow bestowing onto the executive a much more expansive power than what the text of Article 200 and the foundational principles of constitutional law can bear.</p>
<p>The concept of federalism also mandates that the provincial authority’s role in the permanent filling of vacancies of judges must not be usurped, it added.</p>
<p>The June 19 judgment had partially remanded the matter to the president to determine the seniority after examining the service record of the transferred judges as soon as possible, including the question of whether these transfers were permanent or temporary.</p>
<p>The powers of the president under Article 200(1) are two distinct provisions dealing with different situations and niceties and neither do they overlap nor override each other, the verdict explained, adding the transfer by the president by means of Article 200 cannot be construed as a fresh appointment, the judgment had held adding the powers of transfer conferred to the president by the framers of the Constitution cannot be questioned on the ground that if the posts were vacant in IHC then why they were not filled up by JCP through fresh appointments.</p>

            <p><p>The Republican-controlled US Senate narrowly advanced President Donald Trump’s, sweeping <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912732">tax-cut and spending bill</a> on Saturday, during a marathon weekend session marked by political drama, division and lengthy delays as Democrats sought to slow the legislation’s path to passage.</p>
<p>Lawmakers voted 51-49 to open debate on the 940-page megabill, with two of Trump’s fellow Republicans joining Democrats to oppose the legislation that would fund the president’s top immigration, border, tax-cut and military <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886467/trade-immigration-culture-wars-trumps-big-promises">priorities</a>.</p>
<p>Trump on social media hailed the “great victory” for his “great, big, beautiful bill”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-3/5  w-full  media--left    media--uneven  media--stretch">
        <div class="media__item  "><img alt="" src="https://i.dawn.com/primary/2025/06/29110216e2e1d91.png" /></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>After hours of delay, during which Republican leaders and Vice President JD Vance worked behind closed doors to persuade last-minute holdouts to support the measure, Democrats demanded that the megabill first be read aloud in the chamber — a task that could delay the start of the debate until Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>Democrats say the bill’s tax cuts would disproportionately benefit the wealthy at the expense of social programs for lower-income Americans.</p>
<p>“Senate Republicans are scrambling to pass a radical bill, released to the public in the dead of night, praying the American people don’t realise what’s in it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor.</p>
<p>“Democrats are going to force this chamber to read it from start to finish,” he said.</p>
<p>Once the bill has been read, lawmakers will begin up to 20 hours of debate on the legislation. That will be followed by a marathon amendment session, known as a “vote-a-rama,” before the Senate votes on passage. Lawmakers said they hoped to complete work on the bill on Monday.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Republican Senators Thom Tillis and Rand Paul voted against opening debate, a move that seemed for a time to be in danger of failing.</p>
<p>Trump attacked Tillis, who opposed the bill’s cuts to the Medicaid healthcare program for lower-income Americans, which he said would be devastating for his native North Carolina. Tillis is up for reelection next year.</p>
<p>“Numerous people have come forward wanting to run in the Primary against ‘Senator Thom’ Tillis. I will be meeting with them over the coming weeks,” the president posted.</p>
<p>Paul opposed the legislation because it would raise the federal borrowing limit on the $36.2 trillion US debt by an additional $5tr.</p>
<p>“Did Rand Paul Vote ‘NO’ again tonight? What’s wrong with this guy???” Trump said on social media.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#in-limbo" id="in-limbo" title="Permalink"></a>In limbo</h2>
<p>Saturday’s vote was in limbo for hours as Vance, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other top Republicans sought to persuade last-minute holdouts to support the legislation. It was not clear what deals, if any, were struck to win over their support.</p>
<p>Hardline Republican Senators Rick Scott, Mike Lee and Cynthia Lummis, who want deeper cuts in federal spending, voted to support the bill in the end. Another hardliner, Senator Ron Johnson, initially voted no but flipped his vote and backed the legislation.</p>
<p>Trump was monitoring the vote from the Oval Office late into the night, a senior White House official said.</p>
<p>The megabill would extend the 2017 tax cuts that were Trump’s main legislative achievement during his first term as president, cut other taxes and boost spending on the military and border security.</p>
<p>The nonpartisan Joint Tax Committee released an analysis projecting that the Senate bill’s tax provisions would reduce government revenue by $4.5tr over the next decade, increasing the $36.2tr US government debt.</p>
<p>The White House said this month the legislation would reduce the annual deficit by $1.4tr.</p>
<p>The world’s richest person, Elon Musk, also took a swipe at the bill, which would end tax breaks for the electric vehicles that his automaker Tesla manufactures.</p>
<p>Calling the bill “utterly insane and destructive,” he risked reigniting a feud with Trump that raged earlier this month, before Musk backed down from his rhetoric.</p>
<p>“The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!” Musk wrote in a post on his social media platform X.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#medicaid-changes" id="medicaid-changes" title="Permalink"></a>Medicaid changes</h2>
<p>Republicans from states with large rural populations have opposed a reduction in state tax revenue for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903408">Medicaid</a> providers, including rural hospitals. The newly released legislation would delay that reduction and would include $25 billion to support rural Medicaid providers from 2028 to 2032.</p>
<p>The legislation would raise the cap on federal deductions for state and local taxes to $40,000 with an annual 1pc inflation adjustment through 2029, after which it would fall back to the current $10,000. The bill would also phase the cap down for those earning more than $500,000 a year.</p>
<p>That is a major concern of House Republicans from coastal states, including New York, New Jersey and California, who play an important role in keeping the party’s narrow House majority.</p>
<p>Republicans are using a legislative manoeuvre to bypass the Senate’s 60-vote threshold to advance most legislation in the 100-member chamber.</p>
<p>Democrats will focus their firepower with amendments aimed at reversing Republican spending cuts to programs that provide government-backed healthcare to the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as food aid to low-income families.</p>
<p>The bill also would raise the Treasury Department’s debt ceiling by trillions of dollars to stave off a potentially disastrous default on the nation’s debt in the coming months.</p>
<p>If the Senate passes the bill, it will then return to the House of Representatives for final passage before Trump can sign it into law. The House passed its version of the bill last month.</p></p>
