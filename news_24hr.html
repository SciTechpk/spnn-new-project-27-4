            <p><p>Pakistan’s Director General Military Operations (DGMO) Major General Kashif Abdullah and his Indian counterpart Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai on Monday held the first round of talks via hotline after the recent ceasefire between the two countries in the wake of a military conflict.</p>
<p>Saturday’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910113/world-community-hails-ceasefire-decision-between-pakistan-and-india">ceasefire</a>, announced by US President Donald Trump, followed four days of intense exchanges of fire as the nuclear-armed neighbours targeted each other’s military installations with missiles and drones, killing dozens of civilians.</p>
<p>Confirming the talks to <em>Dawn.com</em>, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said the next round would take place in the next 48 hours. A ceasefire till then, he said, was “quite standard”.</p>
<p>State media outlets <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/12-05-2025/first-round-of-talks-between-pakistan-india-dgmos-concluded" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> and <em>PTV News</em> confirmed the talks as well.</p>

<p><em>Reuters</em> also reported that the Indian army confirmed that the DGMOs spoke by phone today.</p>
<p>“Issues related to continuing the commitment that both sides must not fire a single shot or initiate any aggressive and inimical action against each other were discussed,” the Indian army said.</p>
<p>“It was also agreed that both sides consider immediate measures to ensure troop reduction from the borders and forward areas,” it added.</p>

<p>The escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours began following the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">attack</a> in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">killed</a> 26 people. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack%20were%20brought%20out">cross-border linkages</a>” of the att­a­­­c­kers.</p>
<p>Pakistan firmly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">rejected</a> the claim and called for a neutral probe. Following the allegations, India launched a series of strikes on Pakistan on the night of May 6 and 7, resulting in civilian casualties.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#hotline-message" id="hotline-message" title="Permalink"></a>Hotline message</h2>
<p>India’s military sent a “hotline” message to Pakistan on Sunday about alleged ceasefire violations the previous day, flagging New Delhi’s intent to respond to further such incidents, <em>Reuters</em> reported, citing a top Indian army officer.</p>
<p>However, the Foreign Office and the Pakistan military’s spokesperson rubbished the allegations.</p>
<p>“In spite of some minor damage, all our military bases and systems continue to remain fully operational,” India’s director general of air operations, Air Marshal AK Bharti, claimed in a media briefing today.</p>
<p>India also reopened 32 airports it had shut during the clashes, with the Airports Authority of India saying in a statement they were available for civil operations. Some schools remained closed.</p>
<p>Pakistan had reopened its airspace on Saturday.</p>
<p>Visitors were kept out of an airport in the border city of Amritsar shortly after the announcement, a <em>Reuters</em> witness said.</p></p>

            <p><p>The recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">military escalation</a> with arch-rival India won’t have a large fiscal impact on Pakistan and can be managed within the current fiscal space, with no need for a new economic assessment, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said in an interview with <em>Reuters</em> on Monday.</p>
<p>Trade talks with the United States — which had played a key role mediating a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> between the two countries — would likely have progressed in “short order” and that Pakistan could import more high-quality cotton, more soy beans and was also exploring other asset classes, including hydrocarbons, Aurangzeb said in the online interview.</p>
<p>Regarding the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910253">conflict</a>, Aurangzeb described it as a “short duration escalation” with minimal fiscal impact, stating it can be “accommodated within the fiscal space which is available to the government of Pakistan”.</p>
<p>When questioned about potential increased military spending in the upcoming budget, Aurangzeb deferred comment, saying it was premature to discuss specific plans. However, he said: “Whatever we need to do in terms of ensuring that our defence requirements are met will be met.”</p>
<p>Earlier today, President Donald Trump said the US was ready to help India and Pakistan after a ceasefire agreement, claiming trade was a big reason they “stopped fighting”.</p>
<p>Pakistan faces a 29 per cent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901838/economists-see-hurdles-and-opportunities-for-pakistan-as-us-imposes-29pc-tariff-on-country">tariff</a> on exports to the US due to an approximate $3 billion trade surplus, but this is currently under a 90-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903146">pause</a> announced in April.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">approved</a> a $1bn loan disbursement to Pakistan as part of a larger $7bn <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845536">bailout agreement</a>.</p>
<p>“Islamabad will receive the tranche disbursement on Tuesday,” Aurangzeb said.</p>
<p>The IMF executive board also approved a fresh $1.4bn loan to Pakistan under its climate resilience facility.</p>
<p>The federal budget for the next fiscal year, starting July, will be finalised within the next three to four weeks, with scheduled budget talks with the IMF to take place from May 14-23, he said.</p>
<p>Tensions between India and Pakistan began mounting after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">April 22 attack</a> in Indian-occupied Kashmir that killed 26 people, sparking the worst clashes between the nuclear-armed neighbours in more than two decades.</p>
<p>On Saturday, a ceasefire in the region was announced by Trump, following four days of fighting and diplomacy and pressure from Washington.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910555/as-trump-heads-to-the-gulf-israel-asks-where-the-us-stands' target='_blank'><strong>As Trump heads to the Gulf, Israel asks where the US stands</strong></a>
            <p><p>Israeli officials have put a brave face on President Donald Trump bypassing them on a Middle East trip this week, but his decision to do so is the latest to sow doubt in Israel about where the United States stands in Washington’s priorities.</p>
<p>On Sunday, a few days after announcing plans for an expanded military operation in Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said it had been informed by the US of an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1910452">agreement</a> to release American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, after talks between Washington and Hamas that did not include Israel.</p>
<p>Trump, who will be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906046/trump-to-visit-s-arabia-uae-next-month">visiting</a> Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, also caused consternation in Israel last week by abruptly announcing the US would stop bombing Houthis in Yemen, days after a Houthi missile hit near Israel’s main airport.</p>
<p>“The message to the region was clear: Israel is no longer a top US priority,” wrote Itamar Eichner, diplomatic correspondent for Israeli <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1qvel9gee" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news outlets</a> <em>Ynet</em>, echoing media commentators across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>One Israeli official said Trump’s announcement on the Houthis was “kind of an embarrassment” and that the president acts “for good and for bad”.</p>
<p>Israel has been talking to the US about the post-conflict future of Gaza, and officials say relations at the official level remain strong, but some officials acknowledge being blindsided by Trump’s decision-making.</p>
<p>One senior official in Netanyahu’s circle, who declined to be identified by name, said there was “chaos” in the Trump administration, with everything dependent on what the president decided at any given moment.</p>
<p>Sometimes that helped Israel, and sometimes it did not, the official said.</p>
<p>The decision on the Houthis, which was not discussed with Israel beforehand, compounded Israeli unease at US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910345">talks</a> with Iran over Tehran’s nuclear programme, which could blunt any Israeli threat of military action against its arch-enemy.</p>
<p>Israel faced further alarm after <em>Reuters</em> reported that the US was no longer demanding Saudi Arabia normalise ties with Israel as a condition for progress on civil nuclear cooperation talks.</p>
<p>“We coordinate. It doesn’t mean you must fully agree 100 per cent on every issue,” Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on Sunday.</p>
<p>“The US is a sovereign state. Israel is a sovereign state. But I believe we have a very, very big common ground of positions with this administration, more than in the past.”</p>
<p>In March, Trump’s hostage negotiator, Adam Boehler, held what Hamas described as “very helpful” meetings with the Palestinian fighter group that bypassed Israel and focused on releasing Alexander.</p>
<p>Last week, US Ambassador Mike Huckabee denied that Trump was distancing himself from Israel. He said the relationship was often described as ironclad and “that word is still operative”.</p>
<p>“The president has been consistent in his support and his partnership, and I have no reason to believe that that won’t continue,” he said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#chaos" id="chaos" title="Permalink"></a>‘Chaos’</h2>
<p>Netanyahu and his government faced criticism today even as Israelis looked forward to Alexander’s release, with a growing perception in the public that the two allies had differing priorities.</p>
<p>“There’s just no leadership now,” said Tel Aviv pensioner Jack Gottlieb.</p>
<p>There was “no question” the deal happened behind Netanyahu’s back or that the US and Israeli agendas currently differed, he said.</p>
<p>“Right now, it’s every man for himself,” Gottlieb said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu had little choice but to accept the decision on the Houthis, who signalled they would not stop trying to hit Israel by firing another missile a few days later.</p>
<p>Israel has relied on US military and diplomatic support since its creation as an independent state in 1948. Any weakening of US interest, as Israel faces international pressure over the Gaza bombardment, would be a severe blow.</p>
<p>The decision to drop the demand for a normalisation deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel, to get past Riyadh’s insistence that Israel agree to moves towards a settlement with the Palestinians, underlined how damaging the issue has been for Israel internationally.</p>
<p>Adding Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which both normalised relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords signed during Trump’s first term, has been a major goal for Netanyahu but is now seemingly delayed indefinitely.</p>
<p>Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, faced bitter criticism from Israeli hardliners after stopping exports of some heavy munitions used in Gaza and imposing sanctions on violent Israeli West Bank settlers.</p>
<p>By contrast, Trump, in his first term, defied world opinion by moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, which Israel regards as its capital, and recognised Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights, which it seized in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>Israeli officials have said previously that they were aware there were risks for Israel in a president as unpredictable as Trump and one who has shown no compunction in turning on historic US allies.</p>
<p>“But we don’t have a choice,” said one.</p></p>
