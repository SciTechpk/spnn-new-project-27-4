            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918159/sc-constitutional-bench-dismisses-pleas-against-transfer-of-ihc-judges' target='_blank'><strong>SC Constitutional Bench dismisses pleas against transfer of IHC judges</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench on Thursday announced its verdict in a case pertaining to the seniority and transfer of Islamabad High Court (IHC) jud­ges, declaring that their transfers were not unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The bench — headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and comprising Justices Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Shahid Bilal Hassan, Salahuddin Panhwar and Shakeel Ahmed — took up petitions filed by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893249/ihc-judges-petition-sc-to-reclaim-seniority">five IHC judges</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898611">Karachi Bar Association</a> (KBA) and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904020/ihcba-undecided-as-sc-hears-pleas-against-judges-transfer-today">IHC Bar Association</a>, among others.</p>
<p>In February, Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar from the Lahore High Court (LHC), Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro from the Sindh High Court (SHC) and Justice Muham­mad Asif from the Balochistan High Court (BHC) were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889123">transferred to the IHC</a>.</p>
<p>The controversy centres around the alteration of the judges’ seniority list after these transfers as Justice Dogar was made the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889639">senior puisne judge</a>, which paved the way for his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891705">appointment</a> as the acting IHC chief justice after Justice Aamer Farooq’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891044">elevation</a> to the SC.</p>
<p>Today’s judgement was announced in a 3-2 majority ruling, with Justices Afghan and Ahmed dissenting.</p>
<p>In the short order, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, the SC noted that “the transfer of a judge by the president of Pakistan by means of Article 200 of the Constitution (permanently or temporarily) cannot be construed as a fresh appointment.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The order explained that exercise of powers of transfer by the president under <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912990">Article 200 of the Constitution</a> was not unregulated or unfettered.</p>
<p>Rather, it was structured on a “four tier formula which expounds that no judge shall be transferred except with his consent and after consultation by the president with the chief justice of Pakistan and the chief justices of both high courts”.</p>
<p>The short order emphasised that before exercising the power of transfer, certain inbuilt procedures and mechanisms had to be followed and the decision was “within the sphere and realm of judiciary and not within the domain of executives”.</p>
<p>The short order added: “Thus, for all intents and purposes, the transfer of judges by the president of Pakistan (…) is within the framework of the Constitution and cannot be
declared <em>ultra vires</em>.”</p>
<p>The judges further noted that the terms and conditions of transfer, including seniority, should have been taken up and mentioned by the president at the time of issuing the notification of transfer in terms of Article 200 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>The judges also said that they partially remanded the matter to the president, “without upsetting the notification of transfer to determine the seniority after examining/vetting the service record of the transferee judges as soon as possible, including the question of whether the transfer is on a permanent or temporary basis”.</p>
<p>The order concluded that the seniority and transfer of judges was determined by the president by means of a notification/order and that Justice Dogar would continue in his role as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891705">acting chief justice</a> of the IHC till the seniority and nature of posting —
permanent or temporary — of the transferred judges were determined by the president by means of notification/order.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#dissenting-order" id="dissenting-order" title="Permalink"></a>Dissenting order</h2>
<p>In the dissenting order, authored by Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan, he said that the judges accepted the constitutional petitions.</p>
<p>The order declared the impugned notification regarding the transfer of concerned judges as “null, void and of no legal effect”.</p>
<p>Justice Afghan said, “The permanent transfer of three Judges to IHC has been made
by the president in wrong exercise of discretion under Clause (1) of Article 200 of the Constitution.”</p>
<p>He added: “It has offended Article 175A of the Constitution and has made the same redundant.”</p>
<p>The order also stated that the permanent transfer process of three Judges to the IHC was under the “concealment of relevant and material facts from the transferee Judges”, adding that it was also “lacking meaningful, purposive and consensus-oriented consultation” with the chief Justices of the apex and high courts.</p>
<p>It further said that “the process for permanent transfer of three Judges to IHC has
been completed in an unnecessary haste.”</p>
<p>According to the judges, the proportionate representation of provinces in IHC could have been achieved by “making fresh appointments of judges from the provinces by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan under Article 175A of the Constitution”.</p>
<p>The dissenting note added: “It [notification] is violative of Article 2A, Article 4 and Article 25 of the Constitution and it has undermined the independence of judiciary, due process and principle of equality.”</p></p>

            <p><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Thursday predicted that pre-monsoon rains will fall across the country between June 20 and 23.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1852031#:~:text=Monsoon%20rains%20across%20the%20region%20from%20June%20to%20September%20offer%20respite%20from%20the%20summer%20heat%20and%20are%20crucial%20to%20replenishing%20water%20supplies.%20They%20are%20also%20vital%20for%20agriculture%2C%20and%20therefore%20the%20livelihoods%20of%20millions%20of%20farmers%20and%20food%20security%20for%20South%20Asia%E2%80%99s%20nearly%20two%20billion%20people.">fall across</a> the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. They are also vital for agriculture, and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security for South Asia’s nearly two billion people.</p>
<p>According to a statement, “currents from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal are penetrating the central and northern areas of Pakistan, while a westerly wave is expected to approach the north. Both of these weather systems are expected to arrive on June 20 (tomorrow).”</p>
<p>It added that duststorms, thunderstorms and heavy rain are expected in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit Baltistan, Murree, Galliyat, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mianwali, Sargodha, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sialkot, Narowal, Lahore, Faisalabad, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Haripur, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Malakand, Battagram, Shangla, Kohistan, Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, Nowshera, Charsadda, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Kohat, Bannu, Karak, Dera Ismail Khan, and Waziristan from June 20-23 with occasional gaps.</p>
<p>“Similar weather events could be expected in Zhob, Barkhan, Musakhel, Kalat, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan, Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar and Sahiwal from June 21-23, and in Sukkur, Larkana, Dadu, and Jacobabad from June 22-24.</p>
<p>PMD warned that the inclement weather “may damage loose structures like electric poles, trees, vehicles and solar panels” among others and advised farmers to “manage their crop activities keeping in view the weather conditions”.</p>
<p>“Urban flooding may occur in Lahore, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi [and] Islamabad during the forecast period,” the press release warned. “[The] general Public, travellers and tourists are advised to take precautionary measures during the weather activity.”</p>
<p>PMD added that hot weather is likely to subside gradually during the forecast period.</p>
<p>Last month, heavy rain triggered flash floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mohmand, South Waziristan and Upper Kohistan districts, damaging roads and agricultural land. However, no casualties were reported from any districts.</p>
<p>Heavy rainfall <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909665">triggered</a> flash floods in several areas of Halimzai tehsil in Mohmand district, including Shanikhel ,Tarikhel, Barokhel, Durbakhel and Babikhel.</p>
<p>The flood, caused by overflowing mountain streams, swept away dozens of livestock and damaged houses and link roads.</p>
<p>Last month, at least 13 civilians died and 92 others were injured as heavy rains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913072">lashed</a> several parts of Punjab.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918201/chinese-student-gets-life-for-campaign-of-rape-london-court' target='_blank'><strong>Chinese student gets life for ‘campaign of rape’: London court</strong></a>
            <p><p>A Chinese post-graduate student <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901638">convicted</a> of drugging and raping 10 women in the UK and China and suspected of having attacked more was on Thursday jailed for life by a London court.</p>
<p>And London police say they have evidence to suggest he could have targeted more than 50 other women.</p>
<p>Serial rapist Zhenhao Zou, 28 — described in court as “calculated and predatory” — targeted young Chinese women who he invited to his London flat for drinks or to study before drugging and attacking them.</p>
<p>Zou filmed nine of the rapes with hidden or handheld cameras but only two of the 10 victims have ever been identified.</p>
<p>Sentencing him at Inner London Crown Court, Judge Rosina Cottage said there was “no doubt that you planned and executed a campaign of rape” that had caused “devastating and long term effects”.</p>
<p>To the world, he appeared “well to do, ambitious and charming”, but this was a mask hiding a “sexual predator”, she added.</p>
<p>He treated his victims “callously” as “sex toys” for his own gratification and “desire to assert power over women”, which meant he would be a “risk for an indefinite period”.</p>
<p>Zou, wearing a dark suit and glasses, listened impassively in the dock to the sentence via a translator. He will spend a minimum of 22 years in jail, after accounting for time already spent in custody.</p>
<p>The former engineering student at University College London was found guilty by a jury in March of 28 offences including 11 counts of rape — with two of the counts relating to one woman — three counts of voyeurism and one of false imprisonment.</p>
<p>He was found guilty of raping three women in London and seven in China between 2019 and 2023.</p>
<p>He was also convicted of three counts of possessing butanediol — an industrial solvent — with intent to commit a sexual offence and 10 counts of possession of an extreme pornographic image.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#prolific-rapist" id="prolific-rapist" title="Permalink"></a>‘Prolific’ rapist</h2>
<p>Victims told the sentencing hearing in impact statements of the psychological damage they suffered, including nightmares, self-harm and a sense of despair and isolation.</p>
<p>One recalled “wandering like a trapped animal trying to find an exit” after she was attacked.</p>
<p>“What happened that night is etched on my soul”, she said, adding that Zou’s family was “very powerful in China” and she feared he would “seek revenge”.</p>
<p>After the sentence, Saira Pike of the Crown Prosecution Service said: “Zou is a serial rapist and a danger to women.” Pike added that analysis of footage and web chats showed the former student’s “meticulous planning and the horrifying execution of his crimes”.</p>
<p>Since he was convicted, and following an international appeal by UK police, over 20 women have come forward to say they might have been sexually assaulted by Zou.
London’s Met police have said they have evidence to suggest he could have targeted more than 50 other women and urged possible victims to come forward.</p>
<p>“Given how prolific Zou seems to have been, there is every potential he could be one of the most prolific offenders that we’ve ever seen,” the Met’s Commander Kevin Southworth said.</p>
<p>Southworth said 24 potential victims had already contacted officers from “different parts of the globe”.</p>
<p>“The primary places where we believe offending may have occurred at this time appears to be… here in London, and over in China.”</p>
<p>But given how “active and prolific” Zou appeared to have been, there was “every prospect that he could have offended anywhere in the world”, he added.</p>
<p>The Met said earlier officers were compiling a file of new evidence to be submitted to prosecutors after Zou’s sentencing.</p></p>
