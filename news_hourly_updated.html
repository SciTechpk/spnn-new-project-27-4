                <h2>Dar slams Israel, US attacks against fellow SCO member Iran as ‚Äòunacceptable‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday slammed last month‚Äôs attacks by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/tel-aviv-in-smoke-as-iran-launches-missiles-under-operation-true-promise-3-after-day-long-israeli-attacks">Israel</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">United States</a> on Iran as ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù as he attended a ministerial meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in China‚Äôs Tianjin.</p>
<p>The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. The group‚Äôs foreign ministers meet as a precursor to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1864831">annual summit</a> of its leaders, which will be hosted <a class="link--external" href="https://www.chinadailyasia.com/hk/article/615887" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by China</a> this autumn in Tianjin.</p>
<p>On June 13, Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign on Iran that targeted military and nuclear sites as well as residential areas, and killed senior military commanders, nuclear scientists and civilians. The attacks began days before a planned meeting between Tehran and Washington aimed at reviving nuclear negotiations. The US, which had been in talks with Iran since April 12, joined Israel in carrying out its own strikes on June 22, targeting Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz. Iranian authorities say the Israeli strikes killed at least 1,060 people.</p>
<p>Addressing the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers today, Dar said: ‚ÄúWe have strongly condemned the unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran and the US strikes on its nuclear facilities. Such illegal actions directed against SCO member states are unacceptable.‚Äù</p>
<p>Continuing his criticism of Israel, he said: ‚ÄúIsrael has shown a reckless disregard for international norms and humanity through its relentless and disproportionate use of force in Gaza, resulting in the death of tens of thousands of civilians causing the worst humanitarian crisis in Gaza. We call for immediate halt to Israel‚Äôs atrocities. The only viable remedy to Palestine dispute is the realisation of two-state solution which includes the establishment of Palestine as a viable, secure and contiguous state on the basis of pre-1967 borders with Al Quds as its capital.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUnilateral and illegal measures to change the status of disputed territories in violation of UN Security Council resolutions must be strongly condemned and opposed by all.‚Äù</p>

<p>Dar said Pakistan was ‚Äúincreasingly concerned at the trends of using aggression as a tool of policy.‚Äù</p>
<p>Instead, he called for the resolution of longstanding disputes through peaceful means, dialogue, diplomacy and according to the principles of international law, justice and fairness.</p>

<p>On regional issues, FM Dar said Pakistan sought a relationship of peace and stability with all its neighbours.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, the last three months witnessed extremely disturbing developments in South Asia. It is most unfortunate that the attribution of the Pahalgam Attack to Pakistan ‚Äî without a credible investigation or verifiable evidence ‚Äî brought the two nuclear-armed states to the brink of a major conflict. In the wake of mounting tensions, Pakistan‚Äôs restrained and responsible approach was met with legal transgressions, rhetorical belligerence, and strategic recklessness.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan remains steadfast in its commitment to the ceasefire and the cultivation of a stable regional equilibrium. However, we cannot accept that the arbitrary use of force is normalised. We believe that disputes and differences are resolved through dialogue and diplomacy, instead of conflict and coercion. In that backdrop, initiation of a comprehensive and structured dialogue can meaningfully address the full spectrum of issues that have long bedevilled the peace and security in South Asia. Strict adherence to bilateral agreements would be equally important in this regard.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said the events unfolding in the region since the April 22 terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam reaffirmed a ‚Äúcentral truth‚Äù of South Asian geopolitics: the peaceful settlement of longstanding unresolved disputes was ‚Äúimperative for an enduring peace‚Äù in the region.</p>
<p>Dar added that enduring peace and stability in Afghanistan also constituted a cornerstone of the SCO members‚Äô shared aspiration. He pointed out that the revival of the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group could serve as a valuable platform for pragmatic and results-oriented cooperation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTerrorism is the common concern of humanity that threatens global security. All forms of terrorism, including state terrorism are condemnable. We must shun the use of terrorism for political purposes and combat this menace through a cooperative approach, including addressing its root causes.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said the SCO was a vital platform for realising the benefits of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), pointing out that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a flagship BRI project, not only supplemented the SCO‚Äôs vision of regional connectivity and economic integration but also complemented its common objective of shared development and prosperity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe need to take concrete steps within existing SCO‚Äôs mechanisms for trade and development and promote the use of national currencies for mutual settlement within SCO region to avoid international financial shocks. We support the proposal to create SCO alternative development funding mechanism to give needed impetus to various stalled development initiatives.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs the permanent chair of the SCO‚Äôs Special Working Group dedicated to combatting poverty, Pakistan is fully committed to providing the necessary momentum to our collaborative endeavours to address poverty.‚Äù</p>
<p>Dar called on the SCO members to also collectively address the ‚Äúexistential threat‚Äù of climate change.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>

<p>‚ÄúAt a time when the global order is experiencing profound challenges, SCO has emerged as a stabilising force. Its inclusive approach underscoring the sovereign equality of states and seeking peaceful resolutions to disputes, offers a compelling alternative to aggression, confrontation and zero-sum rivalries. The SCO‚Äôs commitment to consensus, development, and mutual respect is a beacon of hope for building a better and equitable world.‚Äù</p>
<p>Stressing Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to the organisation and its principles, Dar said: ‚ÄúIn our pursuit to peace and security, we believe in non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, non-use of force or threat of its use in international relations, as well as seeking no unilateral military superiority in the region.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a post on X after the meeting, Dar said: ‚ÄúAt the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers meeting today, we reaffirmed our shared commitment to multilateralism, mutual respect and regional stability. The Shanghai Spirit continues to guide us towards dialogue, mutual trust and the pursuit of a more just and inclusive international order.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>Indian opposition demands IoK governor step down after admitting ‚Äòsecurity failure‚Äô in Pahalgam attack</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>India‚Äôs opposition parties have called for the governor of occupied Kashmir to resign with an apology to the people of the territory after he admitted to a ‚Äúsecurity failure‚Äù in the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 people.</p>
<p>On April 22, 26 tourists were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">killed</a> at a hill station in India-occupied Kashmir‚Äôs (IoK) Pahalgam. India has blamed Pakistan for the horrific attack, an accusation the latter <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918317">denies</a>. Islamabad has called for an international independent probe into the massacre.</p>
<p>In an <a class="link--external" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jammu-and-kashmir-lg-manoj-sinha-i-take-full-onus-for-pahalgam-was-a-security-failure/articleshow/122426736.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with the <em>Times of India</em> on Monday, IoK Lieutenant Governor and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Manoj Sinha said, ‚ÄúI take full responsibility for the incident, which was undoubtedly a security failure.‚Äù</p>
<p>In response to the admission, numerous Indian politicians slammed him for negligence and for his delay in taking accountability and called for his resignation.</p>
<p>The Indian National Congress |(INC) suggested that Sinha intended to shield ‚Äúunspecified officials‚Äù in the union government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, <em>The Wire</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://thewire.in/security/resign-say-nc-congress-as-jk-lg-manoj-sinha-takes-full-responsibility-of-pahalgam" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said in a post on X, ‚ÄúHe (Sinha) finally takes responsibility for Pahalgam after 82 days of the attack. In doing so, who is he protecting in Delhi? How many days, weeks, months to also be held accountable and resign or get sacked?‚Äù</p>

<p>Similarly, INC national spokesperson, Shama Mohamed asked: ‚ÄúSince [Sinha] has taken full responsibility for the security lapse during the Pahalgam attack ‚Äî when is he resigning? In a democracy, the next step after taking the responsibility is resignation!‚Äù</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Imran Nabi Dar, spokesperson for IoK ruling party National Conference, told <em>The Wire</em> that the ‚Äúnext logical step for him (Sinha) should be to step down and apologise to the people of Jammu and Kashmir whose lives, livelihood and dignity were put at stake due to his blunders‚Äù.</p>
<p>The Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader and general secretary MY Tarigami said that his party had been demanding accountability from the union government since the attack. He called for the government to provide details about the lapses that resulted in the deaths of 26 civilians.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll those responsible should be held accountable. Acceptance means certain action against those who have committed such a grave mistake,‚Äù he was quoted as saying by the report.</p>
<p>PPP Senator Sherry Rehman also reacted to the interview today, saying the admission came ‚Äúwell after two months and after going to a whole war over it‚Äù.</p>
<p>She added, ‚ÄúThe opposition in the Lok Sabha should really take down this regime for the spectacular incompetence that jeopardised Indian lives, credibility and reputation. The momentum is right there.‚Äù</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with Indian journalist Karan Thapar last week, PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had said the Indian public was ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923094/new-delhi-lied-to-public-about-pahalgam-attack-bilawal-tells-indian-journalist">lied to</a>‚Äù by New Delhi about Pakistan‚Äôs alleged involvement in the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>In an interview with <em>The Wire</em>‚Äôs Thapar, the PPP chief said that had Pakistan been involved in the attack, evidence would have surfaced and the perpetrators identified.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs far as the Pahalgam terrorist attack is concerned, Pakistan has been willing to be part of an impartial international investigation; your government refused that,‚Äù Bilawal said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo this day, the Indian government has not shared with Pakistan, with the international community, with the Indian public ‚Ä¶ who exactly are these individuals that were involved in this terrorist attack that are from Pakistan?‚Äù</p>
<p>When pressed on the issue, Bilawal said that if Pakistan was truly involved, the international community would endorse India‚Äôs perspective.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very uncomfortable for you that I point out the truth to the Indian public, that they have been lied to ‚Ä¶ that Pakistan was involved in this attack when we were not,‚Äù he asserted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe government has been unable to provide the evidence. That‚Äôs why during this war, the Indian media and the Indian government launched a campaign of disinformation to continue to bamboozle the people of India,‚Äù he added.</p></p>
