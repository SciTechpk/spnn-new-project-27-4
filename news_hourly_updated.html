<p>President Zardari said that Karbala is a symbol of an eternal struggle against falsehood. ‚ÄúThis day is not only an unparalleled story of sacrifice, loyalty, and patience but also a bright lamp that shows the path of truth and righteousness in the darkness of every era.‚Äù</p>
<p>In his message, PM Shehbaz said: ‚ÄúKarbala teaches us that although the path of truth is difficult, it is the path that leads to the pleasure of Allah Almighty and the satisfaction of hearts and eternal prosperity.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said the message of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) is not limited to his time but is a universal message, which even today convinces us that a Muslim stands for the truth, supports the oppressed, and advocates justice in all circumstances.</p></p>

                <h2>‚ÄòSimple Buddhist monk‚Äô Dalai Lama marks landmark 90th birthday</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Calling himself a ‚Äúsimple Buddhist monk‚Äù who usually didn‚Äôt celebrate birthdays, the Dalai Lama marked his 90th on Sunday by praying for peace after China insisted it would have the final say on who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921752/dalai-lama-confirms-he-will-have-a-successor-after-his-death">succeeded</a> the Tibetan spiritual leader.</p>
<p>Chanting of red-robed monks and nuns rang out from Himalayan hilltop forested temples in India, home to the Dalai Lama since he and thousands of other Tibetans fled Chinese troops who crushed an uprising in their capital Lhasa in 1959.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am just a simple Buddhist monk; I don‚Äôt normally engage in birthday celebrations,‚Äù the Dalai Lama said in a message, thanking those marking it with him for using the opportunity ‚Äúto cultivate peace of mind and compassion‚Äù.</p>
<p>Dressed in traditional robes and a flowing yellow wrap, he walked with the aid of two monks while flashing his trademark beaming smile to thousands of followers.</p>

<p>Beijing condemns the Nobel Peace Prize winner ‚Äî who has led a lifelong campaign for greater autonomy for Tibet, a vast high-altitude plateau ‚Äî as a rebel and separatist.</p>
<p>Alongside the celebrations, however, is the worry for Tibetans in exile that China will name its successor to bolster control over the territory it poured troops into in 1950 and has ruled ever since.</p>
<p>That raises the likelihood of rival challengers to the post; one by self-declared atheist Beijing, the other by the Dalai Lama‚Äôs office based in neighbouring India, a regional rival of China.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#good-heart" id="good-heart" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòGood heart‚Äô</h2>
<p>The celebrations on Sunday are the culmination of days of long-life prayers for Tenzin Gyatso, who followers believe is the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, a man whose moral teachings and idiosyncratic humour have made him one of the world‚Äôs most popular religious leaders.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile it is important to work for material development, it is vital to focus on achieving peace of mind through cultivating a good heart and by being compassionate, not just toward near and dear ones, but toward everyone,‚Äù he said in his birthday message.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThrough this, you will contribute to making the world a better place.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The celebrations also included his key announcement that, after being inundated with messages of support from fellow Tibetans both inside and in exile, the spiritual institution would continue after his death.</p>
<p>He said he had received appeals from followers from across the Himalayan region, Mongolia and parts of Russia and China.</p>
<p>The seemingly esoteric matters of reincarnation have real-world political consequences, with Tibetans fearing his death will mark a major setback in his push for more autonomy for the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama said his India-based office alone would ‚Äúexclusively‚Äù identify that successor ‚Äî prompting a swift and sharp reply from China that the reincarnation ‚Äúmust be approved by the central government‚Äù in Beijing.</p>
<p>China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921605#:~:text=China-,said,-on%20Wednesday%20that">said</a> the succession would be carried out ‚Äúby drawing lots from a golden urn‚Äù, foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>That urn is held by Beijing, and the Dalai Lama has warned that, when used dishonestly, it lacks ‚Äúany spiritual quality‚Äù.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered effusive birthday greetings on Sunday, calling the Dalai Lama an ‚Äúenduring symbol of love‚Äù.</p>

<p>India and China are intense rivals competing for influence across South Asia, but have sought to repair ties after a 2020 border clash.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said in a statement that Washington was ‚Äúcommitted to promoting respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of Tibetans‚Äù.</p>
<p>Among the crowds attending the celebrations was Hollywood star Richard Gere, a longtime backer of the Tibetans in exile, who on Sunday said the Dalai Lama ‚Äútotally embodies selflessness, complete love and compassion and wisdom‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Messages of support were also given by former US presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush, as well as Barack Obama, who said the Dalai Lama had shown what it means to ‚Äúspeak up for freedom and dignity‚Äù.</p>
<p>The ceremony ended with the Dalai Lama eating a slice of cake and thousands singing ‚Äúhappy birthday‚Äù.</p>
<p>No details have been released for the future succession.</p>
<p>All so far have been men or boys, often identified as toddlers and taking up the role only as teenagers.</p>
<p>The current Dalai Lama, himself identified in 1937, has said that if there is a successor it will come from the ‚Äúfree world‚Äù outside China‚Äôs control.</p>
<p>In a speech to followers on Sunday, the Dalai Lama said his practice of Buddhism meant he had dedicated his life towards seeking compassion.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm now 90 and‚Ä¶ when I reflect on my life, I see that I have not wasted my life at all‚Äù, he said, speaking in Tibetan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI would not have regrets at the time of my death; rather I would be able to die very peacefully.‚Äù</p></p>
