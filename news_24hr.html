            <p><p>At least six people were killed and 12 others were injured when a bus overturned and fell into a ditch near Makli in Sindh’s Thatta district on Sunday morning, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>According to the Edhi rescue service, the bus overturned near the Thatta Bypass, following which a rescue team reached the site of the incident and transported the injured to a hospital.</p>
<p>“The bodies of the six victims were initially taken to a mortuary in Orangi Town,” the service said in a statement, adding that they were later transported to Edhi’s morgue in Karachi’s Sohrab Goth.</p>
<p>The bus was carrying a group of picnickers from Karachi to Keenjhar Lake when it overturned while taking a sharp turn, killing six passengers and injuring dozens others, state-owned <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>“Local authorities and rescue teams were quick to respond, reaching the crash site within minutes. The injured were rushed to Karachi hospitals, with several reported to be in critical condition,” it said.</p>
<p>In another incident, at least one person was killed and several others, including women and children, were critically injured when a passenger bus overturned on the Gambat National Highway in Sindh’s Khairpur district.</p>
<p>According to <em>APP</em>, the incident took place while the bus was en route from Karachi to Swabi. Rescue teams, along with local police, reached the incident site and rushed the injured to nearby hospitals for medical aid.</p>

<p>Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah expressed deep sorrow over the loss of lives in the bus accidents, according to a statement issued by his spokesperson Abdul Rashid Channa.</p>
<p>Expressing sympathy with the Makli incident victims, he issued directives to the Thatta deputy commissioner (DC) to ensure the provision of immediate medical assistance to the injured. The chief minister further told him to immediately contact their families and fully cooperate.</p>
<p>Expressing sorrow over the Khairpur coach accident, CM Murad issued similar instructions to the Khairpur DC to ensure medical treatment of the wounded. He urged people to drive carefully to protect precious lives.</p>
<p>Accidents are common on highways and motorways across Pakistan, caused by reckless driving, speeding, driver fatigue, and poor vehicle maintenance. Poor road conditions contribute to mishaps, while weak enforcement of traffic laws allows violations to go unchecked, worsening the situation.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, four people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924364">lost</a> their lives and another six were injured — all from the same family — after their speeding car crashed into a wall next to a drain on Hawkes’ Bay Road in Karachi’s Mauripur area.</p>
<p>South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said the family was returning from the Hawke’s Bay beach, and the accident most likely happened as a result of speeding.</p>
<p>In an incident on July 15, a collision between a trailer and a truck left one dead and three injured near Karachi’s New Sabzi Mandi on the Super Highway.</p>
<p>On June 19, a speeding dumper truck overturned on a 4x4 vehicle on Rashid Minhas Road, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918288">killing</a> a woman and an accompanying five-year-old girl.</p>
<p>On June 11, a young man was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916541">killed</a> and his wife injured in an accident after an unknown vehicle hit their bike on the Super Highway. The same day, two boys were killed after a water tanker hit them near Abdullah College in North Nazimabad.</p></p>

            <p><p>A Federal Constabulary soldier was killed when unidentified gunmen opened fire at a forest checkpoint along the Karakoram Highway in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer district, police said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Diamer Farrukh Rasheed said in a statement, “The deceased has been identified as Muhammad Gul Sher from Dera Ismail Khan.</p>
<p>“The motive behind the attack is not yet known, and the police are investigating the case. The suspects fled with the gun of the deceased.”</p>
<p>Senior Superintendent of Police Abdul Hameed told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “Unknown assailants opened fire at the checkpoint while the deceased was on duty and his colleagues were asleep.”</p>
<p>He added that police teams were raiding nearby areas to look for the suspects. In his statement, he speculated that the case appeared to be related to terrorism, ruling out personal enmity or a timber smuggling attempt.</p>
<p>The forest checkpoint was situated at the Thore Road, primarily to inspect vehicles for wood smuggling via the road, which connects the KKH with forest areas in the district.</p>
<p>GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan condemned the attack, saying, “Firing by terrorists on state personnel is an unacceptable act.”</p>
<p>According to a statement, he directed the police to bring the perpetrators to justice and sought a report on the incident from the home department.</p>
<p>GB government spokesman Faizullah Faraq said in a separate statement that funeral prayers for the martyred soldier were offered at the Police Lines in Chilas, and preparations were underway to send the body to his hometown.</p>
<p>In 2023, at least nine people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1794671/nine-killed-as-bus-comes-under-gun-attack-in-chilas">lost</a> their lives and 21 passengers received injuries after an Islamabad-bound bus came under fire in a terrorist attack near Chilas in Diamer district of Gilgit-Baltistan.</p></p>

            <p><p>A cricket match between Indian and Pakistani veteran players — part of the World Championship of Legends (WCL) — was called off after Indian players, including Shikhar Dhawan, refused to play against Pakistan, citing recent “geopolitical tensions” between the two nations, according to a statement issued by WCL on Sunday.</p>
<p>The WCL is an international cricket league where retired, non-contracted international players return to competitive T20 cricket, according to the league’s <a class="link--external" href="https://edgbaston.com/wcl/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website.</a> The tournament commenced on July 18 and is being held in Birmingham, England.</p>
<p>In a statement posted on X, WCL organisers announced that, “We have decided to call off the India vs Pakistan match,” saying that the match between the two countries was planned in light of recent positive development between India and Pakistan, indicating improved bilateral sporting ties.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The statement cited a recent volleyball match between the rival nations and speculations around Pakistan’s hockey team touring India later this year.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <em>Press Trust of India</em> (PTI) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923823">reported</a> that Pakistan is to review the security situation in India before taking a call on sending its hockey teams to the neighbouring country for the Asia Cup and Junior World Cup to be held later this year.</p>
<p>The decision to cancel the WCL match came after Indian veteran cricketer Shikhar Dhawan refused to play against Pakistan, according to a statement posted on his X account, showing a screenshot of an email sent to notify the player’s withdrawal from the match.</p>

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The statement cited the “current geopolitical situation and prevailing tensions between India and Pakistan” as the reasons for withdrawal.</p>
<p>WCL, in its statement, apologised for “hurting” people’s sentiments and causing discomfort to Indian players for WCL’s decision to hold the match in the first place.</p>
<p>The match — scheduled for Sunday (today) — was to be the first between the two nations in the tournament. The Pakistani team is being led by Mohammed Hafeez, while Yuvraj Singh is leading the Indian side.</p>
<p>According to WCL’s website, the tournament is set to run until August 2 with participation from England, India, Pakistan, Australia, the West Indies and South Africa.</p>
<p>WCL will be held across four English cities — Birmingham, Northampton, Leeds and Leicester.</p>
<p>Reacting to the development, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman condemned the cancellation: “Indian cricketers, following in [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi’s footsteps by refusing to play against Pakistan, have turned sports into hatred.”</p>
<p>“Defeat on the battlefield, failure in diplomacy, and now fleeing from sports, India faces embarrassment on every front,” Rehman, who was part of a delegation that conveyed Pakistan’s stance on the recent conflict with India, said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/sherryrehman/status/1946812461098975271" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X.</p>

<p>“The hate-filled and prejudiced behaviour of Indian players reflects their Modi-worshipping mindset.”</p>
<p>“Sports are ambassadors of peace, tolerance, and mutual respect, but India has demonstrated narrow-mindedness here as well. The Modi government shudders at the mere mention of Pakistan and their players choose to flee the field,” Rehman quipped.</p>
<p>She stressed that Indians’ “hate-driven agenda rather than sportsmanship poses a threat to regional peace and the spirit of sports”.</p>
<p>In May, Pakistan and India stepped back from an all-out war after a four-day military <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">confrontation</a> — the worst in decades — in the aftermath of the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack </a> in India-occupied Kashmir. New Delhi blamed Pakistan for the attack without evidence, launching <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988">Operation Sindoor</a>. Islamabad has strongly denied the accusations.</p>
<p>During the conflict, India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir had called for a complete <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908921">halt</a> to cricketing engagements with Pakistan at any forum.</p>
<p>The recent tensions also briefly cast a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915285">shadow</a> on this year’s Asia Cup, with speculation that India would pull out of the Asia Cup. However, the two teams are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921620">expected</a> to face each other in the tournament in September this year.</p></p>
