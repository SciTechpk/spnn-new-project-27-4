                <h2>5 terrorists killed, 3 officials injured in joint operation in KP‚Äôs Hangu: police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Five terrorists were killed and three officers were injured in an exchange of fire during an operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Hangu district, police said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906333/3-traffic-cops-injured-in-terrorist-attack-in-kps-lakki-marwat-district-police">witnessed</a> an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>According to a statement by KP Inspector General of Police (IGP) Zulfiqar Hameed, security forces and police carried out a joint operation in Hangu‚Äôs Zargari Shinawari area.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring the operation, there was a heavy exchange of fire between the terrorists and the law enforcement personnel,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecurity forces fought bravely and killed five terrorists. However, Hangu District Police Officer (DPO) Khalid Khan, the Doaba station house officer (SHO), and an officer of the security forces were injured in the exchange of fire,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The statement said that DPO Khalid ‚Äúwas hit by three bullets‚Äù, while his condition was said to be stable.</p>
<p>Police were making arrangements for a helicopter to airlift DPO Khalid from the Hangu hospital to Peshawar for further treatment, Imran Khan, personal secretary to IG Hameed, told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>IG Hameed spoke to the injured officers and enquired about their well-being, according to the police statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLaw enforcement agencies are determined to continue their fight against terrorism,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>Pakistan ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents.</p>

<p>On June 21, KP police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918714">killed</a> a terrorist and injured two others belonging to the TTP group in Dera Ismail Khan as they attempted to attack the police.</p>
<p>In May, two policemen were martyred and two were injured in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911459">suicide attack</a> in Peshawar, while in a separate incident, two cops lost their lives as a result of an attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu.</p>
<p>Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773">three</a> ‚Äúwanted terrorists‚Äù were killed during a joint operation between the regional police and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) in Bannu district.</p>
<p>On July 5, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP‚Äôs Tipu Gul group were killed in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922269">joint operation</a> by the CTD.</p>

                <h2>Aurangzeb eyes ‚Äògame-changer‚Äô investment discussions with US</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has said the government aims to follow the ongoing trade talks with the United States by discussing investment, terming it a potential ‚Äúgame-changer‚Äù for economic ties between the two countries.</p>
<p>He made the remarks after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925024">meeting</a> with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer on Friday as part of a critical round of trade talks aimed at securing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901838">tariff relief</a> and expanding bilateral economic cooperation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOne thing we discussed was that we have to move beyond the immediate trade imperative, which is obviously very critical, but besides that, for the Pakistan-US relationship to be brought to the next level and bring in a real step change, [there is] an investment imperative that will hopefully emerge,‚Äù Aurangzeb said in a video statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAreas [for investment] have already been identified,‚Äù the minister said, mentioning <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902898">minerals and mining</a>, artificial intelligence, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912373">digital infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915365">cryptocurrency</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe feel this will be a real game-changer, God-willing, in terms of the economic relationship between Pakistan and the United States.‚Äù</p>

<p>Aurangzeb added that both sides committed to begin their talks with trade and follow them through ‚Äúvery quickly with investment discussions between the two countries and real execution of the investment upside that is available, so that it becomes a win-win‚Äù for Pakistan and the US.</p>
<p>The minister termed his dialogue with Lutnick and Greer ‚Äúvery constructive‚Äù. Pakistan‚Äôs Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh and Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul, who were present during the meeting, accompanied Aurangzeb in the video statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPositive progress over the last few weeks and months was reviewed. Equally importantly, we focused on the slightly outstanding aspects,‚Äù the finance czar said, adding there was a clear commitment from both sides to ‚Äúget closure‚Äù on those items.</p>
<p>The minister highlighted that as the US was Pakistan‚Äôs largest trading partner, it was quite critical to move forward in the ‚Äúsame spirit‚Äù in which the recent discussions had taken place.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the next few days, we hope that the coming leadership-level announcements will reflect all the hard work and efforts that have been put in both by Pakistan and the US side,‚Äù Aurangzeb said.</p>
<p>Pakistan aims to finalise a long-term reciprocal tariff agreement that would prevent the re-imposition of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901838">29 per cent tariff</a> on Pakistani exports ‚Äî primarily textiles and agricultural products. While Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922611/trump-dispatches-letters-outlining-new-tariffs-on-foreign-nations">announced</a> tariffs for some countries, talks with others are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923479">ongoing</a> ahead of his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922652/trump-announces-up-to-40pc-tariffs-on-several-nations#:~:text=%E2%80%94%20postponing%20their%20imposition%20to%20August%201.">extended</a> August 1 deadline.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922229/pakistan-us-reach-accord-on-trade-and-tariffs">reached</a> an initial understanding on a deal that could shape the future of the country‚Äôs key export sectors. A formal announcement on any deal is expected only after the US concludes similar ongoing negotiations with other trade partners.</p>
<p>A source close to the US administration has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925087#:~:text=The%20president%20wants%20concrete%20deliverables%20before%20the%20August%2015%20deadline">mentioned</a> a further deadline: ‚ÄúThe president wants concrete deliverables before the August 15 deadline. Countries that stall may find themselves on the wrong end of a tariff wall.‚Äù</p>
<p>A senior Pakistani official involved in the negotiations said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not here for aid. We‚Äôre here for serious negotiations and a possible deal. It‚Äôs about mutual benefit now ‚Äî trade, not dependence.‚Äù</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, influential US-based businessmen with stakes in cryptocurrency and rare earth mineral ventures have quietly supported Pakistan‚Äôs efforts to gain greater access to American markets.</p>
<p>In April, the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906732">partnered with</a> World Liberty Financial (WLF), a decentralised finance platform backed by US President Donald Trump. Earlier that month, a US delegation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903248">expressed</a> Washington‚Äôs strategic interest in the country‚Äôs mineral sector.</p></p>
