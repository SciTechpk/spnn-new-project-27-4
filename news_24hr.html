            <p><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Friday accorded his assent to the Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Bill, according to a notification by the Presidency <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/sherryrehman/status/1928308205165183220" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared</a> by PPP senator Sherry Rehman on X.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911451">bill</a>, which seeks to protect the rights of children and eventually eradicate marriages of children under the age of 18, reached the presidency on May 27 after sailing through both houses of parliament.</p>
<p>However, the move attracted strong <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913987">opposition</a> from religious segments of society, with the CII ruling that classifying marriage under the age of 18 as rape did not conform with Islamic law.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>“The Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Bill, 2025 is assented to, as passed by the Parliament,” the notification read.</p>
<p>“Pakistan has reached a milestone in the enactment of important legislation against child marriages,” Rehman said in a statement.</p>
<p>She said that the approval of the bill was successful despite resistance from various sections, adding that President Zardari signed the bill despite pressure.</p>
<p>“The signing of the Child Marriage Restraint Bill is a symbol of a new era of reforms in Pakistan,” she said.</p>
<p>She hailed the approval as a victory for the protection of the rights of women and children, adding, “This law was possible after a long and difficult struggle.”</p>
<p>“This bill is not just a law, it is a commitment that our girls have the right to education, health and a prosperous life,” Rehman continued.</p>
<p>She thanked PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, party leaders, other political parties, representatives of the opposition and the public for their support for the bill.</p>
<p>She also called on other provinces to take steps towards this important legislation.</p>
<p>Earlier, CII member Maulana Jalaludin, who belongs to the JUI-F, said Presi­dent Zardari should prevent anarchy in society and not sign the bill.</p>
<p>Incidentally, members bel­ong­ing to different sects opposed the bill.</p>
<p>Responding to a query, the CII member had said the assembly could not be above the Holy Quran and Sunnah. “This bill is not only against the norms of Sharia but also contrary to the values of our society and our traditions,” Maulana Jalaluddin reasoned, terming the move a western conspiracy to destroy ‘family system’.</p>
<p>The ‘bad intentions’ were evident as the bill was not forwarded to the CII, but approved by parliament ‘in secrecy’, he said.</p>
<p>However, PPP MNA Sharmila Faruqi, who tabled the bill in the National Assembly, said the matter of marriage of girls below 18 years of age, should not be given a religious colour and instead be considered in the context of human rights.</p>
<p>“We are not against marriages. We say marrying girls as young as 13 or 14 years is unfair when girls under 18 years of age do not have right to vote, cannot obtain national identity cards and driving licence,” she added.</p>
<p>In this regard, the PPP lawmaker referred to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1740845">decision</a> by Federal Shariat Court of 2022 that allowed the state to set the marriage age.</p></p>

            <p><p>LAHORE:  A pumped-up Pakistan side will look to go all out against Bangladesh in the second T20 International in Lahore on Friday to take an unassailable lead in the three-match <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913965/salman-hasan-and-shadab-star-as-clinical-pakistan-thrash-bangladesh">series</a>.</p>
<p>Pakistan during the past year or so have experienced an alarming decline in their T20 International contests, winning only nine while losing nineteen. Currently languishing at eighth in the ICC T20 International team rankings, the Green-shirts under new captain Salman Ali Agha no doubt will seek to make progress against Bangladesh who are ninth.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>

<p>The home side in the series opener on Wednesday comfortably defeated Bangladesh by 37 runs at the Gaddafi Stadium thanks to impressive batting by Salman (56), Shadab Khan (48, 4-26) and Hasan Nawaz (44). Returning fast bowler Hasan Ali (5-30) produced his best-ever show in the game.</p>
<p>Pakistan are expected to remain unchanged for the second T20 while Bangladesh are most likely to make a couple of changes as they will look to keep the series alive.</p>
<p>Both teams did not practise on Thursday, as they preferred to rest.</p>
<p>Talking to media after Pakistan won the series opener on Wednesday, Hasan Ali attributed his impressive comeback to the national team to the medical team which worked tirelessly with the pacer during the rehab at the National Cricket Academy (NCA).</p>
<p>“When I bowled the first ball [in the first T20], everything went normal. It was not easy to come back and produce such a good performance; I will dedicate it to my wife, my two children, who remained with me during this tough time. Moreover, my medical team which worked at the NCA for my rehab including Dr Iftikhar and  Saboor, all deserved appreciation,” the right-arm pacer said.</p>
<p>Answering a question, Hasan expressed his desire to play in the next World Cup.</p>
<p>“I really want to play the next World Cup; but let us see in between different series, [plus] I have to play in the Blast cricket. If I continue with good performance and my team needs me I will love to play the World Cup,” Hasan said.</p>
<p>He said the main reason behind the victory against Bangladesh was that the players executed the plan perfectly.</p>
<p>“A new set-up is working with the new captain [Salman Ali Agha] and head coach [Mike Hesson] and our simple plan is to embrace modern-day cricket. We have to play this type of game if we want to win against big teams. Now 200 is a par total [in T20 Internationals],” he underscored.</p>
<p>“Yes there is a point discussed to follow a rotation policy for the fast bowlers to keep them fresh. And it is possible when your bench strength is strong,” Hasan said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bangladesh team’s bowling consultant Mushtaq Ahmed while applauding Pakistan’s performance said the visitors had the potential to make a comeback in the series.</p>
<p>“Credit goes to the Pakistan team who produced a fine performance. Their intent was very good. We should learn from our mistakes and we have the potential to come back very hard,” former Pakistan leg-spinner Mushtaq said.</p>
<p>He specially praised the batting of Salman, saying the Pakistan skipper played some delightful shots.</p>
<p>“In any type of cricket, if any batsman plays [proper] cricketing shots he gets good results,” he said.</p>
<p>On Shadab and Rishad Hossain, Mushtaq said, “Shadab Khan is a very much experienced bowler whereas Rishad Hossain is passing through a learning stage; he is a match winner and has a great future for Bangladesh.”</p>
<p>According to Mushtaq, Najamul Hossain Shanto was not selected for the first T20 as the team management looked to test the bench strength.</p>
<p>“As Jaker Ali and Towhid Hridoy are also very good batters and at No.6 Shamim Hossain is also a nice choice, we are testing different combinations. Shanto will also get a chance,” he said.</p>
<p>In Wednesday’s match, Mushtaq highlighted, there was good support for the Bangladesh too in the crowd.</p>
<p>“Bangladeshis respect and love great Pakistan cricketers. There are [ongoing] discussions between the two cricket boards to exchange youth teams to improve cricket,” he said.</p>
