            <p><p>• Dar tells Senate intel suggests India contemplating ‘some form of escalation’<br />
• PPP lawmaker endorses call for Imran’s participation in proposed multi-party moot</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday said Pakistan will not strike India but reserves the right to retaliate, as he concluded his speech in the Senate on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">recent tensions</a> with India and diplomatic overtures deployed by Islamabad to contest New Delhi’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">allegations</a> in light of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>.</p>
<p>The Senate session also witnessed a call by PPP lawmaker Syed Masroor Ahsan, who endorsed the idea floated by the PTI seeking the involvement of PTI chief Imran Khan in the multi-party conference to send a “message of unity” in the country.</p>
<p>The idea initially floated by PTI’s Ali Zafar was recalled by PTI’s Aon Abbas in his speech on Tuesday, in which he said PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif, PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari, and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907225/amid-india-tensions-pti-wants-imrans-voice-heard">PTI founder Imran Khan</a> should participate in the moot to send a strong message.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>PPP’s Masroor Ahsan, while endorsing the idea, observed that the government should show flexibility and listen to the opposition. “Both sides need to set aside egos,” he remarked. Earlier, at least three senators, Allama Nasir Abbas, Gurdeep Singh and Dost Muhammad, called for the release of Imran Khan from the Adiala jail.</p>
<p>However, PML-N Senator Nasir Butt said Imran Khan would have to face the law and prove his innocence to secure his freedom.</p>
<p>Senator Saifullah Abro of the PTI chided former prime minister Nawaz Sharif for his purported silence over the Pahalgam attack and demanded that the political leadership make strong statements over the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Stern response</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, FM Ishaq Dar said Pakis­tan would pay back India in the same coin, but it would not initiate an attack.</p>
<p>Sharing details of Pakistan’s diplomatic overtures following the escalation in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, he said foreign ministers of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">Saudi Arabia</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907326/pakistan-shoots-down-indian-quadcopter-violating-airspace-near-loc-state-media#:~:text=UAE%20joins%20chorus%20favouring%20Pak%2DIndia%20dialogue">United Arab Emirates</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907094/china-urges-india-pakistan-to-exercise-restraint-after-pahalgam-attack">China</a>, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Hungary have been taken on board about Pakistan’s concerns.</p>
<p>He said he also spoke directly to the prime minister of Qatar. Mr Dar praised China and Turkiye for expressing clear support for Pakistan in the wake of the crisis.</p>
<p>“I walked them through what happened — India’s psyche, its history and our concerns about what intentions it may have in light of that history,” he told the House. Mr Dar said intelligence reports suggest that India was contemplating some form of escalation.</p>

<p>Referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1536224/timeline-events-of-the-feb-2019-pak-india-aerial-combat">2019 Pulwama attack</a> that killed 40 Indian paramilitary personnel and was blamed on a Pakistan-based militant group, the deputy prime minister noted that New Delhi had used the incident as a pretext to revoke Article 370 of its constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>The region was subsequently absorbed into India’s union territory framework, a move Pakistan has repeatedly condemned. Ishaq Dar also said that India had been attempting to alter the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">1960 Indus Waters Treaty</a>, which determined the water-sharing mechanism between both countries, for the past two years, citing changing circumstances.</p>
<p>“I have my doubts, much like other people, that this drama was staged to suspend this treaty,” he said while referring to the Pahalgam attack. He said there was no evidence that it was a false-flag operation. “What we do say with full confidence is that Pakistan has nothing to do with this [attack].”</p>
<p>According to Mr Dar, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered an independent investigation into the Pahalgam attack fully knowing that Pakistan had nothing to do with it. He also made it clear that any meddling with Pakistani waters by India will not be tolerated at any cost and will be taken as an act of war.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the House unanimously passed “The Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention (Implementation) Bill, 2025” and “The National Commission for Minorities’ Rights Bill 2025 brought before it as a supplementary agenda.</p>

            <p><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar early Wednesday morning said that “credible intelligence” reports indicated that India was planning to conduct a military action against Pakistan in the next 24 to 36 hours amid tensions between the two countries after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> in occupied Kashmir last week that New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">blamed</a> on Islamabad, albeit without proof.</p>
<p>Earlier today, India gave its military “operational freedom” to respond to the deadly attack in occupied Kashmir last week.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media hours after the development, Tarar said: “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends carrying out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.”</p>
<p>He said Pakistan vehemently rejected “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region” which was completely “reckless”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>“Pakistan has been the victim of terrorism itself and truly understands the pain of this scourge,” he said, adding: “We have always condemned it in all its forms and manifestations anywhere in the world.”</p>
<p>Being a responsible state, he said Pakistan “open heartedly offered a credible, transparent and independent investigation” by a neutral commission of experts to ascertain the truth.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, rather than pursuing the path of reason, India has apparently decided to tread the dangerous path of irrationality and confrontation, which will have catastrophic consequences for the complete region and beyond,” the minister stressed.</p>
<p>He said the “evasion of credible investigations is in itself sufficient evidence exposing India’s real motives.”</p>
<p>“Consciously making strategic decisions hostage to public sentiments, purposefully trumped up for securing political objectives, is unfortunate and deplorable,” the minister added.</p>
<p>Tarar reiterated that any such military adventurism by India would be responded to assuredly and decisively.</p>
<p>“The International community must remain alive to the reality that the onus of escalatory spiral and its ensuing consequences shall squarely lie with India,” Tarar emphasised.</p>
<p>He reiterated the nation’s resolve to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan at all cost.</p>

<p>A week after the deadliest attack on civilians in the contested region in years, Modi held a closed-door meeting today with army and security chiefs, during which he told the armed forces that they had the “complete operational freedom to decide on the mode, targets and timing of our response to the terror attack”, a senior government source told <em>AFP</em>, who was not authorised to speak to the media.</p>
<p>The government released video images of a stern-faced Modi meeting with army chiefs, as well as Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.</p>
<p>Also on Tuesday, India’s army said it had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907094/china-urges-india-pakistan-to-exercise-restraint-after-pahalgam-attack#:~:text=The%20statement%20came%20after%20Pakistan%20and%20India%20reportedly%20exchanged%20gunfire%20for%20a%20fourth%20night%20in%20a%20row%20across%20the%20LoC%2C%20after%20four%20years%20of%20relative%20calm.">repeatedly traded gunfire</a> with Pakistani troops across the Line of Control (LoC). The two neighbours have been trading fire across the LoC for five days now, with each blaming the other for provocation.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Army did not confirm the shooting, but state media reported on Tuesday it had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907326/pakistan-shoots-down-indian-quadcopter-violating-airspace-near-loc">shot down an Indian drone</a>, calling it a violation of its airspace.</p>
<p>It did not say when the incident happened, and there was no comment from New Delhi.</p>
<p>India alleged the “Pakistan Army resorted to unprovoked small arms firing across the LoC” overnight from Monday to Tuesday, the fifth night in a row that fire was exchanged there.</p>
<p>The Indian army said its troops had “responded in a measured and effective manner to the provocation”. There were no reports of casualties.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres held calls today with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and India’s foreign minister to express “deep concern at rising tensions”, his spokesman said.</p>
<p>The UN chief “underscored the need to avoid a confrontation that could result in tragic consequences. He offered his good offices to support de-escalation efforts”, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.</p>
<p>During the telephone call, the prime minister affirmed that Pakistan condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, while highlighting the significant sacrifices rendered by the country in the global war against terror.</p>
<p>While rejecting Indian accusations against Pakistan as “baseless”, the prime minister categorically rejected any attempt to link Pakistan with the Pahalgam incident and reiterated his call for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">transparent and neutral investigation</a> into the incident.</p>
<p>He expressed serious concerns over India’s attempts to delegitimise the Kashmiri freedom struggle by using the bogey of terrorism, as well as its widely documented state-sponsored terrorism in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>He particularly highlighted India’s weaponisation of the waters of the Indus Basin as unacceptable, while noting that water was the lifeline of 240 million people.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>While underscoring that Pakistan would defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity with full force in case of any misadventure by India, the prime minister encouraged the UN chief to counsel India to “act responsibly and exercise restraint”.</p>
<p>He emphasised that the unresolved issue of Jammu and Kashmir remained the root cause of instability in South Asia, and urged the UN chief to play his role for its just resolution, in accordance with relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>The prime minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering commitment towards fostering international peace and security as a responsible member of the international community and a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>The UN chief appreciated Pakistan’s efforts for peace in South Asia and said that the world could not afford any escalation in the region at the crucial time.</p>
<p>Relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours have plummeted after India accused Pakistan of backing an attack in occupied Kashmir on April 22 in which 26 men were killed.</p>
<p>Islamabad has rejected the charge and both countries have since exchanged gunfire and diplomatic barbs, as well as expelled citizens and ordered the main land border crossing shut.</p>
<p>Last week, Modi vowed to pursue those who carried out the attack in the tourist hotspot of Pahalgam and those who had supported it.</p>
<p>“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” he said on Thursday.</p>
<p>“We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth”.</p>
<p>The bellicose statements have prompted worries of a rapid spiral into military action, with several nations, including <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907094/china-urges-india-pakistan-to-exercise-restraint-after-pahalgam-attack">neighbouring China</a>, calling for restraint and dialogue.</p>
<p>Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their independence from British rule in 1947. Both claim the territory in full.</p>
<p>Freedom fighters in the Indian-occupied area have waged an insurgency since 1989, seeking independence or a merger with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Indian police have issued wanted posters for three men accused of carrying out the attack — two alleged Pakistanis and an Indian — who they claim are members of the Lashkar-i-Taiba group, a UN-designated terrorist organisation.</p>
<p>They have announced a two million rupee ($23,500) bounty for information leading to each man’s arrest and carried out sweeping detentions seeking anyone suspected of links to the alleged killers.</p>
<p>The worst attack in recent years in occupied Kashmir was at Pulwama in 2019, when a person rammed a car packed with explosives into a security forces convoy, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1463946">killing 40</a> and wounding 35.</p>
<p>Indian fighter jets <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1466038">carried out air strikes</a> on Pakistani territory 12 days later. The next day, Pakistan Air Force undertook strikes across the LoC from Pakistani airspace.</p>
<p>Iran has already offered to mediate and Saudi Arabia has said Riyadh was trying to “prevent an escalation”.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906480">downplayed tensions</a>, saying on Friday the dispute will get “figured out, one way or another”.</p></p>

<p>NEW DELHI: Indian Prime Minister Nar­endra Modi has given his military “operational freedom” to respond to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in India-held Kashmir last week, which New Delhi has tri­ed to pin on Pakistan, wit­hout offering any evide­nce to support the claim.</p>
<p>A full week after the Pahalgam attack, which claimed the lives of over two dozen tourists, Modi held a closed-door meeting with the heads of the three armed services, as well as Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.</p>
<p>During the meeting, he told the armed forces that they had the “complete operational freedom to decide on the mode, targets and timing of our response to the terror attack”, a senior government source told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>No further details have been released from the meeting, which was held at the Indian PM’s resident on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It comes a day after Defence Minister Kha­waja Asif warned of a possible Indian incursion, saying that the next few days were crucial and Pakistan was prepared for any eventuality.</p>
<p>Last week, Modi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284#:~:text=dangerous%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20warned.-,Modi%20vows%20to%20pursue%20attackers%20to%20%E2%80%98ends%20of%20the%20Earth%E2%80%99,-Meanwhile%2C%20in%20India">vowed to pursue</a> those who carried out the attack, as well as those who had supported it.</p>

<p>Following the high-level meeting, the Indian media began speculating about a “possible response”.</p>
<p>The bellicose statem­e­nts have prompted worr­ies of a rapid spiral into mil­itary action, with several nations, including ne­i­ghbouring China, cal­l­ing for restraint and dialogue.</p>
<p>Late on Tuesday night, US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce announced that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was expected to speak to the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan “as early as today or tomorrow”.</p>
<p>She said the US was reaching out to both parties regarding the Kashmir issue, and is expected to tell both sides not to escalate things any further.</p>
<p>Ms Bruce said that Rubio was also encouraging leaders and foreign ministers from other nations to reach out over the issue.</p>
<p>Earlier, UN Secr­e­­tary-General Antonio Gu­t­erres <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390#:~:text=PM%20Shehbaz%20urges%20UN%20chief%20to%20%E2%80%98counsel%20India%E2%80%99%20to%20%E2%80%98exercise%20restraint%E2%80%99">held calls</a> Tues­day with Pakistan’s prime minister and India’s foreign minister to express “deep concern at rising tensions”, his spokesman said.</p>

<p>According to the PM Office in Islamabad, during their telephone call, PM Shehbaz rejected the Indian accusations as bas­e­less and categorica­lly rejected any attempt to link Pakistan with the Pahalgam incident.</p>
<p>He reiterated his call for a transparent and neutral investigation into the incident, and expre­ssed serious concerns over India’s attempts to delegitimise the Kashmiri freedom struggle by using the bogey of “terrorism”, as well as its widely documented state-sponsored terrorism in the occupied territory.</p>
<p>He also pointed to India’s weaponisation of the waters of the Indus Basin as being unacceptable as it was the lifeline of around 240 million people.</p>
<p><strong>No airport closures</strong></p>
<p>Amid fears of airspace closures due to rising tensions with India, rumours of a possible closure of airports began circulating on social media on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>However, authorities confirmed that this was not true, and both domestic and international flight operations continued as usual.</p>
<p>For example, a flight from Islamabad to Doha departed on Wednesday at around 12.40am.</p>
