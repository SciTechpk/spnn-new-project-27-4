                <h2>Pakistan condemns Modi‚Äôs ‚Äòreckless provocation‚Äô in Gujarat speech</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office on Tuesday condemned the recent remarks towards Pakistan by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a speech in Gujarat, calling it a ‚Äúreckless provocation‚Äù.</p>
<p>The developments follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi‚Äôs allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam.</p>
<p>On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>. After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting drones</a> sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> was reached.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ANI/status/1926983867820326946" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> shared by Indian news outlet <em>ANI</em>, Modi says: ‚ÄúThe people of Pakistan must come forward to rid their country of terrorism. Their youth will have to come forward.‚Äù</p>
<p>He went on to say: ‚ÄúLive a life of peace, eat your bread or [choose my] bullet,‚Äù to applause from the crowd, with many adorned in orange and white outfits.</p>

<p>A statement by the FO early on Tuesday said Pakistan has taken note of Modi‚Äôs remarks ‚Äúdelivered in Gujarat with the theatrical flourish of a campaign rally rather than the sobriety expected of the leader of a nuclear-armed state.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe hate-driven invocation of violence in his remarks is deeply disturbing, not only for its content but for the dangerous precedent it sets in region already burdened by volatility,‚Äù the FO said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe regret the continued erosion of maturity and decorum in Indian statecraft.‚Äù</p>

<p>The FO noted that such statement ‚Äúblatantly violate‚Äù the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, which obliges member states to resolve disputes peacefully and to refrain from the threat or use of force against the sovereignty or political independence of other states.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan views these remarks as a reckless provocation, intended to distract from the ongoing human rights abuses and demographic engineering in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu &amp; Kashmir.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan‚Äôs record as a leading contributor to UN peacekeeping and its consistent cooperation in global counter-terrorism efforts speak louder than any hostile soundbite.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf extremism is indeed a concern for the Indian government, it would do well to turn inward-toward the alarming rise of majoritarianism, religious intolerance, and the systematic disenfranchisement of minorities under the increasingly brutal Hindutva ideology,‚Äù the FO said.</p>
<p>It added that Pakistan remains committed to peace based on mutual respect and sovereign equality.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, any threat to its security or territorial integrity will be met with firm and proportionate measures, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe international community must take serious note of India‚Äôs escalating rhetoric, which undermines regional stability and the prospects for lasting peace.‚Äù</p></p>

                <h2>Govt extends deadline for PIA expressions of interest till June 19</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The government on Tuesday extended the deadline for expressions of interest in purchasing Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) to June 13, the privatisation ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The government‚Äôs failed first <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894375">attempt</a> to privatise PIA cost the national exchequer $4.3 million, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Privatisation was informed on February 26.</p>
<p>In March, Privatisation and Investment Minister Abdul Aleem Khan said that the government would complete all the steps to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896181">privatise PIA by May</a>, while the pri¬≠vatisation commission <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898843">approved</a> a transaction structure for the second attempt to privatise the national carrier based on a divestment of 51 to 100 per cent of its shares of capital.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906353#:~:text=The%20investors%20can%20submit%20an%20expression%20of%20interest%20by%20June%203%2C%20with%20the%20bidding%20process%20expected%20to%20take%20place%20between%20October%20and%20December.">earlier deadline</a> was June 3, with the bidding process expected to take place between October and December.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the ministry, the deadline for submission on expressions of interest till 4pm on June 19.</p>
<p>Last month, a PIA spokesperson said that the carrier‚Äôs bo¬≠¬≠ard of directors approved its fin¬≠ancial results for 2024, which showed the airline achieving a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903037/pia-achieves-net-profit-after-21-years">net profit</a> after around 21 years.</p>
<p>According to the results for FY2024, PIA earned an operational profit of Rs3.9 billion and a net profit of Rs2.26bn. The airline‚Äôs operating margin was more than 12pc, which is on a par with the performance of any of the best airlines in the world, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>PIA began to be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1788332">unprofitable</a> in 2011, requiring government subsidies. By the end of 2016, the national flag carrier was saddled with $3bn in debt. At the end of 2018, the airline was burdened with $3.3bn in debt, up from $2.97bn the year before. Government bailouts were required for the carrier‚Äôs continued operation.</p>
<p>Last year in June, the then-government had agreed to overhaul loss-making state-owned enterprises, including PIA, under a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $3bn bailout. But in February 2024 ‚Äî right before the general elections ‚Äî the election commission had asked the then-caretaker administration to ‚Äúrefrain‚Äù from finalising the deal.</p></p>
