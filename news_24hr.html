            <p><p>Pakistan’s Director General Military Operations (DGMO) Major General Kashif Abdullah and his Indian counterpart Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai held the first round of talks via hotline after the recent ceasefire between the two countries in the wake of a military conflict.</p>
<p>Saturday’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910113/world-community-hails-ceasefire-decision-between-pakistan-and-india">ceasefire</a>, announced by US President Donald Trump, followed four days of intense exchanges of fire as the nuclear-armed neighbours targeted each other’s military installations with missiles and drones, killing dozens of civilians.</p>
<p>Confirming the talks to <em>Dawn.com</em>, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said the next round would take place in the next 48 hours. A ceasefire till then, he said, was “quite standard”.</p>
<p>State media outlets <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/12-05-2025/first-round-of-talks-between-pakistan-india-dgmos-concluded" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> and <em>PTV News</em> confirmed the talks as well.</p>

<p><em>Reuters</em> also reported that the Indian army confirmed that the DGMOs spoke by phone today.</p>
<p>“Issues related to continuing the commitment that both sides must not fire a single shot or initiate any aggressive and inimical action against each other were discussed,” the Indian army said.</p>
<p>“It was also agreed that both sides consider immediate measures to ensure troop reduction from the borders and forward areas,” it added.</p>

<p>The escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours began following the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">attack</a> in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">killed</a> 26 people. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack%20were%20brought%20out">cross-border linkages</a>” of the att­a­­­c­kers.</p>

Following the allegations, India launched a series of strikes on Pakistan on the night of May 6 and 7, resulting in civilian casualties.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#hotline-message" id="hotline-message" title="Permalink"></a>Hotline message</h2>
<p>India’s military sent a “hotline” message to Pakistan on Sunday about alleged ceasefire violations the previous day, flagging New Delhi’s intent to respond to further such incidents, <em>Reuters</em> reported, citing a top Indian army officer.</p>
<p>However, the Foreign Office and the Pakistan military’s spokesperson rubbished the allegations.</p>
<p>“In spite of some minor damage, all our military bases and systems continue to remain fully operational,” India’s director general of air operations, Air Marshal AK Bharti, claimed in a media briefing today.</p>
<p>India also reopened 32 airports it had shut during the clashes, with the Airports Authority of India saying in a statement they were available for civil operations. Some schools remained closed.</p>
<p>Pakistan had reopened its airspace on Saturday.</p>
<p>Visitors were kept out of an airport in the border city of Amritsar shortly after the announcement, a <em>Reuters</em> witness said.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910555/as-trump-heads-to-the-gulf-israel-asks-where-the-us-stands' target='_blank'><strong>As Trump heads to the Gulf, Israel asks where the US stands</strong></a>
            <p><p>Israeli officials have put a brave face on President Donald Trump bypassing them on a Middle East trip this week, but his decision to do so is the latest to sow doubt in Israel about where the United States stands in Washington’s priorities.</p>
<p>On Sunday, a few days after announcing plans for an expanded military operation in Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said it had been informed by the US of an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1910452">agreement</a> to release American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, after talks between Washington and Hamas that did not include Israel.</p>
<p>Trump, who will be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906046/trump-to-visit-s-arabia-uae-next-month">visiting</a> Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, also caused consternation in Israel last week by abruptly announcing the US would stop bombing Houthis in Yemen, days after a Houthi missile hit near Israel’s main airport.</p>
<p>“The message to the region was clear: Israel is no longer a top US priority,” wrote Itamar Eichner, diplomatic correspondent for Israeli <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1qvel9gee" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news outlets</a> <em>Ynet</em>, echoing media commentators across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>One Israeli official said Trump’s announcement on the Houthis was “kind of an embarrassment” and that the president acts “for good and for bad”.</p>
<p>Israel has been talking to the US about the post-conflict future of Gaza, and officials say relations at the official level remain strong, but some officials acknowledge being blindsided by Trump’s decision-making.</p>
<p>One senior official in Netanyahu’s circle, who declined to be identified by name, said there was “chaos” in the Trump administration, with everything dependent on what the president decided at any given moment.</p>
<p>Sometimes that helped Israel, and sometimes it did not, the official said.</p>
<p>The decision on the Houthis, which was not discussed with Israel beforehand, compounded Israeli unease at US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910345">talks</a> with Iran over Tehran’s nuclear programme, which could blunt any Israeli threat of military action against its arch-enemy.</p>
<p>Israel faced further alarm after <em>Reuters</em> reported that the US was no longer demanding Saudi Arabia normalise ties with Israel as a condition for progress on civil nuclear cooperation talks.</p>
<p>“We coordinate. It doesn’t mean you must fully agree 100 per cent on every issue,” Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on Sunday.</p>
<p>“The US is a sovereign state. Israel is a sovereign state. But I believe we have a very, very big common ground of positions with this administration, more than in the past.”</p>
<p>In March, Trump’s hostage negotiator, Adam Boehler, held what Hamas described as “very helpful” meetings with the Palestinian fighter group that bypassed Israel and focused on releasing Alexander.</p>
<p>Last week, US Ambassador Mike Huckabee denied that Trump was distancing himself from Israel. He said the relationship was often described as ironclad and “that word is still operative”.</p>
<p>“The president has been consistent in his support and his partnership, and I have no reason to believe that that won’t continue,” he said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#chaos" id="chaos" title="Permalink"></a>‘Chaos’</h2>
<p>Netanyahu and his government faced criticism today even as Israelis looked forward to Alexander’s release, with a growing perception in the public that the two allies had differing priorities.</p>
<p>“There’s just no leadership now,” said Tel Aviv pensioner Jack Gottlieb.</p>
<p>There was “no question” the deal happened behind Netanyahu’s back or that the US and Israeli agendas currently differed, he said.</p>
<p>“Right now, it’s every man for himself,” Gottlieb said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu had little choice but to accept the decision on the Houthis, who signalled they would not stop trying to hit Israel by firing another missile a few days later.</p>
<p>Israel has relied on US military and diplomatic support since its creation as an independent state in 1948. Any weakening of US interest, as Israel faces international pressure over the Gaza bombardment, would be a severe blow.</p>
<p>The decision to drop the demand for a normalisation deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel, to get past Riyadh’s insistence that Israel agree to moves towards a settlement with the Palestinians, underlined how damaging the issue has been for Israel internationally.</p>
<p>Adding Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which both normalised relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords signed during Trump’s first term, has been a major goal for Netanyahu but is now seemingly delayed indefinitely.</p>
<p>Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, faced bitter criticism from Israeli hardliners after stopping exports of some heavy munitions used in Gaza and imposing sanctions on violent Israeli West Bank settlers.</p>
<p>By contrast, Trump, in his first term, defied world opinion by moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, which Israel regards as its capital, and recognised Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights, which it seized in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>Israeli officials have said previously that they were aware there were risks for Israel in a president as unpredictable as Trump and one who has shown no compunction in turning on historic US allies.</p>
<p>“But we don’t have a choice,” said one.</p></p>

            <p><p>Hip-hop mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs went on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904234/sean-diddy-combs-arrives-in-court-to-face-expanded-sex-trafficking-charges">trial</a> on sex trafficking charges on Monday, with prosecutors saying the Bad Boy Records founder lured women into romantic relationships, forced them to take part in days of drug-fuelled sex parties and then blackmailed them with videos he recorded of the encounters.</p>
<p>Combs “viciously attacked” women when they resisted taking part in the parties, known as ‘freak offs’ or otherwise upset him, prosecutor Emily Johnson said during her opening statement in Manhattan federal court.</p>
<p>She told jurors they would hear testimony from victims who said Combs, 55, routinely beat them and exploded with rage at the smallest slights. The case has drawn intense media coverage because of Combs’ fame.</p>
<p>“They will tell you about some of the most painful experiences of their lives. The days they spent in hotel rooms, high on drugs, dressed in costumes to perform the defendant’s sexual fantasies,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>Defence lawyer Teny Geragos countered that prosecutors were trying to twist Combs’ romantic relationships into a racketeering and sex trafficking case.</p>
<p>“Sean Combs is a complicated man, but this is not a complicated case. This case is about voluntary choices made by capable adults in consensual relationships,” Geragos said in her opening statement.</p>
<p>Combs has pleaded not guilty to five felony counts of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted on all counts, he faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and could face life in prison.</p>

<p>Combs’ mother, Janice Combs, sat in the front row of the courtroom along with six of her son’s children. Combs wore a beige sweater over a white collared shirt and khakis. He smiled at his family and blew them a kiss before taking his seat with his lawyers.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have accused Combs of using his fame and fortune to abuse women. The defence is expected to counter that the activity described by prosecutors was consensual, and say there was nothing illegal about a “swingers” lifestyle in which Combs and his girlfriends occasionally brought a third person into their relationships.</p>
<p>Over the course of a two-month trial, jurors are expected to hear testimony from three and possibly four of the rapper’s female accusers, as well as his former employees who prosecutors say helped arrange and cover up his actions.</p>

<p>Allegations of sexual abuse in the criminal charges brought against Combs by the Manhattan US Attorney’s office last year made him the latest powerful man in the entertainment industry to be accused of sexual misconduct in the wake of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/trends/MeToo">#MeToo</a> movement, which encouraged women to speak up about abuse.</p>
<p>Combs is known for turning rap and rhythm and blues artists like Notorious BIG. and Mary J Blige into stars, and in the process elevating the mainstream appeal of hip-hop in American culture in the 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
<p>Born in Manhattan’s Harlem neighbourhood and raised by a single mother, Combs went on to live in mansions in Miami and Los Angeles and host lavish parties for the cultural elite in destinations like the Hamptons and Saint-Tropez.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Prosecutors say his success concealed a dark side. Over two decades, Combs used violence and threats to force women to take part in the ‘freak offs’, according to the indictment.</p>
<p>Combs would often watch the performances, masturbate and film them, sometimes using the recordings as blackmail to ensure his alleged victims did not report his abuse, prosecutors say.</p>
<p>In one 2016 incident that was captured on hotel surveillance footage that prosecutors plan to show the jury, Combs was seen kicking and dragging a woman as she was trying to leave a ‘freak off’, prosecutors say.</p>
<p><em><a class="link--external" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/17/entertainment/sean-combs-cassie-ventura" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CNN</a></em> last year broadcast footage that appeared to show Combs attacking his former girlfriend, the rhythm and blues singer Casandra Ventura, in 2016 in a Los Angeles hotel hallway. Combs apologised after the video aired.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#cassie-among-first-witnesses" id="cassie-among-first-witnesses" title="Permalink"></a>Cassie among first witnesses</h2>
<p>Ventura, known professionally as Cassie, is among the first witnesses expected to testify against Combs.</p>
<p>Combs’ defence strategy at trial will hinge on undermining the credibility of the women who testify against Combs, including by arguing they were motivated by money to accuse him of wrongdoing and have unreliable memories.</p>
<p>Marc Agnifilo, Combs’ lead lawyer, has said the 2016 hotel incident depicted the aftermath of a dispute over infidelity and was not evidence of sex trafficking. In a court hearing on Friday, Agnifilo said Ventura had a history of domestic violence, undercutting prosecutors’ argument that she was a victim.</p>
<p>Ventura’s lawyer declined to comment.</p></p>
