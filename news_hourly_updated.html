                <h2>3 ‚Äòkey‚Äô TTP terrorists killed in joint operation by Swat CTD, police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Three wanted terrorists and ‚Äúkey operatives‚Äù of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed during a joint operation of the police and the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) in the Barikot tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Swat district on Friday.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP ‚Äî particularly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773/3-terrorists-killed-during-joint-operation-in-kps-bannu-police">Bannu</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923956/one-killed-2-others-injured-in-explosion-in-kps-lakki-marwat-police">Lakki Marwat</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921636">Bajaur</a> ‚Äî have seen a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a> targeting police stations and posts. In response, the state has also intensified its counterterrorism <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925443/9-terrorists-killed-8-captured-in-malakand-joint-action-by-military-leas-during-four-days">operations</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThree wanted terrorists have been killed in Barikot in a major win for Swat CTD. Eliminating the enemies of regional peace, the CTD has killed three important operatives of the <em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em>,‚Äù KP Police said in a statement today.</p>
<p><em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em> is a term the state uses to refer to the banned TTP.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Among the terrorists was Ajmal, also known as Waqas, a resident of Malook Abad who was reportedly involved in at least nine terrorism-related cases. He was also involved in the killing of Village Defence Council members and carried a bounty of Rs2 million.</p>
<p>The second individual was identified as Matiullah, also known by the aliases Ishaq and Junaid, son of Ibrat Shah from Dabb Sar Martung in Shangla district, who was wanted in two terrorism cases.</p>
<p>The third slain terrorist was Rahimullah Rehmani, alias Rohullah, son of Amanullah, a resident of Sheray in Afghanistan‚Äôs Nuristan province. He, too, was wanted in two separate terrorism cases.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe terrorists were involved in attacks on security forces and assassinations of police personnel,‚Äù said the KP police statement. ‚ÄúA network spreading terrorism with external funding was destroyed, and the terrorists were also wanted in improvised explosive device (IED) attacks and extortion cases.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis CTD operation is a blow to the operational wings of <em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em> in Swat and adjacent areas,‚Äù Malakand Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sher Akbar Khan was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúWe are determined to uproot <em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em>.‚Äù</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters, Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Umar Khan said that search and strike operations against militants would continue across the district. He added that security has been intensified at all entry and exit points of Swat to prevent any possible infiltration of miscreants.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will not allow the peace and stability of Swat to be disturbed at any cost,‚Äù the DPO asserted.</p>
<p>KP Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed praised the regional police and Swat CTD for striking the ‚Äúoperational command wing‚Äù of <em>Fitna al-Khawarij</em>, according to the police statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOperations against terrorists will be further intensified to establish lasting peace and order in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">surge</a> in terrorist activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. Attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies‚Äô personnel, and security forces.</p>
<p>In a series of incidents in KP yesterday, a police official was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926664/cop-martyred-in-karak-attack-on-bannu-police-station-foiled">martyred</a> in the Karak district while police thwarted a separate late-night terrorist assault on a police station in Bannu‚Äôs Basyakhel area.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP‚Äôs Tipu Gul group <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922269">were killed</a> in a joint operation by the CTD and the police in Lakki Marwat. This came nearly a week after the leader of a peace committee and two of his companions <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921018">were shot dead</a> by terrorists in the same district.</p>
<p>Three terrorists <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916076/3-terrorists-killed-one-cop-martyred-in-gun-battle-with-lakki-marwat-police-local-peace-committee">were also killed</a> in Lakki Marwat‚Äôs Kot Kashmir area during a gun battle with the police and local peace committee, in which a cop was martyred as well.</p>
<p>A total of 670 terror incidents were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881856">recorded in 2024</a>, while 212 militants were killed in counter-terrorism operations, according to a report issued by the CTD.</p></p>

                <h2>Pakistan presents immense investment opportunities, Mustafa Kamal tells health moot in Beijing</h2>

            <p><p>Health Minister Mustafa Kamal urged international stakeholders to explore partnerships in Pakistan‚Äôs rapidly evolving health landscape, highlighting the country‚Äôs ‚Äúimmense‚Äù potential for investment, state-run <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/26-07-2025/pakistan-presents-immense-opportunities-for-investment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Radio Pakistan</em></a> reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>Representing Pakistan at Boao Forum for Asia‚Äôs (BFA) Global Health Forum in Beijing yesterday, the health minister underscored that Pakistan presents ‚Äúimmense opportunities for collaboration, innovation and investment‚Äù.</p>
<p>Established in 2001, the <a class="link--external" href="https://en.ghfbfa.cn/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Boao Forum for Asia</a> (BFA) is a non-profit international organisation promoting regional cooperation in Asia. It focuses on health issues related to economic development and wellbeing.</p>
<p>The roundtable featured health ministers from all over the world, who discussed equal access to healthcare and sustainable reforms.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPakistan is ready for partnerships in global health,‚Äù Kamal said, highlighting the country‚Äôs 250 million population, nursing cooperation and digital reforms.</p>
<p>He pointed out that there were ‚Äúsignificant opportunities for global collaboration in the health sector‚Äù, according to a post on his X account.</p>
<p>The minister noted that Pakistan could play a role in mitigating a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844692">shortage</a> of nurses and paramedics through training and cooperation.</p>
<p>He invited global partners to explore investment avenues, emphasising Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to providing strong <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891490">returns</a>, streamlined regulation, and government support.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWithout health, the economy cannot progress,‚Äù Kamal said.</p>

<p>The health minister also drew attention to the new Digital System for Licensing and Registration of Medical Devices for the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap), which was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925775">launched</a> by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday.</p>
<p>At the inauguration, the premier noted that the registration of life-saving medical devices and diagnostic products in Pakistan had become a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901711">critical issue</a> earlier this year. He expressed hope that the applications for such equipment would now be decided within 20 days.</p>
<p>Last month, Kamal noted that Pakistan‚Äôs healthcare system was riddled with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919214">fundamental flaws</a> and that the solution lay not merely in building hospitals but in improving the entire environment.</p>
<p>The minister has also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924869">called attention</a> towards Pakistan‚Äôs high fertility rate, high burden of both communicable and non-communicable diseases, and need to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898284">eradicate polio</a>.</p></p>
