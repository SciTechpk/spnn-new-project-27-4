            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929989/mastung-blast-derails-6-bogies-as-jaffar-express-targeted-2nd-time-in-a-week' target='_blank'><strong>Mastung blast derails 6 bogies as Jaffar Express targeted 2nd time in a week</strong></a>
            <p><p>No loss of life was reported after a bomb blast on a railway track in Balochistan’s Mastung district derailed six bogies of the Jaffar Express, an official said on Sunday.</p>
<p>With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province’s transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train. Fortunately, there was no loss of life.”</p>
<p>The incident occurred near the Spezand station in Mastung’s Dasht tehsil, when the train was heading from Quetta to Peshawar City station with 350 passengers on board.</p>
<p>“Security forces and rescue teams rushed to the site as soon as they were alerted about the incident, and began a search operation after cordoning off the area,” Kashif said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Four bogies of the Jaffar Express had been placed back on the track, while efforts were underway to restore the other two,” the official noted.</p>
<p>A relief train of the Pakistan Railways brought the 350 passengers back to Quetta, while bogies stuck on the track will be returned to the city as well, according to a later statement from Kashif, who said that all tickets will be refunded.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, Kashif said the services of the Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail were suspended till August 14.</p>
<p>The Bolan Mail will resume its operations on August 16 (Saturday), when it will depart from Karachi “in its proper turn” and will arrive in Quetta the next day, he added.</p>
<p>Today’s incident comes just three days after Quetta-bound Jaffar Express <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929447">narrowly escaped</a> a disaster in Balochistan’s Sibi, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train passed.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>In another near-miss incident on July 24, a powerful explosion ripped through the Quetta-Sibi rail section, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926300">damaging a bogie</a> of the Bolan Mail.</p>
<p>A July 28 derailment of the Jaffar Express train in Sindh’s Sukkur was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927185">initially attributed</a> to an explosion — even by government-run media — but the Ministry of Railways later said a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927307">technical fault</a> was the cause.</p>
<p>In June, a powerful explosion of a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks caused four bogies of the Jaffer Express to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917945">derail in Jacobabad</a>. No one was hurt in the incident.</p>
<p>In April, the 3UP train heading from Karachi to Quetta was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904018">stopped</a> at Jacobabad railway station due to security reasons.</p>
<p>Train services betw­een Quetta and the rest of the country were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900566">restored</a> on March 27, after they were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897306/all-trains-to-and-from-balochistan-suspended">suspended</a> due to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419">unprecedented hijacking</a> of the Pesha­war-bound Jaffar Express earlier that month.</p>
<p>The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897595/balochistan-standoff-ends-after-all-jaffar-express-hostages-rescued#:~:text=In%20all%2C%2021%20passengers%20lost%20their%20lives%2C%20while%20four%20FC%20personnel%20were%20martyred%2C%20the%20ISPR%20DG%20said.">21 passengers</a> and four security personnel. “All 33 terrorists” were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929988/pti-will-approach-lawyers-over-rumoured-27th-amendment-asad-qaiser' target='_blank'><strong>PTI will approach lawyers over ‘rumoured’ 27th Amendment: Asad Qaiser</strong></a>
            <p><p>PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser on Sunday addressed rumours of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, stating that the party would approach the legal fraternity regarding the potential legislation.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866452/26th-constitutional-amendment-awaits-presidential-assent-after-sailing-through-na-in-late-night-session">passing</a> the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866480">26th Constitutional Amendment</a> last year, the government had been planning to table another amendment, colloquially known as the 27th Amendment, aimed at reforming local governments and “addressing issues skipped in previous legislation”.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, the PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker stated that there is “new drama” surrounding the legislation.</p>
<p>“In this case, we will approach the lawyers’ community regarding this legislation,” Qaiser said. “We will begin by meeting with the Islamabad Bar this month.”</p>
<p>Referring to a “schedule of activities” for this month, Qaiser said that the PTI will also arrange an engagement with foreign diplomats and embassies, as well as a seminar.</p>
<p>The PTI leader also assailed the manner in which the country is being governed, branding it “illegal, unconstitutional and undemocratic”.</p>
<p>“The country is practically under martial law and decisions are being made based on personal preferences,” Qaiser stated. “The country cannot be run under this hybrid system we have right now.</p>
<p>“We have decided that we will use all available forums — parliament, the courts, the public — to take our struggle against injustice and oppression forward.”</p>

<p>Qaiser claimed that courts made decisions not based on merit, but due to institutional pressure.</p>
<p>“We believe that the cases of political prisoners, including [PTI founder] Imran Khan, should be judged on merit, not due to pressure from the authorities,” he emphasised. “If the trials are decided on merit and there is live coverage in the media, the nation will see what a drama this is.”</p>
<p>Qaiser continued: “Then there’s also a show in the assembly. The way it’s being controlled and the way its system is being run, as well as the way parliamentarians are being humiliated in front of Adiala Jail, is concerning. I have conducted some research into this matter and will bring it up before the National Assembly.</p>
<p>“According to our own rules, it is written that any MNA can inspect prisons. Is it just written down or can it actually be enforced?” he asked.</p>
<p>Details about the proposed constitutional amendment were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1868094">divulged</a> by sources following a meeting bet­ween Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PPP Chairperson Bila­wal Bhutto-Zardari in Lahore, atten­ded by key leaders from both parties on October 27 last year.</p>
<p>In contradicting statements, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had declared that the government was not considering any such legislation. At the same time, then-adviser to the PM on Law and Justice Barr­ister Aqeel Malik had hinted that the government could not only table “an amendment” in parliament, but would also be able to pass it.</p>
<p>In June this year, amid speculation in legal circles about the government planning to bring in the 27th Amendment, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915322">endorsed</a> the amendment while calling for broad-based judicial reforms, including the nationwide rotation of judges.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ImranKhanPTI/status/1940527676537679951" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X in July, PTI founder Imran wrote that rather than bringing in the amendment “through a sham parliament, it would be better to openly declare a monarchy, because what exists today is outright dictatorship, forcibly imposed on the country”.</p></p>

            <p><p>Two siblings were killed and their father injured in a road accident involving a dumper on Karachi’s Rashid Minhas Road near Lucky One Mall early Sunday, sparking mob violence and protests that disrupted traffic on key city routes, officials said.</p>
<p>In recent months, Karachi has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891767">rise</a> in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.</p>
<p>Central Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi said that around 3:15am, a dumper truck hit a motorcycle carrying a family, killing Mahnoor, 22, and her 14-year-old brother Ahmed Raza, and injuring their 48-year-old father, Shakir.</p>
<p>Following the incident, transporters staged a protest by blocking Rashid Minhas Road and the Superhighway near Sohrab Goth, causing traffic jams.</p>
<p>Both inbound and outbound roads on Rashid Minhas Road from Sohrab Goth towards Gulshan-i-Iqbal were closed, while traffic on Al-Asif Square towards the city and towards Hyderabad was also halted in both directions.</p>
<p>“A mob gathered and set fire to a total of seven dumpers on both sides of the road within the limits of Yusuf Plaza and Federal B Area police stations,” the SSP told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>“The police reached the spot to apprehend the driver and took the dumper in custody.”</p>
<p>The police cordoned off the area, set up diversions, and called fire tenders to put off the fire, Siddiqi said.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, police have arrested 14 suspects on charges of torching the dumpers, and more arrests are being made with the help of videos and technical evidence.”</p>
<p>Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told <em>Dawn.com</em> the siblings were brought dead to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, while their father was injured. Quoting relatives, she said the deceased girl was to get married soon.</p>
<p>Dr Summaiya said police brought in two drivers with critical injuries after they were beaten by the mob. She said the alleged errant driver was critically injured but stable, while a driver of another burnt dumper was also in critical condition with head injuries.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan confirmed that seven dumpers were torched near Lucky One Mall in Gulshan-i-Iqbal, adding that the fire tenders controlled the fire. “The heavy vehicles were badly damaged in arson acts,” he said.</p>
<p>Later, a statement from Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon’s office stated that negotiations between the transporters and the provincial government were successful, with the former agreeing to end their demonstration.</p>
<p>A delegation of transporters led by Haji Yousaf and Jam Alam met Memon at the Karachi Commissioner House.</p>
<p>Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, Transport Secretary Asad Zamin and the city’s police chief, Javed Alam Odho, were also present on the occasion.</p>
<p>The statement added that Memon expressed condolences for those killed in the accident and condemned the “violent acts” that took place afterwards.</p>

<p>“The Sindh government will prioritise resolving their (the transporters’) legitimate issues,” Memon was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>“Violence and vandalism are not the solution to these problems. We will work with all parties to solve the problems of the transport sector and ensure that these incidents do not happen again.”</p>
<p>Memon added that those who committed acts of vandalism and “took the law into their own hands” will be charged under anti-terrorism laws.</p>
<p>“Dumper owners will ensure that their trucks are fitted with cameras and trackers, while they will have insurance and truck drivers’ licences,” Memon was quoted as saying. “A committee will be formed to assess the losses incurred by transporters.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a high-speed trailer truck <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928663">crashed</a> in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA), injuring two people.</p>
<p>In July, a 59-year-old milk supplier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924967">was killed</a> when a dumper ran over his motorcycle in Karachi’s Saudabad.</p></p>
