            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925193/trump-says-5-jets-were-shot-down-in-india-pakistan-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says 5 jets were shot down in India-Pakistan conflict</strong></a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Friday that five jets were shot down during the recent India-Pakistan conflict that began after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, with the situation calming after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> in May.</p>
<p>Trump, who made his remarks at a dinner with some Republican US lawmakers at the White House, did not specify which side’s jets he was referring to.</p>
<p>Pakistan had said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">downed six</a> Indian planes after the latter carried out deadly attacks in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, while New Delhi had <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/india-shot-down-high-tech-jets-of-pakistan-confirms-air-marshal-bharti-938212" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed</a> it had downed “a few planes”.</p>
<p>“Something I’m very proud of [is that] we stopped a lot of wars. A lot of wars. And these were serious, serious wars; would have been going on,” Trump said.</p>
<p>“You had India-Pakistan that was going, and in fact, planes were being shot out of the air. Five, five, four or five, but I think five jets were shot down actually,” Trump said while talking about the India-Pakistan hostilities, without elaborating or providing further detail.</p>
<p>“It was getting worse and worse, wasn’t it? […] These are two serious nuclear countries and they were hitting each other. It seems like a new form of warfare; you saw it recently, when you looked at what we did in Iran when we knocked out their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920005">nuclear capability</a>, totally knocked out,” he said, referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">US strikes</a> on Iran’s three nuclear sites.</p>

<p>Pakistan said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downed five</a> Indian planes in air-to-air combat, later stating that figure <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">as six</a>. India’s highest-ranking general said in late May that India switched tactics after suffering losses in the air on the first day of hostilities and established an advantage before a ceasefire was announced three days later.</p>
<p>As New Delhi launched deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a>, which Islamabad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">denied</a>, the Pakistan Air Force downed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">five</a> Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>While India <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/india-shot-down-high-tech-jets-of-pakistan-confirms-air-marshal-bharti-938212" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed</a> downing jets, Islamabad has denied any losses of planes and said it hit <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910381">26 Indian targets</a> were hit after its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186#:~:text=The%20strikes%20targeted%20Nur%20Khan%20air%20base">three air bases</a> were targeted.</p>
<p>Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914608">repeatedly</a> said he prevented a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">nuclear war</a>” between Pakistan and India after Washington held talks with both sides, even <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920139">crediting</a> Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir for helping in it. India has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921534">differed</a> with Trump’s claims that it resulted from his intervention and his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911719">threats</a> to sever trade talks.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Most recently, on July 7, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923026/trumps-claim-on-averting-india-pakistan-war-gains-new-life">doubled down</a> on its narrative of Trump playing a central role in defusing tensions, despite India claiming otherwise.</p>
<p>Asked about Indian officials’ repeated <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912153">denials</a> of Trump’s role, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce avoided taking a position. “So many comments speak for themselves,” she said.</p>
<p>Pressed further, Bruce added, half in jest: “Everyone will have an opinion. That’s an opinion. Some opinions are wrong. Mine rarely are, but other people’s opinions can be wrong.”</p>
<p>Trump’s statements stand in contrast to India’s official position, which maintains that New Delhi acted independently during the May crisis and that Washington did not mediate. Trump’s remarks support Pakistan’s view that quiet US diplomacy — and direct intervention from the White House — helped calm tensions.</p>
<p>India’s position has been that New Delhi and Islamabad must resolve their problems directly and with no outside involvement.</p>

<p>India is an increasingly important US partner in Washington’s effort to counter China’s influence in Asia, while Pakistan is a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524">strong partner</a> in counterterrorism.</p>
<p>The April attack in Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">killed 26 men</a> and sparked heavy fighting between the nuclear-armed Asian neighbours in the latest escalation of a decades-old rivalry.</p>
<p>New Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">strongly denied</a> responsibility while calling for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral</a> investigation. Washington condemned the attack but did not directly blame Islamabad.</p></p>

            <p><p>Local mountaineer Iftikhar Hussain lost his life while a foreign climber sustained injuries when their four-member international expedition team was caught in an avalanche that struck the K2 peak on Friday.</p>
<p>K2, standing at 8,611 metres above sea level, is the second-highest peak in the world, attracting a host of local and foreign tourists. Last summer, Gilgit-Baltistan authorities issued a total of 175 permits to climbers aspiring to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1848754">conquer</a> the mountain, despite the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1848345">treacherous</a> climb and harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>The senior vice president of the Alpine Club of Pakistan (ACP), Karrar Haidri, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that at approximately 12:30pm on Friday, an avalanche struck Camp 1 on K2, located about 500m above the base camp. Four climbers were caught in the avalanche.</p>
<p>“A foreign climber sustained minor injuries, while two others successfully returned to the Advance Base Camp,: Haidri said in a statement. However, high-altitude porter Iftikhar Hussain from Sadpara in Skardu lost his life in the incident.</p>
<p>Hussain’s body has since been recovered and brought down to the base camp, the ACP official added.</p>
<p>The other climbers were Dawa Finjo Sherpa and Dawa Geljen Sherpa from Nepal, and high-altitude porter Niaz Ali from Skardu. The international team was returning from Camp 2 during their rotation for the summit at the time of the incident.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The expedition outfitter submitted a formal request to ACP President Major General Irfan Arshad and Askari Aviation for a helicopter operation to repatriate the deceased following the incident.</p>
<p>The request was approved by the army’s General Headquarters on humanitarian grounds. According to Haidri, the body will be airlifted by the Army Aviation and transported to Sadpara in Skardu today.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a tourist from the Czech Republic, Klára Kolouchová, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921892">died</a> after falling into a ravine at the Nanga Parbat base camp in GB.</p>
<p>Kolouchová, 46, was part of a multinational expedition atte­m­pting to summit the mountain. Her health reportedly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922204/search-underway-to-recover-body-of-czech-climber-at-nanga-parbat">deteriorated</a> at Camp 4, forcing her to abort the climb and begin her de­­s­­­cent with Nepali Sherpa Tara­man Tamang.</p></p>

            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump sued media magnate Rupert Murdoch and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> for at least $10 billion on Friday over the publication of a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796?mod=article_inline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bombshell article</a> on his friendship with the infamous alleged sex trafficker of underage girls, Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>The defamation lawsuit, filed in federal court in Miami, saw the 79-year-old Republican hitting back at a scandal threatening to cause serious political damage.</p>
<p>“We have just filed a powerhouse lawsuit against everyone involved in publishing the false, malicious, defamatory, fake news ‘article’ in the useless ‘rag’ that is <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>,” Trump posted on Truth Social late on Friday.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The <em>Journal</em> reported on Thursday that in 2003, the then-real estate magnate wrote a suggestive birthday letter to Epstein, illustrated with a naked woman and alluding to a shared “secret”.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, which also names two reporters, the <em>Dow Jones</em> corporation and Murdoch’s parent company <em>News Corp</em> as defendants, claims that no such letter exists and that the paper intended to malign Trump with a story that has now been viewed by hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>“And given the timing of the defendants’ article, which shows their malicious intent behind it, the overwhelming financial and reputational harm suffered by President Trump will continue to multiply,” it said.</p>
<p><em>Dow Jones</em>, the <em>Journal</em>‘s longtime publisher, responded to Trump’s libel suit on Friday, saying that it is standing by the story.</p>
<p>“We have full confidence in the rigour and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit,” a <em>Dow Jones</em> spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#alleged-cover-up" id="alleged-cover-up" title="Permalink"></a>Alleged cover-up</h2>
<p>In another bid to dampen outrage among his own supporters about an alleged government cover-up of Epstein’s activities and 2019 death, Trump ordered US Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the unsealing of grand jury testimony from the prosecution against the disgraced financier.</p>
<p>In a filing in New York, Bondi cited “extensive public interest” for the unusual request to release what is typically secret testimony.</p>

<p>Epstein, a longtime friend of Trump and multiple high-profile men, was found hanging dead in a New York prison cell while awaiting trial on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1492768/us-financier-epstein-arrested-on-sex-charges">charges</a> that he sexually exploited dozens of underage girls at his homes in New York and Florida.</p>
<p>The case sparked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924612">conspiracy theories</a>, especially among Trump’s far-right voters, about an alleged international cabal of wealthy pedophiles. Epstein’s death — declared a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1499139">suicide</a> — before he could face trial supercharged the narrative.</p>
<p>When Trump returned to power for a second term this January, his supporters clamoured for revelations about Epstein’s supposed list of clients. But Bondi issued an official <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922841/sex-offender-jeffrey-epstein-died-by-suicide-did-not-have-client-list-us-govt-memo">memo</a> this month declaring there was no such list.</p>
<p>The discontent in Trump’s “Make America Great Again” base poses a rare challenge to the Republican’s control of the political narrative in the United States.</p>
<p>It remained unclear whether a court would authorise the unsealing of the grand jury testimony.</p>
<p>But even if such material were made public, there is no assurance that it would shed much, if any, light on the main questions raised in the conspiracy theories — particularly the existence and possible contents of an Epstein client list.</p>
<p>Asked on Friday by reporters if he would pursue the broader release of information related to the case, Trump did not answer.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#naked-woman-and-signature" id="naked-woman-and-signature" title="Permalink"></a>Naked woman and signature</h2>
<p>Trump was close with Epstein for years, and the two were photographed and videotaped together at parties, although there has never been evidence of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> article published late on Thursday was damaging because it indicated a shared interest in sex.</p>
<p>The <em>Journal</em> reported that Trump had wished Epstein a happy 50th birthday in 2003 with a “bawdy” letter, part of an album of messages from rich and well-known figures.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Journal</em>, the Trump letter contained the outline of a naked woman, apparently drawn with a marker, and had the future president’s signature “Donald” mimicking pubic hair. It ends, according to the newspaper, with “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret”.</p>
<p>Trump reacted in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1946224789170917875" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">series</a> of <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1946009907553051105" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">furious</a> social media posts, saying, “It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”</p>

<p>“I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of women,” he said.</p>
<p>US media has published multiple drawings done by Trump in the past, with several dating to the early 2000s when he used his celebrity status to donate sketches for charity.</p></p>
