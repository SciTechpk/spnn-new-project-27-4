                <h2>KP governor administers oath to opposition MPAs</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Twenty-five MPAs-elect of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa opposition were sworn into office on Sunday after KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi administered their oaths.</p>
<p>The oath-taking issue has risen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1831068">once again</a> after the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925091/ptis-senate-poll-campaign-beset-by-political-wrangling">redistribution</a> of reserved seats in the wake of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920721/ptis-hopes-dashed-as-rivals-set-to-receive-reserved-seats">verdict</a> by the Supreme Court‚Äôs constitutional bench that effectively took away the seats <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">from the PTI</a> and declared other political parties eligible for them.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Kundi delivered a press conference following the swearing-in ceremony, where he highlighted that the government reneged on an agreement it had made with the opposition.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA formula of 6-5 was agreed upon and our opposition candidates withdrew,‚Äù the KP governor said. ‚ÄúAll of them agreed that they will contest five seats ‚Äî two will be contested by the JUI-F, two by the PPP, and the PML-N will for one.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe PTI founder [Imran Khan] then made a decision, and their information secretary said, ‚Äòour Senate candidates are not in our control‚Äô. If your Senate candidates are not in control, then how are the MPAs-elect in your control?‚Äù Kundi asked.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe point is, we had a deal in place, we had an agreement. But their members were not completely on board.‚Äù</p>
<p>The KP governor highlighted that there are between 30 and 35 independent members of the assembly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have spoken with them, and we are hopeful that we can move towards 6-5. As soon as the leader of the opposition briefs us, we will have a strategy ready for tonight and then we will contest tomorrow‚Äôs [Senate] elections,‚Äù Kundi said.</p>
<p>Earlier, the opposition MPAs could not take their oaths on reserved seats due to a lack of quorum in the provincial assembly.</p>
<p>At today‚Äôs assembly session, which had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924631">called</a> by the KP government, the 25 MPAs-elect on reserved seats for women and minorities were expected to be sworn in. The session had assumed importance as the non-administration of oaths could lead to the postponement of Senate polls <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922230">set for tomorrow</a> for 11 seats from the legislature.</p>
<p>The session was scheduled for 9am but began with a delay of two hours and 20 minutes, with KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati presiding over it. As soon as the session started, MPA Sher Ali Afridi of the ruling PTI pointed out a lack of quorum, leading to the session being adjourned till July 24.</p>
<p>Upon Afridi‚Äôs remarks, PML-N‚Äôs Sobia Shahid contended that a lack of quorum could not be pointed out between the recitation of the Holy Quran and the oath-taking. ‚ÄúYou (KP government) have been making a joke out of this province for a year,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>Swati asked her to point out the legal provisions for her argument instead of giving a speech.</p>
<div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0;"></div>
<p>Ahmad Karim Kundi, the PPP‚Äôs parliamentary leader in the KP Assembly, also spoke on the floor of the assembly, backing Shahid. He asserted that the administration of oath was ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù, citing Article 255 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>The speaker also asked Ahmad to state the relevant provisions requiring so and issued a ruling to count the MPAs in attendance, at which it emerged that only 25 lawmakers were present.</p>
<p>Addressing PML-N‚Äôs Dr Ibadullah, Swati said: ‚ÄúOpposition leader <em>sahib</em>, there are 25 members present. The quorum is incomplete; ring the bells.‚Äù</p>
<p>The opposition lawmakers then came to the front of the speaker‚Äôs dais to protest. Swati then adjourned the session, saying: ‚ÄúAs the quorum is incomplete, the sitting is adjourned till 2pm on Thursday, July 24.‚Äù</p>

<p>The ECP had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924686/jui-f-loses-two-ppp-one-seat-in-kp-assembly#:~:text=reserved%20for%20women.-,ECP%20approaches%20PHC,-The%20Peshawar%20High">approached</a> the Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Wednesday, requesting that Chief Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah appoint a person to administer the oath to the notified MPAs-elect under Article 255(2) (oath of office) of the Constitution.</p>
<p>Subsequently, after today‚Äôs session, the PHC registrar issued an order by Justice Shah that accepted the ECP request and nominated Governor Kundi to administer the oaths ‚Äúat the earliest‚Äù.</p>
<p>It stressed that the governor should ensure that the oaths are ‚Äúadministered in the manner prescribed and proper record be maintained in accordance with the official procedure‚Äù. The judge also directed the KP Assembly secretary to facilitate the newly notified MPAs to sign the Roll of the Members.</p>
<p>A notification by the KP Governor‚Äôs secretariat, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, said Kundi would administer the oaths to the MPAs-elect at 6pm today.</p>
<p>The ECP has <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ECP_Pakistan/status/1946879928189755772" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">changed</a> the timing for the Senate elections from 9am to 11am.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, the ECP had issued a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ECP_Pakistan/status/1946877503932338301" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> announcing that Kundi will administer the oaths at 9am tomorrow at Governor House. It ordered KP Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed, the chief secretary and the Federal Constabulary IG to ensure foolproof security arrangements for the ceremony.</p>
<p>Speaking outside the KP Assembly after the session, Ibadullah said he would approach the courts against the delay in the oath-taking, assailing the PTI government.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDo not hand over whatever political space is left to others,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNo one can stop these oaths [‚Ä¶] at which forum will they (PTI) challenge it?‚Äù the PML-N lawmaker said.</p>
<p>Ibadullah stressed that the opposition‚Äôs women and minority members had not had representation in the Senate for one and a half years, since the 2024 general elections.</p>
<p>Terming the PTI ‚Äúpolitically immature‚Äù, he pointed out that it was the PTI government‚Äôs ‚Äúresponsibility‚Äù to ensure a proper quorum, given their majority in the KP Assembly.</p>
<p>Before the assembly session, the PTI held a parliamentary party meeting, in which it decided that none of its MPAs would attend the proceedings, calling the oaths a ‚Äútheft of its right‚Äù.</p>

                <h2>4 terrorists killed in Balochistan‚Äôs Kalat operation: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Security forces killed four terrorists during an operation in Balochistan‚Äôs Kalat district, the military‚Äôs media wing said in a statement on Sunday.</p>
<p>There has been an increase in the frequency of attacks against security forces in Balochistan in recent times. Earlier this week, three people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924597">killed</a> and seven others were injured as a passenger bus was fired upon in Kalat.</p>
<p>The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that the intelligence-based operation took place on the night of July 19-20, upon the ‚Äúreported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, <em>Fitna al Hindustan</em>‚Äù.</p>
<p>In May this year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525#:~:text=The%20government%20has%20designated%20all%20terrorist%20organisations%20in%20Balochistan%20as%20Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan,%20state%20media%20PTV%20News%20reported.">designated</a> all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna-Al-Hindu¬≠stan</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring the conduct of [the] operation, [our] own forces effectively engaged the terrorists‚Äô location, and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>According to the ISPR, weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from the dead terrorists, who were actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvnews/urdunewsdetail/10614" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PTV News</a></em> reported that security forces seized a <em>Fitna Al Hindustan</em> flag as well.</p>
<p>‚Äú[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation‚Äôs unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,‚Äù the statement concluded.</p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to security forces for killing the four terrorists in a statement from his office.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe security forces are always determined to eradicate terrorism,‚Äù the president was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúTerrorism will be defeated at all costs with national unity.‚Äù</p>
<p>The statement added that operations against terrorism will continue.</p>
<p>‚Äú<em>Fitna Al Hindustan</em> will be pursued till the end,‚Äù the president was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>On Saturday, a senior officer belonging to the security forces was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925314/security-official-martyred-in-quetta-blast">martyred</a> in a bomb attack at the Western Bypass area, according to officials.</p>
<p>Police said a magnetic explosive device was attached to the officer‚Äôs vehicle, which exploded in the Jabl-i-Noor area, a locality on the outskirts of Quetta.</p>
<p>CCTV footage from a nearby camera showed a motorcyclist passing close to the vehicle moments before the explosion. He reportedly attached the explosive device to the driver‚Äôs side door. A few seconds later, the blast took place.</p>
<p>Pakistan ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on Friday, a Balochistan Constabulary acting deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and a constable were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925001">martyred</a> and two others suffered injuries when unidentified gunmen opened fire on their vehicle on the National Highway in the Mastung district, provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind said.</p>
<p>According to Rind‚Äôs statement, ‚ÄúA police convoy coming from Kalat to Quetta was targeted by terrorists.</p>
<p>‚ÄúActing DSP Inspector Abdul Razzaq and Constable Raza Muhammad Jam were martyred in the attack, while Constable Taj Muhammad and Constable Khursheed Ahmed were injured,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Rind further said that the dead bodies and injured personnel were transferred to Quetta by helicopter.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTerrorist incidents are a manifestation of the despair of the enemies of peace. The morale of the people of Balochistan and the security forces cannot be diminished,‚Äù the spokesperson said.</p></p>
