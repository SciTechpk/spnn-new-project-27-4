                <h2>Trump says Pakistani representatives coming to US next week for trade talks</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump said on Friday that representatives from Pakistan are coming to the United States next week as Islamabad seeks to make a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914442/pakistan-us-open-formal-talks-on-reciprocal-tariffs">deal on tariffs</a>.</p>
<p>Pakistan faces a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904017">potential 29 per cent tariff</a> on its exports to the US due to a $3 billion trade surplus with the world‚Äôs biggest economy, under tariffs announced by Washington last month on countries around the world.</p>
<p>Pakistan‚Äôs formal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914329">negotiations</a> with the United States on reciprocal tariffs started earlier in the day with a phone call between Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, a press release from the finance ministry said.</p>
<p>Trump said he would have no interest in making a deal with Pakistan or India, if they were to engage in war with each other.</p>
<p>The developments follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi‚Äôs allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam.</p>
<p>New Delhi, based on the allegations, launched a series of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> in Pakistan in early May, killing civilians. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>. After intercepting drones sent by India on May 8 and tit-for-tat strikes on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs you know, we‚Äôre very close making a deal with India,‚Äù Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews after departing Air Force One.</p>

<p>Indian Trade Minister Piyush Goyal visited Washington recently to advance trade talks, with both sides aiming to sign an interim agreement by early July.</p>
<p>India faces 26pc tariffs on shipments to the US.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> reported last week that India is likely to allow US firms to bid for contracts worth over $50 billion, mainly from federal entities, as it negotiates a trade deal with Washington.</p>
<p>The increase in trade tariffs on Pakistani products, amongst a global tariff announcement by US President Donald Trump, which were paused, could have a devastating impact on Pakistan‚Äôs important exports and serve as a wake-up call for diversification, according to a state-owned think tank.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics warned that these tariffs could have a ‚Äúdevastating impact‚Äù on the country‚Äôs export sector, translating into an annual loss of $1.1-1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810/trumps-tariffs-stoke-global-trade-war-as-china-eu-hit-back">tariffs</a>, implemented on April 2, introduced a 10 per cent baseline tariff for every country the US trades with, and additional reciprocal tariffs on rivals and allies alike.</p></p>

‚Ä¢ Says millions of lives must not be held hostage to ‚Äònarrow political gains‚Äô<br />
‚Ä¢ Terms 2022 floods a consequence of glacial melt<br />
‚Ä¢ Tajik president wants global plan to save melting glaciers</p>
<p>DUSHANBE: Rejecting the ‚Äúweaponisation of water‚Äù, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday warned that Pakistan would not allow India to cross the ‚Äúred line‚Äù by suspending the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">Indus Waters Treaty</a>, describing any such move as a reckless act that would jeopardise millions of lives for narrow political gain.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs unilateral and illegal decision to hold in abeyance the Indus Water Treaty, which governs the sharing of the Indus Basin‚Äôs water, is deeply regrettable,‚Äù the prime mi¬≠n¬≠ister said while addr¬≠essing the High-Level Int¬≠e¬≠rnational Conference on Glaciers Preservation. ‚ÄúMillions of lives must not be held hostage to narrow political gains, and Pakistan will not allow this. We will never allow the red line to be crossed.‚Äù</p>
<p>The three-day conference, held in Tajikistan‚Äôs capital Dushanbe from May 29-31, brought toge¬≠ther over 2,500 delegates from 80 UN member states and 70 international orga¬≠ni¬≠sations, including prime ministers, vice presidents, ministers, and UN assistant secretaries-general.</p>

<p>Hosted by the government of Tajikistan in collaboration with the United Nations, Unesco, World Meteorological Organisa¬≠tion (WMO), and the Asian Development Bank, the summit aimed to push forward the agenda for glacier protection and international climate cooperation.</p>
<p>In his address, Prime Minister Shehbaz touched all the relevant issues, including glacial preservation, Pakistan‚Äôs climate vulnerability, the 2022 floods in Pakistan, global climate action and responsibility, scientific projections on glacial melt, weaponisation of water, and a call to protect nature and humanity‚Äôs shared destiny.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe world today bears fresh scars from the use of conventional weapons in Gaza that have left deep wounds. As if that were not enough, we are now witnessing an alarming new low ‚Äî the weaponisation of water,‚Äù he told participants.</p>
<p>The 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly, through a resolution, declared 2025 as the International Year of Glaciers Preservation, designated 21 March as the annual World Day for Glaciers beginning in 2025, and assigned the government of Tajikistan to host the inaugural international conference on the subject that year.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz reminded the international audience that Pakistan, with over 13,000 glaciers, was among the countries most vulnerable to climate change. These glaciers contribute nearly half of the annual flows in the Indus River system, which sustains Pakistan‚Äôs civilisation, culture and economy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe five great rivers that shape our geographical landscape ‚Äî Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej ‚Äî all depend on the stability of glacial systems. This makes Pakistan one of the most vulnerable countries to any climatic changes that impact glaciers,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>He told the international gathering that Pakistan had faced the peril of glacial melt in the form of devastating floods in 2022, which destroyed millions of acres of standing crops and hundreds of thousands of houses and infrastructure, despite Pakistan‚Äôs only less than half a per cent contribution to the total world emissions.</p>
<p>Referring to the ‚Äúsobering‚Äù scientific projections, he highlighted that glacial melt in our region was expected to accelerate flooding in the coming decades, followed by a drastic decline in river flows as glaciers recede further.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese changes threaten our fragile ecosystem. As we inch closer to these grim new realities, we must heed the alarm bells, deflection signs of haunting consequences ‚Äî lost livelihoods, displaced families and deep chaos,‚Äù he warned.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Highlighting Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to shared responsibility and collective action, he called for enhanced global climate action to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe developed countries must meet their climate financial commitments without any delay and with a balanced focus on adaptation and mitigation as well as loss and damage,‚Äù the prime minister said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAdequate funding for climate resilience, infrastructure and overcoming financing gaps remains critical for climate-vulnerable countries. Investment must be made in early warning systems and disaster preparedness and management,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p><strong>Measures to protect glaciers</strong></p>
<p>President Emomali Rahmon of Tajikistan, co-hosting the international conference, called on the world to take urgent and coordinated action to safeguard glaciers, warning that their rapid melting poses a global crisis.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI want to note clearly that glaciers preservation is not just a problem of countries with glaciers but rather a global crisis that deserves the immediate attention of the international community,‚Äù President Rahmon said.</p>
<p>He urged comprehensive monitoring and scientific research to better understand glacier dynamics, their role in ecosystems and their socio-economic impacts.</p>
<p>He suggested that countries with the ability to collect accurate data on the state of glaciers, particularly through satellites, should establish a regular exchange of information with countries that lack such capabilities.</p>
<p>The president called for implementing collective actions to address the socio-economic consequences of glacier melting, including its impact on accessing water, ensuring food security, producing electricity, and protecting cultural and natural heritage.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe must make every effort to ensure the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and take the necessary measures to prevent an increase in global temperature,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Tajikistan, with 93 per cent of its territory covered by mountains, is home to the largest glaciers in Central Asia. ‚ÄúSo far, 1,300 out of 14,000 glaciers have completely melted. These glaciers supply 60pc of the region‚Äôs drinking water,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>President Rahmon stressed that climate change had already caused the loss of about a third of mountain glaciers around the world and this process is not just an environmental problem but is closely related to many aspects of human life. ‚ÄúTajikistan‚Äôs glaciers are vital not just for regional rivers, but for climate stability worldwide,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Citing the Fedchenko Glacier, one of the world‚Äôs largest continental glaciers, President Rahmon said it could yield thousands of years of climate data crucial for future strategies. He called on all countries to support Tajikistan‚Äôs proposal to develop a global preservation framework under the United Nations.</p>
