                <h2>New York poised for first Muslim mayor as Cuomo concedes to Mamdani</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old state lawmaker and self-described democratic socialist, was poised on Tuesday to win New York City‚Äôs Democratic mayoral primary in a surprising upset over former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p>
<p>In brief remarks to supporters, Cuomo, 67, who had been seeking a political comeback four years after resigning amid sexual harassment allegations, said he had called Mamdani to congratulate him.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTonight is his night,‚Äù Cuomo said while conceding the race to Mamdani.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Mamdani, who entered the campaign as a virtual unknown, was ahead of Cuomo 43.5 per cent to 36.4pc with nearly 95pc of ballot scanners reporting, according to the city‚Äôs elections board. Nine other Democratic candidates trailed far behind.</p>
<p>The outcome will not be final until next week, due to New York‚Äôs ranked-choice system that allows citizens to pick up to five candidates in order of preference.</p>
<p>But Mamdani‚Äôs lead in Tuesday‚Äôs preliminary results appeared too large for Cuomo, or any other candidate, to overcome, particularly since the third-place finisher on Tuesday, City Comptroller Brad Lander, encouraged his supporters to list Mamdani second.</p>
<p>The race was seen as an early read on the direction Democrats believe the party should take five months into Republican President Donald Trump‚Äôs tumultuous second term.</p>
<p>Their differences were clear: Cuomo, a moderate backed by the establishment who served a decade as governor, or Mamdani, a progressive newcomer who promised a break with the past.</p>
<p>Mamdani will likely be the favourite in November‚Äôs general election in a city where Democrats dominate. The current mayor, Democrat Eric Adams, will also appear on the November ballot as an independent, but a series of corruption scandals and his perceived ties to Trump have weakened his standing.</p>
<p>The Republican candidate is Curtis Sliwa, a radio host best known as the founder of the Guardian Angels anti-crime patrol, who lost to Adams in 2021.</p>
<p>For some voters, Mamdani represented a chance to usher in a new era for the party.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs time for somebody young, a person of colour, something different,‚Äù Ignacio Tambunting, a 28-year-old actor, told a <em>Reuters</em> reporter outside a polling station in Manhattan after putting Mamdani atop his ballot.</p>
<p>Another voter, Leah Johanson, said she listed Mamdani first even though she was concerned he was too liberal. But she did not rank Cuomo.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo. God, no,‚Äù said Johanson, 39, who voted on Tuesday in Queens, where Mamdani lives. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna vote for a man who is credibly accused of molesting women.‚Äù</p>
<p>Cuomo has denied the harassment accusations, which he has characterised as ill-conceived attempts to be affectionate or humorous.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#self-described-democratic-socialist" id="self-described-democratic-socialist" title="Permalink"></a>Self-described democratic socialist</h2>
<p>Born in Uganda to a family of Indian descent, Mamdani, who would be the city‚Äôs first Muslim mayor, has a history of pro-Palestinian activism.</p>
<p>He was elected to a state assembly seat in New York‚Äôs Queens borough and has garnered the support of US Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, two prominent progressives.</p>
<p>Cuomo accused Mamdani of lacking the experience required, while Mamdani attacked Cuomo over the harassment allegations.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Cuomo, who emerged as a vocal critic of Trump during his first term as president, won the endorsements of former President Bill Clinton and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.</p>
<p>In ranked voting, the last-place candidate is eliminated after each round, and their votes are redistributed to the second choice marked on the ballots of their supporters. The process is repeated until one candidate achieves 50pc of the total.</p>
<p>Mamdani seems likely to expand his lead when the additional counts are conducted, after he and Lander endorsed one another and urged their supporters to rank the other as their second choice.</p>
<p>Lander, who was the first choice on 11.6pc of ballots counted on Tuesday, made national headlines last week when he was briefly <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reutersconnect.com/all?search=all%3AL1N3SK0XL&amp;linkedFromStory=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">detained</a> while escorting a defendant out of an immigration court.</p></p>

                <h2>Trump says China can buy Iranian oil, but urges it to purchase US crude</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that China can continue to purchase Iranian oil after Israel and Iran agreed to a ceasefire, a move that the White House clarified did not indicate a relaxation of US sanctions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúChina can now continue to purchase oil from Iran. Hopefully, they will be purchasing plenty from the US, also,‚Äù Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114738521695017472" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a post on Truth Social, just days after he ordered US bombings of three Iranian nuclear sites.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch  ">
        <div class="media__item  "><img alt="" src="https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/251102334967ff8.png" /></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Trump was drawing attention to no attempts by Iran so far to close the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919557">Strait of Hormuz</a> to oil tankers, as a closure would have been hard for China, the world‚Äôs top importer of Iranian oil, a senior White House official told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe president continues to call on China and all countries to import our state-of-the-art oil rather than import Iranian oil in violation of US sanctions,‚Äù the official said.</p>
<p>After the ceasefire announcement, Trump‚Äôs comments on China were another bearish signal for oil prices, which fell nearly 6 per cent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Any relaxation of sanctions enforcement on Iran would mark a US policy shift after Trump said in February he was re-imposing maximum pressure on Iran, aiming to drive its oil exports to zero, over its nuclear program and funding of militants across the Middle East.</p>
<p>Trump imposed waves of Iran-related sanctions on several of China‚Äôs independent ‚Äúteapot‚Äù refineries and port terminal operators for purchases of Iranian oil.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äôs greenlight for China to keep buying Iranian oil reflects a return to lax enforcement standards,‚Äù said Scott Modell, a former CIA officer, now CEO of Rapidan Energy Group.</p>
<p>In addition to not enforcing sanctions, Trump could suspend or waive sanctions imposed by executive order or under authorities a president is granted in laws passed by Congress.</p>
<p>Trump will likely not waive sanctions ahead of coming rounds of US-Iran nuclear talks, Modell said. The measures provide leverage given Tehran‚Äôs demand that any deal includes lifting them permanently.</p>
<p>Jeremy Paner, a partner at law firm Hughes Hubbard &amp; Reed, said if Trump chooses to suspend Iran oil-related sanctions, it would require lots of work between agencies.</p>
<p>The US Treasury would need to issue licences, and the State Department would have to issue waivers, which require Congressional notification.</p>
<p>Oil traders and analysts in Asia said they did not expect Trump‚Äôs comments to have a near-term impact on Chinese purchases of oil from either Iran or the US.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Iranian oil accounts for roughly 13.6pc of China‚Äôs oil purchases this year, with the discounted barrels providing a lifeline to margin-squeezed independent refineries. US oil accounts for just 2pc of China‚Äôs imports, and Beijing‚Äôs 10pc tariffs on US oil deter further purchases.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#pressure-on-china" id="pressure-on-china" title="Permalink"></a>Pressure on China</h2>
<p>China has long opposed what it has called Washington‚Äôs ‚Äúabuse of illegal unilateral sanctions‚Äù. China‚Äôs embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump‚Äôs post.</p>
<p>Larger purchases of Iranian oil by China and other consumers could upset US ally Saudi Arabia, the world‚Äôs largest oil exporter.</p>
<p>The impact of US sanctions on Iran‚Äôs exports, however, has been limited since Trump‚Äôs first administration when he cracked down harder on Tehran.</p>
<p>Trump has ‚Äúflashed the Glock‚Äù this year with sanctions on Chinese trading companies and terminals, Modell said, referring to revealing a gun. But the results have been far more ‚Äúminimum pressure‚Äù than maximum, Modell added.</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters that Trump had signalled what he wanted to happen and that his administration is focused on delivering that. She would not say what the process would entail.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut clearly we are focused on making sure that (the) guiding hand of President Trump prevails and moves this government forward, so we will have to wait and see when it comes to what that ends up looking like,‚Äù Bruce said.</p></p>
