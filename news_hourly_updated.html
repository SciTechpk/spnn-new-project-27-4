                <h2>Utility Stores Corporation shutters down operations at all outlets</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Utility Stores Corporation (USC) on Thursday formally ceased operations, in compliance with the July 31 deadline <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924725">established</a> earlier this month to close the state-owned enterprise (SOE).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924725#:~:text=Established%20in%201971,%20USC%20is%20a%20state-owned%20enterprise%20tasked%20with%20supplying%20essential%20commodities%20at%20subsidised%20rates,%20primarily%20targeting%20low-income%20households.%20It%20currently%20operates%20over%204,000%20retail%20outlets%20nationwide.">Established</a> in 1971, USC was an SOE tasked with supplying essential commodities at subsidised rates, primarily targeting low-income households. It operated over 4,000 retail outlets nationwide.</p>
<p>According to a USC notification from the Ministry of Industries and Production, available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, the decision was taken in compliance with directives issued by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on June 28 and a meeting of the board of directors earlier this month.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll the sales and purchases at utility stores have been closed with effect from July 31, except shifting of stock from stores to warehouses and returned to vendors and handing-taking of stores‚Äô inventories,‚Äù the notification reads, instructing strict compliance with the order.</p>
<p>Additionally, sales through the business-management suite Odoo have been permanently discontinued as of today, a second USC notification read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll point of sale systems connected with Odoo will be rendered inactive across all stores effective July 31,‚Äù the notice read. ‚ÄúNo store in charge or designated official is authorised to conduct any sales through the Odoo system after this date. Additionally, no procurement transactions shall be initiated through Odoo either.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the notification, the Odoo system will only be utilised for inventory reconciliation and record maintenance and any attempt to carry out sales or purchase transactions after today will be treated as ‚Äúa serious violation of official policy‚Äù.</p>
<p>It added that ‚Äúany employee found conducting or facilitating sales or purchases through Odoo after July 31 shall be held personally responsible, and strict disciplinary action will be initiated under USC rules.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the finance ministry‚Äôs Federal SOE Performance Overview for the first half of FY25, USC posted a loss of Rs4.1 billion over six months, with cumulative losses rising to Rs15.5bn ‚Äî highlighting persistent structural and operational challenges.</p>
<p>In January, the federal cabinet <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1887083">formed</a> a high-level committee to develop a comprehensive strategy for the prompt shutdown of USC operations nationwide. The committee was tasked with determining a plan for the immediate closure of the USC, as well as arrangements for placing permanent USC employees in the surplus pool or absorption against existing vacancies in other federal government organisations.</p>
<p>The National Assembly‚Äôs Standing Committee on Privatisation was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906202">informed</a> in April that under the restructuring plan of USC, 1,203 Utility Stores were closed while 2,237 employees were laid off.</p></p>

                <h2>May 9 riots: Faisalabad ATC sentences Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz and other PTI leaders to 10 years in jail</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Faisalabad on Thursday sentenced PTI leaders, including Omar Ayub Khan, Shibli Faraz, Hamid Raza, and Zartaj Gul Wazir, to 10 years of imprisonment for their involvement in the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1752003">PTI supporters</a>, protesting the party founder Imran Khan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">arrest</a>, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">attacking</a> the Lahore corps commander‚Äôs residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.</p>
<p>Out of 185 PTI workers accused, 108 have been sentenced by the court today.  PTI‚Äôs Member of the Provincial Assembly (MPA), Junaid Afzal Sahi, was sentenced to three years in prison. Meanwhile, MPA Khayal Ahmad Kastro, Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Zain Qureshi, and former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry have been acquitted in the cases.</p>
<p>Reacting to the development, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the party will challenge the decision in the high courts.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media in Islamabad today, Gohar said: ‚ÄúWe will raise the issue with PTI Founder Imran Khan on the future course of action regarding whether we should return to the parliament or launch a movement.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that the ‚Äúpolitical cases against PTI members were baseless‚Äù, adding that the PTI believed in running the system instead of believing in extremism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe do not believe in violence or incitement in politics. Those who have been convicted today do not believe in politics of violence.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to a copy of the court order ‚Äî available with <em>Dawn.com</em> ‚Äî ‚Äúthe prosecution has successfully proved its case without any shadow of doubt‚Äù against 17 of the accused, including the opposition leaders and Zartaj Gul. They were sentenced to:</p>

<p>Meanwhile, 77 accused were acquitted because the prosecution ‚Äúmiserably failed to prove the alleged offence‚Äù.</p>
<p>In a post on X, the PTI condemned the sentences in the strongest terms and branded the cases ‚Äúfalse, fabricated, and politically motivated‚Äù, adding that the opposition leaders in both houses were sentenced to prevent the party‚Äôs mass mobilisation on August 5.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThrough this decision, six of our National Assembly members, three Punjab Assembly members and one senator have been sentenced,‚Äù the party stated. ‚ÄúThis decision is not only a clear violation of the Constitution and the law but also another dark stain on the face of justice.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe judiciary‚Äôs continuous transformation into a rubber stamp at the behest of the state system, issuing such grave verdicts one after another under political pressure without transparent trials, evidence, cross-examination of witnesses, or the right to defence, is a dangerous trend that is completely undermining the credibility of the judicial system,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>The PTI added that this is the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù opposition leaders in both houses of parliament have been sentenced ‚Äúsolely based on their loyalty to Imran Khan‚Äôs political narrative, public representation, and constitutional struggle‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe real purpose of these decisions is not to deliver legal justice but to make a concerted effort to prevent the public protest scheduled for August 5, which was announced by Imran Khan himself,‚Äù the party claimed.</p>

<p>‚ÄúToday‚Äôs sentences and the warrants issued against several other leaders this morning are all links in the chain of fear that the state system harbours toward Imran Khan‚Äôs peaceful public movement.‚Äù</p>
<p>Moreover, the party branded the sentences ‚Äúpart of a systematic plan aimed at suppressing the public awakening and political consciousness emerging under Imran Khan‚Äôs leadership‚Äù.</p>
<p>However, the PTI wrote that these sentences only ignited their resolve, ahead of the protests slated for August 5.</p>
<p>‚ÄúImran Khan‚Äôs vision lives in our hearts, and our loyalty to it remains unwavering.
Our leaders and workers are ready for every sacrifice, because we believe that only those nations survive the darkness of oppression that resist,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan deplored the mass sentencing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile those involved in violence must be held accountable, the use of anti-terror laws to try civilians raises serious due-process concerns and is symptomatic of the continued erosion of democratic values. We reiterate that all those accused must receive fair, transparent trials in civilian courts and urge the state to refrain from using draconian laws to stifle political dissent.‚Äù</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914290">May</a>, an ATC in Islamabad sentenced PTI members, including MNA Abdul Latif, to 27 years of imprisonment for attacking a police station during the May 9 riots.</p>
