            <p><p>President Asif Ali Zardari has given his assent to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920303">Finance Act 2025</a>, which outlines the budget for the upcoming fiscal year with an outlay of Rs17.57 trillion, it emerged on Monday.</p>
<p>According to a gazette notification dated June 29, available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, the Finance Act 2025, as approved by the National Assembly, received the president’s assent on June 27. The act will be applicable from July 1, according to the <a class="link--external" href="https://moib.gov.pk/News/62615#:~:text=President%20gives%20assent%20to%20Finance,applicable%20from%201st%20of%20July" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">information ministry</a>.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292">unveiled</a> Pakistan’s annual federal budget in a charged June 10 National Assembly session, outlining ambitious proposals to drive 4.2 per cent economic growth in the coming fiscal year while cutting back on overall spending and tightening tax measures.</p>
<p>The National Assembly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920477">passed</a> the federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year on June 26, with an outlay of Rs17.57tr, despite opposition calls for the budgetary proposals to be made public and for the passage to be delayed until public input had been sought.</p>
<p>The House passed it with certain amendments, incorporating around half of the suggestions put forward by the finance committees of both houses of parliament. All amendments proposed by the opposition were rejected.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#budget-2025-26" id="budget-2025-26" title="Permalink"></a>Budget 2025-26</h2>
<p>The federal budget for the next fiscal year projects an economic growth rate of 4.2pc and an inflation rate of 7.5pc. The net revenue receipts have been estimated at Rs11.07tr, with FBR collections projected to rise by 18.7pc to Rs14.13tr. Non-tax revenues are estimated at Rs5.15tr.</p>
<p>Key allocations include Rs2.55tr for defence, Rs1.06tr for pension expenditures, and Rs1.19tr for subsidies on electricity and other sectors. Relief measures in the budget include a 10pc increase in salaries, 7pc in pensions and tax relief for the salaried class across all income brackets.</p>
<p>The budget also includes Rs716bn for BISP and Rs1tr for the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), in which the largest allocation of Rs328bn is earmarked for transport infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>The PSDP for the next fiscal year has been aligned with the objectives of URAAN Pakistan, prioritising high-impact, near-completion foreign-funded projects and new initiatives of national importance.</p>
<p>Key infrastructure projects like Diamer Bhasha, Mohmand Dam and K-IV have been allocated Rs32.7bn, Rs35.7bn and Rs3.2bn, respectively. Besides, Rs10bn has been allocated for the lining of Kalri Baghar Feeder and Rs4.4bn for installing a telemetry system on the Indus Basin System.</p>
<p>The Higher Education Commission has been allocated Rs39.5bn for 170 projects. Additionally, Rs18.5bn has been earmarked in the PSDP for various education initiatives.</p>
<p>The agriculture sector will receive Rs4bn for 10 ongoing and five new schemes. The budget also includes incentives for the construction industry, such as a reduction in withholding tax on property purchases.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Karachi Police on Monday briefly detained government employees protesting for pay hikes and promotions after initially using tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowds.</p>
<p>Traffic snarls were also caused in several areas due to the confrontations.</p>
<p>South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “Eighty-seven [protesters were] arrested and released on commitment to call off the protest,” adding that their future course of action would be announced after 13th Muharam.</p>
<p>He said the police initially took action as negotiations among the representatives of the employees and officials failed. “The Sindh Employees’ Alliance (SEA) — an alliance of different departments of Sindh government employees — were marching towards the Chief Minister’s House.</p>
<p>“The SEA has made three major demands, including an increase of 70 per cent salaries and pension of Sindh employees of Sindh from grade 1 to 22, granting DRA (disparity reduction allowance) of 50pc to all employees of the same grades, and group insurance and benevolent fund after retirement to all employees of the said grades as per pattern of Balochistan government.”</p>

<p>DIG Raza said that the leaders of the alliance held talks with officials, including with him, Planning and Development Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, Karachi commissioner and finance secretary at the Commissioner’s office.</p>
<p>“The talks failed as there was no agreement,” he said, adding that the protesters gathered outside the Karachi Press Club in the morning and planned to move towards the CM House.</p>
<p>The roads near the CM House were already barricaded by the law enforcement agencies, he said, adding that police used water cannons to disperse protesters marching towards the Aiwan-i-Saddar Road, near the Governor House.</p>
<p>Witnesses and protesting leaders told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the police used tear gas shells as well.</p>
<p>“They were dispersed and diverted towards the venue of the protest at the Karachi Press Club after the police action,” DIG Raza said, adding that no one was arrested.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media outside the KPC, SEA’s Ashraf Khaskheli, Zamir Chandio, and other leaders said the police resorted to “torture” while dispersing the protesters.</p>
<p>They said that they would plan a future course of action and were planning to move towards Bilawal House in Clifton for their demands.</p>
<p>The leaders claimed that provincial minister Nasir Shah had “accepted” their demands, but Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah sought three days for talks.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Nasir told the media that the Sindh government would try to address the legitimate demands of the employees.</p>
<p>“It has been a priority of the PPP-led government to provide jobs to the youth,” Nasir said, adding that he would present the demands before CM Murad.</p>
<p>He further said that while everyone had the right to protest, such protests should not happen as they cause inconvenience to the general public.</p>
<p>Separately,  South SSP (Traffic) Suhai Aziz told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “Four main roads, namely Aiwan-i-Saddar, Dr Ziauddin Ahmad Road, Din Muhammad Wafai Road and Sarwar Shaheed, have been closed by district police.”</p>
<p>The traffic police chief said that 4pm to 7pm were considered peak hours when “traffic is moving bumper to bumper”.</p>
<p>“Due to the closure of the four major roads, there is a major impact on adjacent roads like I.I. Chundrigar Road, Abdullah Haroon, M.T. Khan and Saddar,” she added.</p>
<p>According to traffic alerts issued by the Karachi police, the roads were closed due to “security reasons”. The alerts said, “Traffic from PIDC Chowk is being diverted towards Club Road, and from State Life Building towards B. Mountain Road,” adding, “Traffic from Sultanabad Chowki is being directed towards Mai Kolachi Road and Boat Basin.</p>
<p>“Traffic from Fountain Chowk is being diverted towards Zainab Market, and from Thana Gali towards M.R. Kiani Chowrangi,” they added.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Punjab Food Authority (PFA) on Monday sealed suspected food outlets after two girls died from alleged food poisoning in Gujranwala’s Eminabad, a notification said.</p>
<p>International kabaddi player and father of victims Naveed Pehlwan told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the family had ordered food during a birthday party.</p>
<p>“The family, including me, my wife and five children, were taken to the hospital after feeling sick,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that two of the children, an 8-year-old and a 4-year-old, passed away while two others were in critical condition.</p>
<p>“On the directions of Punjab Food Authority Director General Muhammad Asim Javaid, food safety teams conducted a crackdown in Eminabad following the alleged death of two minor girls due to toxic food,” according to a PFA handout seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>The operations were carried out from the identification of the suspected food outlets by the family, the statement read.</p>
<p>It said, “During the raid, two food outlets were sealed and various food samples, including cake, cream, red chilli powder, cooking oil, and chicken, were collected and sent to the laboratory for analysis.”</p>
<p>The statement quoted the PFA spokesperson as saying that further action will be taken once laboratory reports are received.</p>
<p>He further said, “[The] initial medical findings revealed the children had been unwell for several days and were already under treatment. Meanwhile case is also under police investigation,” he added.</p>
<p>PFA DG Javaid said that the food outlets that were involved in compromising public health will face strict action according to food safety laws, the statement added.</p>
<p>Last week, a Rawalpindi woman was in critical condition at the hospital after her three children <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919947">died</a> due to food poisoning.</p>
<p>In April, a food poisoning affected approximately <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904475">1,500 people</a> in the Dhoong village of Gujar Khan, while the cause was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904707">unknown</a> to the authorities and residents.</p></p>
