            <p><p>The Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) on Saturday reviewed complaints against different judges of the superior judiciary, “unanimously” dismissing 19 of them.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi called the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922929">SJC meeting</a> to consider around two dozen pending complaints against superior court judges and a set of recommendations to streamline the process of handling complaints and to ensure transparency while probing allegations of misconduct against judges.</p>
<p>According to a press release dated today, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, the council examined 24 complaints under Article 209 of the Constitution. It said, “19 complaints were unanimously decided to be filed while five others were deferred for the time being.”</p>
<p>The meeting was chaired by CJP Afridi and attended by senior puisine judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Munib Akhtar, Lahore High Court Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and Sindh High Court Chief Justice  Muhammad Junaid Ghaffar.</p>
<p>The press release also said, “The proposed draft of SJC Secretariat Service Rules, 2025 was approved by the council,” adding that the Procedure of Enquiry, 2005 and amendments in the Code of Conduct “needed to be examined from legal and drafting point of view” which required further deliberation.</p>
<p>The SJC had appointed Justice Akhtar as head of a committee to propose amendments to the code of conduct.</p>
<p>In February, the SJC <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1890556/supreme-judicial-council-examines-complaints-against-judges">examined</a> as many as 46 complaints against constitutional office-holders, disposed of 40 of them, sou­ght comments on five complaints and as­­ked for further information in one case.</p></p>

            <p><p>Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) founder Altaf Hussain’s health has been on the mend after he was admitted to the hospital, according to a video by a party official posted on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hussain was recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923515">hospitalised</a> in London due to “severe illness”, where he underwent multiple tests. London-based senior party leader Mustafa Azizabadi told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the MQM founder’s treatment was ongoing and “hopefully it’s not something serious”.</p>
<p>In a video message posted early on X today, Azizabadi stated that the MQM founder’s health had improved since yesterday.</p>
<p>“Altaf Hussain <em>bhai</em> (brother) has undergone some tests and blood transfusion has been given. The tests show that Altaf <em>bhai’s</em> health … has greatly improved,” Azizabadi said. “Doctors are treating him according to the test results.”</p>
<p>He highlighted that misinformation had spread about Hussain’s condition, calling it “upsetting”.</p>

<p>An update from MQM Coordination Committee Deputy Convener Qasim Ali said doctors conducted a detailed medical examination and agreed to continue treatment in light of the test reports from a day ago.</p>
<p>“Doctors have advised continuing blood transfusions for Altaf Hussain today as well due to a decrease in blood count.”</p>

<p>Previously known as the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, Hussain founded his party in 1984 to represent the Urdu-speaking community, which had migrated to Pakistan amid Partition.</p>

<p>Under Hussain’s leadership, MQM swept the 1988 election in Sindh’s urban areas, emerging as the third-largest party in the country.</p>
<p>The MQM under Hussain was accused of using violent tactics to attain and retain political power. On the contrary, Hussain maintained that the state and other political parties have targeted MQM and its workers ever since its formation.</p>
<p>Hussain currently lives in London, where he has been in self-imposed exile since 1992. He was later granted British citizenship. From London, Hussain played an active role in politics, regularly broadcasting political speeches to his followers in Karachi.</p></p>
