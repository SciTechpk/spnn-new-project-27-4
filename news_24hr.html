            <p><p>• Additional burden on consumers to be offset by disbursement through BISP<br />
• Committee approves supplementary grants worth Rs856bn; passes the buck on sugar import to minister-led body</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: The government has increased the price of gas by 50 per cent in an apparent move to meet the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878236">demand</a> of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the federal cabinet approved the hike in fixed gas charges for all consumers from July 1.</p>
<p>The rate for non-domestic consumers has been increased by 29pc to cumulatively raise an additional Rs72 billion.</p>
<p>The ECC meeting on Friday, chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, also approved supplementary grants of Rs856bn.</p>
<p>However, the committee failed to reach a decision over the import of sugar and passed the responsibility to a political committee led by the National Food Security and Research minister.</p>
<p><strong>Increase in gas price</strong></p>
<p>The summary for the revised natural gas pricing structure for the fiscal year 2025–26 was moved by the Petroleum Division.</p>
<p>The ministry sought app­roval for up to 56pc increase in gas rates for protected domestic consumers and 37pc increase in fixed charges.</p>
<p>The additional burden on consumers was to be offset by disbursing the amount —saved due to the removal of subsidy — through the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1818690">BISP social safety programme.</a></p>
<p>However, the ECC decided to increase fixed charges by 50pc for domestic consumers and shift partial burden to bulk, power sector and industrial consumers.</p>
<p>The increase in gas rate for the power sector would have around Rs0.12 per unit additional impact on the average power tariff.</p>
<p>In doing so, the ECC increased fixed charges for protected consumers by 50pc from Rs400 to Rs600.</p>
<p>Likewise, fixed charges for non-protected domestic consumers were increased by 50pc from Rs1,000 to Rs1,500.</p>
<p>The meeting also abolished the one-slab benefit to domestic consumers — both protected and non-protected — who would now be charged at the first tariff slab of each category.</p>
<p>The ECC also increased gas rates for bulk consumers by 9.5pc from Rs2,900 to Rs3,175 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu).</p>
<p>The gas rates for the power sector were increased by 29pc instead of 25pc proposed by the Petroleum Division from Rs1,050 to Rs1,350 per mmBtu.</p>
<p>Likewise, a 9.3pc increase was approved for industrial (process) consumers from Rs2,150 to Rs2,350 per mmBtu.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the Ministry of Finance said the Ogra law required the federal government to notify revised consumer gas prices within 40 days of Ogra’s determination to ensure cost recovery and regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>“The submission also aligns with structural benchmarks agreed with the IMF, including rationalisation of captive power tariffs and a shift from cross-subsidies to direct, targeted support for low-income consumers,” it added.</p>
<p>The statement said the ECC decided to maintain gas prices to protect household consumers with only fixed charges re-adjusted to recover the asset costs.</p>
<p>“It also allowed price of gas for bulk consumers, power plants operating on natural gas and industry to be increased by an average value of around 10pc,” the statement said.</p>
<p>This would ensure the revenue requirement of Rs888.6bn — Rs534.46bn for SNGPL and Rs354.2bn for SSGCL — determined by Ogra for FY26.</p>
<p>At the existing price of gas effective since February 01, the estimated revenues of both Sui companies by the end FY26 was Rs847.714bn — Rs493.54bn for SNGPL and Rs354.18bn for SSGCL, leaving a shortfall of Rs41bn.</p>
<p>The gas tariff revisions cleared by the ECC are assumed to meet the Rs41bn revenue deficit.</p>
<p>The petroleum division warned that the government was already engaged with the IMF to replace cross-subsidies with direct, budgeted subsidies, i.e., through the BISP.</p>
<p><strong>Sugar import</strong></p>
<p>The ECC also discussed the issue of sugar imports to stabilise prices in the local market and constituted a 10-member steering committee for further deliberations.</p>
<p>The committee, led by the food security minister, also included the commerce minister, SAPM on foreign affairs, Finance Division secretary, FBR chairman and others will submit its recommendations to the ECC.</p>
<p>The ECC also discussed proposed changes in the home remittances incentive schemes and asked the State Bank of Pakistan and the Finance Division to propose and present a plan by July 31.</p>
<p>The meeting considered a finance ministry’s proposal to launch a risk coverage scheme for small farmers and under-served areas and gave an in-principle approval to the scheme.</p>
<p>The ECC noted the scheme was likely to bring 750,000 new agricultural borrowers into the formal financial system and generate an incremental credit portfolio of Rs300bn during its disbursement tenure of three years.</p>
<p>The meeting approved a total of 14 supplementary grants worth Rs856bn.</p>
<p>Major among them included Rs832bn to the Ministry of Finance for repayment of debt, Rs15.84bn for the Ministry of Defence to cover the shortfall in admissible pay and allowances, in employees-related and non-employees related expenditures and clear the outstanding dues as part of the PM’s Package for the martyrs of the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914634">clashed</a> with India and Rs5.5bn grant to Strategic Plans Divisions as rupee cover to Pakistan Space &amp; Upper Atmosphere Research Commission.</p>

            <p><p>• Court of Arbitration rules that New Delhi’s decision to hold Indus treaty in abeyance doesn’t affect its competence to hear and decide disputes<br />
• Islamabad welcomes, India rejects ‘supplemental award’ as it exposes Kishenganga and Ratle hydel projects to Pakistan’s objections</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: In a major boon for Pakistan in its dispute over the ‘one-sided’ <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906310">suspension</a> of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague has ruled that India’s actions have no bearing on its competence to adjudicate the matter.</p>
<p>The court found that its competence cannot be affected by the unilateral decision of a party taken after the initiation of arbitral proceedings, regardless of whether India’s recent decision was characterised as a suspension of the treaty, or otherwise.</p>
<p>The court further found that it has a continuing responsibility to advance proceedings in a timely, efficient and fair manner, notwithstanding India’s position on “abeyance”.</p>
<p>It also declared that these findings also apply to the Neutral Expert, appointed in separate proceedings.</p>
<p>The decision, which was hailed by Islamabad and “rejected by New Delhi, marks a major legal win for Pakistan. At the heart of the decision is a clear message that India cannot unilaterally suspend or sideline the treaty.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The court based its ruling firmly on the treaty’s text, especially Article XII(4), which says the treaty stays in force unless both countries agree to end it through a formal agreement. This leaves no room for one side to walk away or put the treaty on pause. This is consistent with the provisions of international law, particularly the principle of pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept).</p>
<p>The ruling also emphasises the importance of the treaty’s built-in dispute resolution system. According to the court, letting one country unilaterally ignore the arbitration process would undermine the treaty’s very purpose. This reflects the principle that treaties should be interpreted in a way that gives their provisions real meaning and effect.</p>
<p>Crucially, the court has rejected India’s claim that it could simply pull out of the proceedings and halt arbitration. It has also reaffirmed its own authority to decide on its jurisdiction, pointing out that once the process has started, it can’t be disrupted by one party backing out.</p>
<p><strong>‘Supplemental award’</strong></p>
<p>Friday’s decision by The Hague-based Court of Arbitr­ation was a ‘Supplemental Award on the Competence of the Court’ in a matter initiated by Pakistan.</p>
<p>In these proceedings, Pakistan had requested the court to address the interpretation and application of IWT to certain design elements of the run-of-river hydro-electric <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1734060">projects</a> (Kishen­ganga and Ratle) that India was permitted by the treaty to construct on the tributaries of the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab, before those rivers flow into Pakistan.</p>
<p>In the unanimous decision, the court found that its competence cannot be affected by the unilateral decision of a party taken after the initiation of the arbitral proceedings, regardless of whether India’s recent decision was characterized under international law as a suspension of the treaty or otherwise.</p>
<p>Pakistan had initiated the present arbitral proceedings in 2016. Subsequently, India reques­ted that the World Bank appoint a neutral expert (a highly-qualified engineer) to address certain design and operation questions that were essentially identical to some of the questions presented by Pakistan in its request for arbitration.</p>
<p>In December 2016, the World Bank, which has a special but essentially ministerial role under the Treaty, decided to “pause” the process of appointing the Chairman of the Court of Arbitration and the Neutral Expert. This pause was lifted in 2022, following which the Court of Arbitration was empaneled and the neutral expert was appointed.</p>
<p>On July 6, 2023, the Court issued its Award on the Competence of the Court, in which the court carefully considered objections to the competence of the Court raised by India (by way of correspondence to the World Bank).</p>
<p>In a unanimous decision, the court rejected each of the objections raised by India and determined that the court is competent to consider and determine the disputes set forth in Pakis­tan’s request for arbitration.</p>
<p>The court then recalled the well-settled rule of customary international law that events occurring after the initiation of proceedings can have no effect on the jurisdiction of the relevant court or tribunal.</p>
<p>This rule, reflected in decisions of the International Court of Justice and international arbitral tribunals, confirmed the Court’s conclusion that, once established, the court’s jurisdiction cannot be defeated by a party’s unilateral action.</p>
<p>Applying these findings to India’s decision that the “Indus Waters Treaty 1960 will be held in abeyance with immediate effect”, the court found that it was not open to India to take unilateral action to suspend these proceedings, regardless of how India’s position was characterized or justified under international law.</p>
<p><strong>Reactions from Islamabad, New Delhi</strong></p>
<p>The government of Pakistan noted that the court had affirmed its competence in the light of recent developments, and that unilateral action by India cannot deprive either the court or the Neutral Expert, in the proceedings initiated by India, of their competence to adjudicate the issues before them.</p>
<p>Pakistan looks forward to receiving the court’s award on the First Phase on the Merits in due course following the hearing that was held in Peace Palace in The Hague in July 2024, a statement said.</p>
<p>The high priority, at this point, the statement said, was that India and Pakistan find a way back to a meaningful dialogue, including on the application of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>It recalled that to this end, PM Shehbaz Sharif had stated on June 24, 2025 that Pakistan was “ready to engage in a meaningful dialogue with India on all outstanding issues, including Jammu &amp; Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, India “categorically rejected” the supplemental award by the Court of Arbitration on its Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects, saying that it “never recognised” the Court of Arbitration.</p>
<p>“India has never recognised the existence in law of this so-called Court of Arbitration, and India’s position has all along been that the constitution of this so-called arbitral body is in itself a serious breach of the Indus Waters Treaty and consequently any proceedings before this forum and any award or decision taken by it are also for that reason illegal and per se void,” India’s Ministry of External Affairs said.</p>
<p>“Today, the illegal Court of Arbitration, purportedly constituted under the Indus Waters Treaty 1960, albeit in brazen violation of it, has issued what it characterises as a “supplemental award” on its competence concerning the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects in the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.”</p>
<p>The MEA described the Court of Arbitration’s latest declarations as a “charade at Pakistan’s behest”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Until such time that the Treaty is in abeyance, India is no longer bound to perform any of its obligations under the Treaty. No Court of Arbitration, much less this illegally constituted arbitral body, which has no existence in the eye of law, has the jurisdiction to examine the legality of India’s actions in exercise of its rights as a sovereign,” it said.</p>

            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The interior ministry on Friday approved the nationwide deployment of the Pakistan Army and civil armed forces for security during <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920308">Muharram-ul-Haram.</a></p>
<p>A notification issued by the interior ministry, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn</em>, said the approval followed requests by all provincial governments, besides governments of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>It added the federal government authorised the deployment of army troops and civil armed forces under Sections 4 and 5 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, for Muharram security duties in aid of civil power, subject to laws enforced in the country.</p>
<p>“The exact number, date and area of deployment of Pakistan Army and CAFs troops/assets will be worked out by all provincial governments including Government of Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Govt. of the State of Jammu and Kashmir and ICT administration in consultation with concerned stakeholders on the basis of on-ground requirement/assessment.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Deployment approved on requests from provinces, GB and Azad Kashmir</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“The date of de-requisitioning of the said deployment will be decided subsequently after mutual consultation among all stakeholders,” the notification said.</p>
<p>Copies of the notification besides others have been sent to the secretary to the prime minister, secretary of ministry of defence, secretaries of home departments, governments of Punjab, Sindh, KP, Balochistan, GB &amp; AJK, chief commissioner of ICT, military operations directorate, GHQ, inspectors general of Frontier Corps, (North and South), inspectors general of Frontier Corps, Balochistan (North and South), director generals of Pakistan Rangers (Punjab and Sindh), commandant of Frontier Constabulary, director general of Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts, and inspectors general of Police, Punjab, Sindh, KP, Balochistan, GB, AJK and Islamabad.</p>
<p>Ashura, the 10th of Muharram, will be observed on July 6. Muharram is the month of mourning, observed in particular by Shia Muslims worldwide. It commemorates the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD, where Imam Hussain, the grandson of Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), and his family members and companions were martyred.</p>
<p>Keeping in view the need for extra security due to the spike in religious activity during the first 10 days of Muharram, authorities make arrangements accordingly.</p>
<p>A day earlier, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920266/interior-ministry-vows-to-take-strict-action-against-religious-hate-online-during-muharram">chaired</a> a meeting on nationwide Muharram security plan at the Ministry of Interior.</p>
<p>During the meeting, security plans for all provinces, Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad were reviewed in detail.</p>
<p>It was decided in the meeting to launch a crackdown against elements spreading religious hatred on social media during Muharram and take strict legal action against them.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was decided to send clear recommendations to Pemra and PTA to curb hate content on electronic and social media. It was also decided that all necessary measures will be taken to ensure peace and order during Muharram.</p>
<p>It was also agreed that any decision to suspend internet or mobile phone services will be made in consultation with provinces, keeping in view the security concerns.</p>
<p>Mr Naqvi directed the authorities to make decisions regarding internet and mobile service suspensions the basis of ground realities and the security situation.</p>
