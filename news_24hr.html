            <p><p>A policeman guarding a polio vaccination team was gunned down on Tuesday by unknown attackers in Balochistan’s Noshki district, according to an official.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries where polio <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1883410">remains</a> endemic, and vaccination teams are frequently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1804269">targeted</a> by militants waging a campaign against security forces.</p>
<p>Noshki Deputy Commissioner (DC) Amjad Hussain Soomro confirmed the “unfortunate incident” to <em>Dawn.com</em>, in which Waheed Ahmed was gunned down in Noshki’s Killi Muhammad Hassni district.</p>
<p>He said that police have set up checkpoints at various places to search for the attackers, who will be arrested soon.</p>
<p>DC Soomro noted that security of the health department staff working on the anti-polio campaign has been further beefed up.</p>
<p>He added that the anti-polio campaign is continuing even after the terrorist incident and the targets given to the anti-polio teams in Noshki district for this national cause will be completed soon.</p>
<p>Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind confirmed that the martyred was a resident of Jalalabad, Noshki.</p>
<p>“The polio campaign is a national duty, and any attack on it is intolerable,” Rind said in a statement, paying tribute to the slain officer who “sacrificed himself while on duty”.</p>
<p>“This attack is a conspiracy to sabotage the national campaign and spread fear and panic,” Rind added.</p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack in Noshki and offered heartfelt condolences to the family of the bereaved.</p>
<p>He noted that the courage and sacrifice of polio officials “[inspires] us all to save our children from this crippling disease.”</p>
<p>The president reiterated Pakistan’s commitment  to fully eradicating polio</p>
<p>“We have the tools, the will, and the support of our global partners to make this vision a reality,” he said in a statement issued today. “I call on parents to open their doors to vaccinators, ensuring every child receives the life-saving polio drops.</p>
<p>“I urge teachers, religious leaders, and community elders to champion this noble cause, dispelling myths and building trust. I appeal to the media to amplify the truth: the polio vaccine is safe, effective, and our best weapon.”</p>
<p>He reiterated his support for his daughter Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, “whose tireless advocacy and efforts has galvanized our nation in this fight against polio”.</p>
<p>“Today, I also pay tribute to our brave polio workers, who risk their lives to reach every child, often in the face of grave danger.</p>
<p>“We also honour those polio workers and security officials who have made the ultimate sacrifice, losing their lives to cowardly attacks aimed at derailing our efforts to make Pakistan polio-free,” he said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the incident and affirmed that strict action will be taken against militant elements targeting the polio campaign, according to state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/27-05-2025/president-pm-condemn-attack-on-polio-team-in-nushki" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em>.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and said that an attack on the team tasked with securing the safe future of children is intolerable.</p>
<p>Yesterday, two polio workers were abducted by armed assailants in Tank district while performing their duties in the Dolat Koruna area as part of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913239/pakistan-launches-3rd-anti-polio-drive-of-this-year">ongoing vaccination drive</a> which kicked off on Sunday.</p>

<p>The Pakistan Polio Programme launched the third drive of the year against the crippling disease at the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), Islamabad.</p>
<p>The campaign was formally inaugurated by Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication Ayesha Raza Farooq, alongside members of the Polio Programme’s core group and representatives of partner organisations, the statement added.</p>

            <p><p>The Foreign Office on Tuesday condemned the recent remarks towards Pakistan by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a speech in Gujarat, calling it a “reckless provocation”.</p>
<p>The developments follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.</p>
<p>On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>. After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting drones</a> sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> was reached.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ANI/status/1926983867820326946" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> shared by Indian news outlet <em>ANI</em>, Modi says: “The people of Pakistan must come forward to rid their country of terrorism. Their youth will have to come forward.”</p>
<p>He went on to say: “Live a life of peace, eat your bread or [choose my] bullet,” to applause from the crowd, with many adorned in orange and white outfits.</p>

<p>A statement by the FO early on Tuesday said Pakistan has taken note of Modi’s remarks “delivered in Gujarat with the theatrical flourish of a campaign rally rather than the sobriety expected of the leader of a nuclear-armed state.</p>
<p>“The hate-driven invocation of violence in his remarks is deeply disturbing, not only for its content but for the dangerous precedent it sets in region already burdened by volatility,” the FO said.</p>
<p>“We regret the continued erosion of maturity and decorum in Indian statecraft.”</p>

<p>The FO noted that such statement “blatantly violate” the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, which obliges member states to resolve disputes peacefully and to refrain from the threat or use of force against the sovereignty or political independence of other states.</p>
<p>“Pakistan views these remarks as a reckless provocation, intended to distract from the ongoing human rights abuses and demographic engineering in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu &amp; Kashmir.</p>
<p>“Pakistan’s record as a leading contributor to UN peacekeeping and its consistent cooperation in global counter-terrorism efforts speak louder than any hostile soundbite.</p>
<p>“If extremism is indeed a concern for the Indian government, it would do well to turn inward-toward the alarming rise of majoritarianism, religious intolerance, and the systematic disenfranchisement of minorities under the increasingly brutal Hindutva ideology,” the FO said.</p>
<p>It added that Pakistan remains committed to peace based on mutual respect and sovereign equality.</p>
<p>“However, any threat to its security or territorial integrity will be met with firm and proportionate measures, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.</p>
<p>“The international community must take serious note of India’s escalating rhetoric, which undermines regional stability and the prospects for lasting peace.”</p></p>

            <p><p>India’s defence minister has approved a framework for building the country’s most advanced stealth fighter jet, the defence ministry said on Tuesday, amid a new arms race with Pakistan weeks after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">military conflict</a> between the neighbours.</p>
<p>Indian state-run Aeronautical Development Agency, which is executing the programme, will shortly invite initial interest from defence firms for developing a prototype of the warplane, envisaged as a twin-engine 5th generation fighter, the ministry said.</p>
<p>The project is crucial for the Indian Air Force, whose squadrons of French, Russian and ex-Soviet aircraft have fallen to 31 from an approved strength of 42 at a time when rival China is expanding its air force rapidly.</p>
<p>Pakistan has one of China’s advanced warplanes, the J-10, in its arsenal, which it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911307">claims</a> to have used to shoot down India’s latest French Rafale jets in the recent fighting.</p>

<p>Militaries of nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan faced-off in four days of fighting this month, which saw use of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911123">fighter jets</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">missiles</a>, drones and artillery by both sides before a ceasefire was announced by US President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>It was the first time both sides utilised drones at scale and the South Asian powers are now locked in a drones arms race, according to <em>Reuters</em>’ interviews with 15 people, including security officials, industry executives and analysts in the two countries.</p>
<p>India will partner with a domestic firm for the stealth fighter programme, and companies can bid independently or as a joint venture, the defence ministry said in a statement, adding that the bids would be open for both private and state-owned firms.</p>
<p>In March, an Indian defence committee had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895761">recommended</a> including the private sector in military aircraft manufacturing to shore up the capabilities of the Indian Air Force and reduce the burden on state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, which makes most of India’s military aircraft.</p>
