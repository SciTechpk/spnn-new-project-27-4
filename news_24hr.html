            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928059/countrys-18th-polio-case-of-this-year-reported-in-kps-tank' target='_blank'><strong>Country’s 18th polio case of this year reported in KP’s Tank</strong></a>
            <p><p>A newly confirmed case of polio in Khyber Paktunkhwa’s Tank district has brought the total number of polio cases in Pakistan this year to 18, the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad said on Friday.</p>
<p>Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879016">endemic</a>. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891351">challenges</a> such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation have slowed progress.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://www.endpolio.com.pk/media-room/media-releases/2649-new-polio-case-underscores-ongoing-risk-in-south-khyber-pakhtunkhwa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme confirmed that a 10-month-old boy from Union Council Mullazai in Tank district was confirmed as the 11th polio case from KP this year, bringing the country’s total number of cases in 2025 to 18. Last year, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891351">74 cases</a> were reported nationwide.</p>
<p>“The continued detection of polio cases underscores the persistent threat to children, particularly in areas with low vaccine acceptance,” the press release said. “It is crucial for communities to understand that poliovirus can re-emerge wherever immunity gaps persist.”</p>
<p>It added that every unvaccinated child remained vulnerable and could also contribute to the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The press release pointed out that the only effective protection for polio — a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis — was through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p>
<p>Despite “significant improvements” in the quality of polio vaccination campaigns nationwide, the laboratory said that southern districts of KP remained a key area of concern due to restricted access and operational challenges in house-to-house vaccination, leaving “thousands of children unvaccinated”.</p>
<p>According to the press release, six campaigns, including four nationwide, have each reached over 45 million children since September 2024.</p>
<p>It added that the National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) plans to conduct two nationwide and one sub-national campaign between August and December this year, as well as targeted campaigns in selected high-risk districts, to help stop transmission and protect children from the virus.</p>

<p>As part of intensified efforts to eradicate polio in South KP, the prime minister’s Focal Person on Polio Eradication, Senator Ayesha Raza Farooq and NEOC Coordinator retired Captain Anwarul Haq held a meeting with KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah in Peshawar on Tuesday to review ongoing initiatives in the province.</p>
<p>The meeting focused on “campaign performance, current challenges, and targeted strategies to interrupt poliovirus transmission”, particularly in high-risk southern districts of KP, including Tank.</p>
<p>Farooq emphasised the need to “resolve persistent access barriers and ensure the uninterrupted presence and performance of frontline vaccinators in high-risk union councils”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Anwarul Haq presented a targeted strategy to improve the quality of campaigns and strengthen routine immunisation, particularly in southern KP.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The press release added, “A special planning meeting focused on South KP is scheduled to be held at the chief secretary’s office on August 2-3.”</p>
<p>The programme called polio eradication “a collective responsibility that requires unified efforts at all levels”.</p>
<p>“While dedicated frontline polio workers continue to deliver life-saving vaccines, it is equally critical for parents and caregivers to ensure their children receive every dose of the polio vaccine,” it said.</p>
<p>“Communities must play an active role by supporting vaccination efforts, dispelling misinformation, and encouraging others to protect their children through timely immunisation.”</p>
<p>It directed citizens to the Sehat Tahaffuz Helpline at 1166 for information, as well as the Polio Helpline on WhatsApp at 0346-7776546.</p>
<p>Last Saturday, the NIH had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926915/3-new-polio-cases-confirmed-in-kp-sindh-as-nationwide-tally-climbs-to-17">confirmed</a> three new polio cases in the country in KP and Sindh.</p>
<p>In June, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918236">claimed</a> that Pakistan has witnessed a decline of over 99 per cent in polio cases, saying that polio eradication remains a top priority of the government.</p></p>

            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Friday stressed that the “enduring partnership” between Pakistan and China will continue to play a pivotal role in regional stability.</p>
<p>Pakistan and China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/china-says-it-backs-pakistan-in-defending-sovereignty">share</a> a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure — with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884628">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.</p>
<p>The army chief made the remarks at the 98th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China, which was commemorated at General Headquarters in Rawalpindi today, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7374" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> by the military’s media affairs wing.</p>
<p>“He emphasised that their enduring partnership will continue to play a pivotal role in promoting regional stability and safeguarding shared strategic interests,” said the statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).</p>
<p>China’s Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong graced the occasion as the chief guest, while Defence Attaché Major General Wang Zhong, Chinese Embassy officials and senior military officers from the Pakistani tri-services were also present.</p>
<p>COAS Munir extended a warm welcome to the Chinese guests and congratulated the PLA on its 98th founding anniversary, lauding the army’s “pivotal role in China’s defence, security and nation-building”, the ISPR said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The army chief emphasised that “despite shifting strategic dynamics, the friendship between the two nations has remained steadfast and unshakable”, according to the press release.</p>
<p>“The COAS underscored the strength and strategic significance of Pakistan-China relations, emphasising that the bond between the two nations is unique, time-tested, and exceptionally resilient amid evolving regional and global challenges.</p>
<p>“The Field Marshal highlighted that the Pakistan-China strategic relationship exemplifies mutual trust, unwavering support, and shared commitment,” the statement added.</p>
<p>Concluding his address, COAS Munir “reaffirmed that the Pakistan Army and the PLA are true brothers-in-arms”, the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>Addressing the gathering, Ambassador Zaidong expressed his sincere gratitude to the army chief for hosting the event commemorating the PLA’s 98th anniversary.</p>
<p>He acknowledged the steadfast role of the armed forces in the “fight against terrorism and reaffirmed China’s unwavering support for and commitment to its strategic partnership with Pakistan”, according to the ISPR.</p>

<p>Today’s renewed affirmation of the strong bilateral ties comes just a week after COAS Munir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926523/chinese-leadership-lauds-pakistans-role-in-regional-peace-during-meeting-with-coas-munir">paid an official visit</a> to China, where he met with Vice President Han Zheng and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.</p>
<p>During the visit, the Chinese leadership hailed the Pakistan Army as a “cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor” for peace in the region.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924658">reaffirmed</a> their commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation and promoting regional peace, stability, and development.</p>

            <p><p>PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khanum on Friday said that his sons had applied for their Pakistani visas and were awaiting approval from the interior ministry ahead of their visit to the country.</p>
<p>In a post on X, she said: “A few days ago, Suleiman [Khan] and Kasim [Khan] applied for their visas with the Pakistan High Commission in London. The ambassador has intimated that he is awaiting approval from the Ministry of Interior in Islamabad.”</p>

<p>Imran’s sons — Sulaiman, 28, and Kasim, 26 — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910789">called attention</a> to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Last month, Aleema <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">said</a> they would go to the United States before coming to Pakistan as part of a movement calling for the ex-premier’s release. The siblings visited the US and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926052/imrans-sons-meet-trump-aide-to-kick-off-us-campaign-to-free-father">engaged US lawmakers</a> on the issue of their father’s incarceration.</p>
<p>Imran, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a> since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.</p>
<p>Aleema had previously said that the sons would “definitely” come to Pakistan as they had a National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis and they were “citizens of Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“If anything were to happen to Imran’s sons, it would become an international matter,” she had told reporters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had remarked, “Why would the government stop Imran’s sons from coming to Pakistan?”</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the PTI <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927421">swiftly rubbished</a> media reports claiming that the incarcerated leader told reporters at Adiala Jail that his sons would not be coming to Pakistan and taking part in or leading any protest.</p>
<p>Although the government has not officially commented on the matter of Imran’s sons, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926052/imrans-sons-meet-trump-aide-to-kick-off-us-campaign-to-free-father">questioned</a> what, if any, role they would be able to play, adding that they were welcome to visit Pakistan and there would be no obstacle for them. He continued that visas would be issued to them “in less than 24 hours”, provided they stayed within the law.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan">told</a> <em>Dawn.com</em> that Article 16 of the Constitution, which grants the right to gather, was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Malik also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923089">said</a> that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals, and that if they “violate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled”.</p>
<p>There were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan">conflicting statements</a> from PML-N leaders as well on whether the duo would be allowed entry into Pakistan, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they should be allowed to come and “carry out their activities”, but within the limitations of the law.</p></p>
