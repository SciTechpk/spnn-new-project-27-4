            <p><p>The Balochistan government on Thursday said that it has received information about the kidnapping of some passengers near Sardhaka and a search operation is underway to recover them.</p>
<p>A statement from Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind said terrorists belonging to the <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> had carried out attacks in Quetta, Kalat, Mastung and Sardhaka.</p>
<p>“Information has been received about the kidnapping of some passengers near Sardhaka. A search operation has been launched in the area to safely recover the passengers,” he said.</p>
<p>Rind added that the security forces responded “immediately and vigorously” at all three locations, saying they were fully alert to protect the lives, property and belongings of the people.</p>
<p>The police and security forces have not provided details at the moment of the other incidents.</p>
<p>In May this year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525">designated</a> all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna-al-Hindu­stan</em> — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">a new phrase</a> aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>
<p>In March, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900559/several-killed-vehicles-torched-in-balochistan">five people were killed</a> by armed men who blocked the highway in the Kalmat area of Gwadar district, while three long-body trailers carrying urea from Gwadar port were set on fire in the Tajaban area.</p>
<p>In February, seven Punjab-bound passengers were offloaded from a bus and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892974/">shot dead</a> in Barkhan district. The incident came days after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892214">12 were killed</a> in a blast targeting a bus carrying coal miners in Harnai.</p>
<p>Balochistan has witnessed a spate of attacks targeting those hailing from Punjab. In two separate incidents in April 2024, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1827193">nine people</a> were killed after being forced off a bus near Noshki, while <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1830243">two labourers</a> from Punjab were shot in Kech.</p>
<p>In May last year, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832433">seven barbers</a> from Punjab were shot dead near Gwadar, while August saw <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854830">23 travellers</a> offloaded from trucks and buses and shot in the Musakhail district.</p>
<p>The Musakhail incident was part of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855006">flare-up of violence</a>, where dozens of militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army — a separatist outfit — launched <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854776/gun-grenade-attacks-in-balochistan">numerous attacks</a> across Balochistan, targeting security personnel as well as civilians.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Field Marshal Asim Munir said India was “doubling down to further its nefarious agenda through its proxies of <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>”.</p></p>

            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir said on Thursday that India was doubling down on its “nefarious agenda” against Pakistan through the use of proxies after facing a “manifest defeat” in the recent military conflict between the two countries.</p>
<p>India blamed Pakistan for the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> without evidence, triggering a military escalation. On May 6–7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">missile exchange</a>.

<p>A day earlier, Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923063/dg-ispr-brands-indian-nsa-ajit-doval-chief-architect-of-terrorism-in-pakistan">accused</a> Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval of masterminding terrorism in Pakistan, alleging Indian support for terrorist groups.</p>
<p>Echoing similar sentiments, Field Marshal Munir said, while chairing the 271st Corps Commanders’ Conference (CCC) at the General Headquarters (GHQ), said today: “Following its manifest defeat in direct aggression against Pakistan, post-Pahalgam incident, India is now doubling down to further its nefarious agenda through its proxies of <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>.”</p>
<p>In July last year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349">designated</a> the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em>, while mandating all institutions to use the term <em>khariji</em> (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.</p>
<p>In May this year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525">designated</a> all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna-al-Hindu­stan</em> — a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">new phrase</a> aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7348" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from the ISPR said the CCC participants offered prayers for the martyrs of recent terrorist attacks by “Indian-sponsored proxies”.</p>
<p>“Taking stock of recent successes against terrorist proxies, forum resolved that blood of our martyrs will not go waste and the safety and security of people of Pakistan remain topmost priority for the armed forces of Pakistan. Forum strongly asserted that it is imperative to take decisive and holistic actions at all levels against the Indian-backed and sponsored proxies.”</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The ISPR said the forum also noted the Indian military’s “baseless insinuations to offset its comprehensive defeat”, in an apparent reference to the deputy Indian army chief alleging last week that China gave Islamabad “live inputs” on key Indian positions during the conflict.</p>
<p>“Invoking third parties in what is unmistakably a bilateral military confrontation reflects a disingenuous attempt at bloc politics aimed at falsely projecting India’s self-assigned role as a net security provider to accrue benefits in a region that is visibly growing disillusioned with Indian hegemonic ambitions and Hindutva-driven extremism,” the ISPR quoted Field Marshal Munir as saying on the matter.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The army brass also conducted a holistic review of the prevailing internal and external security dynamics, with particular emphasis on the recent developments in the Middle East and Iran, noting the “growing propensity for ‘use of force’ as a preferred policy tool”, saying it warranted “persistent development of self-reliant capabilities as well as national unity and resolve”.</p>
<p>The forum’s members were further briefed on the military’s ongoing drive with quick adaptation towards the “evolving threat spectrum and changing character of war”. The army chief also appreciated the leadership of the Pakistan Navy and the Pakistan Air Force for “further strengthening tri-services synergy”.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir also shared details of the country’s “proactive and successful” diplomatic manoeuvres, including recent visits to Iran, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where he had accompanied Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Forum was also briefed on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044">historic and unique visit</a> of the COAS to US, where meetings with top-tier leadership afforded an opportunity to share first hand Pakistan’s objective perspective on bilateral, regional and extra-regional developments.”</p>
<p>The ISPR said that in his concluding remarks, the army chief expressed “full confidence in the operational readiness of Pakistan Army against complete threat spectrum”.</p></p>

            <p><p>At least eight officials of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) were arrested on Thursday along with the owner of a building that recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050">collapsed</a> in Karachi’s Lyari, claiming <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922486/death-toll-in-lyari-building-collapse-stands-at-27-as-rescue-operation-ends-on-3rd-day">27 lives</a>.</p>
<p>The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market collapsed on Friday morning, with the rescue operations concluding on Sunday. The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, with the SBCA saying it had issued <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=SBCA%20says%20issued%20multiple%20prior%20notices%20to%20vacate%20building">multiple prior notices</a> to residents to vacate the structure since 2023.</p>
<p>South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the arrests were made today after a first information report (FIR) was registered a day ago.</p>
<p>“Nine officials and the present owner of the building were nominated in the FIR registered on a complaint of an official of the local government department. However, eight directors and deputy directors were arrested but one official was not arrested as he was sick,” he said. adding that the owner was arrested as well.</p>
<p>The provincial government had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922557">suspended</a> SBCA Director General Ishaque Khuhro and announced strict action against all those responsible for the incident on Monday. Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said a fact-finding committee had been formed to present a report on the incident, adding that the Sindh chief minister ordered the home minister to immediately register an FIR.</p>
<p>The FIR was registered at the Baghdadi Police Station on the complaint of Hamadullah, a section officer of the Sindh Local Government and Housing Town Planning Department, under Sections 34 (common intention), 217 (public servant disobeying direction of law with intent to save person from punishment or property from forfeiture), 218 (public servant framing incorrect record or writing intent to save person from punishment or property from forfeiture), 288 (negligent conduct with respect to pulling down or repairing buildings), 322 (punishment for qatl-bis-sabab), 337-Ai (whoever, by doing any act with the intention of thereby causing hurt to any person, or with the knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause hurt to any person causes shajjah-i-khafifah) and 427 (mischief causing damage amounting to Rs50) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p>
<p>The FIR said the building, spread over 527.3 square yards, was constructed in 1986. Its owner constructed the five-storey plus ground floor building in two portions, and for a considerable period, both portions (buildings) were in dilapidated condition and were unlivable. It added that one building with 20 apartments collapsed on July 4 due to the “criminal negligence” of the SBCA officials and the owner.</p>
