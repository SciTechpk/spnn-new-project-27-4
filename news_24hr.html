            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908601/sbp-cuts-interest-rate-by-100bps-to-11pc' target='_blank'><strong>SBP cuts interest rate by 100bps to 11pc</strong></a>
            <p><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) cut the policy rate on Monday to 11 per cent, amid trade and industry sectors advocating for a significant cut.</p>
<p>The central bank’s policy rate, after being slashed by 1,000bps from 22pc since June 2024 in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1888017">six intervals</a>, previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897015">stood at 12pc</a>.</p>
<p>April inflation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908067/inflation-hits-all-time-low-of-03pc">stood</a> at a low of 0.3pc, largely due to a high base a year ago. The reduction is also primarily attributed to lower prices of key food staples such as wheat and its derivatives, onions, potatoes and certain pulses, as well as a cut in electricity and fuel charges. These items carry significant weight in the inflation basket — the Consumer Price Index (CPI) — meaning minor price changes can heavily influence the overall rate.</p>
<p>According to a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.sbp.org.pk/press/2025/Pr-05-May-2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a> issued by the SBP today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the interest rate, noting that inflation in April turned out to be lower than expected, mainly due to a drop in prices of perishable food items and electricity and fuel charges.</p>
<p>According to the statement, core inflation declined in April, primarily reflecting favourable base-effect amid moderate demand conditions.</p>
<p>“Overall, the MPC assessed that the inflation outlook has improved further relative to the previous assessment,” the statement said.</p>
<p>The committee viewed that the heightened global uncertainty surrounding trade tariffs and geopolitical developments could pose challenges for the economy.</p>
<p>“In this backdrop, the MPC emphasised the importance of maintaining a measured monetary policy stance,” it said.</p>
<p>The committee also noted key developments since the last meeting.</p>
<p>It said that the provisional real GDP growth for Q2-FY25 was reported at 1.7 per cent year-on-year whereas Q1 growth was revised up to 1.3pc from 0.9pc.</p>
<p>“Second, the current account recorded a sizable surplus of $1.2 billion in March, mainly due to record-high workers’ remittances,” it said.</p>
<p>It said that the surplus and SBP’s foreign exchange purchases partially cushioned the impact of large ongoing debt repayments on the SBP’s foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>It also said that recent surveys suggested further improvement in both consumer and business sentiments, adding that shortfall in tax collection has continued to widen.</p>
<p>“Global uncertainty, particularly around tariffs, has led the IMF to sharply downgrade its 2025 and 2026 growth projections for both advanced and emerging economies,” the statement said, adding that the tariff uncertainty also triggered heightened financial market volatility and a sharp decline in global oil prices.</p>
<p>“Considering the evolving developments and risks, the MPC viewed that the real policy rate remains adequately positive to stabilise inflation in the target range of 5pc to 7pc, while ensuring that the economy grows on a sustainable basis,” it said.</p>
<p>Separately, the statement said that headline inflation, continuing its downtrend, fell to 0.3pc y/y in April, driven primarily by food and energy prices.</p>
<p>“A sharp decline in wheat and allied product prices, moderation in global commodity prices and downward adjustment in electricity tariffs were the major drivers of this ease in food and energy prices,” the statement said.</p>
<p>“These factors also contributed to the moderation in inflation expectations of consumers,” it said.</p>
<p>Moreover, core inflation, after remaining sticky at around 9pc over the past few months, declined to 8.0pc y/y in April, it added.</p>
<p>The statement said that going forward, the committee anticipated inflation to gradually inch up in the coming months and stabilise within the target range of 5pc to 7pc.</p>
<p>“This outlook is, however, subject to both upside and downside risks emanating from volatility in wheat and other food prices, timing and magnitude of energy price adjustments, potential global supply-chain disruptions and uncertain commodity price outlook.”</p>
<p>Earlier, it noted that despite a long-term decline in inflation and real interest rates above 11pc, opinions on the central bank’s likely decision on the policy rate were divided, with trade and industry sectors advocating for a significant cut.</p>
<p>Researchers had conducted polls to gauge market sentiment, but the 0.3pc inflation in April has caused division among those who were confident there would be no change in the interest rate.</p>
<p>However, many experts <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908316">believed</a> the SBP would cut the rate by 50bps. Some had also found reasons for a likely status quo as they feel the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">war-like situation</a> between India and Pakistan has created uncertainty that may escalate prices.</p>
<p>This situation may force the central bank to adopt a cautious approach in the face of sudden shocks of higher inflation.</p>
<p>The SBP’s MPC met today to set the key interest rate for the next two months. In March, the central bank delivered a surprise by leaving its policy rate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897015">unchanged</a> in the last review, disappointing the business community.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Supreme Court’s (SC) Constitutional Bench on Monday reserved its verdict on the appeals against the decision to declare the trial of civilians in military courts null and void, saying it would announce the verdict later this week.</p>
<p>The development came as the CB resumed hearing a case pertaining to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783105">military trials</a> and the subsequent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881338">sentencing of civilians</a> for their role in attacks on army installations during the riots that followed ex-premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">Imran Khan’s arrest</a> on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9, 2023</a>.</p>
<p>The CB resumed hearing a set of 38 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1797503">intra-court appeals</a> (ICAs) moved by the federal and provincial gover­nments as well as Shuhada Forum Balochistan, among others, against the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783105">widely-praised</a> Oct 23, 2023, ruling by a five-judge bench that unanimously declared that trying the accused civilians in military courts <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783065/may-9-riots-sc-declares-military-trials-of-civilians-null-and-void">violated the Constitution</a>.</p>
<p>The bench — led by Justice Aminuddin and also including Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, and Shahid Bilal Hassan — is reviewing whether the trial of civilians in military courts is constitutional or not.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#the-hearing" id="the-hearing" title="Permalink"></a>The hearing</h2>
<p>At the outset of today’s hearing, Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan said he would begin by speaking about what happened on May 9.</p>
<p>“Our country is in a state of war almost all year round,” he said. “Army installations were attacked under a well-thought-out plan; on May 9, 49 places were attacked from 3pm onwards,” he said.</p>
<p>He noted that a prime minister had been hanged in Pakistan — referring to the hanging of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto— but even then there was no such protest. “No political party had attacked the army in the past.”</p>
<p>The attorney general further referenced Pakistan’s political history, saying that all parties had been banned during the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD).</p>
<p>“The entire MRD leadership was in chains, Asghar Khan was under house arrest for three and a half years,” the AGP said. “Even during this time, no one took a step like people did on May 9.”</p>
<p>“Even if this was a reaction to May 9, it cannot be allowed; ours is not an ordinary country,” the AGP said. “Due to geography, we face a lot of threats.”</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail remarked that the question before the court was not about whether a crime was committed, saying: “You come to the appeal, tell us about the appeal.”</p>
<p>As he continued his arguments, AGP Awan said that the army took departmental action for negligence in the Jinnah House attack.</p>
<p>“Three senior officers were retired without pension and benefits, including a lieutenant general, a brigadier and a lieutenant colonel,” he said.</p>
<p>“Dissatisfaction was expressed with the performance of 14 officers, dislike and distrust means that they cannot get any further promotion,” the AGP said.</p>
<p>To this, Justice Mandokhail asked whether the army had initiated criminal proceedings against any army officer.</p>
<p>The attorney general said that criminal action would have been taken only when a crime had been committed, noting that departmental action had been taken for not stopping the incidents of May 9.</p>
<p>“The Army Act is clear that departmental action will also be accompanied by criminal punishment,” Justice Mandokhail replied.</p>
<p>The attorney general then said that he would present arguments on May 9, as well as the July 21 decision and appeal.</p>
<p>“There were 23 incidents in Punjab, eight in KP, seven in Sindh and one in Balochistan. General Headquarters, Lahore, Mianwali Air Base, and ISI offices were attacked.</p>
<p>“All the incidents on May 9 were not accidental — the entire corps was inactive from 5:30pm to 9pm. If there was an external aggression on Lahore on May 9, it could not have been responded to,” the AGP said.</p>
<p>Justice Hassan Azhar Rizvi remarked that at the time of Bhutto’s execution, people were making arrests and people set themselves on fire and self-immolated. “No one set property on fire at that time.”</p>
<p>The attorney general was in agreement, saying that his father himself had faced cases as a political activist yet it never occurred to anyone to damage the property by burning it.</p>
<p>Justice Hilali asked whether the gate of Jinnah House was broken open or if someone had opened it from inside.</p>
<p>“If someone opened it from inside, it would be a crime of collusion,” the AGP said, adding that he would check and confirm this.</p>
<p>Justice Mandokhail asked whether what happened on May 9 was done with the intention of committing a crime.</p>
<p>“Was the intention to register a protest or to attack? Maybe the intention was to protest but the matter got out of hand. It should not have gone beyond the limit but it did,” Justice Mandokhail said.</p>
<p>“What happened on May 9 was a crime,” AGP Awan said.</p>
<p>Here, Justice Afghan told the attorney general that he had gone down the wrong path.</p>
<p>“We did not allow anyone to talk about the merits of the May 9 incident. Talking about the merits will affect the cases in the trial and appeal. If we go into the details of May 9, many questions will arise.</p>
<p>“Many questions arise that you may not be able to answer, such as whether the general who retired without pension was the Lahore Corps Commander,” Justice Afghan asked.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#military-courts-sentences" id="military-courts-sentences" title="Permalink"></a>Military courts’ sentences</h2>
<p>On Dec 13, 2024, the SC’s constitutional bench <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1783105">conditionally allowed</a> military courts to pronounce reserved verdicts of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279#:~:text=A%20year%20on%2C%20as%20of%20May%209%2C%202024%2C%2085%20of%20these%20civilians%20are%20still%20in%20military%20custody.">85 civilians</a> who were in custody for their alleged involvement in the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>Subsequently, on December 21, military courts <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880141">sentenced 25 civilians</a> to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their involvement. Days later, another <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881338">60 civilians</a> were handed jail terms of a similar period over the matter.</p>
<p>On January 2, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884089">mercy petitions</a> of 19 accused were accepted on humanitarian grounds, while 48 other pleas have been processed to Courts of Appeal.</p>
<p>The sentencing of civilians by military courts was not only condemned by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880270">PTI</a>, but the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880757/may-9-riots-us-joins-uk-eu-in-voicing-concerns-over-military-trials-of-civilians">United States</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880609/trying-civilians-in-military-courts-lacks-transparency-uk-says-after-may-9-fgcm-convictions">United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880384">European Union</a> also raised concerns, saying the move contradicted international laws.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908587/icj-throws-out-sudan-genocide-case-against-uae' target='_blank'><strong>ICJ throws out Sudan genocide case against UAE</strong></a>
            <p><p>The top United Nations court on Monday threw out Sudan’s case against the United Arab Emirates over alleged complicity in genocide during the brutal Sudanese civil war.</p>
<p>Sudan has dragged the UAE before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, arguing it is supplying weapons to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1747924/sudanese-paramilitary-claims-control-of-key-buildings-in-coup-bid/1000">battling</a> the Sudanese army since 2023.</p>
<p>The UAE denies supporting the rebels and has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1840857">dismissed</a> Sudan’s case as “political theatre” distracting from efforts to end a war that has killed tens of thousands.</p>
<p>The ICJ said today it “manifestly lacked” jurisdiction to rule on the case and threw out it out.</p>
<p>A UAE official hailed the judges’ ruling.</p>
<p>“This decision is a clear and decisive affirmation of the fact that this case was utterly baseless,” Reem Ketait, aeputy assistant minister for political affairs at the UAE foreign ministry, said in a statement sent to <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Before the ruling, Ketait had accused Sudan of lodging the case in a “cynical attempt to divert attention from their own brutal record of atrocities against Sudanese civilians”.</p>
<p>When the UAE signed up to the UN’s Genocide Convention in 2005, it entered a “reservation” to a key clause that allows countries to sue others at the ICJ over disputes.</p>
<p>Since April 2023, Sudan has been torn apart by a power <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1749217/what-is-happening-in-sudan-fighting-in-khartoum-explained">struggle</a> between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.</p>
<p>The war has triggered what aid agencies <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878096">describe</a> as the world’s largest displacement and hunger crises. Famine has officially hit five areas across Sudan, according to a UN-backed assessment.</p>
<p>The North Darfur region has been a particular battleground, with at least 542 civilians killed in the past three weeks, according to the United Nations.</p>
<p>The ICJ said it was “deeply concerned about the unfolding human tragedy in Sudan that forms the backdrop to the present dispute”.</p>
<p>“The violent conflict has a devastating effect, resulting in untold loss of life and suffering, in particular in West Darfur,” the court added.</p>
<p>A world away from the horrors on the ground, lawyers in robes and wigs thrashed out legal arguments in hearings last month in the panelled splendour of the ICJ’s Peace Palace.</p>
<p>Muawia Osman, Sudan’s acting justice minister, told the court last month, “[The] ongoing genocide would not be possible without UAE complicity, including the shipment of arms to the RSF.”</p>
<p>“The direct logistical and other support that the UAE has provided and continues to provide to the RSF has been and continues to be the primary driving force behind the genocide now taking place, including killing, rape, forced displacement and looting,” he added.</p>
<p>Responding for the UAE, top foreign ministry official Reem Ketait said Sudan’s allegations were “at best misleading and at worst pure fabrications”.</p>
<p>“This case is the most recent iteration of the applicant’s misuse of our international institutions as a stage from which to attack the UAE,” Ketait added.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#full-reparations" id="full-reparations" title="Permalink"></a>Full reparations</h2>
<p>In the end, legal experts had said Sudan’s case may flounder on technical jurisdictional issues.</p>
<p>“There is clearly no basis for the court’s jurisdiction in this case,” the UAE’s Ketait told the judges.</p>
<p>The UAE had called for the case to be thrown out and removed from the court’s list.</p>
<p>Sudan argued the UAE’s reservation was “incompatible” with the purpose of the Genocide Convention, which emphasises global collective responsibility to prevent the world’s worst crimes.</p>
<p>Khartoum wanted ICJ judges to force the UAE to stop its alleged support for the RSF and make “full reparations”, including compensation to victims of the war.</p>
<p>The rulings of the ICJ, which hears disputes between states, are final and binding, but the court has no means to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Judges ordered Russia to halt its invasion of Ukraine to no avail, for example, and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1846750">ruled</a> that Israel’s 57-year occupation of Palestinian land was illegal.</p></p>
