            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915359/bilawal-led-delegation-reaches-washington-after-wrapping-up-ny-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal-led delegation reaches Washington after wrapping up NY visit</strong></a>
            <p><p>The high-powered delegation, led by former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, has reached Washington after concluding its two-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow">visit</a> to the United Nations Headquarters in New York on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pakis­tan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">launched</a> a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence here.</p>
<p>The delegation comprises Senator Rehman, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt and Jalil Abbas Jilani.</p>
<p>In New York, the delegation “drew attention to India’s illegal use of force and violations of international law, including the UN Charter and International Humanitarian Law, particularly targeting of civilian areas and killing of innocent civilians, including women and children”, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>It added that the delegation rejected India’s allegations regarding the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909746">attack</a> in India-occupied Kashmir “without a shred of evidence, and warned against India’s weaponisation of water through its unilateral hold on the IWT [Indus Waters Treaty] in violation of international law and treaty obligations”.</p>
<p>According to the statement, the delegation met with the UN secretary-general, the president of the General Assembly, the president of the Security Council, the representatives of the Security Council’s permanent and non-permanent members, ambassadors of the OIC Group, representatives of the media, civil society, and think tanks, and the Pakistani community.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Furthermore, the delegation highlighted the country’s role and commitment to combating terrorism in all forms, while also “drawing attention of the international community towards Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan, and its transnational assassination campaign”.</p>
<p>“Cooperation, not politicisation, was required to effectively combat the menace of terrorism, it was underlined,” the statement said.</p>
<p>The delegation also emphasised the country’s responsible and lawful response to Indian aggression and provocations, adding that Pakistan “seeks peace but will always defend its sovereignty with resolve”.</p>
<p>It warned that Indian attempts to create a “new normal” that implied arbitrary and unilateral strikes could lead to disastrous consequences in South Asia’s nuclear environment, reiterating that peace in the region hinged on a just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in line with the UN Security Council resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>“The international community was urged to uphold international law and the sanctity of treaties, push for the revival and normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty, and support the initiation of a comprehensive dialogue to resolve all outstanding issues between India and Pakistan, including the core dispute of Jammu and Kashmir,” the statement read.</p>
<p>Speaking at a press conference at UN Headquarters, Bilawal said coope­ration between Pakistan and India’s intelligence agencies could significantly reduce terrorism in South Asia.</p>
<p>“I am completely confident that if ISI and RAW were ready to sit down and work together to fight these forces, we would see a significant decrease in terrorism in both India and Pakistan,” he added.</p>
<p>He also urged the global community to remain engaged in South Asia, warning that the risk of conflict between nuclear-armed neighbours had grown, not diminished, after the recent ceasefire.</p>
<p>“With the intervention of the international community — and I would like to mention particularly the role played by the US President Donald Trump and his team led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio — we did manage to achieve a ceasefire between India and Pakistan,” said Bilawal. “This is a welcome first step, but it’s only a first step.”</p>

<p>Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, detailing PM Shehbaz’s recent multi-state <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow">visit</a>, said the international community was lauding Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts.</p>
<p>“We are being praised for our kinetic actions”, he said, adding that Pakistan’s narrative was clear to the international community from the beginning and remained so until the resolution of the conflict.</p>
<p>While addressing a press conference, FM Dar said the delegation led by PM Shehbaz expressed gratitude for the support of countries to Pakistan throughout the period of tension, particularly Turkiye and Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>“People in Turkiye and Azerbaijan took to the streets to celebrate the resolution,” he said, noting that Pakistan’s victory was a victory for the entire Muslim community.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Appreciating Turkiye’s role in de-escalation efforts, he recalled that on the night of May 6, when India attacked, his Turkish counterpart was “the first one to call and ask if there is anything they can do for Pakistan”.</p>
<p>He further said that in the wake of the recent events, India’s “hegemony has been destroyed” and its supremacy “blown in the air”, adding that Indians were now blaming each other while Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts were being globally acknowledged.</p></p>

            <p><p>At least seven people were killed in a stampede outside a cricket stadium in India’s Bengaluru, where an event was being held to celebrate Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s first Indian Premier League title win, TV channels reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bengaluru beat Punjab Kings in the tournament’s final match on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Thousands of people, some of them waving the team’s red flag, lined the streets leading up to the Chinnaswamy Stadium in the heart of the city as the cricket team arrived at the venue in a bus in the evening, television channels showed.</p>
<p>Visuals after the stampede showed a policeman carrying an injured spectator to an ambulance, while people gathered around a second person who lay seemingly unconscious on the ground.</p>
<p>Stampedes and other accidents are not uncommon when large crowds gather in India, including during religious events.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915388/irans-khamenei-dismisses-us-nuclear-proposal-vows-to-keep-enriching-uranium' target='_blank'><strong>Iran’s Khamenei dismisses US nuclear proposal, vows to keep enriching uranium</strong></a>
            <p><p>Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that abandoning <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914527/iran-steps-up-production-of-highly-enriched-uranium-iaea">uranium enrichment</a> was “100 per cent” against the country’s interests, rejecting a central US demand in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912469/iran-us-nuclear-talks-set-for-rome-this-week">talks</a> to resolve a decades-long dispute over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914989">US proposal</a> for a new nuclear deal was presented to Iran on Saturday by Oman, which has mediated talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.</p>
<p>After five rounds of talks, several hard-to-bridge issues remain, including Iran’s insistence on maintaining uranium enrichment on its soil and Tehran’s refusal to ship abroad its entire existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium — possible raw material for nuclear bombs.</p>
<p>Khamenei, who has the final say on all matters of state, said nothing about halting the talks, but said the US proposal “contradicts our nation’s belief in self-reliance and the principle of ‘We Can’”.</p>
<p>“Uranium enrichment is the key to our nuclear programme and the enemies have focused on the enrichment,” Khamenei said during a televised speech marking the anniversary of the death of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.</p>
<p>“The proposal that the Americans have presented is 100pc against our interests … The rude and arrogant leaders of America repeatedly demand that we should not have a nuclear programme. Who are you to decide whether Iran should have enrichment?” he added.</p>
<p>“Independence means not waiting for the green light from America and the likes of America.”</p>
<p>Khamenei said, “If we have 100 nuclear power plants but don’t have enrichment, they will be of no use to us,” because “nuclear power plants need fuel” to operate. “If we cannot produce this fuel domestically, we have to reach out to the United States, which may have dozens of conditions.”</p>
<p>Tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and has long denied accusations by Western powers that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#maximum-pressure" id="maximum-pressure" title="Permalink"></a>‘Maximum pressure’</h2>
<p><em>Reuters</em> reported on Monday that Tehran was poised to reject the US proposal as a “non-starter” that failed to soften Washington’s stance on uranium enrichment or to address Tehran’s interests.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>The <em>New York Times</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/us/politics/iran-nuclear-deal-proposal.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on Tuesday that the US proposal includes “an arrangement that would allow Iran to continue enriching uranium at low levels” as the US and other countries “work out a more detailed plan intended to block Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon”.</p>
<p>It said the proposal would see the United States facilitating “the building of nuclear power plants for Iran and negotiate the construction of enrichment facilities managed by a consortium of regional countries”.</p>
<p>Iran has previously said it is open to temporary limits on its enrichment of uranium and is willing to consider the establishment of a regional nuclear fuel consortium. But it has stressed that such a consortium is “in no way intended to replace Iran’s own uranium enrichment programme”.</p>
<p>Trump has revived his “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran since his return to the White House in January, which included tightening sanctions and threatening to bomb Iran if the negotiations yield no deal.</p>
<p>Trump wants to curtail Tehran’s potential to produce a nuclear weapon that could trigger a regional nuclear arms race and perhaps threaten Israel. Iran’s clerical establishment, for its part, wants to be rid of devastating sanctions.</p>
<p>During his first term, Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1405945">ditched</a> Tehran’s 2015 nuclear pact with six powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy. Iran responded by escalating enrichment far beyond the pact’s limits.</p>
<p>Iran’s clerical establishment is grappling with multiple crises — energy and water shortages, a plunging currency, losses among regional militia proxies in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912630/iran-says-will-hold-us-responsible-for-any-israeli-attack-on-its-nuclear-sites">conflicts</a> with Israel, and rising fears of an Israeli strike on its nuclear sites — all intensified by Trump’s hardline stance.</p>
<p>Iran’s arch-foe Israel, which sees Tehran’s nuclear programme as an existential threat, has repeatedly threatened to bomb the Islamic Republic’s nuclear facilities to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Tehran has vowed a harsh response.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#less-than-satisfactory" id="less-than-satisfactory" title="Permalink"></a>‘Less than satisfactory’</h2>
<p>In its latest quarterly report last week, the IAEA said Iran had further <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914610">stepped up</a> its production of highly enriched uranium.</p>
<p>In a separate report, it also criticised “less than satisfactory” cooperation from Tehran, particularly in explaining past cases of nuclear material found at undeclared sites.</p>
<p>Iran currently enriches uranium to 60pc, far above the 3.67pc limit set in the 2015 deal but still short of the 90pc threshold needed for a nuclear warhead.</p>
<p>The reports came ahead of a planned IAEA Board of Governors meeting in Vienna later this month which will review Iran’s nuclear activities.</p>
<p>Britain, France and Germany, the three European countries who were party to the 2015 deal, are currently weighing whether to trigger the sanctions “snapback” mechanism in the accord.</p>
<p>The mechanism would reinstate UN sanctions in response to Iranian non-compliance — an option that expires in October.</p>
<p>Iran has criticised the IAEA report as unbalanced, saying it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907133/iran-accuses-israels-netanyahu-of-dictating-us-policy-in-nuclear-talks">relied</a> on “forged documents” provided by Israel.</p></p>
