                <h2>Pakistani pilgrims barred from by-road travel to Iran, Iraq this Arbaeen: interior minister</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistani pilgrims will be barred from travelling by road to Iran and Iraq for the Arbaeen pilgrimage due to public and national security, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Pilgrims <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855955">visit Iraq</a> to attend the chehlum commemoration ‚Äî also known as Arbaeen (40 in Arabic) ‚Äî to mark the 40th day of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922472/ashura-processions-in-major-cities-of-country-conclude-peacefully">mourning</a> for the martyrdom of Imam Husain, the grandson of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter extensive consultations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [the] Balochistan Government, and security agencies, it has been decided that <em>zaireen</em> (pilgrims) will not be allowed to travel to Iraq and Iran by road for Arbaeen this year,‚Äù Naqvi said on X.</p>
<p>He added that the ‚Äúdifficult decision was taken in the interest of public safety and national security‚Äù.</p>
<p>However, the pilgrims will be able to travel by air, the minister noted.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Naqvi stressed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed authorities to ‚Äúarrange maximum flights to facilitate their pilgrimage in the coming days‚Äù.</p>
<p>Naqvi‚Äôs statement came after he met with PM Shehbaz earlier today to brief him on the new policy for pilgrims, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> (<em>APP</em>) <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/interior-minister-calls-on-pm-briefs-over-zaireens-new-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The premier also directed Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif to arrange ‚Äúspecial flights for the pilgrims, <em>APP</em> stated, citing a press release from the PM Office.</p>
<p>Iraq‚Äôs Karbala, where Imam Hussein and his brother Abbas are buried in two enormous mausoleums facing each other, is the centre of the Shia world during this time. More than <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854804/millions-of-pilgrims-rally-for-arbaeen">21 million</a> devotees took part in the pilgrimage last year.</p>
<p>Pakistan is set to introduce a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922178">new travel management system</a> from Jan 1, 2026, under which pilgrims will only be allowed to undertake the journey under registered organisers.</p>

<p>Under the new measures, the traditional Salar System will be abolished and replaced with a Zaireen Group Organisers model. Alongside weekly flights to Iran being increased from six to 15, 107 additional special flights will also be arranged for pilgrims heading to Iraq.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousuf <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925358/religious-affairs-minister-retracts-40000-missing-pilgrims-remark">retracted</a> his statement that 40,000 pilgrims had not returned from trips to Iran and Iraq. He clarified that a ‚Äúmisunderstanding‚Äù of outdated paper records that had not yet been fully digitised resulted in the statement.</p>

<p>During their meeting, PM Shehbaz and Naqvi also discussed the law and order situation in Balochistan, with the premier telling the minister to initiate work on the Gwadar Safe City project.</p>

                <h2>GB floods death toll at 10 as rescue operations continue, need for aid mounts</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The death toll from floods in Gilgit-Baltistan stood at 10 as search and rescue operations continued across the region and stranded tourists were moved to safer locations, officials said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">heat¬≠¬≠waves</a>, erratic weat¬≠her patterns and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660">glacial melting</a> have triggered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a> and intense floods across the region.</p>
<p>Floods <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> across GB on Monday, causing landslides, leaving many <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926193">stranded</a>, and damaging more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure.</p>
<p>In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said flood-related incidents in the region have claimed 10 lives since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719">Monday</a>, when four were killed and 15 went missing in Babusar.</p>
<p>The toll in Babusar has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20so%20far%2C%2010%20fatalities%20and%20four%20injuries%20have%20been%20reported.%20Seven%20deaths%20were%20reported%20from%20Babusar%2C%20two%20from%20Thore%20Valley%20(Dia%C2%ADmer)%20and%20another%20from%20Astore%20district.">risen</a> to seven, while two deaths were reported from Diamer‚Äôs Thore Valley and another from the Astore district, Faraq added.</p>
<p>The body of an unidentified woman was recovered from the Indus River in Chilas‚Äôs Minar area. ‚ÄúThe body could be that of one of the tourists swept away at the Babusar Highway,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926705/karakoram-highway-reopened-as-rescue-aid-efforts-continue-in-flood-hit-gb#:~:text=Speaking%20about%20the%20search%20operation%20in%20Babusar%2C%20Faraq%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CThere%20may%20be%2010%20to%2012%20missing%20tourists%20at%20the%20Babusar%20valley%20as%20a%20search%20operation%20was%20ongoing.%E2%80%9D">speaking</a> about the search operation yesterday, Faraq had said there may be 10 to 12 missing tourists at Babusar valley.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSearch operations are underway on Babusar Highway by personnel of the Pakistani Army, district administration and other institutions,‚Äù he said, adding that rescue and relief operations were also underway in Ghanche, Ghizer and Gilgit.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Most tourists trapped in Ferry Meadows have been rescued and moved to a safe place, Faraq said, adding that the Silk Road had been restored for all types of traffic.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt least Rs20 billion worth of damage has been caused by flooding in Gilgit-Baltistan,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe province runs on grants and aid; it will be difficult redressal for the provincial government alone. The federal government should announce a separate reasonable grant for the relief of flood disasters.‚Äù</p>
<p>A day earlier, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan appe¬≠aled to the federal government for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab">Rs7bn in emergency funds</a> to deal with climate-induced disasters that approximately ‚Äúcaused damages exceeding Rs20bn across the region.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said unprecedented floods had impacted seven districts, with Diamer being the worst affected. ‚ÄúPeople in GB are facing daily flood events. At least one flood occurs every day,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The chief minister said that 300 homes were destroyed, 200 were partially damaged, 40 water channels in 30 villages were swept away and 15 kilometres of roads, bridges, agricultural land, crops and public and private infrastructure were severely damaged.</p>
<p>He noted that only Rs1bn was allocated in the GB budget for emergencies and that the local government is also burdened with Rs3bn in liabilities from past disaster rehabilitation efforts.</p></p>
