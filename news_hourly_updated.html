                <h2>Bilawal-led delegation reaches Washington after wrapping up NY visit</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The high-powered delegation, led by former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, has reached Washington after concluding its two-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow">visit</a> to the United Nations Headquarters in New York on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pakis¬≠tan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">launched</a> a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi‚Äôs growing lobbying presence here.</p>
<p>The delegation comprises Senator Rehman, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt and Jalil Abbas Jilani.</p>
<p>In New York, the delegation ‚Äúdrew attention to India‚Äôs illegal use of force and violations of international law, including the UN Charter and International Humanitarian Law, particularly targeting of civilian areas and killing of innocent civilians, including women and children‚Äù, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>It added that the delegation rejected India‚Äôs allegations regarding the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909746">attack</a> in India-occupied Kashmir ‚Äúwithout a shred of evidence, and warned against India‚Äôs weaponisation of water through its unilateral hold on the IWT [Indus Waters Treaty] in violation of international law and treaty obligations‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to the statement, the delegation met with the UN secretary-general, the president of the General Assembly, the president of the Security Council, the representatives of the Security Council‚Äôs permanent and non-permanent members, ambassadors of the OIC Group, representatives of the media, civil society, and think tanks, and the Pakistani community.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the delegation highlighted the country‚Äôs role and commitment to combating terrorism in all forms, while also ‚Äúdrawing attention of the international community towards Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan, and its transnational assassination campaign‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCooperation, not politicisation, was required to effectively combat the menace of terrorism, it was underlined,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>The delegation also emphasised the country‚Äôs responsible and lawful response to Indian aggression and provocations, adding that Pakistan ‚Äúseeks peace but will always defend its sovereignty with resolve‚Äù.</p>
<p>It warned that Indian attempts to create a ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù that implied arbitrary and unilateral strikes could lead to disastrous consequences in South Asia‚Äôs nuclear environment, reiterating that peace in the region hinged on a just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in line with the UN Security Council resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe international community was urged to uphold international law and the sanctity of treaties, push for the revival and normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty, and support the initiation of a comprehensive dialogue to resolve all outstanding issues between India and Pakistan, including the core dispute of Jammu and Kashmir,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>Speaking at a press conference at UN Headquarters, Bilawal said coope¬≠ration between Pakistan and India‚Äôs intelligence agencies could significantly reduce terrorism in South Asia.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am completely confident that if ISI and RAW were ready to sit down and work together to fight these forces, we would see a significant decrease in terrorism in both India and Pakistan,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>He also urged the global community to remain engaged in South Asia, warning that the risk of conflict between nuclear-armed neighbours had grown, not diminished, after the recent ceasefire.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith the intervention of the international community ‚Äî and I would like to mention particularly the role played by the US President Donald Trump and his team led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio ‚Äî we did manage to achieve a ceasefire between India and Pakistan,‚Äù said Bilawal. ‚ÄúThis is a welcome first step, but it‚Äôs only a first step.‚Äù</p></p>

                <h2>14 terrorists killed in North Waziristan operation: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Fourteen terrorists belonging to <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> were killed in an operation by security forces in North Waziristan district‚Äôs Datta Khel in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military‚Äôs media wing <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7313" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Despite heightened military tensions between Pakistan and India last month, militant groups were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914847/militant-attacks-increased-to-85-in-may-picss">unable</a> to significantly escalate their activities in the country, according to data released by an Islamabad-based independent think tank.</p>
<p>The monthly security assessment issued by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) recorded 85 militant attacks in May as compared to 81 in April, resulting in 113 fatalities. These included 52 security forces personnel, 46 civilians, 11 militants, and four peace committee members.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn June 2-3 2025, an intelligence-based operation was conducted by the Security Forces in the general area Datta Khel, North Waziristan District, on the reported presence of <em>khwarij</em> belonging to Indian proxy, <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em>,‚Äù the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.</p>
<p>The statement added that during the conduct of operation, the troops effectively engaged the terrorists‚Äô location and ‚Äúafter an intense exchange of fire, fourteen Indian sponsored <em>khwarij</em> were sent to hell.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúSanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored Kharji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country,‚Äù the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Last month, security forces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913266">killed</a> nine terrorists ‚Äúsponsored‚Äù by India during a series of operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the ISPR.</p>
<p>In July last year, the government, through an official notification, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade">designated</a> the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as <em>Fitna al Khawarij</em>, while mandating all institutions to use the term <em>khariji</em> (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.</p>
<p>ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913266">accused</a> India of activating its ‚Äúassets‚Äù to inte¬≠nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting ‚Äúirr¬≠e¬≠futable evidence‚Äù of Ind¬≠ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind¬≠ian military personnel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPost-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the <em>Fitnah-al-Khawarij</em> and the independent terrorist cells ‚Ä¶ to increase their activity,‚Äù he had said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p></p>
