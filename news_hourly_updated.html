                <h2>Trump says 5 jets were shot down in India-Pakistan conflict</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Friday that five jets were shot down during the recent India-Pakistan conflict that began after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in India-occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam, with the situation calming after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> in May.</p>
<p>Trump, who made his remarks at a dinner with some Republican US lawmakers at the White House, did not specify which side‚Äôs jets he was referring to.</p>
<p>Pakistan had said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">downed six</a> Indian planes after the latter carried out deadly attacks in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, while New Delhi had <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/india-shot-down-high-tech-jets-of-pakistan-confirms-air-marshal-bharti-938212" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed</a> it had downed ‚Äúa few planes‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSomething I‚Äôm very proud of [is that] we stopped a lot of wars. A lot of wars. And these were serious, serious wars; would have been going on,‚Äù Trump said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou had India-Pakistan that was going, and in fact, planes were being shot out of the air. Five, five, four or five, but I think five jets were shot down actually,‚Äù Trump said while talking about the India-Pakistan hostilities, without elaborating or providing further detail.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was getting worse and worse, wasn‚Äôt it? [‚Ä¶] These are two serious nuclear countries and they were hitting each other. It seems like a new form of warfare; you saw it recently, when you looked at what we did in Iran when we knocked out their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920005">nuclear capability</a>, totally knocked out,‚Äù he said, referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">US strikes</a> on Iran‚Äôs three nuclear sites.</p>

<p>Pakistan said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downed five</a> Indian planes in air-to-air combat, later stating that figure <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">as six</a>. India‚Äôs highest-ranking general said in late May that India switched tactics after suffering losses in the air on the first day of hostilities and established an advantage before a ceasefire was announced three days later.</p>
<p>As New Delhi launched deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a>, which Islamabad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">denied</a>, the Pakistan Air Force downed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">five</a> Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">strikes</a> on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>While India <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/india-shot-down-high-tech-jets-of-pakistan-confirms-air-marshal-bharti-938212" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed</a> downing jets, Islamabad has denied any losses of planes and said it hit <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910381">26 Indian targets</a> were hit after its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186#:~:text=The%20strikes%20targeted%20Nur%20Khan%20air%20base">three air bases</a> were targeted.</p>
<p>Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914608">repeatedly</a> said he prevented a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">nuclear war</a>‚Äù between Pakistan and India after Washington held talks with both sides, even <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920139">crediting</a> Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir for helping in it. India has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921534">differed</a> with Trump‚Äôs claims that it resulted from his intervention and his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911719">threats</a> to sever trade talks.</p>

<p>Most recently, on July 7, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923026/trumps-claim-on-averting-india-pakistan-war-gains-new-life">doubled down</a> on its narrative of Trump playing a central role in defusing tensions, despite India claiming otherwise.</p>
<p>Asked about Indian officials‚Äô repeated <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912153">denials</a> of Trump‚Äôs role, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce avoided taking a position. ‚ÄúSo many comments speak for themselves,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>Pressed further, Bruce added, half in jest: ‚ÄúEveryone will have an opinion. That‚Äôs an opinion. Some opinions are wrong. Mine rarely are, but other people‚Äôs opinions can be wrong.‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs statements stand in contrast to India‚Äôs official position, which maintains that New Delhi acted independently during the May crisis and that Washington did not mediate. Trump‚Äôs remarks support Pakistan‚Äôs view that quiet US diplomacy ‚Äî and direct intervention from the White House ‚Äî helped calm tensions.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs position has been that New Delhi and Islamabad must resolve their problems directly and with no outside involvement.</p>

<p>India is an increasingly important US partner in Washington‚Äôs effort to counter China‚Äôs influence in Asia, while Pakistan is a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524">strong partner</a> in counterterrorism.</p>
<p>The April attack in Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">killed 26 men</a> and sparked heavy fighting between the nuclear-armed Asian neighbours in the latest escalation of a decades-old rivalry.</p>
<p>New Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">strongly denied</a> responsibility while calling for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral</a> investigation. Washington condemned the attack but did not directly blame Islamabad.</p></p>

                <h2>Local mountaineer Iftikhar Hussain dies as 4 caught in K2 avalanche</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Local mountaineer Iftikhar Hussain lost his life while a foreign climber sustained injuries when their four-member international expedition team was caught in an avalanche that struck the K2 peak on Friday.</p>
<p>K2, standing at 8,611 metres above sea level, is the second-highest peak in the world, attracting a host of local and foreign tourists. Last summer, Gilgit-Baltistan authorities issued a total of 175 permits to climbers aspiring to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1848754">conquer</a> the mountain, despite the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1848345">treacherous</a> climb and harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>The senior vice president of the Alpine Club of Pakistan (ACP), Karrar Haidri, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that at approximately 12:30pm on Friday, an avalanche struck Camp 1 on K2, located about 500m above the base camp. Four climbers were caught in the avalanche.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA foreign climber sustained minor injuries, while two others successfully returned to the Advance Base Camp,: Haidri said in a statement. However, high-altitude porter Iftikhar Hussain from Sadpara in Skardu lost his life in the incident.</p>
<p>Hussain‚Äôs body has since been recovered and brought down to the base camp, the ACP official added.</p>
<p>The other climbers were Dawa Finjo Sherpa and Dawa Geljen Sherpa from Nepal, and high-altitude porter Niaz Ali from Skardu. The international team was returning from Camp 2 during their rotation for the summit at the time of the incident.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The expedition outfitter submitted a formal request to ACP President Major General Irfan Arshad and Askari Aviation for a helicopter operation to repatriate the deceased following the incident.</p>
<p>The request was approved by the army‚Äôs General Headquarters on humanitarian grounds. According to Haidri, the body will be airlifted by the Army Aviation and transported to Sadpara in Skardu today.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a tourist from the Czech Republic, Kl√°ra Kolouchov√°, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921892">died</a> after falling into a ravine at the Nanga Parbat base camp in GB.</p>
<p>Kolouchov√°, 46, was part of a multinational expedition atte¬≠m¬≠pting to summit the mountain. Her health reportedly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922204/search-underway-to-recover-body-of-czech-climber-at-nanga-parbat">deteriorated</a> at Camp 4, forcing her to abort the climb and begin her de¬≠¬≠s¬≠¬≠¬≠cent with Nepali Sherpa Tara¬≠man Tamang.</p></p>
