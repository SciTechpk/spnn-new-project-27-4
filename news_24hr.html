            <p><p>Chinese air force chief Lieutenant General Wang Gang has lauded the “exemplary performance” of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) during the Pakistan-India conflict in May.</p>
<p>As New Delhi launched deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a>, which Islamabad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">denied</a>, PAF <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">downed six</a> Indian jets in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">retaliation</a>. After tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>The praise from Lt Gen Gang came as a high-level defence delegation led by him called on PAF’s Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu at Air Headquarters in Islamabad, the military’s media affairs wing said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7346" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Lauding the professional acumen and strategic foresight of PAF’s leadership, the visiting dignitary paid rich tribute to the exemplary performance of Pakistan Air Force during the recent conflict with India,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) stated.</p>
<p>Gen Wang, chief of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (Plaaf), praised the “decisive and measured response delivered by PAF pilots under the resolute leadership of the air chief, describing it as a textbook example of precision, discipline and courage in the face of unprovoked aggression”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>During their meeting, the two air force heads discussed “matters of mutual interest, regional security dynamics and avenues of enhanced bilateral cooperation, particularly in the domain of airpower and operational synergy”.</p>
<p>Lt Gen Gang also expressed “deep appreciation for the high state of operational readiness and the cutting-edge capabilities” of the PAF, according to ISPR.</p>
<p>He was “particularly impressed by PAF’s seamless integration of multi-domain operations, terming it a hallmark of modern air warfare and conveyed Plaaf’s keen interest in learning from PAF’s battle-proven experience in multi-domain operations”.</p>
<p>The Plaaf chief was given a comprehensive briefing on PAF’s modern force structure, strategic initiatives and the evolution of its operational doctrine, the ISPR statement added.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Air Chief Marshal Sidhu also reaffirmed the “strong bond of friendship between the two air forces and reiterated PAF’s commitment to expanding cooperation in training, technology and operational domains”.</p>
<p>He extended a gracious welcome to the distinguished guests, reiterating that Pakistan and China enjoy historic and time-tested ties rooted in mutual trust, strategic convergence, and shared aspirations for regional peace and stability.</p>
<p>“The meeting stands as a testament to the shared resolve of Pakistan and China to advance their time-tested strategic partnership through deepened cooperation and innovation-driven collaboration,” the ISPR highlighted.</p>
<p>The meeting came nearly a week after the air chief <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921677/air-chief-meets-senior-military-political-leadership-in-landmark-us-visit">met with</a> senior military and political leadership of the United States in the first official visit by a serving PAF air chief in “over a decade”.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923014/uae-denies-granting-lifetime-golden-visas-to-certain-nationalities' target='_blank'><strong>UAE denies granting lifetime Golden Visas to certain nationalities</strong></a>
            <p><p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) late on Tuesday night denied widespread media reports that claimed it had begun granting lifetime Golden Visas to select nationalities under a “new nomination-based” scheme, according to the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.wam.ae/en/article/bkkw61s-uae-denies-rumours-about-lifetime-golden-visa-for" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Emirates News Agency</em></a> (<em>WAM</em>).</p>
<p>The <a class="link--external" href="https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/residence-visas/golden-visa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Golden Visa</a> is a long-term residence visa that enables foreign talent to live, work, or study in the UAE while enjoying a range of exclusive benefits. According to the UAE government’s official portal, eligible categories include investors, entrepreneurs, scientists, outstanding students and graduates, humanitarian pioneers, and frontline heroes.</p>
<p>This week, several Indian media outlets, including <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.ptinews.com/editor-detail/Indians-can-now-get-UAE-s-Golden-Visa-without-trade-license--property-purchase/2704586" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Press Trust of India</a></em> and <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indians-can-now-get-uaes-golden-visa-without-trade-license-property-purchase/article69782170.ece" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Hindu</a></em>, reported that the UAE government had initiated a “new nomination-based visa policy”, allowing Indians to “enjoy the UAE’s Golden Visa for life by paying a fee of AED100,000”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uae-golden-visa-how-indians-can-now-get-lifetime-residency-without-investment-key-details/amp_articleshow/122288489.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Times of India</a></em> reported that the newly launched scheme was in its pilot phase and was currently available to applicants from both India and Bangladesh, with over 5,000 Indian applications expected in the first three months. Dubai-based <em><a class="link--external" href="https://gulfnews.com/uae/good-news-bangladeshis-can-now-apply-for-uae-golden-visa-remotely-1.500189952" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gulf News</a></em> also reported on Monday that Bangladeshi citizens could apply for the Golden Visa remotely if they meet the requirements.</p>
<p>“The Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has denied the accuracy of rumours circulated by some local and international media outlets and websites regarding the United Arab Emirates granting lifetime Golden Visas to certain nationalities,” the <em>WAM</em> report said.</p>
<p>“ICP clarified that the categories, conditions, and regulations of the Golden Visa are clearly defined in accordance with official laws, legislations, and ministerial decisions.”</p>
<p>According to <em>WAM</em>, the ICP emphasised that “all Golden Visa applications are handled exclusively through official government channels within the UAE, and that no internal or external consultancy entity is recognised as an authorised party in the application process”.</p>
<p>The federal authority said it had “recently observed news articles from a consultancy office based in another country, suggesting that lifetime Golden Visas could be obtained for all categories from outside the UAE via consulting or commercial entities under simplified conditions”.</p>
<p>The <em>WAM</em> report further added: “These claims have no legal basis and were made without coordination with the relevant authorities in the UAE. The federal authority reaffirmed its commitment to providing a safe and transparent environment for applicants.”</p>
<p>It also stated that legal action would be taken against entities “spreading such false information in an attempt to illegally collect money from individuals aspiring to live and reside in the UAE, exploiting their hopes for a dignified and secure life.”</p>
<p>The federal authority urged individuals wishing to visit, live, or invest in the UAE not to respond to inaccurate rumours and false news aimed at a quick profit. They should avoid paying any fees or submitting personal documents to any party claiming to provide these services, the report said.</p>

<p>“I checked with the authorities here, and they say they have no such information. So, the news is likely to be untrue,” Iqbal Marconi, ex-chief executive officer of ECH Group (which <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.khaleejtimes.com/kt-network/golden-horizons-iqbal-marconis-ech-digital-pioneers-uaes-golden-visa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Khaleej Times</a></em> has described as the largest golden visa facilitator in the region), told <em>Economic Times</em>.</p>
<p>“The only new update they have is that crypto investors won’t be considered for the Golden Visa scheme. I checked with the GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs Dubai) also; they too said they don’t have any information on this, “ Marconi said.</p>
<p>He added that a “couple of officials […] in the same line of work” whom he contacted also did not have any information in this regard.</p></p>

            <p><p>An Indian Air Force (IAF) fighter jet crashed near a village in Rajasthan’s Churu district on Wednesday, Indian media outlets reported.</p>
<p>The jet was a Jaguar aircraft that crashed in an agricultural field at around 1:25pm, Rajaldesar Station House Officer Kamlesh told <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.ptinews.com/stories-detail/national/jaguar-fighter-jet-crashes-in-rajasthan/2712385/0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Press Trust of India</a></em>.</p>
<p>Human body parts were found near the crash site, SHO Kamlesh added.</p>

Citing initial reports, the outlet said two pilots were on the plane and there was “no official word yet on their safety”.</p>
<p>A domestically made light combat IAF jet, called Tejas, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1821026">crashed in Rajasthan</a> in March 2024, making it the first such incident since the aircraft was inducted in 2016.</p>
