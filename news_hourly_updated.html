                <h2>Passengers kidnapped in Sardhaka, rescue operation underway: Balochistan govt</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Balochistan government on Thursday said that it has received information about the kidnapping of some passengers near Sardhaka and a search operation is underway to recover them.</p>
<p>A statement from Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind said terrorists belonging to the <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> had carried out attacks in Quetta, Kalat, Mastung and Sardhaka.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInformation has been received about the kidnapping of some passengers near Sardhaka. A search operation has been launched in the area to safely recover the passengers,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Rind added that the security forces responded ‚Äúimmediately and vigorously‚Äù at all three locations, saying they were fully alert to protect the lives, property and belongings of the people.</p>
<p>The police and security forces have not provided details at the moment of the other incidents.</p>
<p>In May this year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525">designated</a> all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna-al-Hindu¬≠stan</em> ‚Äî <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">a new phrase</a> aimed at framing India‚Äôs alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>
<p>In March, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900559/several-killed-vehicles-torched-in-balochistan">five people were killed</a> by armed men who blocked the highway in the Kalmat area of Gwadar district, while three long-body trailers carrying urea from Gwadar port were set on fire in the Tajaban area.</p>
<p>In February, seven Punjab-bound passengers were offloaded from a bus and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892974/">shot dead</a> in Barkhan district. The incident came days after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892214">12 were killed</a> in a blast targeting a bus carrying coal miners in Harnai.</p>
<p>Balochistan has witnessed a spate of attacks targeting those hailing from Punjab. In two separate incidents in April 2024, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1827193">nine people</a> were killed after being forced off a bus near Noshki, while <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1830243">two labourers</a> from Punjab were shot in Kech.</p>
<p>In May last year, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832433">seven barbers</a> from Punjab were shot dead near Gwadar, while August saw <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854830">23 travellers</a> offloaded from trucks and buses and shot in the Musakhail district.</p>
<p>The Musakhail incident was part of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855006">flare-up of violence</a>, where dozens of militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army ‚Äî a separatist outfit ‚Äî launched <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854776/gun-grenade-attacks-in-balochistan">numerous attacks</a> across Balochistan, targeting security personnel as well as civilians.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Field Marshal Asim Munir said India was ‚Äúdoubling down to further its nefarious agenda through its proxies of <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>‚Äù.</p></p>

                <h2>India doubling down on proxy war after clear defeat by Pakistan, says COAS Munir</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir said on Thursday that India was doubling down on its ‚Äúnefarious agenda‚Äù against Pakistan through the use of proxies after facing a ‚Äúmanifest defeat‚Äù in the recent military conflict between the two countries.</p>
<p>India blamed Pakistan for the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> without evidence, triggering a military escalation. On May 6‚Äì7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">missile exchange</a>. A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">US-brokered ceasefire</a> ended the war.</p>
<p>A day earlier, Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923063/dg-ispr-brands-indian-nsa-ajit-doval-chief-architect-of-terrorism-in-pakistan">accused</a> Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval of masterminding terrorism in Pakistan, alleging Indian support for terrorist groups.</p>
<p>Echoing similar sentiments, Field Marshal Munir said, while chairing the 271st Corps Commanders‚Äô Conference (CCC) at the General Headquarters (GHQ), said today: ‚ÄúFollowing its manifest defeat in direct aggression against Pakistan, post-Pahalgam incident, India is now doubling down to further its nefarious agenda through its proxies of <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>.‚Äù</p>
<p>In July last year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349">designated</a> the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em>, while mandating all institutions to use the term <em>khariji</em> (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.</p>
<p>In May this year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525">designated</a> all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna-al-Hindu¬≠stan</em> ‚Äî a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">new phrase</a> aimed at framing India‚Äôs alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7348" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from the ISPR said the CCC participants offered prayers for the martyrs of recent terrorist attacks by ‚ÄúIndian-sponsored proxies‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTaking stock of recent successes against terrorist proxies, forum resolved that blood of our martyrs will not go waste and the safety and security of people of Pakistan remain topmost priority for the armed forces of Pakistan. Forum strongly asserted that it is imperative to take decisive and holistic actions at all levels against the Indian-backed and sponsored proxies.‚Äù</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The ISPR said the forum also noted the Indian military‚Äôs ‚Äúbaseless insinuations to offset its comprehensive defeat‚Äù, in an apparent reference to the deputy Indian army chief alleging last week that China gave Islamabad ‚Äúlive inputs‚Äù on key Indian positions during the conflict.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInvoking third parties in what is unmistakably a bilateral military confrontation reflects a disingenuous attempt at bloc politics aimed at falsely projecting India‚Äôs self-assigned role as a net security provider to accrue benefits in a region that is visibly growing disillusioned with Indian hegemonic ambitions and Hindutva-driven extremism,‚Äù the ISPR quoted Field Marshal Munir as saying on the matter.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The army brass also conducted a holistic review of the prevailing internal and external security dynamics, with particular emphasis on the recent developments in the Middle East and Iran, noting the ‚Äúgrowing propensity for ‚Äòuse of force‚Äô as a preferred policy tool‚Äù, saying it warranted ‚Äúpersistent development of self-reliant capabilities as well as national unity and resolve‚Äù.</p>
<p>The forum‚Äôs members were further briefed on the military‚Äôs ongoing drive with quick adaptation towards the ‚Äúevolving threat spectrum and changing character of war‚Äù. The army chief also appreciated the leadership of the Pakistan Navy and the Pakistan Air Force for ‚Äúfurther strengthening tri-services synergy‚Äù.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir also shared details of the country‚Äôs ‚Äúproactive and successful‚Äù diplomatic manoeuvres, including recent visits to Iran, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where he had accompanied Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúForum was also briefed on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044">historic and unique visit</a> of the COAS to US, where meetings with top-tier leadership afforded an opportunity to share first hand Pakistan‚Äôs objective perspective on bilateral, regional and extra-regional developments.‚Äù</p>
<p>The ISPR said that in his concluding remarks, the army chief expressed ‚Äúfull confidence in the operational readiness of Pakistan Army against complete threat spectrum‚Äù.</p></p>
