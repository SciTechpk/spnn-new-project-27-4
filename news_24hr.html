            <p><p>At least six tourists were killed in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer district as heavy floods battered the region, while a search for missing visitors was underway, an official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudburst-induced</a> floods wreaked havoc across the region. The flood-related <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829">death toll</a> in the region rose to five on Tuesday, after four lost their lives and 15 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719">went missing</a> on Monday.</p>
<p>GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that rescue teams recovered another body in Babusar valley, taking the total number of deaths to six. “The search operation to locate the remaining tourists at Babusar is underway,” he added.</p>
<p>According to Rescue 1122, GB’s Ghanche district experienced floods in various areas. Flash floods in Kandos villages damaged a dozen homes, a dispensary, mosques, agricultural land and crops, it said.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 also stated that flash floods in Sikarkoi damaged several houses and other infrastructure in Dass Mohallah and the surrounding areas in Gilgit.</p>

<p>Separately, rescue teams on Thursday recovered the body of a retired colonel who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/pmd-issues-glof-alert-for-gb-kp-as-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-from-diamer-amid-floods#:~:text=Two%20swept%20away%20in%20Rawalpindi%E2%80%99s%20DHA'">went missing</a> after his car was swept away by floodwaters and slipped into a drain in Rawalpindi last week, while a search for his daughter continues, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>Rescue efforts have been underway since Tuesday, when Retired Colonel Ishaq Qazi, aged approximately 62–64 years, and his 25-year-old daughter went missing after the car they were in was swept away by rainwater.</p>
<p>District Emergency Officer (DEO) Sibghatullah said, “The body of Ishaq had been found near the Soan River bridge, while rescue operations are underway to look for his daughter.”</p>
<p>Earlier today, Sibghatullah had said that rescue operations had entered a third day to search for the duo, while parts of their car had been found.</p>
<p>“Rescue 1122 found the bonnet and a door of the car under the Soan River bridge,” he said.</p>
<p>According to a statement by Islamabad’s Sihala police station on Tuesday, the duo were in a grey Honda vehicle and were residents of Defence Housing Authority’s Phase 5.</p>
<p>“Due to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain,” the police statement from Tuesday said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, two girls were among four people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925919">swept away</a> in separate incidents due to flash flooding in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>Pakistan experiences <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925461">monsoon rainfall</a> from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>Last week, Section 144 was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924761">imposed</a> across Punjab along with a state of emergency in several districts as heavy rains triggered flooding and claimed over 60 lives across the province in 24 hours.</p>

<p>On the other hand, residents of a housing society blocked Rawalpindi’s Grand Trunk Road after the rescue teams could not recover the body of a teenager who had drowned a day earlier.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, a 17-year-old boy drowned while crossing a nullah near the Metro City Housing Society. He was walking on a small passage when high-speed torrents swept him away in deep waters.</p>
<p>Two of his relatives jumped in the water to rescue him, but they told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the water was moving at high speed and the boy could not be saved.</p>
<p>Gujar Khan assistant superintendent of police and assistant commissioner also reached the spot and called the Rescue 1122 team, who were unable to retrieve the body as of the filing of this report. The residents of the area blocked the GT Road, citing the “inaction and incapacity of Rescue 1122 in recovering the victim’s body after many hours”.</p></p>

            <p><p>A bogie of a Quetta-bound Bolan Mail train was “partially damaged” on Thursday after an explosion struck a railway track in Balochistan’s Sibi district, officials said.</p>
<p>The 3Up train usually departs Karachi City Station in the day and arrives the next day in Quetta, with over 20 stops on its way, according to Pakistan Railways’ <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakrailways.gov.pk/train" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>“The railway track between Bakhtiarabad and Damboli areas was blown up with explosives, resulting in the Bolan Mail heading from Karachi to Quetta being hit,” station master Murtaza told reporters in Sibi.</p>
<p>He added that bogie No. 7 of the train was “partially damaged” in the incident. The train reached the Sibi railway station safely, he confirmed.</p>
<p>A statement by Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Quetta Railway divisional superintendent, said: “We were informed that a blast occurred on the track at KM No. 200 between Damboli and Dangra while train 3UP was passing.</p>
<p>“However, the train passed safely and is now reaching Sibi. Train 40UP has been controlled at DMJJ (Dera Murad Jamali Station) as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents when train tracks were blown up, targeting the province’s transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>Train services betw­een Quetta and the rest of the country were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900566">restored</a> on March 27, after they were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897306/all-trains-to-and-from-balochistan-suspended">suspended</a> due to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419">unprecedented hijacking</a> of the Pesha­war-bound Jaffar Express earlier that month.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897595/balochistan-standoff-ends-after-all-jaffar-express-hostages-rescued#:~:text=In%20all%2C%2021%20passengers%20lost%20their%20lives%2C%20while%20four%20FC%20personnel%20were%20martyred%2C%20the%20ISPR%20DG%20said.">21 passengers</a> and four security personnel. “All 33 terrorists” were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.</p>
<p>In June, a powerful explosion of a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks caused four bogies of the Jaffer Express to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917945">derail in Jacobabad</a>. No one was hurt in the incident.</p>
<p>In April, the 3UP train was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904018">stopped</a> at Jacobabad railway station due to security reasons.</p></p>

            <p><p>Pakistan and Saudi Arabia on Thursday emphasised mutual resolve to enhance bilateral defence cooperation and discussed the evolving regional security dynamics within the Middle East and South Asia, particularly focusing on maritime security, a statement issued by the military’s media wing said.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in mutual economic <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885389">interests</a>, strategic military cooperation, and shared Islamic heritage. Historically, these ties have encompassed economic assistance, energy supplies and military collaboration, with Saudi Arabia being a significant <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889514">source</a> of financial aid and oil for Pakistan.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the Royal Saudi Naval Forces’ (RSNF) chief of staff, Vice Admiral Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Ghuraybi, called on Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, NI (M), at the joint staff headquarters in Rawalpindi today.</p>
<p>The dignitaries discussed the evolving regional security dynamics within the Middle East and South Asia, particularly focusing on maritime security.</p>
<p>“The CJCSC highlighted the historical brotherly relations between [the] Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and [the] Islamic Republic of Pakistan, and emphasised mutual resolve for enhancing existing bilateral defence cooperation,” the ISPR said.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Al Ghuraybi also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925853">met</a> with Pakistan’s chief of naval staff, Admiral Naveed Ashraf, at the Naval Headquarters in Islamabad on Tuesday, according to a statement by the Pakistan Navy’s Director General Public Relations (DGPR).</p>
<p>During the meeting, both leaders discussed “matters of mutual interest, (the) regional maritime security situation, and avenues for enhanced (cooperation) in defence, training and security”, according to the DGPR.</p>
<p>The two naval chiefs pledged to further strengthen and diversify the scope of the existing bilateral defence relationship between the countries.</p>
