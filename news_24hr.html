            <p><p>• Forces continue to trade fire at LoC; checkpost in held-Kashmir destroyed after ‘unprovoked firing’<br />
• India closes airspace for Pakistani planes until May 23; flights to GB cancelled for a few hours<br />
• US Secy of State urges PM Shehbaz to help probe Pahalgam attack; tells New Delhi to work with Pakistan for de-escalation</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Amid a flurry of diplomatic activity aimed at calming tensions in the Subcontinent, fears of a possible <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907576/pakistan-wont-initiate-but-will-respond-strongly-to-any-indian-escalation-dar">military confrontation</a> between India and Pakistan continued to persist on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Following a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390">statement</a> by Information Minister Atta Tarar in the early hours of Wednesday, where he warned of a possible incursion by India within the next 24-36 hours, a number of incidents of Indian aggression heightened tensions.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em>, Pakistani security forces delivered a robust response to India’s unprovoked ceasefire violation along the Line of Control (LoC), destroying an Indian checkpost after late-night aggression on April 29-30.</p>
<p>According to security officials, Indian troops resorted to unprovoked small arms fire in the Kiani and Mandal sectors, which was met with a prompt response.</p>
<p>Sources told <em>APP</em> that the retaliatory strikes destroyed several bunkers, including the Chakputra post in India-held Kashmir.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> also reported that a conversation was held between top army officers from India and Pakistan — without naming them.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Separately, state media also reported that a “timely and swift response” by Pakistan Air Force (PAF) had forced four Indian Rafale jets to retreat.</p>
<p>Quoting security sources, state-run <em>PTV</em> and <em>Radio Pakistan</em> said that the previous night, four Indian Rafales were detected patrolling over the territory of held-Kashmir. A timely and prompt action by the PAF forced them to retreat.</p>
<p>They said that Indian jets became flustered and retreated owing to the PAF’s prompt response.</p>
<p><strong>Airspace concerns</strong></p>
<p>With tensions running high, Pakistan briefly closed the airspace over Gilgit-Baltistan, while India shut its airspace for all Pakistan-registered aircraft, or those owned and operated by Pakistani airlines or operators, including military craft.</p>
<p>A Notam (Notice to Airmen) issued by New Delhi said the closure would be from April 30 to May 23, 2025.</p>
<p>While PIA flights to the Gilgit and Skardu airports were cancelled on Wednesday, two Airblue flights between Skardu and Islamabad operated as per their schedule, sources said.</p>
<p>The PIA official noted that the air route between Gilgit-Baltistan and other cities passes “near Indian territories”.</p>
<p>However, the airspace closure ended after a few hours and flight schedules were restored.</p>
<p>One source told <em>Dawn</em> that the airspace closure was carried out due to certain exercises that were being carried out, but it was not clear if this was directly linked to the heightened tensions with India, or due to inclement weather, as rain and wind storms are predicted to sweep across the country’s northern parts from today.</p>
<p>Residents and visitors obviously faced difficulties, as alternative land routes are often less reliable and more time-consuming.</p>
<p><strong>Diplomatic efforts</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the United States has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension">urged</a> both Pakistan and India to take steps to de-escalate tensions in the region.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio conveyed the message in separate calls with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar.</p>
<p>In a readout of the call with PM Shehbaz, issued by the State Department, Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said: “The secretary spoke of the need to condemn the terror attack on April 22 in Pahalgam. Both leaders reaffirmed their continued commitment to holding terrorists accountable for their heinous acts of violence.”</p>
<p>“The Secretary urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in investigating this unconscionable attack. He also encouraged Pakistan to work with India to de-escalate tensions, re-establish direct communications, and maintain peace and security in South Asia,” the statement said.</p>
<p>A separate readout of Rubio’s conversation with India’s foreign minister said: “[Secretary of State Marco Rubio] encouraged India to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia.”</p>
<p>According to the Prime Minister’s Office, PM Shehbaz shared Pakistan’s perspective on recent developments in South Asia since the Pahalgam incident with Rubio.</p>
<p>During the call, the prime minister condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and termed India’s escalatory and provocative behavior as deeply disappointing and worrisome, adding that these would only distract Pakistan from its ongoing efforts to defeat terrorism.</p>
<p>He categorically rejected Indian attempts to link Pakistan to the incident and pointed to his call for a transparent, credible, and neutral investigation to bring out the facts.</p>
<p>He urged the US to impress upon India to dial down the rhetoric and act responsibly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar contacted leaders from European Union countries, apprising them that Pakistan was open to an transparent investigation into the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>Mr Dar spoke with Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares and Oman’s Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr bin Hamad bin Hamood Al Busaidi, briefing them on recent regional developments, including Indian propaganda and illegal unilateral measures against Pakistan, and placing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">Indus Waters Treaty</a> in abeyance — a clear violation of international law.</p>
<p>He also met with US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker, who called on the foreign minister in Islamabad. Both leaders exchanged views on recent regional developments, a statement said.</p>
<p>In the meeting, Mr Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and security while safeguarding national interests, while Ms Baker conveyed the US desire for de-escalation, adding that Washin­gton would stay engaged with both countries on the evolving situation.</p>

            <p><p>• Registrar says ex-PM’s appeal at ‘motion stage’, much needs to be done before regular hearing<br />
• Bushra Bibi’s appeal to be taken up by division bench next week</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: In a major blow to Imran Khan’s hopes for a legal reprieve, the Islamabad High Court has signalled that his appeal against a 14-year sentence in the £190 million <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880546">Al-Qadir Trust corruption case</a> won’t be heard this year — effectively keeping the former prime minister in legal limbo throughout 2025.</p>
<p>The report by the IHC registrar office was submitted to a division bench in response to an application, seeking the early hearing of an appeal against the conviction of the PTI founder and his spouse, Bushra Bibi.</p>
<p>As per the report, a criminal appeal filed in January 2025 by Mr Khan, sentenced to 14 years imprisonment, faces indefinite delays, with the court confirming that the case would not be heard during the current calendar year.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The report cited the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC) recommendations, according to which the court had approved a ‘fixation policy’ in February 2023 to expedite pending cases, particularly the appeals filed by convicts. Key measures included designating special benches to resolve cases pending for over five years within two months. However, despite these directives, fresh cases like the 2025 appeal remain trapped in procedural limbo.</p>
<p>As per the report, 279 convict appeals are pending before the court, including 63 about the death sentence and 73 against life imprisonment. In 88 cases, the sentences are more than seven years and while in 55 cases, they are up to seven years.</p>
<p>The subject appeal, filed in January 2025, relates to a convict sentenced to 14 years imprisonment, said the report. Despite its recent filing, the case remains at the “motion stage”, requiring the preparation of paper books (mandatory legal documents) before admission.</p>
<p>“After [the appeal’s] admission, paper books are required to be prepared. So far, its fixation for regular hearing… is not in sight during the calendar year 2025,” the report stated, underscoring the procedural bottleneck. The report explicitly stated that due to existing priorities under the NJPMC’s policy—which focuses on older cases—the appeal of Mr Khan has “no sight of fixation for a regular hearing in 2025”.</p>
<p><strong>Bushra’s appeal next week</strong></p>
<p>During the hearing on the application for early hearing of this matter, the division bench comprising acting Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Asif scheduled Bushra Bibi’s plea for suspension of her seven-year sentence for hearing next week.</p>
<p>Barrister Salman Safdar, representing the petitioners, raised concerns over the court office’s handling of urgent applications. “For the third time, the PTI founder is in jail in this case, and our applications for suspension of sentence remain pending,” he told the bench.</p>
<p>He alleged that the registrar’s office was not processing the relevant applications and was instead prioritising other appeals unjustifiably.</p>
<p>Mr Safdar also emphasised that Bushra Bibi had no direct involvement in the case and requested immediate relief for her. He further urged the bench to fix the case for next Tuesday, citing travel arrangements from Lahore. In response, Acting Chief Justice Dogar remarked, “Let me tell you the day, I will see.”</p>
<p>Commenting on the development, advocate Faisal Hussain said that the delay has exposed the strategy of the PTI’s legal team. He said that the legal team should convince the court that this was not a routine case, and being its peculiar nature, the case should be heard on priority basis.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907658/bjp-goes-for-caste-census-with-an-eye-on-bihar-polls' target='_blank'><strong>BJP goes for caste census with an eye on Bihar polls</strong></a>
            <p><p>NEW DELHI: The Modi government announced a plan on Wednesday to include caste identity in the next census, something that has been Rahul Gandhi’s demand. And thereby hangs a tale.</p>
<p>It is, of course, abundantly clear that whoever carried out the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">massacre</a> at Pahalgam or whoever backed the hideous killing of men by identifying them by their religion, helped the BJP’s divisive agenda under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s watch.</p>
<p>This was just as true of the killing of 40 troops in Pulwama in 2019. It too was turned into a communal incident.</p>
<p>A division of Indians along Hindu-Muslim lines inevitably helps negate the predominant social reality of caste, not only among Hindus but also for minorities, including Muslims. The killing of 27 men in Pahalgam, predominantly Hindu, by suspected Muslim gunmen, premeditated or not, was quickly turned into a Hindu-Muslim slugfest.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Pahalgam incident seen as helping ‘BJP’s divisive agenda’; quickly turned into ‘Hindu-Muslim slugfest’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“They didn’t ask one’s caste. They asked about their religion.” Pamphlets were put out on TV post haste within moments of the slaughter. The opposition said it was the BJP at work.</p>
<p>This was the currency that works sure footedly for political mileage. In Gujarat, too, almost moments after the burning of the train coach in Godhra in 2002, the Indian government blamed Pakistan before quickly turning its finger at well-to-do Muslims who had recently won the municipal elections in Godhra.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The “Mian Musharraf” slur continued to describe Gujarat Muslims to extract the last drop of political elixir. But poll-bound Bihar doesn’t respond quite so well to Hindu-Muslim mischief given its more entrenched, centuries-old social reality around caste.</p>
<p>Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav were part of the JP Movement, but belonged to different castes. (Nitish Kumar is the current chief minister of Bihar while Lalu Yadav is a predecessor).</p>
<p>The BJP too needs to move along the caste ruts while seeking to keep the religious pot boiling. When it overlooks the caste angle, its poll arithmetic is likelier challenged. That’s how a Dalit politician from the opposition could defeat the BJP candidate in Ayodhya in the general election last year.</p>
<p><strong>Change of tact</strong></p>
<p>When the full cabinet met under Mr Modi’s watch on Wednesday, the discussion was expected to be entirely on the India-Pakistan tensions. But the headlines were unexpectedly different, suggesting a more politically savvy preparation for Bihar than the Hindu-Muslim cliché.</p>
<p>No timeline was given and polls are due in the politically crucial state in October. The promise was made but the timeline was not provided about when the promise would be honoured. That’s what the newspapers focused on.</p>
<p>“With an eye on the Bihar elections, the Union government on Wednesday announced that a caste census will be conducted along with the decadal census,” The Wire reported.</p>
<p>Information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw made the announcement at a cabinet briefing. “However, he did not provide any timeline for when the decadal census or the corresponding caste census will be conducted,” the report said.</p>
<p>The last population census was conducted in 2011 and the 2021 census, which was delayed by the pandemic, is yet to be conducted.</p>
<p>“Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the cabinet committee on political affairs (CCPA) has decided that caste enumeration should be included in the forthcoming census. This demonstrates that our government is committed to the values and interests of society and country.</p>
<p>“Like in the past, when our government had introduced 10pc reservation for the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society without causing any stress in any section,” said Vaishnaw.</p>
<p>A nationwide caste census has been a long-standing demand of the opposition parties and was a central issue during the Lok Sabha elections last year. Vaishnaw, while making the announcement on Wednesday, accused the INDIA alliance of using the caste census as a “political tool” and said that Congress governments have “always opposed caste census”.</p>
<p>The cynicism hasn’t abated on the communal front, though. Reports are coming of assaults on and beating up of Muslims in BJP-ruled states.</p>
<p>In Kashmir, where the police are controlled by New Delhi, the people helped arrest the slide. But, as Mirwaiz Umar Farooq noted on Wednesday, Kashmiris are being assaulted elsewhere.</p>
<p>“The physical and verbal assault on Kashmiri shawl vendors in Mussoorie (a hill station in Uttarakhand state), who had to flee when police refused to guarantee their safety, is very disturbing,” he said in a statement. “After large-scale detentions, demolition of homes, and crackdowns inside Kashmir, ordinary citizens, students, and small traders outside of J&amp;K are being attacked and forced to return.”</p>
<p>Mirwaiz slammed the communal upsurge and the killings in Pahalgam in the same breath.</p>
<p>“Being themselves at the receiving end of all forms of violence and subsequent suffering for decades, Kashmiris’ condemnation, empathy, and grief for the victims of the Pahalgam bloodbath is straight from the heart, yet they are being vilified and targeted. I appeal to the people of India not to fall prey to hatred and media propaganda creating mistrust of Kashmiris, and reciprocate in ensuring their safety, as they have always done in times of crisis towards all visitors and tourists.”</p>
<p>Pahalgam has set a political agenda, however, in which caste calculations have surged to the fore. The delicate manoeuvre requires a balance between keeping the India-Pakistan border hot and not losing the state polls.</p>
