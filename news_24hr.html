            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912791/pakistan-rubbishes-indian-pm-modis-bid-to-link-islamabad-with-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan rubbishes Indian PM Modi’s bid to link Islamabad with terrorism</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office on Friday categorically rejected the “baseless, provocative, and irresponsible allegations” made by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who in a heated speech accused Pakistan of carrying out terrorist attacks in his country.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between New Delhi and Islamabad came as tensions over last month’s Pahalgam attack continued to build up, as India —without evidence — blamed Pakistan for the attack. On the night of May 6-7, India launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting</a> drones sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat</a> strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns and declare a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">ceasefire</a>. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">offered talks</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Indian premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912761/no-water-for-pakistan-from-indian-rivers-modi">said</a> that Pakistan would not get water from rivers over which India has rights.</p>
<p>According to a statement <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1925764355250950294/photo/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued</a> by the FO on X today, “Pakistan categorically rejects the baseless, provocative, and irresponsible allegations made by the Indian prime minister during a recent public address in Rajasthan.</p>

<p>“The remarks, replete with distortions, misrepresentations, and inflammatory rhetoric, are clearly aimed at stoking regional tensions for narrow political gains,” the FO said, adding that such statements not only reflect a deliberate attempt to mislead the public but also violate the norms responsible statecraft.</p>
<p>“Resorting to threats and boasting about military action against a sovereign nation is a grave breach of the United Nations Charter and established principles of international law,” the FO said.</p>
<p>“This dangerous approach undermines regional peace and stability,” it added.</p>
<p>The foreign ministry said that Pakistan remained a “consistent and proactive partner in the global fight against terrorism”.</p>
<p>“Any insinuation seeking to associate Pakistan with acts of terrorism is factually incorrect and patently misleading,” it continued.</p>
<p>It noted that the Indian premier’s tactic was “often employed to divert attention from India’s own internal challenges”, adding that the Indian attempts to mask its “serious human rights violations” in occupied Kashmir by scapegoating Pakistan were well-documented and increasingly recognised by the international community.</p>
<p>“The plight of the Kashmiri people and their just struggle for self-determination cannot be obscured by aggressive rhetoric and political deflection.”</p>
<p>Pakistan urged the Indian leadership to “exercise responsibility and restraint”, the FO said.</p>
<p>“Escalatory statements and belligerent posturing serve no purpose other than exacerbating tensions.</p>
<p>“Rather than resorting to fictitious narratives and warmongering for electoral mileage, India should demonstrate maturity by resolving outstanding disputes through peaceful dialogue and diplomacy,” the FO noted.</p>
<p>It added that Pakistan remained firmly committed to “peaceful coexistence, regional stability, and constructive engagement”.</p>
<p>“However, our desire for peace should not be misconstrued as weakness,” it said, adding that the people and the armed forced were “fully prepared and capable of defending the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.</p>
<p>“Any misadventure or aggression will be met with a resolute and proportionate response,” the FO added.</p>
<p>It said that Pakistan has demonstrated its resolve in the past and will do so again, if required.</p>
<p>“The international community must take serious note of India’s aggressive posture and hate-driven narratives that threaten regional peace,” it said, adding that it was “imperative to discourage such rhetoric and actions to preserve stability in South Asia”.</p>
<p>“Glorification of conflict benefits no one, and the path to lasting peace lies in dialogue, mutual respect, and adherence to international law,” it concluded.</p></p>

            <p><p>The United Nations Security Council on Friday condemned “in the strongest terms the heinous and cowardly” terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar earlier this week.</p>
<p>At least six people, including three students, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912542/pm-vows-strong-action-against-perpetrators-after-school-bus-blast-in-khuzdar">slain</a> while over 40 others — mostly students — sustained injuries after a bomb targeted the bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.</p>
<p>The condition of at least a dozen is said to be serious due to critical injuries, officials said, adding that at least 15 girl students were among the injured. Security forces vowed to “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357/4-students-killed-several-injured-as-school-bus-comes-under-attack-in-khuzdar-dc">relentlessly pursue</a>” the culprits of the attack as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir visited the injured in Quetta yesterday.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912572/bla-and-ttp-are-indian-proxies-govt-will-prove-indias-involvement-in-khuzdar-bus-attack-asif">said</a> that two major terrorist groups operating in Pakistan were “Indian proxies”, adding that Islamabad would present “complete evidence” to prove New Delhi’s involvement in the attack on the school bus.</p>
<p>According to state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em>, the UNSC condemned the “heinous and cowardly terrorist attack” on a school bus in Khuzdar in the strongest terms.</p>
<p>In a press release, the UNSC said that the “reprehensible act of terrorism resulted in the grievous loss”, with its members expressing deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the government.</p>
<p>“They [UNSC members] wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured,” it added.</p>
<p>The council reaffirmed that “terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security”, underlining the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>It urged all states to cooperate actively with the government of Pakistan, reiterating that any acts of terrorism were criminal and unjustifiable.</p>
<p>The council reaffirmed the need for all states to combat by all means, according to the UN Charter and other international obligations.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912795/iran-us-to-hold-new-round-of-nuclear-talks-in-rome' target='_blank'><strong>Iran, US to hold new round of nuclear talks In Rome</strong></a>
            <p><p>Iranian and US negotiators meet in Rome on Friday for a fifth round of nuclear talks, after a public disagreement over Tehran’s uranium enrichment.</p>
<p>The talks, which began in April, are the highest-level contact between the foes since the United States quit the 2015 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1194436">nuclear accord</a> during President Donald Trump’s first term.</p>
<p>Since returning to office, Trump has revived his “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran, backing talks but <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901324">warning</a> of military action if diplomacy fails.</p>
<p>Iran wants a new deal that would ease sanctions which have battered its economy.</p>
<p>The last round of talks, in the Omani capital Muscat, ended with a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910453">public spat</a> over enrichment.</p>
<p>US envoy Steve Witkoff said Washington “could not authorise even one per cent” enrichment — a position Tehran called a red line, citing its rights under the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#fundamental-differences" id="fundamental-differences" title="Permalink"></a>‘Fundamental differences’</h2>
<p>Ahead of Friday’s talks, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said “fundamental differences” remained with the United States, while adding that Tehran was open to its nuclear sites undergoing more inspections.</p>
<p>“We will not have an agreement at all if the United States wants to prevent Iran from enriching uranium,” Araghchi added.</p>
<p>Friday’s talks in the Italian capital come ahead of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/820841">June meeting</a> of the UN nuclear watchdog, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the October expiry of the 2015 accord.</p>
<p>The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, aimed to stop Iran from developing a nuclear bomb — a goal Western countries accused it of pursuing, though Tehran denies it.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In return for curbs on its nuclear programme, Iran had received relief from international sanctions. But the accord was torpedoed in 2018 when Trump unilaterally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1406529">withdrew</a> the United States.</p>
<p>Iran responded by ramping up its nuclear activities.</p>
<p>It is now enriching uranium to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1801033">60pc</a> — far above the deal’s 3.67pc cap but below the 90 percent needed for weapons-grade material.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#its-quite-simple" id="its-quite-simple" title="Permalink"></a>‘It’s quite simple’</h2>
<p>Experts in Tehran said Iran was unlikely to back down.</p>
<p>“It’s quite simple; if the US expects Iran to halt nuclear enrichment, then there can’t be a deal,” said Mohammad Marandi, a political scientist who was once an adviser on the nuclear issue.</p>
<p>The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran says the country’s nuclear industry employs 17,000 people, similar to other countries where uranium is enriched for civilian use.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“The Netherlands, Belgium, South Korea, Brazil, and Japan enrich (uranium) without possessing nuclear weapons,” its spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi said.</p>
<p>Iran’s enmity with Israel, whose main backer is the United States, has been a constant backdrop to the talks.</p>
<p>In a letter to the United Nations, Araghchi wrote: “We believe that in the event of any attack on the nuclear facilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran by the Zionist regime, the US government will also be involved and bear legal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912630">responsibility</a>.”</p>
<p>The warning came after <em>CNN</em>, citing unnamed US officials, reported Israel was making preparations to carry out such a strike.</p>
<p>The White House said Trump had a “productive discussion” with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday about Iran and the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staff in Washington.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#irreversible" id="irreversible" title="Permalink"></a>‘Irreversible’</h2>
<p>Friday’s talks will be held before an IAEA Board of Governors meeting in June in Vienna during which Iran’s nuclear activities will be reviewed.</p>
<p>The 2015 deal provides for the possibility of UN sanctions being reimposed through a mechanism called “snapback” if Iran fails to fulfil its commitments.</p>
<p>The agreement’s three European signatories — Britain, France and Germany — have warned they would trigger the mechanism if the continent’s security was threatened.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Iran’s top diplomat Araghchi said such a move would have “consequences — not only the end of Europe’s role in the agreement, but also an escalation of tensions that could become irreversible”.</p></p>
