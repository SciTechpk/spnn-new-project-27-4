                <h2>India electoral roll revision sparks fear and fury</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Indian election officials have given voters in Bihar state just weeks to prove their citizenship, requiring documents that few possess in a registration revamp set to be applied nationwide, triggering disenfranchisement fears.</p>
<p>The Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the revision of the voter rolls in June ahead of upcoming polls in the eastern state.</p>
<p>It said the exercise will later be replicated across the nation of 1.4 billion people.</p>
<p>According to the ECI, the ‚Äúintensive revision‚Äù was needed in part to avoid the ‚Äúinclusion of the names of foreign illegal immigrants‚Äù.</p>
<p>Members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have long claimed that large numbers of undocumented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920561">Muslim migrants</a> from neighbouring Bangladesh have fraudulently entered India‚Äôs electoral rolls.</p>
<p>Critics say the overhaul could render vast numbers of Indian citizens unable to vote.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou are being asked to produce documents that very few people have,‚Äù said Asaduddin Owaisi, a prominent Muslim lawmaker.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúIt will lead to mass disenfranchisement.‚Äù</p>
<p>Opposition lawmakers say it will impact minorities the hardest, including <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891144">Muslims</a> and Dalit communities, those on the bottom rung of India‚Äôs rigid caste hierarchy.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#engineered-exclusions" id="engineered-exclusions" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòEngineered exclusions‚Äô</h2>
<p>All potential voters in Bihar will have to provide proof of citizenship by July 25.</p>
<p>Those registered in 2003, the last time scrutiny of the voter list took place in Bihar, can submit a copy of that.</p>
<p>The rest ‚Äî around 30 million people, according to the ECI‚Äôs estimates ‚Äî have to provide evidence of their place and date of birth.</p>
<p>And those born after 1987 must also furnish proof of their parents‚Äô Indian citizenship.</p>
<p>The requirement affects more than a third of potential voters in Bihar, India‚Äôs third most populous state and its poorest.</p>
<p>It is also a crucial election battleground as the only state in India‚Äôs northern Hindi-speaking belt where Modi‚Äôs BJP has only ever governed in a coalition.</p>
<p>Bihar‚Äôs main opposition party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, has challenged the election commission in the Supreme Court, along with other parties and activists.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is being used to justify aggressive and opaque revisions of electoral rolls that disproportionately target Muslim, Dalit and poor (Indian) migrant communities,‚Äù the court petition read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey are not random patterns but‚Ä¶ engineered exclusions.‚Äù Unlike many other countries, India does not have a unique national identity card.</p>
<p>The widely used biometric-linked ‚ÄúAadhaar‚Äù identity card is not among the documents listed by the ECI as acceptable proof.</p>
<p>Documents that can be used include birth certificates, passports and matriculation records.</p>
<p>Of these, most people are likely to rely on their matriculation certificates.</p>
<p>But even those are in short supply in Bihar, where literacy rates are among the lowest in India.</p>
<p>According to an analysis published in <em>The Indian Express</em> newspaper, only 35 per cent of people in the state hold such a document.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn Bihar, where literacy is not very high, many people are not likely to have the kind of documents the ECI has demanded,‚Äù said Jagdeep Chhokar from the
New Delhi-based Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR).</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe poor, poorly educated, uneducated, and minorities will be the most impacted.‚Äù</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#foreign-infiltrators" id="foreign-infiltrators" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòForeign infiltrators‚Äô</h2>
<p>Detractors say the drive is unprecedented because ‚Äúdocumentary proof has never been demanded‚Äù of people to vote in India.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOnly those who especially wanted their name inserted needed to fill a form,‚Äù said political activist and academic Yogendra Yadav. ‚ÄúFor the rest, someone would come to their house and get their names registered.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe onus in India was never on the voter but on the ECI officials,‚Äù he added.
In previous verification drives, modifications were made to the existing rolls, Yadav said.</p>
<p>Now, a list is being drawn from scratch.</p>
<p>Yadav said the drive was a ‚Äúde facto‚Äù implementation of an earlier plan to put together a list of Indian citizens.</p>
<p>The National Register of Citizens (NRC), which was compiled in the eastern state of Assam in 2019, left out almost two million people. Many of them were Muslims.</p>
<p>The BJP had said the NRC would be replicated nationwide as it was necessary to detect ‚Äúforeign infiltrators‚Äù, but was forced to backtrack after furious protests.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEveryone has to now prove that they are citizens of India,‚Äù said Yadav.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat is exactly what the NRC is‚Ä¶ this is NRC by the backdoor. ‚Äú</p></p>

                <h2>Govt eyes Panda bonds as Dubai Islamic Bank closes $1bn loan deal</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: In a renewed push to diversify funding sources and tap into China‚Äôs vast capital market, a Ministry of Finance team is holding high-level meetings in Beijing this week to attract investment for Pakistan‚Äôs debut Panda Bond issuance.</p>
<p>The outreach comes as Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB) has successfully arranged a $1bn syndicated loan for Pakistan, partially backed by the Asian Development Bank ‚Äî the first such guarantee-based facility for the country.</p>
<p>Khurram Schehzad, adviser to the finance minister, said in a post on X on Wednesday that the MoF team had engaged in technical discussions with prospective investors, underwriters, guarantors, a Chinese rating agency, and legal advisers. The meetings, which began on July 7, will continue until July 11 as part of a non-deal roadshow (NDR) ahead of Pakistan‚Äôs debut Panda Bond issue.</p>
<p>Mr Schehzad noted that the roadshow had attracted encouraging initial interest, reflecting investor confidence in Pakistan‚Äôs reform trajectory and its improving credibility in international markets. He added that the visit underscores the government‚Äôs commitment to proactive investor engagement and its strategy to broaden access to China‚Äôs deep and diversified onshore capital market.</p>

<p>In a separate development, Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB) has finalised a $1bn syndicated loan for Pakistan in partnership with a consortium of regional and international financial institutions, according to an official statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The five-year facility is partially guaranteed by a Policy-Based Guarantee (PBG) from the Asian Development Bank, marking the first transaction of its kind undertaken by the ADB for Pakistan.</p>
