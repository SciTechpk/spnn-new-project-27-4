                <h2>United States committed to countering terrorism in all forms with Pakistan amid growing ties</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The United States said on Tuesday that it was committed to countering terrorism in all its forms with Pakistan amid strengthening ties between the two countries.</p>
<p>The statement comes a day after the US State Department added the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and its alias, the Majeed Brigade, to its Foreign Terrorist Organisation list. The US said the move, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925093/pakistan-seeks-listing-of-majeed-brigade-as-terror-group">long-desired</a> by Pakistan, demonstrated its commitment to countering terrorism, while <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930323/us-designates-bla-as-foreign-terrorist-outfit#:~:text=cooperation%20and%20international%20coordination">signalling</a> strengthened cooperation and international coordination in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p>A post from the US Embassy in Islamabad on X said the Acting Coordinator for Counterterrorism Gregory LoGerfo and Charg√© d‚ÄôAffaires Natalie Baker participated in the US-Pakistan Counterterrorism Dialogue, advancing their shared resolve to combat the global threat.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe remain committed to countering terrorism in all its forms,‚Äù the embassy said.</p>

<p>The Foreign Office (FO) said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/pakistan-us-counterterrorism-dialogue-joint-press-statement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> the dialogue was co-chaired by Special Secretary (UN) Ambassador Nabeel Munir and LoGerfo, adding that the two delegations underscored the critical importance of developing effective approaches to terrorist threats, including those posed by the BLA, Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe US applauded Pakistan‚Äôs continued successes to contain terrorist entities that pose a threat to the peace and security of the region and the world. Furthermore, the US expressed condolences for the loss of civilians and members of law enforcement agencies in terrorist incidents in Pakistan, including the barbaric Jaffar Express terrorist attack and the bombing of a school bus in Khuzdar.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBoth delegations emphasised the importance of building stronger institutional frameworks and developing capabilities to respond to security challenges and to counter the use of emerging technologies for terrorist purposes,‚Äù the FO said.</p>
<p>It added that sides reaffirmed their intention to work closely in multilateral fora, including the United Nations, to promote effective and enduring approaches to counterterrorism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúReaffirming the long-standing partnership between Pakistan and the US, both sides emphasised that sustained and structured engagement remains vital to countering terrorism and promoting peace and stability.‚Äù</p>

<p>LoGerfo also called on Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, according to the Foreign Office, adding that the latter was briefed on the discussions held during the dialogue.</p>
<p>Dar encouraged sustained and structured bilateral engagement on counterterrorism between both countries as a ‚Äúvital contributor to peace and stability in the region and beyond‚Äù, the statement said.</p>

<p>The last US-Pakistan Counterterrorism Dialogue was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1833287">held</a> in May of last year, where both countries reaffirmed the continuation of counterterrorism cooperation to advance regional and global security and stability.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929938">completed</a> a visit to the US, terming the trip ‚Äî the second in just one-and-a-half months ‚Äî a ‚Äúnew dimension‚Äù in ties between both nations. He also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917414">visited</a> the US in June on a five-day official visit, where he met with US President Donald Trump over luncheon, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">becoming</a> the first serving army chief to have an official face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.</p>
<p>The two had discussed joint counterterrorism efforts and expanding bilateral trade during their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093/trump-coas-munir-talk-counterterrorism-and-trade-in-cordial-meeting-ispr">‚Äúcordial‚Äù meeting</a> in Washington. During the meeting, Trump had ‚Äúlauded Pakistan‚Äôs ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counterterrorism cooperation between the two states‚Äù.</p>
<p>FM Dar had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926640">met</a> US Secretary of State Marco Rubio last month and discussed trade, investment, counterterrorism cooperation and the clash between India and Pakistan in May, according to officials from both countries.</p>
<p>The meeting ‚Äî the first such engagement between the foreign ministers of the two countries in three years ‚Äî was considered a breakthrough in diplomacy between Pakistan and the US. Secretary Rubio had recognised Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúunparalleled sacrifices‚Äù in the fight against terrorism and described Islamabad as a ‚Äúconstructive actor‚Äù in efforts to ensure regional stability.</p>
<p>In June, United States Central Command chief Army General Michael Kurilla had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524/us-centcom-chief-lauds-phenomal-partner-pakistan-in-counter-terrorism-efforts">praised</a> Pakistan as a ‚Äúphenomenal partner in the world of counter-terrorism‚Äù, citing the nation‚Äôs struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups such as the IS-K.</p>
<p>Of late, it seems that Islamabad and Washington are in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928556">lockstep</a>. The positive signals, which began emanating soon after Trump‚Äôs inauguration, seem to be turning into full-blown bonhomie.</p>
<p>From acknowledging Pakistan‚Äôs counterterror cooperation in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895923/trump-hails-pakistans-help-in-arresting-is-terrorist-behind-2021-kabul-airport-bombing">arrest</a> of an IS-Khorasan operative to claiming <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625/trump-says-us-stopped-pak-india-nuclear-war">credit</a> for stopping a nuclear war in South Asia, the country has perhaps featured more in this US president‚Äôs day-to-day media interactions than any past ‚Äòcommander-in-chief‚Äô.</p>
<p>After securing what seems to be a <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1927992/trump-slaps-19pc-tariff-on-pakistani-goods-targets-dozens-of-countries-with-steep-duties">major discount</a> in tariff negotiations, attracting US investor <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927725/us-makes-deal-to-tap-pakistans-oil-reserves">interest</a> in its oil and mineral reserves and signalling that its currency market is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914060/pakistan-unveils-first-govt-led-strategic-bitcoin-reserve">receptive</a> to digital assets and cryptocurrencies, Pakistan seems to be in the driving seat as far as South Asia is concerned.</p></p>

                <h2>‚ÄòYou cannot snatch even a drop from Pakistan,‚Äô PM Shehbaz warns India on restricting water flow</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday warned India against any designs on the Indus River, saying that it could not snatch ‚Äúeven one drop‚Äù of water belonging to Pakistan amid tensions over the share of hydel resources in the region.</p>
<p>India in April held the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">abeyance</a> following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam that killed 26 ‚Äî an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">termed</a> any attempt to suspend its water share an ‚Äúact of war‚Äù, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907454">considering</a> court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920611/pakistan-hails-hague-courts-supplemental-award-in-indus-waters-case-says-india-cant-sideline-arbitration-process">supplemental award</a> by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague in June held that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. India, in response, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920611/pakistan-hails-hague-courts-supplemental-award-in-indus-waters-case-says-india-cant-sideline-arbitration-process#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIndia%20has%20never,the%20ministry%20maintained.">did not recognise</a> the court or its decisions. A day ago, the PCA issued an ‚ÄúAward on Issues of General Interpretation of the IWT‚Äù in the Indus Waters case, stating that India must <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930219">generally ‚Äúlet flow‚Äù the waters</a> of the western rivers for Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúunrestricted use‚Äù.</p>
<p>Addressing a ceremony in Islamabad today, the prime minister said: ‚ÄúI want to tell the enemy today that if you threaten to hold our water, then keep this in mind that you cannot snatch even one drop from Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>The prime minister warned that if India attempted such an act, ‚Äúyou will be again taught such a lesson that you will be left holding your ears.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur air force shot down six of their jets, among which four of them were Rafales,‚Äù PM Shehbaz added.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The prime minister‚Äôs warning comes a day after former foreign minister and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari termed the IWT‚Äôs suspension an attack on the Indus Valley civilisation and said the nation would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930241/pakistan-wont-back-down-if-india-forces-war-declares-bilawal">not back down</a> if New Delhi forced it into war.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf war is waged, then from the land of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai we will send a message to the Modi government that we do not retreat, we do not bow down, and if you dare think about launching an attack on the Indus River, then the people of every province of Pakistan will be ready to confront you,‚Äù he had said.</p>
<p>Similarly, while on a weekend visit to the United States, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930030/coas-says-india-wont-be-allowed-to-choke-indus-river">reportedly warned</a> that Pakistan would never allow India to choke the Indus River and would defend its water rights at all costs, even if the forces would have to destroy any controversial dam that India sought to build on it.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will wait for India to build a dam, and when they do so, we will destroy it,‚Äù he reportedly told members of the Pakistani-American community in Tampa, Florida. ‚ÄúThe Indus River is not the Indians‚Äô family property. We have no shortage of resources to undo the Indian designs to stop the river.‚Äù</p>

<p>The prime minister also conveyed his wishes for Independence Day to the representatives of the Christian, Hindu, Sikh and Parsi communities present at the event.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe brothers and sisters of the minority communities also played an integral role in the movement for Pakistan,‚Äù he said, adding that not only did they play a role in the founding of the country, but also played a role in its development of the country.</p>
<p>Speaking on the May conflict between Pakistan and India, the prime minister said: ‚ÄúThe way we smashed the enemy in this conflict, they will remember it for a lifetime.‚Äù</p>
<p>He called upon the youth to play a role in the development of Pakistan and announced that 100,000 laptops would be distributed amongst the high achievers all over the country.</p></p>
