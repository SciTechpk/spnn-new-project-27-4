            <p><p>As people continue to be evacuated from nearby structures following a deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050">building collapse</a> in Karachi’s congested Lyari neighbourhood that left <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922486/death-toll-in-lyari-building-collapse-stands-at-27-as-rescue-operation-ends-on-3rd-day">27 people dead</a>, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said on Wednesday it would not be possible for the government to provide housing to all residents living in dilapidated buildings.</p>
<p>The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market collapsed on Friday morning, with the rescue operations concluding on Sunday. The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, with the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) saying it had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=SBCA%20says%20issued%20multiple%20prior%20notices%20to%20vacate%20building">issued multiple prior notices</a> to residents to vacate the structure since 2023.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>GeoNews</em>, Memon said that there were 740 dilapidated buildings across Sindh, out of which 51 were in “extremely dangerous” condition, out of which 11 buildings had been vacated.</p>
<p>“Orders have been issued to vacate the others in the next 48 hours for residents’ safety,” Memon said.</p>
<p>“However, it won’t be possible for the government to provide housing to all residents living in dilapidated buildings,” the minister said, adding that there was no such law obligating the government to do so.</p>
<p>“Nonetheless, the government in the past had provided temporary shelters to flood victims and Covid-19 patients for quarantine,” he added.</p>
<p>“Whatever space is available with the government, we will provide that for housing to the most deserving residents who have no other option available [for housing].”</p>
<p>Memon’s comments come a day after the Sindh government announced the suspension of SBCA Director General Ishaque Khuhro over the building collapse.</p>
<p>According to Local Government (LG) Minister Saeed Ghani, other SBCA officials who were suspended included the director, deputy director and building inspectors assigned to Lyari. He also noted that the Sindh government has announced Rs1 million in compensation to the families of the 27 deceased people.</p>
<p>Major opposition parties — the PTI, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and Jamaat-i-Islami — have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922336/sindh-govt-sbca-earn-oppositions-ire-over-lyari-tragedy">condemned</a> the PPP’s Sindh government, the SBCA and other authorities, accusing them of “criminal negligence” that led to the disaster.</p>
<p>They not only demanded compensation and alternative residences for the affected families but also called for the registration of manslaughter cases against the officials responsible for the tragedy.</p>

<p>In April, a 10-year-old girl <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907402/minor-girl-dies-in-building-collapse">died</a> when a three-storey building in Bhains Colony suddenly collapsed, while a man and a woman were pulled alive from the debris.</p>
<p>In October 2023, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1780534/five-killed-as-another-building-going-up-illegally-collapses">five people</a> were killed and four others injured when an under-construction building collapsed in Shah Faisal Colony.</p>
<p>The city witnessed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1579454/2-killed-10-injured-as-second-building-collapses-in-karachi-in-less-than-72-hours">two</a> such <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1578939">incidents</a> within 72 hours in September 2020, claiming the lives of at least three people and injuring over a dozen.</p>
<p>Lyari also faced a similar incident in June 2020, when <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1562672">22 people</a> were killed after a five-storey residential building housing about 40 apartments <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1561975/1-dead-4-injured-after-residential-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari-neighbourhood?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20dawn-news%20%28Dawn%20News%29">collapsed</a>.</p>
<p>A building collapse in Karachi’s Gulbahar area in March 2020 killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1539325">27 people</a>. A similar 2011 incident in Lyari’s Musa Lane neighbourhood took <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/650268/death-toll-from-karachi-building-collapse-at-33">33 lives</a>.</p></p>

            <p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he has nominated Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, presenting the US president with a letter he sent to the prize committee.</p>
<p>The move comes as Israel continues its onslaught on Gaza, which has so far killed 57,523 Palestinians. Last year, the UN-backed International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1874034">issued</a> arrest warrants for Netanyahu, citing allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court said he, along with ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, “intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival”, including food, water, medicine, fuel, and electricity.</p>
<p>“He’s forging peace as we speak, in one country, in one region after the other,” Netanyahu said at a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922520">dinner</a> with Trump at the White House.</p>

<p>Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514">nominations</a> from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years and has made no secret of his irritation at missing out on the prestigious award.</p>
<p>The Republican has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514#:~:text=Trump%20complains%20about%20not%20getting%20Nobel%20prize%20for%20%E2%80%98stopping%E2%80%99%20multiple%20wars">complained</a> that he had been overlooked by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">mediating role</a> in conflicts between India and Pakistan, as well as Serbia and Kosovo.</p>
<p>In 2024, he <a class="link--external" href="https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/trump-grumbles-about-obama-s-nobel-peace-prize-and-claims-he-deserved-it-more/ar-AA1sVZiM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">insisted</a> that he was more deserving of a Nobel than ex-president Barack Obama, and complained how it was unfair that “anybody else” but him would have been honoured with one.</p>
<p>In June, Pakistan had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514/govt-to-recommend-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize-for-decisive-diplomatic-intervention-in-india-pakistan-crisis">decided</a> to formally recommend Trump for the coveted prize, given his role in de-escalating the India-Pakistan conflict when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">US mediation</a>.</p>
<p>However, as the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">joined</a> Israel’s war with Iran and launched attacks on three Iranian nuclear facilities, Pakistani lawmakers, activists, authors and ex-diplomats <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919128/fazl-others-urge-govt-to-review-decision-to-nominate-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize">criticised the move</a>.

<p>Trump has also demanded credit for “keeping peace” between Egypt and Ethiopia and brokering the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements aiming to normalise relations between Israel and several Arab nations.</p>
<p>He campaigned for office as a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20what%20I%20want%20to%20be%3A%20a%20peacemaker%20and%20unifier.">peacemaker</a>” who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging more than five months into his presidency.</p></p>

            <p><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Quetta on Tuesday handed Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other organisers of the group into police custody for 10 days, extending their three-month detention.</p>
<p>In March, Mahrang and other BYC members were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899608">arrested</a> for “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after the group faced a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899479/tear-gas-water-cannon-employed-to-disperse-baloch-yakjehti-committee-protesters-in-quetta">police crackdown</a> for protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.</p>
<p>Mahrang has been held at the Hudda District Prison in Quetta under Section 3 of the <a class="link--external" href="https://pakistancode.gov.pk/english/UY2FqaJw1-apaUY2Fqa-apaUY2Npa5prZw%3D%3D-sg-jjjjjjjjjjjjj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mainte­nance of Public Order</a> (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order.</p>
<p>Mahrang’s counsel, Advocate Israr Baloch, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the BYC organiser and five other activists were presented before Judge Saadat Bazai, who approved the state prosecutor’s request for their 10-day physical remand.</p>
<p>The other activists were Gulzadi, Bebow Baloch, Sibghatullah Shahji, Ghaffar Baloch and and Beberg Baloch. Advocate Shoaib Baloch also appeared in the court as their lawyer.</p>
<p>The BYC members were presented in the court in “four different” first information reports (FIRs) after the last <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920724/mahrangs-detention-extended-for-another-15-days">extension</a> in their MPO detention expired, Israr added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Mahrang was taken into custody under MPO for a period of 30 days (first term) on March 22. Thereafter, her detention was extended for an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905705">additional 30 days</a> (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April.</p>
<p>After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody last month, the provincial government issued a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920724">fourth</a> extension order, extending their imprisonment by another 15 days.</p>
<p>Renowned rights lawyer Jibran Nasir, who has served as Mahrang’s counsel in a case last month, said a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DL1qq4eiQOp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on Instagram: “After the state ran out of ways to exploit colonial MPO laws the liberty of the BYC leaders is now being infringed by exploiting the ATC and penal laws.”</p>

<p>“Expect long remands, delayed hearing of bail applications, likely dismissal of bail from ATC and when bail would finally be granted, expect another arrest and transfer to another district jail in another,” Nasir wrote.</p>
<p>Nasir, citing Mahrang’s family, shared with <em>Dawn.com</em> a list of the FIR numbers in the four cases, showing they were from this year.</p>
<p>According to a BHC judgment from May provided by Nasir, the FIRs included those registered at the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899910/mahrang-other-byc-leaders-face-terror-charges?utm_source=www.dailybiscuitt.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=dr-mahrang-baloch-faces-terror-charges#:~:text=Civil%20Lines%20Police%20Station">Civil Lines</a> police station on March 19 for storming the Civil Hospital and at <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899910/mahrang-other-byc-leaders-face-terror-charges?utm_source=www.dailybiscuitt.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=dr-mahrang-baloch-faces-terror-charges#:~:text=Brewery%20Police%20Station">Brewery</a> police station on March 2 for blocking the Western Bypass Road in Quetta.</p>

<p>While the BYC is not listed among banned organisations by the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta), Mahrang is included on its list of <a class="link--external" href="https://nfs.nacta.gov.pk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proscribed persons</a>.</p>
<p>Constitutional petitions seeking the release of Mahrang and two other activists were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912743">rejected</a> by the Balochistan High Court (BHC) in May.</p>
