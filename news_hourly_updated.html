                <h2>3 killed, 7 injured in gun attack on passenger bus in Balochistan‚Äôs Kalat: govt</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Three people were killed and seven others were injured as a passenger bus was fired upon in Balochistan‚Äôs Kalat, according to the provincial government spokesperson.</p>
<p>A statement from Shahid Rind said: ‚ÄúThree passengers were martyred and seven were injured in the tragic incident‚Äù when a shooting occurred on a passenger coach coming from Karachi to Quetta in Kalat.</p>
<p>He said the injured were being moved to the District Headquarters Hospital Kalat for treatment, adding that an emergency had been imposed at the facility.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecurity agencies, district administration and rescue teams have immediately reached the scene. Security forces have surrounded the area and a search operation is underway. Security forces are pursuing the attackers,‚Äù Rind said.</p>
<p>The incident comes a week after at <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923342/passengers-kidnapped-in-sardhaka-rescue-operation-underway-balochistan-govt">least nine passengers</a> travelling on two Punjab-bound coaches were abducted and killed by unidentified armed men in the Sur-Dakai area, situated on the border between Balochistan‚Äôs Zhob and Loralai districts.</p>
<p>The government had said that <em>Fitna-al-Hindu¬≠stan</em> ‚Äî a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">term</a> the government uses for terrorist organisations in Balo¬≠chistan ‚Äî had carried out attacks at three different places ‚Äî Kakat, Mastung and Sur-Dakai.</p>
<p>The Balochistan Liberation Front, a banned outfit, later claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group said it had killed the nine individuals after blocking the highway between Musakhail-Makhtar and Khajuri.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923476/bodies-of-slain-passengers-in-balochistan-bus-killing-sent-to-punjab-hometowns-official">sources</a>, two passenger coaches en route to Punjab were intercepted in the Sur-Dakai area near the N-70 highway, close to Dab ‚Äî a place along the Loralai-Zhob border. A group of armed men had blocked the road and stopped the two vehicles.</p>
<p>The armed assailants boarded the coaches, checked the identity cards of passengers and forced 10 persons off the vehicles at gunpoint. ‚ÄúThey dragged out 10 passengers ‚Äî seven from one coach and three from the other ‚Äî and took them away (to an unknown place),‚Äù a surviving passenger had told Levies. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what they did to them, but I heard gunfire as we were leaving.‚Äù</p>
<p>After abducting the nine passengers, the assailants allowed both coaches to leave the area. According to sources, the attackers had checked the national identity cards of all passengers and specifically targeted individuals with Punjab addresses. They also opened fire on the coaches during the abduction to prevent any escape.</p>
<p>In May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna-al-Hindu¬≠stan</em>.</p>
<p>In March, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900559/several-killed-vehicles-torched-in-balochistan">five people</a> were killed by armed men who blocked the highway in the Kalmat area of Gwadar district, while three long-body trailers carrying urea from Gwadar port were set on fire in the Tajaban area.</p>
<p>In February, seven Punjab-bound passengers were offloaded from a bus and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892974/">shot dead</a> in Barkhan district. The incident came days after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892214">12 were killed</a> in a blast targeting a bus carrying coal miners in Harnai.</p>
<p>Balochistan has witnessed a spate of attacks targeting those hailing from Punjab. In two separate incidents in April 2024, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1827193">nine people</a> were killed after being forced off a bus near Noshki, while <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1830243">two labourers</a> from Punjab were shot in Kech.</p>
<p>In May last year, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832433">seven barbers</a> from Punjab were shot dead near Gwadar, while August saw <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854830">23 travellers</a> offloaded from trucks and buses and shot in the Musakhail district.</p>
<p>The Musakhail incident was part of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855006">flare-up of violence</a>, where dozens of militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army ‚Äî a separatist outfit ‚Äî <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854776/gun-grenade-attacks-in-balochistan">launched numerous attacks</a> across Balochistan, targeting security personnel as well as civilians.</p>

                <h2>UK lifts ban on Pakistani airlines, removes country from Air Safety List</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The United Kingdom on Wednesday removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, thereby allowing Pakistani airlines to now apply to operate flights to the UK, according to a statement from the British High Commission in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Debt-ridden Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1566153">banned</a> from flying to the European Union, UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi‚Äôs Model Colony, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1558944">killing nearly 100 people</a>. The ban on operating to Europe was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875575">lifted</a> in November last year.</p>
<p>Today‚Äôs development comes after a team from the UK Department for Transport <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923408/uk-audit-approves-pakistan-aviation-security">concluded</a> an aviation security ins¬≠pection at Islamabad Inter¬≠nat¬≠ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan‚Äôs security arrangements ‚Äúsatisfactory and in line with international standards‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFollowing air safety improvements, the UK‚Äôs Air Safety Committee has lifted UK restrictions on Pakistani carriers,‚Äù said a statement from the British High Commission.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndividual airline carriers will still need to apply for permits to operate to the UK through the UK Civil Aviation Authority.‚Äù</p>
<p>British High Commissioner Jane Marriott was quoted as saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful to aviation experts in the UK and Pakistan for their collaborative work to drive improvements to meet international safety standards.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile it will take time for flights to resume, once the logistics are in place, I look forward to using a Pakistani carrier when visiting family and friends.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a post on X, Marriott called the approval ‚Äúan important step, and a testament‚Äù to PIA‚Äôs air safety improvements.</p>

<p>Decisions on de-listing states and air carriers from the UK Air Safety List are made through an independent aviation safety process, according to the statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is overseen by the UK‚Äôs Air Safety Committee, who have <em>[sic]</em> been closely engaging with the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority over several years.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe committee has judged that necessary safety improvements have been made since its original decision in 2021. Therefore, based on this independent and technically-driven process, it has decided to remove Pakistan and its air carriers from the list.‚Äù</p>
<p>PIA said it was all set to resume flights to the UK now.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt became possible after adherence to the most stringent flight safety standards, reviewed by the UK‚Äôs Air Safety Committee.‚Äù</p>

<p>Reacting to today‚Äôs development, Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif commended the government led by his party for ‚Äúcrossing another milestone‚Äù. ‚ÄúThree years of continuous hard work have borne fruit,‚Äù he <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KhawajaMAsif/status/1945389259881406550" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X.</p>

<p>In a press conference in Islamabad, Asif said the aviation ministry would now apply for licences to restore routes to Britain.</p>
<p>The minister said Airblue had also been removed from the safety list: ‚ÄúAccording to my knowledge, they have allowed not just PIA but also Airblue.‚Äù</p>
<p>Asif affirmed that the government was making efforts to resume New York flights.</p>
<p>The move adds to another positive development, with the UK government yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924354">launching</a> e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù border and immigration system.</p>
<p>A day prior to that, the two countries formally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924280/pakistan-uk-ink-accord-to-boost-economic-cooperation">signed</a> the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.</p>

<p>Asif hailed the removal of Pakistani airlines from UK‚Äôs Air Safety list, but stressed the need for fixing responsibility for the loss caused to the national carrier.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, Asif strongly criticised the PTI government for the fiasco and reputational damage caused to PIA, which he called a ‚Äúcrime against state‚Äù.</p>
<p>He pinned the responsibility on former prime minister Imran Khan and then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan, who had stated in the National Assembly after the 2020 crash that almost <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1567845">40 per cent</a> of the country‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1565352">pilots</a> had fake licenses.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The minister called on the government to pursue whoever was responsible for this loss, as the nation‚Äôs image was affected and a negative impression was created about the national airline and its pilots.</p>
<p>‚ÄúImran Khan and Ghulam Sarwar turned PIA into a graveyard,‚Äù Asif quipped.</p>
<p>In reply to a question, he said Sarwar‚Äôs speech was ‚Äúenough to fix responsibility‚Äù as the national flag carrier‚Äôs image was affected. He suggested that the prime minister could order an enquiry to conduct an investigation and hold individuals accountable.</p>
<p>The minister noted that PIA suffered a drop in business, planes became <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1771459">dysfunctional</a> and the pilots‚Äô reputation was tarnished. He highlighted that overseas Pakistanis used the airline due to cheaper and direct routes.</p>
<p>Asif hailed the civil aviation regulator and ministry officials for the ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù day, saying that the decision has restored confidence in the national airline and aviation industry. He also thanked the UK and EU regulators for their guidance to plug loopholes and meet international standards.</p>
<p>The next step was privatising PIA, Asif noted, adding that the restoration of routes will assist the process as the government will receive a higher bid price. He asserted that the private sector would be able to revive the airline with higher investment, induct a new fleet and open new routes.</p></p>
