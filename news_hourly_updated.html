            <p><p>‚Ä¢ ISPR DG says 26 Indian sites struck, response textbook demonstration of integrated tri-services<br />
‚Ä¢ Indian military dodges question about loss of fighter jets</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan‚Äôs armed forces on Sunday said they struck 26 Indian targets in ‚Äò<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a>‚Äô to re-establish deterrence after India violated Pakistan‚Äôs airspace earlier this week and separately targeted air bases in early-morning strikes.</p>
<p>In a press conference alongside Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Director General Public Relations Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed and Naval Staff (Operations) Deputy Chief Vice Admiral Raja Rab Nawaz, Pakistan Army‚Äôs chief spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared details about the operation.</p>
<p>He said the dastardly attacks began on the night of May 6 and 7, resulting in the loss of innocent civilian lives, including women, children and the elderly. He said one Pakistani aircraft was slightly damaged during the Indian missile attack.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTwenty-six military targets, along with facilities in India used to target Pakistani citizens and entities involved in fomenting terrorism in Pakistan, were engaged in both Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and mainland India,‚Äù he said in the presser.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Gen Chaudhry said Pakistan‚Äôs response was a ‚Äútextbook demonstration‚Äù of integrated tri-services, enabled by real-time situational awareness, network-centric warfare capabilities and seamless multidomain operations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe targets included air force and aviation bases at Suratgarh, Sirsa, Adampur, Bhooj, Nalia, Bathinda, Barnala, Halwara, Avantipura, Srinagar, Jammu, Mamoon, Ambala, Udampur and Pathankot ‚Äî all of which sustained major damages,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>The DG said Brahmos facilities, which had fired missiles in Pakistan and killed innocent civilians, were also destroyed.</p>

<p>India launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">series of strikes</a> under ‚ÄòOperation Sindoor‚Äô soon after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam tragedy</a> in the early hours of May 7 across Pakistan, in which 31 people were martyred. Pakistan‚Äôs military responded swiftly, downing five Indian jets, destroying Indian brigade headquarters, and check posts in the occupied Kashmir along the Line of Control.</p>
<p>The ISPR chief paid tribute to those who were martyred in the Indian aggression and their families, while praying for the speedy recovery of the wounded.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe extend our heartfelt gratitude to every officer, soldier, airman and sailor of the Armed Forces of Pakistan who made this success on the battlefield possible through their courage, professionalism and sacrifice.‚Äù</p>
<p>The military spokesperson particularly thanked the youth of Pakistan ‚Äî ‚Äúwho became the frontline soldiers as information and cyber warriors of the country‚Äù ‚Äî and the media that stood as a ‚Äústeel wall‚Äù against the Indian media. He also appreciated politicians for their support to the army during these times and lauded the premier for taking ‚Äúdestiny-changing decisions‚Äù during this testing time</p>
<p><strong>War not an option</strong></p>

<p>Responding to a question about who first requested for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>, the DG ISPR said: ‚ÄúPut it on record that Pakistan never requested for a ceasefire.‚Äù</p>
<p>He warned that there was no space for a war between two nuclear-armed nations. ‚Äúif anyone wants to carve out this space for war, he is actually carving out the space for mutual annihilation,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>He said: ‚ÄúThis is why you saw how in this conflict Pakistan acted in a very mature manner and through conventional forces, we maintained escalation control, through conventional forces we gave them a two notch up response while also ensuring that the Pakistan forces employed on the counterterrorism operations ‚Ä¶ no pull is also exerted on them.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>IAF airfields hit</strong></p>
<p>Air Vice Marshal Ahmed, while describing Pakistan‚Äôs response to the Indian Air Force, said the PAF‚Äôs response was based ‚Äúon the time and place of own choosing‚Äù, displaying ‚Äúbold, aggressive and unwavering resolve of the brave military leadership‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúI must appreciate the leadership ‚Ä¶ they were resolute and clear in giving instructions to all of us and that is perhaps the reason why we were so sure about what we had to do,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith unprecedented reach, precision and lethality, while avoiding collateral, the PAF hit maximum number of IAF airfields in a single operational package since 1971 because they crossed the international border,‚Äù the officer said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile reestablishing deterrence, Pakistan negated the setting of a new normal under the hegemonistic design of a supremacist regime through swift and effective response.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>Sea frontiers</strong></p>
<p>Vice Admiral Rab Nawaz said the Pakistan Navy was able to defend the country‚Äôs sea frontiers from a ‚Äúnumerically superior enemy‚Äù.</p>
<p>He gave details of the navy‚Äôs readiness to thwart any attack from the sea. He said there was a hype that INS Vikrant (Indian fleet) was approaching Karachi. ‚ÄúWe were keeping a very close eye on the activities at sea [‚Ä¶] we were monitoring it from day one,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúOn the night of May 6 and 7, it was close to Bombay and on May 9, it was essentially 400 nautical miles from the Pakistani coast and it retreated close to Bombay,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf a carrier gets within 400 nautical miles, it simplifies our problem. The navy maritime air arm was proper ready to generate a response at all times. If there was any aggression from the sea we were ready to respond effectively,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p><strong>Indian military dodges question</strong></p>
<p>Indian military officers, meanwhile, said that the objectives of ‚ÄòOperation Sindoor‚Äô were achieved, with ‚Äòhigh-value terrorists‚Äô being eliminated, but dodged a question whether they had lost a bunch of warplanes in the operation.</p>
<p>The officers, speaking at a press conference, provided key details on Operation Sindoor, its impact and results, saying that the ‚Äúobjective has been achieved‚Äù.</p>
<p>Air Marshal AK Bharti, DGMO Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai, Maj Gen SS Sharma and Vice Admiral AN Pramod addressed the press. Responding to reports that Rafale fighter jets were downed, Air Marshal AK Bharti did not confirm or deny the claims, stating instead that ‚Äúlosses are a part of any combat scenario‚Äù.</p>
<p>The Indian military said, ‚ÄúWe are in a combat scenario and losses are a part of it. Question is that ‚Äòhave we achieved our objective‚Äô? Answer is a thumping yes. As for details, at this time I would not like to comment on that, as we are still in combat, and give advantage to (our) adversary. All our pilots are back home.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>AJK villagers torn between fear and hope</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Emergency declared in LoC districts<br />
‚Ä¢ Educational institutions across AJK to remain closed until further notice as civil defence seeks thorough safety sweeps<br />
‚Ä¢ Thousands evacuated from LoC need humanitarian assistance<br />
‚Ä¢ Affectees lack adequate privacy and safety</p>
<p>MUZAFFARABAD: A day after Pakistan and India agreed to de-escalate tensions, internally displaced persons (IDPs) from vulnerable areas along the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909871/locals-describe-night-of-heaviest-shelling-along-line-of-control">Line of Control</a> (LoC) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) found themselves caught in a dilemma ‚Äî torn between the longing to return home and lingering doubts about the durability of the ceasefire.</p>
<p>According to Sardar Waheed Khan, Director General of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), calm had largely prevailed along the LoC following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire agreement</a> ‚Äî except in Barnala sector of Bhimber district, where Indian shelling continued until 10:30 pm on Saturday before finally subsiding.</p>
<p>He said intense shelling had officially displaced around 1,186 families across AJK. However, he acknowledged that several other families had quietly fled their homes without notifying the authorities, meaning the actual number of displaced persons could be higher.</p>
<p>On Sunday, some displaced families began pre¬≠paring to return, but many remained hesitant.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are not ready to take the risk just yet,‚Äù said Zahida Parveen, a housewife from Bugna Ban Chattar village in Neelum Valley, cradling her infant in a high school building in Lower Plate neighbourhood of Muzaffarabad.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our children we‚Äôre most worried about. We fled in panic and don‚Äôt want to go back unless we‚Äôre sure it‚Äôs safe.‚Äù</p>
<p>Parveen said she and her two sisters-in-law had rushed to Muzaffar¬≠abad with their infants after a brief pause in Indian shelling on Friday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe stayed with some relatives for two nights, but they had limited space. So, we‚Äôve moved to this school building and will wait to see what happens on Monday.‚Äù</p>
<p>Their fear was compounded by a recent tragedy: a teenage boy in their village was killed by shell fragments just a day earlier.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll reassess tomorrow after¬≠noon,‚Äù said Mahreen Gillani, one of the sisters-in-law, seated beside her.</p>
<p>Outside in the school veranda, Syed Mureed Hussain, 56, from Sandok village, expressed a similar view: ‚ÄúMy heart wants to go back, but the children are terrified. The sound of artillery still echoes in their minds.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said he planned to stay with relatives on the outskirts of Muzaffarabad for another day or two.</p>
<p>Nazarat Ali Kazmi, 39, another villager, said his trust in the ceasefire was low.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere was a time when the Indian army raised white flags ‚Äî a truce signal ‚Äî and still resumed firing,‚Äù he alleged.</p>
<p>However, in Kotli‚Äôs Khuiratta Tehsil, many displaced people were more optimistic.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm hopeful this agreement holds. We want to go back to our land,‚Äù said Chaudhry Azam, a 55-year-old farmer from Jamairi Kas village, just 200 metres from the LoC.</p>
<p>His home was damaged and livestock killed in Friday‚Äôs shelling, forcing him to seek shelter at a friend‚Äôs house in Manjwar, four kilometres away.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPeople here have been kind, but there‚Äôs no place like home ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs damaged,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been told by local officials to wait until Monday noon. One more day won‚Äôt hurt.‚Äù</p>
<p>Neelum Deputy Commissioner Nadeem Ahmed Janjua confirmed that return was being encouraged, but with caution.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese people left voluntarily and are returning voluntarily. All we have advised them is to remain alert until the situation stabilises,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He added that despite the shelling, life had not come to a complete halt. ‚ÄúEven in the worst days, passenger vans and grocery-laden vehicles continued to operate on the main Neelum road, and we made sure to facilitate them.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>Schools to stay shut</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, SDMA Director General Sardar Waheed Khan announced on Sunday that all educational institutions across AJK would remain closed until further notice, pending a decision by a cabinet committee.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe decision regarding the reopening of schools and colleges will be announced through the SDMA platform,‚Äù he said in a post on his social media accounts.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Separately, in light of recent Indian aggression and unprovoked shelling, Civil Defence Department Director General Abrar Azam urged immediate precautionary measures ahead of any plans to resume academic activities.</p>
<p>In a letter addressed to the divisional commissioners of Muzaffarabad, Mirpur, and Poonch, Mr Azam cited credible reports of suspicious objects, including unexploded ordnance (UXOs), allegedly dropped by Indian forces in civilian areas near the LoC.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGiven the danger posed by unexploded bombs and toy-like explosive devices, it is essential to carry out thorough search-and-sweep operations in all educational institutions before classes resume,‚Äù he stressed, urging timely safety measures on part of district administration concerned to ensure the protection of students and staff.</p>
<p><strong>Humanitarian assistance</strong></p>
<p>Thousands of people relocated from villages and their local communities near the Line of Control (LoC) due to drone strikes, indiscriminate cross-border firing, shelling and artillery exchanges, are facing the most severe impacts, needing humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>Based on the findings of the Rapid Needs Assessment carried out by Islamic Relief Pakistan (IRF), immediate and comprehensive intervention is required to address the multifaceted needs of the affected people.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>A significant limitation was the security risk posed by ongoing cross-border shelling and firing. Access to certain high-risk villages was restricted due to safety concerns, and some visits had to be delayed or rerouted. This limited access to the most affected areas, potentially leading to gaps in data from frontline communities, IRF report says.</p>
<p>The IRF teams collected data across three districts: Muzaffarabad, Bagh and Haveli. The 58pc people residing near the border are also facing protection concerns due to damaged shelters, as many are currently living in public schools and even with relatives, lacking adequate privacy and safety.</p>
<p>The SDMA said a state of emergency has been declared in districts of LOC: Muzaffarabad, Neelum, Haveli, Jhelum Valley, and Kotli. There are mobility restrictions, road closures, and civilians are advised to evacuate from high-risk zones.</p>
<p>Displaced families are relocating to safer areas with relatives. Schools and essential services remain suspended, exacerbating vulnerabilities, particularly for women and children.</p>
<p>Assessment results show 58pc of the population lacks access to clean water, hygiene and dignity kits, primarily due to damaged infrastructure and widespread displacement across AJ&amp;K. Many water sources at community level have been destroyed by heavy mortar fire and shelling, further compounding the crisis. Sanitation conditions have also deteriorated considerably, particularly in displacement settings.</p>
