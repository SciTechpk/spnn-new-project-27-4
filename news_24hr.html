            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said the government was implementing a comprehensive and effective strategy to “completely eliminate” the menace posed by the proscribed <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>, <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and other terrorist outfits to the country.</p>
<p>Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.</p>
<p>In response, the government labelled the group as <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and directed use of the term <em>khariji</em> for attackers. It later <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525">designated</a> Balochistan-based groups as <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">highlight</a> India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office said the premier chaired a meeting of the Steering Committee on Counter-Terrorism and Establishment of the State Writ (Harden the State) today at the PM House. The meeting was attended by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, National Security Adviser Lieutenant General Muhammad Asim Malik, PM aide Rana Sanallah, the four provincial chief secretaries and police chief, ministers and officials.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is working on a comprehensive, effective and workable strategy to completely eliminate <em>Fitna al Hindustan</em>, <em>Fitna al Khawarij</em> and other such anti-social elements,” the statement quoted PM Shehbaz as saying.</p>
<p>He said the state was determined to eradicate and uproot the scourge of terrorism, adding that even the world recognised Pakistan’s successful operations against terrorists.</p>

<p>The prime minister said the state had adopted a “multi-pronged strategy” in the war against terrorism and made “full and effective use” of important elements such as ground operations, legislation, meaningful public communication and discouraging extremist thinking.</p>
<p>The prime minister directed the committee to ensure effective coordination between the federal and provincial governments against terrorism and to strictly implement the recommendations of the committee in this regard.</p>
<p>Lauding the role of security personnel and law enforcement agencies, he said the provincial governments, Intelligence Bureau, Ministry of Interior and Counter-Terrorism Department had taken “very effective steps” in the war against terrorism.</p>
<p>“With the joint actions and cooperation of all the relevant institutions, effective actions were taken against smuggling, which made it possible to prevent it,” he said, adding that preventing the issue had a positive impact on the economy.</p>
<p>The prime minister said that only a peaceful and strong state structure free from terrorism could restore the confidence of investors at the international level, adding that the government had brought substantial changes, such as the digitisation of all systems and improvement in the tax system, for this end.</p>
<p>Pointing to the performance of the Pakistan Stock Exchange, he said the record increase in its index and the improvement in the country’s global ratings indicated the economy’s stability and would restore the confidence of foreign investors.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also said that the implementation of the repatriation programme for Afghans residing illegally in the country was also continuing effectively in accordance with international laws.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir had, similarly, a day ago <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927575/coas-munir-reaffirms-resolve-to-eradicate-terrorism-warns-of-decisive-response-to-all-threats">reaffirmed</a> the military’s resolve to eradicate the menace of terrorism from the country, underscoring the nation’s preparedness to respond decisively to any external or internal threats.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations, the army chief was speaking to a group of stakeholders at the 16th National Workshop in Balochistan.</p>
<p>“[The] COAS resolutely reaffirmed Pakistan Army’s unwavering commitment to uproot the menace of terrorism and [the] inevitability of socio-economic uplift of Balochistan for national cohesion and integration,” the statement had said.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Utility Stores Corporation (USC) on Thursday formally ceased operations, in compliance with the July 31 deadline <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924725">established</a> earlier this month to close the state-owned enterprise (SOE).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924725#:~:text=Established%20in%201971,%20USC%20is%20a%20state-owned%20enterprise%20tasked%20with%20supplying%20essential%20commodities%20at%20subsidised%20rates,%20primarily%20targeting%20low-income%20households.%20It%20currently%20operates%20over%204,000%20retail%20outlets%20nationwide.">Established</a> in 1971, USC was an SOE tasked with supplying essential commodities at subsidised rates, primarily targeting low-income households. It operated over 4,000 retail outlets nationwide.</p>
<p>According to a USC notification from the Ministry of Industries and Production, available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, the decision was taken in compliance with directives issued by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on June 28 and a meeting of the board of directors earlier this month.</p>
<p>“All the sales and purchases at utility stores have been closed with effect from July 31, except shifting of stock from stores to warehouses and returned to vendors and handing-taking of stores’ inventories,” the notification reads, instructing strict compliance with the order.</p>
<p>Additionally, sales through the business-management suite Odoo have been permanently discontinued as of today, a second USC notification read.</p>
<p>“All point of sale systems connected with Odoo will be rendered inactive across all stores effective July 31,” the notice read. “No store in charge or designated official is authorised to conduct any sales through the Odoo system after this date. Additionally, no procurement transactions shall be initiated through Odoo either.”</p>
<p>According to the notification, the Odoo system will only be utilised for inventory reconciliation and record maintenance and any attempt to carry out sales or purchase transactions after today will be treated as “a serious violation of official policy”.</p>
<p>It added that “any employee found conducting or facilitating sales or purchases through Odoo after July 31 shall be held personally responsible, and strict disciplinary action will be initiated under USC rules.”</p>
<p>According to the finance ministry’s Federal SOE Performance Overview for the first half of FY25, USC posted a loss of Rs4.1 billion over six months, with cumulative losses rising to Rs15.5bn — highlighting persistent structural and operational challenges.</p>
<p>In January, the federal cabinet <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1887083">formed</a> a high-level committee to develop a comprehensive strategy for the prompt shutdown of USC operations nationwide. The committee was tasked with determining a plan for the immediate closure of the USC, as well as arrangements for placing permanent USC employees in the surplus pool or absorption against existing vacancies in other federal government organisations.</p>
<p>The National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Privatisation was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906202">informed</a> in April that under the restructuring plan of USC, 1,203 Utility Stores were closed while 2,237 employees were laid off.</p></p>

            <p><p>An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Faisalabad on Thursday sentenced PTI leaders, including Omar Ayub Khan, Shibli Faraz, Hamid Raza, and Zartaj Gul Wazir, to 10 years of imprisonment for their involvement in the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1752003">PTI supporters</a>, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">arrest</a>, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">attacking</a> the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.</p>
<p>Out of 185 PTI workers accused, 108 have been sentenced by the court today.  PTI’s Member of the Provincial Assembly (MPA), Junaid Afzal Sahi, was sentenced to three years in prison. Meanwhile, MPA Khayal Ahmad Kastro, Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Zain Qureshi, and former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry have been acquitted in the cases.</p>
<p>Reacting to the development, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the party will challenge the decision in the high courts.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media in Islamabad today, Gohar said: “We will raise the issue with PTI Founder Imran Khan on the future course of action regarding whether we should return to the parliament or launch a movement.”</p>
<p>He said that the “political cases against PTI members were baseless”, adding that the PTI believed in running the system instead of believing in extremism.</p>
<p>“We do not believe in violence or incitement in politics. Those who have been convicted today do not believe in politics of violence.”</p>
<p>According to a copy of the court order — available with <em>Dawn.com</em> — “the prosecution has successfully proved its case without any shadow of doubt” against 17 of the accused, including the opposition leaders and Zartaj Gul. They were sentenced to:</p>

<p>According to the order, the 108 convicts will receive copies of the order and will be able to file an appeal within 15 days. Additionally, arrest warrants have been issued for those convicted in absentia, including Shibli Faraz, Omar Ayub, Rai Murtaza Iqbal and Zartaj Gul.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 77 accused were acquitted because the prosecution “miserably failed to prove the alleged offence”.</p>
<p>In a post on X, the PTI condemned the sentences in the strongest terms and branded the cases “false, fabricated, and politically motivated”, adding that the opposition leaders in both houses were sentenced to prevent the party’s mass mobilisation on August 5.</p>
<p>“Through this decision, six of our National Assembly members, three Punjab Assembly members and one senator have been sentenced,” the party stated. “This decision is not only a clear violation of the Constitution and the law but also another dark stain on the face of justice.</p>
<p>“The judiciary’s continuous transformation into a rubber stamp at the behest of the state system, issuing such grave verdicts one after another under political pressure without transparent trials, evidence, cross-examination of witnesses, or the right to defence, is a dangerous trend that is completely undermining the credibility of the judicial system,” the statement added.</p>
<p>The PTI added that this is the “first time” opposition leaders in both houses of parliament have been sentenced “solely based on their loyalty to Imran Khan’s political narrative, public representation, and constitutional struggle”.</p>
<p>“The real purpose of these decisions is not to deliver legal justice but to make a concerted effort to prevent the public protest scheduled for August 5, which was announced by Imran Khan himself,” the party claimed.</p>

<p>“Today’s sentences and the warrants issued against several other leaders this morning are all links in the chain of fear that the state system harbours toward Imran Khan’s peaceful public movement.”</p>
<p>Moreover, the party branded the sentences “part of a systematic plan aimed at suppressing the public awakening and political consciousness emerging under Imran Khan’s leadership”.</p>
<p>However, the PTI wrote that these sentences only ignited their resolve, ahead of the protests slated for August 5.</p>
<p>“Imran Khan’s vision lives in our hearts, and our loyalty to it remains unwavering.
Our leaders and workers are ready for every sacrifice, because we believe that only those nations survive the darkness of oppression that resist,” the statement read.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan deplored the mass sentencing.</p>
<p>“While those involved in violence must be held accountable, the use of anti-terror laws to try civilians raises serious due-process concerns and is symptomatic of the continued erosion of democratic values. We reiterate that all those accused must receive fair, transparent trials in civilian courts and urge the state to refrain from using draconian laws to stifle political dissent.”</p>
