            <p><p>Israel’s Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened on Monday that the residents of Tehran will “pay the price and soon” after Iranian missiles struck Tel Aviv and the port city of Haifa before dawn, killing at least five people.</p>
<p>The latest military exchange between the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916920/a-timeline-of-the-long-standing-conflict-between-israel-and-iran">arch-rivals</a> began when Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/israel-launches-strikes-on-iran">struck</a> Iran’s nuclear and military sites on Friday, killing top <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">commanders and scientists</a>.

<p>“The residents of Tehran will pay the price, and soon,” Katz <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/Israel_katz/status/1934482487599575160" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>, as the missile exchange continued for a fourth day, fuelling concerns among world leaders at this week’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1917383">G7 meeting</a> that the battle between the two old enemies could lead to a broader regional conflict.</p>

<p>At least five people were killed in the latest Iranian strikes, the national emergency service said, bringing Israel’s death toll to at least 18 since Friday.</p>
<p>At least 100 more were wounded in the overnight strikes, part of a wave of attacks by Tehran in retaliation for Israel’s strikes targeting Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.</p>
<p>Search and location operations were underway in the coastal city of Haifa, where around 30 people were wounded, emergency authorities said, as dozens of first responders rushed to the strike zones.</p>
<p>Fires were seen burning at a power plant near the port, the media reported. Video footage showed several missiles over Tel Aviv and explosions could be heard there and over Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Israel’s military warned of a new missile salvo incoming from Iran. “A short while ago, the IDF identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the State of Israel,” the army posted on Telegram, using the acronym for its official name.</p>
<p>It said its air defences were working to intercept the threat but advised people to “enter a protected space and remain there until further notice”.</p>
<p>An <em>AFP</em> journalist heard loud explosions in Jerusalem on early Monday, while footage showed Israeli air defences working over the city. Outside Haifa, an <em>AFP</em> journalist saw fires break out following the latest Iranian barrage.</p>
<p>British maritime security firm Ambrey said that fires were observed at the power plant in the vicinity of Israel’s Haifa port, <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>
<p>Ambrey said it observed video footage of the Israeli military intercepting the attack, followed by impacts from two hypersonic missiles.</p>
<p>Israel’s public broadcaster <em>Kan</em> reported that at least four areas were hit in the latest Iranian attacks on central Israel.</p>

<p>The death toll in Iran since Friday has risen to 224, including 70 women and children, while over 1,200 have been injured, the health ministry was quoted as saying earlier today by <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/at-least-224-killed-over-1-000-wounded-in-israeli-strikes-on-iran-health-ministry/3599882" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anadolu Agency</a></em>.</p>
<p>More than 90 per cent of the wounded were civilians, including women and children, health ministry official Hossein Kermanpour <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/HKermanpour/status/1934331936912326671" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X.</p>
<p>General Mohammad Kazemi, the intelligence chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), his deputy Gen Hassan Mohaqqeq, and Gen Mohsen Baqeri were among those killed in Israel’s attacks on Sunday, the IRGC <a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/06/16/3336218/irgc-intelligence-officials-martyred-in-israeli-attack" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>
<p>Iranian state television reported at least five people were killed on Sunday by an Israeli strike that hit a residential building in downtown Iran.</p>
<p>Israel has claimed strikes as far away as Iran’s holy city of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1835205">Mashhad</a> in the far east, 2,300 kilometres from Israel.</p>
<p>Colonel Reza Sayyad, a spokesman for Iran’s armed forces, threatened a “devastating response” to Israel’s attacks.</p>
<p>“Leave the occupied territories (Israel) because they will certainly no longer be habitable in the future,” he warned in a televised address, adding shelters will “not guarantee security”.</p>
<p>According to <em>AFP</em>, residential areas in both countries have suffered deadly strikes since the hostilities broke out, with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slamming Iran on Sunday for allegedly targeting civilians.</p>
<p>“Iran will pay a very heavy price for the premeditated murder of civilians, women and children,” he said, during a visit to the site of a missile strike on a residential building in the coastal city of Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>His remarks came hours after Iranian missile fire killed another 10 people yesterday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a likely Iranian drone killed a woman in Syria, a Britain-based war monitor said, in what would be the first death on Syrian soil since the current hostilities between Iran and Israel began, reported <em>AFP.</em></p>
<p>The drone struck the woman’s home in western Tartus province, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said earlier today that it was striking surface-to-surface missile sites in central Iran, adding it was “operating against this threat in our skies and in Iranian skies”.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#i-will-not-leave" id="i-will-not-leave" title="Permalink"></a>‘I will not leave’</h2>
<p>A heavy cloud of smoke hung above Tehran after Israeli aircraft struck two fuel depots. Local media also reported an Israeli strike on the police headquarters in the city centre.</p>
<p>“We haven’t been able to sleep since Friday because of the terrible noise,” said a Tehran resident who gave her name as Farzaneh.</p>
<p>“Today, they hit a house in our alley, and we were very scared. So we decided to leave Tehran and head to the north of the country.”</p>
<p>Some, however, were determined to stay.</p>
<p>“It is natural that war has its own stress, but I will not leave my city,” Shokouh Razzazi, 31, told <em>AFP.</em></p>
<p><em>AFP</em> images from the Israeli city of Haifa, meanwhile, also showed a column of smoke rising on Sunday evening following an Iranian missile barrage.</p>

<p>The military said rescue teams “have been dispatched to several hit sites in Israel”, while the fire services reported rescuers heading to a building on the coast that sustained a “direct hit”.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, in Bat Yam, first responders wearing helmets and headlamps picked through a bombed-out building.</p>
<p>“There was an explosion and I thought the whole house had collapsed,” said Bat Yam resident Shahar Ben Zion.</p>
<p>“It was a miracle we survived.”</p>

<p>In Washington, two US officials told <em>Reuters</em> that Trump had vetoed an Israeli plan in recent days to kill Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>
<p>“We found out that the Israelis had plans to hit Iran’s supreme leader. President Trump was against it, and we told the Israelis not to,” a US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>When asked about the <em>Reuters</em> report, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu <a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/netanyahu-reveals-iran-marked-trump-enemy-number-one-assassination-plot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Fox News</em></a> on Sunday: “There’s so many false reports of conversations that never happened, and I’m not going to get into that.”</p>
<p>“We do what we need to do,” he told <em>Fox</em>’s ‘Special Report With Bret Baier’.</p>
<p>Asked in the interview whether <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917243">regime change</a> in Iran was one of the objectives of Israel’s strikes, Netanyahu said that “it certainly could be the result, because the Iran regime is very weak”.</p>
<p>Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20shifting%20stance%20around%20the%20Israeli%20strikes%2C%20which%20he%20called%20%E2%80%9Cexcellent%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9Cvery%20successful%E2%80%9D%20in%20a%20series%20of%20media%20interviews%20on%20Friday">lauded Israel’s offensive</a> but said Washington had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917285#:~:text=Trump%20distances%20US%20from%20strikes%20on%20Iran%2C%20warns%20against%20attacks%20on%20it%20in%20%E2%80%98any%20way%E2%80%99">nothing to do</a> with it, while threatening to unleash “the full strength and might” of the US military if Iran attacked American interests.</p>
<p>However, seemingly contradicting his ally, Netanyahu claimed that American pilots were shooting down drones headed towards Israel. In the same interview, he also said that he and Trump were “fully coordinated”.</p>
<p>Trump has urged the two foes to “make a deal”, adding, however, that “sometimes they have to fight it out” first. He told <em>ABC News</em> on Sunday that he would be “open” to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, being a mediator.</p>
<p>“It’s possible we could get involved” in the ongoing battle in the Middle East, he said.</p>
<p>Two US officials said on Friday that the US military had helped shoot down Iranian missiles that were headed toward Israel, according to <em>Reuters</em>. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/after-sitting-out-the-iran-attack-u-s-steps-in-to-help-israel-intercept-missiles-16749866" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> the same.</p>
<p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi maintained Tehran had “solid proof” that US forces had supported Israel in its attacks.</p>
<p>He also told a meeting of foreign diplomats that Iran’s actions were a “response to aggression”. “If the aggression stops, naturally our responses will also stop,” he added.</p>
<p>Iran scrapped <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">planned</a> nuclear <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903561">talks</a> with the United States, saying it was “meaningless” to negotiate while under fire.</p>
<p>Iranian media, including <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1404/03/25/3335833/%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%DB%8C-2-%D8%B9%D8%B6%D9%88-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%AC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tasnim</a></em>, reported on Sunday that police had arrested two suspects over alleged links to Israel’s Mossad spy agency.</p>
<p>Israel, in turn, said it had taken two individuals into custody over alleged links to Iranian intelligence.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917405/fuel-prices-go-up' target='_blank'><strong>Fuel prices go up</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Petrol hiked by Rs4.80, diesel rates rise by Rs7.95<br />
• Crisis deepens in Balochistan as supply from Iran disrupted<br />
• ME conflict worries global markets</p>
<p>QUETTA/KARACHI: The federal government has jacked up the prices of both petrol and diesel, with their rates climbing by Rs4.80 and Rs7.95 per litre, respectively.</p>
<p>According to a Finance Division notification issued on late Sunday night, the new prices had been determined “based on the recommendations of Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority) and the relevant ministries”.</p>
<p>High-speed diesel (HSD), which previously cost Rs254.64 per litre, will now be sold for Rs262.59.</p>
<p>Similarly, petrol, which cost Rs253.63 per litre, will now be available for Rs258.43.</p>
<p>Previous estimates suggested that petrol and diesel prices would increase by about Re1 and Rs5 per litre, respectively, for the next fortnight, owing to higher international market prices.</p>
<p><strong>Fuel crisis deepens in Balochistan</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the fuel crisis in Balochistan has taken a serious turn amid the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917285/four-injured-in-haifa-amid-fresh-iranian-missile-salvo-on-israel">escalating Israel-Iran conflict</a>, as the supply of Iranian oil through the border has been badly affected, leading to the closure of a large number of petrol pumps.</p>
<p>The border districts of Balochistan with Iran, including Turbat, Gwadar, Panjgur, Chagai, Washuk, and Mashkail are worst-affected, as they were not only facing suspension of Iranian oil supply, but also a food shortage, as most eatable supplies also come from Iran.</p>
<p>Around 60 to 70 per cent petrol pumps have been closed due to suspension of supply of Iranian smuggled oil through Makran, Rakhshan and Chagai areas. The petrol pumps selling smuggled Iranian petrol and diesel were already closed by the district administration last week, which also added to citizens’ woes in Quetta and other districts.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Those involved in the Iranian petrol business had increased prices, selling petrol for Rs280 to 300 per litre in the black market, while the government had fixed the local petrol price at Rs254 per litre.</p>
<p>The petrol supply from Karachi was also affected due to the road blockade between Quetta and the port city at different points.</p>
<p><strong>‘No fuel shortage’</strong></p>
<p>However, the Balochistan government claimed that there was no fuel shortage in the province, as most petrol pumps were open in the provincial capital.</p>
<p>In a statement, provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind refuted the impression that the province was facing a fuel shortage.</p>
<p>He said that petrol stations selling Iranian oil are safety hazards, citing 28 fuel-related accidents across Quetta in the past month, including incidents on Airport Road and in Hazar Ganji area.</p>
<p>“These so-called shortages are being exaggerated by those who want to lift the ban on smuggled Iranian fuel,” Rind said, adding that strict action is being taken to ensure the supply of legal petrol through registered pumps. Petrol stations found involved in hoarding or refusing service will face immediate legal consequences, he warned.</p>
<p><strong>Global oil price volatility</strong></p>
<p>The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran has raised significant concerns in global markets, particularly in the energy sector, due to both countries’ strategic positions in the Middle East, a region critical to the global oil supply chain.</p>
<p>Investors were on edge ahead of markets reopening late on Sunday, gripped by anxiety over the escalating threat of a sweeping conflict in the Middle East and nationwide protests against President Donald Trump, according to Reuters.</p>
<p>Oil prices rose by 7pc on Friday, as Israel and Iran traded strikes, and investors will be watching closely to see how prices react when markets open today (Monday).</p>
<p>Israel’s strikes on Iran’s oil and gas industry lifted oil prices and prompted a rush into gold and the dollar, which resumed its role as a safe-haven asset for the first time in months.</p>
<p>Oil prices at close to six-month highs could pose a risk to the inflation outlook, as central banks around the world grapple with the impact on prices from Trump’s trade tariffs and the effect on economic growth.</p>
<p>Energy experts said if hostilities remain limited to tit-for-tat strikes without affecting shipping lanes or oil fields then oil prices may see short-term volatility, but stabilise quickly later.</p>
<p>In other case, if the conflict escalates, impacting the Strait of Hormuz or drags in other countries, the oil prices could surge above $100 per barrel, they feared.</p>

            <p><p>WASHINGTON: Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir arrived in Washington on Sunday for a five-day official visit aimed at reinforcing military and strategic ties between Pakistan and the United States, diplomatic sources confirmed.</p>
<p>The visit, which sources described as “primarily bilateral in nature”, is not officially linked to the US Army’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917286">250th anniversary celebrations</a> on June 14, despite its timing.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir did not attend the military parade, but some sources speculated that he spent the last two days at the US Central Command’s headquarters in Tampa, Florida. The Pakistani embassy in Washington, however, refused to confirm or deny this claim.</p>
<p>The sources said the army chief’s visit aims to reinforce military and strategic ties between Pakistan and the US, with meetings expected with senior US officials, including the Secretaries of Defence and State and senior US military commanders.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, several PTI supporters staged a protest outside the Pakistan embassy on Saturday afternoon, calling for the restoration of what they described as “unfettered democracy” in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The demonstration came ahead of the COAS’s arrival. “We believe the army chief is in Washi­ngton, and that’s why we’re here,” said one of the protest organisers, linking the demonstration to the COAS’ presence in the US.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The Pakistani embassy declined to confirm or deny the visit at the time of the protest.</p>
<p>The army chief’s trip comes at a particularly delicate time, following <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/iran-responds-with-operation-true-promise-3-after-israeli-onslaught-targets-nuclear-facilities">Israeli airstrikes in Iran.</a></p>
<p>Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst, said the visit is complicated by the regional tensions.</p>
<p>“Pakistan wants to cultivate US support but has condemned the Israeli strikes and is working to strengthen ties with Tehran,” Mr Kugelman noted. “For Gen Munir to be in the capital of Israel’s closest ally and Iran’s primary adversary at such a tense moment could lead to some uncomfortable conversations.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He added that the unfolding Middle East crisis may also limit how fully US officials can engage with the visiting Pakistani delegation.</p>
<p>Mr Kugelman said counterterrorism cooperation will likely dominate the agenda, and Field Marshal Munir may try to build on recent improvements in bilateral ties following the India-Pakistan ceasefire. However, broader efforts to reframe the security partnership would remain a “hard sell”, he warned.</p>
<p>Shuja Nawaz, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council’s South Asia Centre, underscored the strategic imbalance in US regional priorities.</p>
<p>“Washington sees Pakistan in the China camp but as a useful counterterrorism base,” Mr Nawaz said.</p>
