<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz said Pakistan came out of the crisis with India as victorious because of the “brave actions of our outstanding armed forces, strongly supported by the people of Pakistan”.</p>
<p>He added, “We want peace and will work for peace in the region thro­ugh talks on the table and resolve our outstanding iss­ues, including the Kash­mir dispute, according to the United Nations Secu­rity Council resolutions, which were acknowledged even by the Indian Lok Sabha when Nehru was the prime minister of India.”</p>
<p>He said Pakistan is ready to talk for the sake of peace on different issues, including water, trade and counterterrorism, “if India is serious”. However, he reaffirmed that if India remained aggressive, Pakistan would defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
<p>The prime minister said he had a productive and useful meeting with the Iranian president, covering all areas of mutual interest and cooperation.</p>

<p>“There was total agreement that the two brotherly neighbouring countries must enhance cooperation in diverse fields, including trade, investment and economy,” he added.</p>
<p>Stressing that Pakistan and Iran had deep-rooted cultural and historical relations, he said, “We have decided to transform these relations into a very productive cooperation in various fields of life.”</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also thanked the Iranian president for calling him and showing his concern on the evolving situation in the subcontinent a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>“I deeply appreciate your concern and brotherly feelings for the people of Pakistan and your ardent desire that this crisis comes to a grinding halt instead of escalating further,” he told the president.</p>
<p><strong>Israeli actions condemned</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz said Pakistan condemned Israeli actions causing untold misery for the people of Gaza, where Israel murdered more than 50,000 Palestinians, and the bloodshed continues.</p>
<p>“It is high time that the international community used its influence to bring a lasting ceasefire in Palestine. Pakistan stands by its brothers and sisters in Iran to promote peace, progress and prosperity,” he said.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan fully supported Iran’s right to have a civilian nuclear programme. He assured that Pakistan would work with Iran on all issues of mutual concern.</p>
<p>The Iranian president stressed that Pakistan and Iran shared a common stance on important regional and international issues on different platforms, including the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).</p>
<p>President Pezeshkian said the two countries should cooperate on making their borders secure from the activities of terrorists and criminal groups.</p>
<p>“Peace and stability in Pakistan are in the interest of Iran. We believe that sustaining security and maintaining friendly and peaceful relations with neighbouring countries is in the interest of the two countries,” he added.</p>
<p>He said Iran welcomed the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, adding that settling issues through dialogue was essential for stability in the region.</p>
<p>“We believe that to ensure security and stability in the region, neighbouring countries should hold dialogue and have positive consultations with each other and the international partners,” he added.</p>
<p>He said the two sides discussed issues facing the Islamic world and the top priority was the issue of Palestine.</p>
<p>“As always, we support the cause of Palestine and condemn the atrocities carried out by Israel,” he added.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to Prime Minister Tariq Fatimi accompanied the prime minister.</p>

            <p><p>Nepali Sherpa guide <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1122089/newspaper/column">Kami Rita</a> scaled Mount Everest for the 31st time on Tuesday, breaking the record he set last year.</p>
<p>The 55-year-old reached the 8,849-metre (29,032 foot) peak — the highest in the world — by the traditional southeast ridge route while guiding a 22-member Indian army team, officials said, adding that 27 other Sherpas also accompanied the group.</p>
<p>“He is a very passionate climber,” said Pasang Phurba, director of the Seven Summit Treks company for which Kami Rita works, adding that Kami Rita was currently descending to lower camps.</p>
<p>Kami Rita, who uses only his first name, first climbed Everest in 1994 and has done so every year except for three years when authorities <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1626367">closed</a> the mountain to climbers for various reasons.</p>
<p>More than 8,000 people have climbed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1594790">Mount Everest</a> since it was first scaled by New Zealander Sir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/284404">Edmund Hillary</a> and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953.</p>
<p>After Kami Rita, another Sherpa, Pasang Dawa, has ascended Everest the most with 29 climbs. Among non-Sherpa climbers, the record is held by British guide <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1637562">Kenton Cool</a> who has accomplished the feat 19 times, followed by American climbers Dave Hahn and Garrett Madison with 15 times each.</p>
<p>One of the poorest countries in the world, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1386736">Nepal</a> is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest peaks and is heavily reliant on climbing, trekking, and tourism for foreign exchange. Guiding foreign climbers to Everest and other peaks provides crucial family income to many Sherpas.</p>
<p>Authorities have issued 468 permits to climbers for Everest this March-May climbing season, and more than 300 climbers and Sherpas have already scaled the peak, officials said.</p>
<p>Two climbers are known to have died on the mountain this month and there have also been unconfirmed reports of other deaths.</p></p>

            <p><p>• Govt activates emergency protocols; orders desilting of waterways<br />
• PDMA calls for standardised fitting of solar panels to withstand inclement weather<br />
• Official says 70pc deaths resulted from falling solar panels</p>
<p>LAHORE: Heavy rain and thunderstorms are set to batter Punjab, days after similar weather <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913072">killed</a> around 20 people across the province.</p>
<p>The Provincial Disaster Man­agement Authority (PDMA) Punjab has issued a province-wide alert of severe weather from today (Tuesday).</p>
<p>A westerly wave combined with moist currents is likely to bring intense windstorms, thu­nderstorms, and heavy rainfall across the region from May 27 to 31, said the Met department forecast.</p>
<p>Upper and central Punjab districts, including Rawal­pi­ndi, Murree, Galliyat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mianwali, Sargodha, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Sialkot, Narowal, Okara, Lahore, Faisalabad, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Gujranwala, Gujrat and Sheikhupura will experience heavy rains with hailstorms and lightning from the evening of May 27 through May 31.</p>
<p>Southern districts of DG Khan, Rajanpur, Multan, Bhakkar, Layyah, Bahawalpur, Sahiwal, Pakpattan and Vehari are expected to receive light to moderate rain and thunderstorms during the same period.</p>
<p>The authorities warned people to stay away from loose stru­ctures, including electric poles, trees, vehicles and solar panels during thunderstorms and stay indoors as much as possible.</p>
<p>The warning was issued as a PDMA assessment showed 70pc of casualties during the thunderstorm three days ago were caused by falling solar panels which were not installed properly.</p>
<p><strong>Emergency protocols</strong></p>
<p>In light of the fresh forecast, the Punjab government has activated emergency protocols across all districts.</p>
<p>The district administrations and all relevant departments, including health, education, irrigation, local government and Rescue 1122, have been put on alert to maintain round-the-clock staffing at emergency operation centres.</p>
<p>The provincial cabinet committee on disaster management also convened an emergency meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>Health Minister Khawaja Salman Rafiq chaired the mee­ting attended by senior officials and divisional commissioners.</p>
<p>The meeting focused on a comprehensive five-point age­nda to strengthen the province’s response to the upcoming monsoon season.</p>
<p>PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia briefed the committee on the relief body’s preparations. The commissioners and deputy commissioners shared progress reports on ongoing desilting of waterways and mock emergency exercises.</p>
<p>Mr Rafiq issued directives for enhanced measures in Gujranwala and Lahore, where above-average monsoon rains are predicted.</p>
<p>The meeting approved a special grant for desilting operations in Waha (Rajanpur) and urgent measures to address potential hill torrents in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>The minister stressed the importance of field visits by officers to ensure proper arrangements before monsoon rains.</p>
<p>Rawalpindi’s Leh Nullah was specifically identified for priority desilting operations.</p>
<p>The meeting also reviewed the Flood Risk Management Survey. Officials revealed plans to survey over 100,000 structures in Dera Ghazi Khan division, with all hill torrent area surveys scheduled for completion by June 22.</p>
<p>The committee also approved a crucial model study on river erosion patterns.</p>
<p><strong>PDMA helpline</strong></p>
<p>The PDMA has also established a communication system to disseminate weather updates and warnings through SMS alerts, mosque announcements and through local representatives.</p>
<p>PDMA DG Kathia urged citizens to contact the PDMA helpline at 1129 in case of any emergency. The authority can also be reached on WhatsApp +923178371900 and landline 042-9922135/6 for assistance.</p>
<p>PDMA has also directed local authorities to submit daily situation reports.</p>
<p><strong>Solar panel regulations</strong></p>
<p>The PDMA has taken action against substandard fitting of solar panels after falling plates resulted in the deaths of most of the 19 people who were killed during the windstorm in central and southern Punjab on Saturday.</p>
<p>The authority has issued directives to the energy and local government departments and divisional and district administrations for comprehensive guidelines for the installation of solar panels so that they could withstand inclement weather.</p>
<p>According to PDMA’s findings, poorly installed solar panels and mounting structures were uprooted during the recent storm, causing fatal accidents across Punjab.</p>
<p>Poorly fitted panels and mounts fell from rooftops, resulting in significant loss of life and property.</p>
<p>PDMA DG Kathia confirmed that 70pc of the accidents that occurred due to windstorms in the past few days were caused by fallen solar panels or their mounts.</p>
<p>He said solar panels installed on rooftops or in open areas should follow proper installation guidelines.</p>
<p>He stressed the installation of solar panels should be standardised and certified in the future.</p>
<p>The PDMA has instructed district administrations to conduct thorough surveys of existing solar installations to identify and repair dangerous fittings.</p>
<p>The installation of all existing and future solar panels must meet strict engineering standards, including the key requirements like use of certified material and mounting equipment, structural approval by relevant authorities and implementation of regular maintenance and inspection protocols, the relief body directed.</p>
<p>It also stressed the need to devise standard operating procedures (SOPs) for repairs and periodic safety checks.</p>
<p>The energy and local government departments were directed to create a regulatory framework for solar panel installations.</p>
<p>The framework would enforce mandatory safety standards and certification processes for all solar energy systems, especially those installed on rooftops and open structures.</p>
<p>The PDMA warned that failure to comply with the new guidelines could result in similar tragedies during future extreme weather events.</p>
<p>All deputy commissioners have been directed to immediately launch awareness campaigns to educate the public about safe solar panel installation practices while the formal regulations were being developed.</p>
