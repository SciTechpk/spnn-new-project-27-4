                <h2>Escalation can outpace diplomacy with no crisis management in place, warns Pakistan‚Äôs top general</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan‚Äôs top military man General Sahir Shamshad Mirza has stressed the need to move towards conflict resolution instead of management, warning that its absence could result in a destructive escalation.</p>
<p>The remarks follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi‚Äôs allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam. As New Delhi launched <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> in early May, killing civilians, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downed five Indian jets</a> in retaliation. After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>Gen Mirza, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, made the remarks at the annual <a class="link--external" href="https://www.iiss.org/events/shangri-la-dialogue/shangri-la-dialogue-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shangri-La Dialogue 2025</a> organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore on Saturday evening.</p>
<p>During a panel discussion, titled ‚Äú<a class="link--external" href="https://www.iiss.org/events/shangri-la-dialogue/shangri-la-dialogue-2025/special-sessions/special-session-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Regional Crisis-Management Mechanisms</a>‚Äù, Gen Mirza said: ‚ÄúIt has become imperative to move beyond conflict management towards conflict resolution. This will ensure sustainable peace and an assured crisis management.‚Äù</p>
<p>He then stressed that an ‚Äúearly resolution of Kashmir in line with the UN Security Council <a class="link--external" href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/111955/?ln=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resolutions</a> and as per the aspirations of the people is essential‚Äù for an enduring peace in South Asia.</p>
<p>The CJCSC cautioned: ‚ÄúGiven the Indian policies and polities‚Äô extremist mindset, the absence of a crisis management mechanism may not give enough time to the global powers to intervene and affect cessation of hostilities. They will be probably too late to avoid damage and destruction.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>During his address, Gen Mirza also highlighted the Kashmir dispute and the recent military clash between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen there is no crisis, Kashmir is never discussed, and as we always say that it is the Kashmir dispute resolution in line with the aspirations of the people of Kashmir and in line with the <a class="link--external" href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/111955/?ln=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UNSC resolutions</a> that will address many issues.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe core that resides between Pakistan and India is Kashmir,‚Äù the CJCSC pointed out.</p>
<p>He added that unless countries did not ‚Äúenter conflict resolution‚Äù ‚Äî which he said could initially be through conflict management and then lead to resolution ‚Äî issues would ‚Äúalways erupt‚Äù.</p>
<p>Other speakers on the panel included Canada‚Äôs Deputy Minister of National Defence Stefanie Beck and Fiji‚Äôs army chief Major Gen Jone Logavatu Kalouniwai. India‚Äôs Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan also addressed a separate <a class="link--external" href="https://www.iiss.org/events/shangri-la-dialogue/shangri-la-dialogue-2025/special-sessions/special-session-1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discussion</a> on defence innovation yesterday.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Gen Mirza said the recent Pak-India escalation had underscored ‚Äúhow regional crisis management frameworks remain hostage to countries‚Äô belligerence‚Äù, noting that the only line of contact between the two countries was the director general military operations <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911867">(DGMO) hotline</a>.</p>
<p>The top general further said that following the military conflict, the ‚Äúthreshold of an escalatory war has come dangerously low, implying greater risk on both sides, not just in the disputed territory but all of India and all of Pakistan‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEmboldening of India as a net security provider by the West and its ambition to become a regional hegemon is disincentivising it to engage in conflict management options,‚Äù CJCSC Mirza asserted.</p>
<p>He went on to state that Pakistan desired a ‚Äúpeaceful coexistence with India based on mutual respect, sovereign equality and most importantly, dignity and honour‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe seek a principal order, an order anchored in sovereign equality and restraint. In this, crisis management is not merely a set of tools but a strategic ethic,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>The CJCSC stressed the need for instead of chalking out new mechanisms, the Asia-Pacific and South Asia regions required to re-energise and strengthen existing bilateral, regional and multilateral frameworks. ‚ÄúStates need to communicate more and more often and more effectively.‚Äù</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#conventional-warfare-threshold-now-dangerously-lower" id="conventional-warfare-threshold-now-dangerously-lower" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòConventional warfare threshold now dangerously lower‚Äô</h2>
<p>During the IISS session, Gen Mirza also asserted that following the Pakistan-India military clash, the threshold of conventional warfare had ‚Äúsignificantly degraded‚Äù to ‚Äúdangerous levels‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe lowering of this threshold to the dangerous levels, if next time such a conflict occurs and the cities are targeted first and the borders become irrelevant mostly, [‚Ä¶] there could be a chance ‚Äî I‚Äôm not trying to create an alarm but I‚Äôm speaking based on logic ‚Äî there could be a possibility that before the international community intervenes because of the restricted or constricted times window, the damage and destruction may have already taken place,‚Äù he warned.</p>
<p>Gen Mirza pointed out that the 1965 and 1971 wars with India were ‚Äúalways confined to the disputed territory‚Äù. ‚Äú[However,] this time, it has transcended that and come to the international border.‚Äù</p>
<p>The CJCSC further noted: ‚ÄúInstead of targeting the borders first, which used to be the conventional domain or erstwhile domain, the cities have been targeted and the borders have relatively remained, if not silent, comfortable.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi had launched a series of air strikes in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">Punjab</a> and Azad Kashmir, resulting in at least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910848">40 civilians</a> losing their lives with 121 others injured.</p>
<p>The military has confirmed that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910992">13 security personnel</a>, including members of the Pakistan Army and the Pakistan Air Force, were martyred while over 75 were injured during the confrontation with India.</p>
<p>Noting that by those attacks, India had ‚Äúcrossed the threshold of disputed territory into the international border‚Äù, Gen Mirza said it had significantly lowered the threshold.</p>
<p>Highlighting the absence of a crisis management mechanism, ‚Äújingoistic‚Äù role of Indian media and its leadership‚Äôs mindset, he said, ‚ÄúHad there been no third party mediation, it would have gone to the next levels.‚Äù</p>
<p>The CJCSC mentioned the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">United States</a>, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as the ‚Äúinterlocutors‚Äù.</p></p>

                <h2>India‚Äôs Congress party says Modi govt ‚Äòmisled‚Äô nation following top general‚Äôs admission of losing aircraft to Pakistan</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>India‚Äôs Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge on Saturday said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/kharge/status/1928783909946318854" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X that the Modi government had ‚Äúmisled the nation‚Äù amidst the furore over the Indian top general‚Äôs admission of losing aircraft to Pakistan.</p>
<p>A day after a BJP politician and staunch critic of Prime Minister Nare¬≠ndra Modi, Subrahmanyam Swamy, claimed Pakistan had downed five Indian planes in the recent military escalation, India‚Äôs Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914500">confirmed</a> yesterday that his country‚Äôs fighter jets were downed by Pakistan but did not specify any number.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Modi govt has misled the nation. The fog of war is now clearing,‚Äù Kharge wrote in the post.</p>
<p>He said that in the wake of the remarks made by the Indian CDS in Singapore in an interview, there were some very important questions which needed to be asked.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese can only be asked if a Special Session of the Parliament is immediately convened,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Congress party demands a comprehensive review of defence preparedness by an independent expert committee, on the lines of the Kargil review committee,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Congress leader and Telangana Minister Uttam Reddy separately demanded transparency from the Indian government to reveal the extent of losses, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/india/modi-govt-should-come-clean-on-military-losses-suffered-during-op-sindoor-congress-amid-cds-chauhans-remark-3565775" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deccan Herald</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe fact that the fighter aircraft were downed is something that the government needs to stop denying. The CDS himself mentioned that. ‚ÄúEarlier Air Marshal Bharti had mentioned it indirectly in his briefing along with the DGMO,‚Äù Reddy, himself a former air force pilot, was quoted as having said.</p>
<p>Indian fighter jets were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">shot down</a> by the Pakistan Air Force on the night of May 6-7 in response to the Indian Air Force‚Äôs late-night missile strikes at six Pakistani sites, including Subhan Mosque in Bahawalpur‚Äôs Ahmedpur East, Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad, Abbas Mosque in Kotli, Umalkura Mosque in Muridke, the village of Kotki Lohara in Sialkot district, and Shakargarh.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911307">took down</a> six Indian jets, including three advanced French Rafale planes. According to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911123"><em>Dawn.com</em> report</a>, the recent clash between India and Pakistan marks a significant development in the regional air power constellation. Three Rafales, one Su-30MKI, one Mirage 2000 and one MiG-29 were downed within a 40-minute span. Not one Pakistani jet crossed the border or engaged in close combat.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909476/at-least-29-drones-neutralised-by-pakistan-so-far-dg-ispr">intercepting drones</a> sent by India on May 8 and tit-for-tat strikes on each other‚Äôs airbases on the night of May 9-10, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910113/world-community-hails-ceasefire-decision-between-pakistan-and-india">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>The US-brokered ceasefire had brought a halt to a week of record escalation between Pakistan and India as the latter took a series of unprovoked military actions despite Islamabad‚Äôs call for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a> into India‚Äôs allegations over the Pahalgam attack.</p>
