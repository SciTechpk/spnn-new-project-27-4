            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927992/trump-slaps-19pc-tariff-on-pakistani-goods-targets-dozens-of-countries-with-steep-duties' target='_blank'><strong>Trump slaps 19pc tariff on Pakistani goods, targets dozens of countries with steep duties</strong></a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump introduced tariffs on exports from dozens of trading partners, including a 19 per cent tariff on Pakistani goods — revised from the previous 29pc — a day after the two countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927783">finalised</a> a trade agreement.</p>
<p>Late on Wednesday night, a Pakistani <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925309/pakistan-us-near-breakthrough-as-trade-talks-enter-final-stage">delegation</a> led by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in Washington, DC, finalised a trade agreement with the US, expected to lower tariffs, although no figure was announced. Trump also said Washington would help Islamabad develop “massive oil deposits”.</p>
<p>According to an <a class="link--external" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/further-modifying-the-reciprocal-tariff-rates/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> detailing the tariffs, it was announced that Pakistan is set to face a 19pc tariff rate as Trump’s tariff deadline comes to an end on August 1 (today).</p>
<p>Trump set rates including a 35pc duty on many goods from Canada, 50pc for Brazil, 25pc for India, 20pc for Taiwan and 39pc for Switzerland, according to a presidential executive order.</p>
<p>The order listed higher import duty rates of 10 to 41pc starting in seven days for 69 trading partners as the 12:01am EDT (9:01am PKT) deadline approached.</p>
<p>Some of them had reached tariff-reducing deals; others had no opportunity to negotiate with his administration. Trump included an exception for some goods shipped within the coming week.</p>
<p>Goods from all other countries not listed would be subject to a 10pc US import tax. Trump had previously said that rate might be higher.</p>
<p>The administration also teased that more trade deals were in the pipeline as it seeks to close trade deficits and boost domestic factories.</p>
<p>Facing a Friday deadline of his making, the Republican president has tapped emergency powers, pressured foreign leaders, and pressed ahead with trade policies that sparked a market sell-off when they were first announced in April.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>This time, markets had a more muted reaction. Stocks and equity futures fell modestly in Friday morning trading in Asia.</p>
<p>Trump’s order said that some trading partners, “despite having engaged in negotiations, have offered terms that, in my judgment, do not sufficiently address imbalances in our trading relationship or have failed to align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national-security matters.”</p>
<p>Other details are still to come, including on the “rules of origin” that will determine what products might face even higher tariffs.</p>
<p>Trump also said “we have made a few deals today that are excellent deals for the country,” and a US official later told reporters that they were still to be announced.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#canada-mexico" id="canada-mexico" title="Permalink"></a>Canada, Mexico</h2>
<p>Trump issued a separate order for Canada that raises the rate on Canadian goods subject to fentanyl-related tariffs to 35pc, from 25pc previously, saying Canada had “failed to cooperate” in curbing illicit narcotics flows into the US.</p>
<p>The higher tariffs on Canadian goods contrasted sharply with Trump’s decision to grant Mexico a 90-day reprieve from higher tariffs of 30pc on many goods to provide more time to negotiate a broader trade pact.</p>
<p>Trump complained to reporters earlier that Canada had “been very poorly led.” Canada’s government did not immediately comment but it has previously disputed there being any basis for the tariffs.</p>
<p>The extension for Mexico avoids a 30pc tariff on most Mexican non-automotive and non-metal goods compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade and came after a Thursday morning call between Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.</p>
<p>“We avoided the tariff increase announced for tomorrow,” Sheinbaum <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/Claudiashein/status/1950938276967403563" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X, adding that the Trump call was “very good.” About 85pc of US imports from Mexico comply with the rules of origin outlined in the USMCA, shielding them from 25pc tariffs related to fentanyl, according to Mexico’s economy ministry.</p>

<p>Trump said the US would continue to levy a 50pc tariff on Mexican steel, aluminum and copper and a 25pc tariff on Mexican autos and on non-USMCA-compliant goods subject to tariffs related to the US fentanyl crisis.</p>
<p>“Additionally, Mexico has agreed to immediately terminate its Non Tariff Trade Barriers, of which there were many,” Trump said in a Truth Social post, without providing details.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#india-discord" id="india-discord" title="Permalink"></a>India discord</h2>
<p>Goods from India appeared to be headed for a 25pc tariff after talks <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927819">bogged down</a> over access to India’s agriculture sector, drawing a higher-rate threat from Trump that also included an unspecified penalty for India’s purchases of Russian oil.</p>
<p>Although negotiations with India were continuing, New Delhi vowed to protect the country’s labor-intensive farm sector, and the threat of higher rates from Trump triggered outrage from the opposition party and a slump in the rupee.</p>
<p>Trump’s rollout of higher import taxes on Friday comes amid more evidence they have begun driving up consumer goods prices.</p>
<p>Commerce Department data released Thursday showed prices for home furnishings and durable household equipment jumped 1.3pc in June, the biggest gain since March 2022. Recreational goods and vehicles prices shot up 0.9pc, the most since February 2024. Prices for clothing and footwear rose 0.4pc.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#tough-questions-from-judges" id="tough-questions-from-judges" title="Permalink"></a>Tough questions from judges</h2>
<p>Trump hit Brazil’s exports on Wednesday with a steep 50pc tariff as he escalated his fight with Latin America’s largest economy over its prosecution of his friend and former President Jair Bolsonaro, but softened the blow by excluding sectors such as aircraft, energy and orange juice from heavier levies.</p>
<p>The run-up to Trump’s tariff deadline was unfolding as federal appeals court judges sharply questioned Trump’s use of a sweeping emergency powers law to justify his sweeping tariffs of up to 50pc on nearly all trading partners.</p>
<p>Trump invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare an emergency over the growing US trade deficit and impose his “reciprocal” tariffs and a separate fentanyl emergency.</p>
<p>The Court of International Trade ruled in May that the actions exceeded his executive authority, and questions from judges during oral arguments before the US Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit in Washington indicated further skepticism.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, China is facing an August 12 deadline to reach a durable tariff agreement with Trump’s administration, after Beijing and Washington reached preliminary deals in May and June to end escalating tit-for-tat tariffs and a cut-off of rare earth minerals.</p>
<p>A US official told reporters that they are making progress toward a deal.</p></p>

            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) held its multi-party conference on Thursday, appealing for a new social contract to restore the Constitution and democracy, claiming that government officials had blocked access to the original venue, forcing them to relocate.</p>
<p>The alliance was forced to move its conference to a private farmhouse after authorities placed barriers at its intended venue, Tulip Banquet Hall, organisers said</p>
<p>TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said that when he and other leaders, including Mehmood Khan Achakzai, arrived at the Tulip Banquet Hall, the venue management was absent.</p>
<p>“Barriers were placed there and it was made impossible to go there,” Mr Khokhar said. “We held a press conference there and then we decided to move the venue to my farmhouse located in Tarlai.”</p>

<p>Urges ‘democratic’ forces to unite and draft a new charter to restore democracy</p>

<p>The conference, attended by opposition parties, lawyers, and media figures, criticised what speakers called the “undemocratic behaviour” of the government.</p>
<p>Speaking to the participants, Mr Achakzai said the group gathered for the supremacy of the constitution, freedom of the judiciary and media, and restoration of the ‘stolen’ public mandate from Feb 8 elections.</p>
<p>“As everyone knows, on the night of February 8, a brazen robbery of the public mandate took place through money and coercion,” Mr Achakzai said. “Whoever paid the highest price was awarded victory with a check mark. What followed was the auction of the entire state apparatus — consciences, government jobs, and public resources were all put up for sale.”</p>
<p>Mr Achakzai argued that “powerful undemocratic forces have treated the Constitution as nothing more than a piece of paper”.</p>

<p>He claimed that after the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party was stripped of its electoral symbol, voters still overwhelmingly chose its candidates, only to have their mandate “snatched at gunpoint” by the night of Feb 9.</p>
<p>He asserted the country was engulfed in corruption, with 45 per cent of the population living below the poverty line, and questioned military actions in certain regions.</p>
<p>“Areas in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other Pashtun and Baloch regions are routinely subjected to bombardment and shelling,” he said. “What was the fault of the unarmed people of Tirah and the innocent children of Bajaur who were riddled with bullets?”</p>
<p>Mr Achakzai appealed to all “democratic” forces to unite and formulate a new consensus charter and social contract.</p>
<p>In a warning to the international community, he said any agreements made by the current government regarding national resources have no legal legitimacy because the government does not represent the people.</p>
<p>A formal resolution from the conference is expected to be released Friday.</p>

            <p><p>GILGIT: More cloudburst-induced floods hit Ghizer and Hunza districts on Tuesday, causing widespread destruction.</p>
<p>According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA), the heavy rainfall led to flooding in Khatam village in Ghizer’s Gupis Valley, blocking the Ghizer-Shandur Road and damaging agricultural land and private properties.</p>
<p>The floodwaters also caused significant damage to the irrigation channel in Ghalapan village in Gojal, upper Hunza, which provides water for over 50,000 forest trees, according to residents.</p>
<p>The Gilgit-Baltistan government has declared 37 villages across the region as calamity-hit areas. According to a notification issued by the GB Home and Prisons Department, the affected areas include 12 villages in Diamer, nine in Gilgit, five in Ghizer, four each in Skardu and Shigar, two in Ghanche, and one each in Nagar and Kharmang.</p>

<p>GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said in a statement that the recent floods across Gilgit-Baltistan have caused an estimated Rs20 billion in damages. The floods have destroyed infrastructure, homes, agricultural land and public utilities.</p>
<p>Mr Faraq added that 22 vehicles were swept away by the floods, while 10 people, mostly tourists, have lost their lives. Four individuals have sustained injuries and between 10 and 15 tourists are still missing. Search operations are currently underway.</p>
<p>Over 500 homes and agricultural land, crops, roads, bridges and both public and private infrastructure have been significantly damaged.</p>
<p>The Gilgit-Baltistan government has initiated emergency and rehabilitation operations across the affected areas.</p>
