            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910733/11-soldiers-martyred-78-wounded-while-defending-pakistan-in-indian-attack-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>11 soldiers martyred, 78 wounded while defending Pakistan in Indian attack: ISPR</strong></a>
            <p><p>At least 11 soldiers were martyred and 78 wounded while defending Pakistan against India’s “unprovoked and reprehensible dastardly attacks” during the recent escalation between the neighbours, said the military’s media wing in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan under the banner of Operation Sindoor, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>On Saturday, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">announced</a> that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), 40 civilians — including seven women and 15 children — were killed in Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.</p>
<p>The martyrs from the Pakistan Army include Naik Abdul Rehman, Lance Naik Dilawar Khan, Lance Naik Ikramullah, Naik Waqar Khalid, Sepoy Muhammad Adeel Akbar and Sepoy Nisar, as per the statement.</p>
<p>The martyrs from the Pakistan Air Force include Squadron Leader Usman Yousuf, Chief Technician Aurangzeb, Senior Technician Najeeb, Corporal Technician Farooq, and Senior Technician Mubashir.</p>
<p>“Pakistan Armed Forces mounted a resolute response under the banner of Marka-i-Haq, delivering precise and notch-up retributive strikes through Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”, stated the ISPR in its statement.</p>
<p>“Their noble sacrifice of martyrs is an enduring symbol of courage, devotion, and unwavering patriotism — etched forever in the nation’s memory,” the statement said. “Let there be no ambiguity: any attempt to challenge Pakistan’s sovereignty or territorial integrity, ever again, shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response.”</p>
<p>Paying tribute to the martyred civilians and military personnel, the ISPR offered heartfelt prayers for the recovery of the injured.</p>
<p>“Let there be no ambiguity: any attempt to challenge Pakistan’s sovereignty or territorial integrity, ever again, shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response,” the statement read while reaffirming that the nation “remains resolute in the face of aggression.”</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz Sharif has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910450/nation-celebrates-befitting-response-to-aggression">announced</a> that Youm-e-Marka-i-Haq will be observed every year on May 10 on the “magnificent success” of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. Friday, May 16, 2025, will be observed as a day to pay tribute to the armed forces for achieving magnificent success on the defence front and to bow before God in gratitude, he added.</p></p>

            <p><p>Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Tuesday announced that the remaining eight matches of the HBL Pakistan Super League (PSL) — postponed due to the conflict with India — would resume from May 17, with the final scheduled for May 25.</p>
<p>The PSL was first <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909572">moved</a> to the UAE and subsequently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909898">postponed</a> after an Indian drone crashed close to the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium last week.</p>
<p>In a post on X today, Naqvi stated that the league will pick up from where it left. “Let the aura take over as we unite and celebrate the spirit of cricket,” he wrote.</p>

<p>Earlier, it was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910621/psl-resumption-hinges-on-foreign-players-return">reported</a> that the six PSL franchises have reached out to players, who were flown from the country on a charter flight over the weekend as the cross-border skirmishes with India intensified last week, to return after a ceasefire agreement was reached.</p>
<p>“The franchises are in negotiations with their foreign players regarding the tentative dates of May 17 to 25 with Raw­a­lpindi proposed to be the ve­nue for the remaining matc­hes,” sour­ces told <em>Dawn</em> on Monday.</p>
<p>“As soon as the franchises confirm the availability of the foreign players, the PCB will announce the schedule of the remaining matches after getting the approval from chairman Mohsin Naqvi,” sources added.</p>
<p>With no international cricket during the proposed window, the PCB remains hopeful that the foreign players will return.</p>
<p>However, reports suggested that Australian players might not be open to the idea of returning to Pakistan or India, which also saw its T20 tournament — the Indian Premier League — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909693/ipl-cricket-tournament-suspended-over-india-pakistan-tensions-indian-media">suspended</a> due to the escalating hostilities.</p>
<p>While most Australian players in both countries left for home, former Australia batter Ricky Ponting — now coach of IPL side Punjab Kings — deboarded his flight home following the ceasefire agreement.</p></p>

            <p><p>An assailant opened fire at a school van injuring six people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Battagram district, police said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Battagram police spokesperson Gul Nabi told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the school van was coming from the Pirwahari area when it was attacked. “Five students and the van driver were injured in the incident,” he added.</p>
<p>The injured were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital Battagram, he continued, adding that one person, who was in critical condition, was referred to the Ayub Medical Complex Abbottabad.</p>
<p>“A first information report [FIR] was lodged and efforts to arrest the suspect were underway,” Nabi added.</p>
<p>According to Kuzabanda Station House Officer (SHO) Amjid Khan, the suspect’s motive behind the incident was “personal vendetta” against the van driver. “The shooter opened fire, recklessly endangering the lives of the children onboard,” he said.</p>
<p>The president of the Private Education Network (PEN) Battagram chapter, Syed Raqib Shah, condemned the incident and characterised it as an “act of terrorism”.</p>
<p>Shah urged the Battagram district police officer (DPO) to register a case under the Anti-Terrorism Act and apprehend the assailant, warning that failure to do so would prompt a strong reaction from the community.</p>
<p>Last month, a senior civil judge and a lawyer were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904431/senior-civil-judge-lawyer-killed-over-personal-enmity-in-kps-nowshera-district-police">killed</a> by unknown motorcyclists in Nowshera district. According to Nowshera DPO Abdur Rasheed, the incident was said to be one of personal enmity.</p></p>
