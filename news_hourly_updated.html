                <h2>PSX opens up over 9pc as ceasefire with India holds</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange opened up over nine per cent on Monday after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> over the weekend with India, returning calm to the markets.</p>
<p>Saturday‚Äôs ceasefire, announced by US President Donald Trump, followed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">four days</a> of tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">strikes</a> between the nuclear-armed neighbours, as well as diplomacy and pressure from Washington.</p>
<p>The KSE-100 index opened with a gain of 9,929.48 points, or 9.26pc, to stand at 117,104.11 points from the previous close of 107,174.63 at 9:30am.</p>
<p>Due to the massive gains, the PSX was suspended briefly soon after opening to control excessive volatility.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe market has reacted jubilantly to the ceasefire announcement after Pakistan established effective deterrence against India,‚Äù noted Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe PSX has saluted the Pakistan Air Force this morning with a surge of over 9pc in the KSE-100 Index,‚Äù he remarked, in reference to the PAF‚Äôs actions in response to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186">India‚Äôs strikes</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Farooq highlighted, the recent <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interest rate cut</a> and the approval of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">$1 billion tranche</a> by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) ‚Äúfurther fueled investor enthusiasm‚Äù.</p>
<p>Commenting on the future investor mood, Farooq said market participants were now expected to shift their focus towards the upcoming federal budget for the next fiscal year, which is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909569">expected on June 2</a>.</p>
<p>Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, pointed out three main reasons for the robust market activity.</p>
<p>Other than the ceasefire and the IMF‚Äôs green light to the disbursement, Tariq mentioned US President Donald Trump‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910382/kashmir-takes-centre-stage-as-fragile-ceasefire-holds">recent statement</a> on increasing trade with Pakistan.</p>

            <p><p>‚Ä¢ ISPR DG says 26 Indian sites struck, response textbook demonstration of integrated tri-services<br />
‚Ä¢ Indian military dodges question about loss of fighter jets</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan‚Äôs armed forces on Sunday said they struck 26 Indian targets in ‚Äò<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a>‚Äô to re-establish deterrence after India violated Pakistan‚Äôs airspace earlier this week and separately targeted air bases in early-morning strikes.</p>
<p>In a press conference alongside Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Director General Public Relations Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed and Naval Staff (Operations) Deputy Chief Vice Admiral Raja Rab Nawaz, Pakistan Army‚Äôs chief spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared details about the operation.</p>
<p>He said the dastardly attacks began on the night of May 6 and 7, resulting in the loss of innocent civilian lives, including women, children and the elderly. He said one Pakistani aircraft was slightly damaged during the Indian missile attack.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTwenty-six military targets, along with facilities in India used to target Pakistani citizens and entities involved in fomenting terrorism in Pakistan, were engaged in both Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and mainland India,‚Äù he said in the presser.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>Gen Chaudhry said Pakistan‚Äôs response was a ‚Äútextbook demonstration‚Äù of integrated tri-services, enabled by real-time situational awareness, network-centric warfare capabilities and seamless multidomain operations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe targets included air force and aviation bases at Suratgarh, Sirsa, Adampur, Bhooj, Nalia, Bathinda, Barnala, Halwara, Avantipura, Srinagar, Jammu, Mamoon, Ambala, Udampur and Pathankot ‚Äî all of which sustained major damages,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>The DG said Brahmos facilities, which had fired missiles in Pakistan and killed innocent civilians, were also destroyed.</p>

<p>India launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">series of strikes</a> under ‚ÄòOperation Sindoor‚Äô soon after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam tragedy</a> in the early hours of May 7 across Pakistan, in which 31 people were martyred. Pakistan‚Äôs military responded swiftly, downing five Indian jets, destroying Indian brigade headquarters, and check posts in the occupied Kashmir along the Line of Control.</p>
<p>The ISPR chief paid tribute to those who were martyred in the Indian aggression and their families, while praying for the speedy recovery of the wounded.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe extend our heartfelt gratitude to every officer, soldier, airman and sailor of the Armed Forces of Pakistan who made this success on the battlefield possible through their courage, professionalism and sacrifice.‚Äù</p>
<p>The military spokesperson particularly thanked the youth of Pakistan ‚Äî ‚Äúwho became the frontline soldiers as information and cyber warriors of the country‚Äù ‚Äî and the media that stood as a ‚Äústeel wall‚Äù against the Indian media. He also appreciated politicians for their support to the army during these times and lauded the premier for taking ‚Äúdestiny-changing decisions‚Äù during this testing time</p>
<p><strong>War not an option</strong></p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to a question about who first requested for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>, the DG ISPR said: ‚ÄúPut it on record that Pakistan never requested for a ceasefire.‚Äù</p>
<p>He warned that there was no space for a war between two nuclear-armed nations. ‚Äúif anyone wants to carve out this space for war, he is actually carving out the space for mutual annihilation,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>He said: ‚ÄúThis is why you saw how in this conflict Pakistan acted in a very mature manner and through conventional forces, we maintained escalation control, through conventional forces we gave them a two notch up response while also ensuring that the Pakistan forces employed on the counterterrorism operations ‚Ä¶ no pull is also exerted on them.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>IAF airfields hit</strong></p>
<p>Air Vice Marshal Ahmed, while describing Pakistan‚Äôs response to the Indian Air Force, said the PAF‚Äôs response was based ‚Äúon the time and place of own choosing‚Äù, displaying ‚Äúbold, aggressive and unwavering resolve of the brave military leadership‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúI must appreciate the leadership ‚Ä¶ they were resolute and clear in giving instructions to all of us and that is perhaps the reason why we were so sure about what we had to do,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith unprecedented reach, precision and lethality, while avoiding collateral, the PAF hit maximum number of IAF airfields in a single operational package since 1971 because they crossed the international border,‚Äù the officer said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile reestablishing deterrence, Pakistan negated the setting of a new normal under the hegemonistic design of a supremacist regime through swift and effective response.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>Sea frontiers</strong></p>
<p>Vice Admiral Rab Nawaz said the Pakistan Navy was able to defend the country‚Äôs sea frontiers from a ‚Äúnumerically superior enemy‚Äù.</p>
<p>He gave details of the navy‚Äôs readiness to thwart any attack from the sea. He said there was a hype that INS Vikrant (Indian fleet) was approaching Karachi. ‚ÄúWe were keeping a very close eye on the activities at sea [‚Ä¶] we were monitoring it from day one,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúOn the night of May 6 and 7, it was close to Bombay and on May 9, it was essentially 400 nautical miles from the Pakistani coast and it retreated close to Bombay,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf a carrier gets within 400 nautical miles, it simplifies our problem. The navy maritime air arm was proper ready to generate a response at all times. If there was any aggression from the sea we were ready to respond effectively,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p><strong>Indian military dodges question</strong></p>
<p>Indian military officers, meanwhile, said that the objectives of ‚ÄòOperation Sindoor‚Äô were achieved, with ‚Äòhigh-value terrorists‚Äô being eliminated, but dodged a question whether they had lost a bunch of warplanes in the operation.</p>
<p>The officers, speaking at a press conference, provided key details on Operation Sindoor, its impact and results, saying that the ‚Äúobjective has been achieved‚Äù.</p>
<p>Air Marshal AK Bharti, DGMO Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai, Maj Gen SS Sharma and Vice Admiral AN Pramod addressed the press. Responding to reports that Rafale fighter jets were downed, Air Marshal AK Bharti did not confirm or deny the claims, stating instead that ‚Äúlosses are a part of any combat scenario‚Äù.</p>
<p>The Indian military said, ‚ÄúWe are in a combat scenario and losses are a part of it. Question is that ‚Äòhave we achieved our objective‚Äô? Answer is a thumping yes. As for details, at this time I would not like to comment on that, as we are still in combat, and give advantage to (our) adversary. All our pilots are back home.‚Äù</p>
