            <p><p>Six Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel were injured in a ‚Äúterrorist attack‚Äù at a checkpoint in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Bannu district on Wednesday, a police spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Bannu Police spokesperson Aamir Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>: ‚ÄúTerrorists attacked a Frontier Constabulary checkpoint situated in the border area of Takhti Khel Wazir in Bannu.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs a result of the attack, six personnel of the FC were injured, but the immediate response of the constabulary forced the terrorists to flee.‚Äù</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Aamir added that the injured constables have been taken to the Combined Military Hospital in Bannu for treatment.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPolice teams have been sent to the area and have begun a search operation to track down the terrorists,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">surge</a> in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies‚Äô personnel, and security forces.</p>
<p>Attacks increased after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">broke</a> a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP ‚Äî including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur ‚Äî have seen a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a>, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773/3-terrorists-killed-during-joint-operation-in-kps-bannu-police">this month</a>.</p>
<p>A day ago, a police official identified as Constable Hayatullah was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925895/police-constable-martyred-in-bannu-terrorist-attack">martyred</a> when terrorists attacked him in the district while he was returning home from duty.</p>
<p>On July 21, over a dozen terrorists <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1925535">attacked</a> a police station in the Bakkakhel town of Bannu. However, the cops responded effectively and thwarted their nefarious plan to take over the building. The police also thwarted a sabotage bid by defusing explosives in the Ghoriwala town of Bannu. An official said the explosives were seized during an intelligence-based operation in the area.</p>
<p>On July 19, two police officials, including an officer, were injured when terrorists carried out a quadcopter <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925051">attack</a> on Bannu‚Äôs Miryan police station.</p></p>

                <h2>19-year-old girl dies in coma after alleged marital rape by husband: Karachi police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A 19-year-old girl in Karachi‚Äôs Lyari succumbed to her injuries after an alleged marital rape at the hands of her husband, police said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the newlywed girl was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922609/newlywed-19-year-old-girl-in-coma-after-alleged-brutal-sexual-violence-by-husband">admitted</a> to Civil Hospital Karachi in critical condition after allegedly enduring ‚Äúbrutal sexual violence‚Äù from her husband, who was arrested by the police.</p>
<p>The victim was in a coma and her physical examination findings were ‚Äúconsistent with sexual violence‚Äù, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed had stated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMs Shanti, 19, rape victim, passed away at the trauma centre of the Civil Hospital Karachi at 10:45am today,‚Äù Syed said today.</p>
<p>She was admitted to the trauma centre in a ‚Äúcritical condition‚Äù, having undergone a surgical procedure at another hospital, she added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHer initial findings were positive for sexual violence,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>The police surgeon told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the hospital informed police and family to conduct a post-mortem examination of the body and was waiting for their response.</p>
<p>Baghdadi police Station House Officer Majid Alvi also confirmed her death to <em>Dawn.com.</em></p>
<p>He said that the girl got married on June 15. ‚ÄúTwo days later, the husband subjected her to sodomy and installed a metal pipe into her body, leading to deterioration of her health condition.‚Äù</p>
<p>The brother of the victim had registered a first information report (FIR) at the Baghdadi Police Station on July 5 under Sections 324 (attempt to commit murder) and 376-B (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn the third day of her marriage, my sister was subjected to brutal sexual violence allegedly by her husband. She remained admitted at a private hospital in the city and was later taken to Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre of Civil Hospital Karachi in a critical condition the other day,‚Äù the FIR read.</p>
<p>In the FIR, the complainant said his 19-year-old sister married the suspect on June 15. Her health condition deteriorated on June 30, compelling the family to bring her back home. She informed the parents that on July 17, her husband subjected her to an ‚Äúunnatural sexual act‚Äù.</p>
<p>He said that the husband also sexually assaulted her with a foreign object. Subsequently, the husband subjected her to sexual violence, leading to bleeding. As per the FIR, the suspect threatened his wife with ‚Äúdire consequences‚Äù if she disclosed anything to anyone.</p>

<p>Despite the presence of anti-rape laws ‚Äî with punishment for rape either resulting in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1761373">death penalty</a> or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years ‚Äî cases continue to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899694/two-arrested-for-kidnap-gang-rape-of-minor-girl-in-bahawalnagar">prevail</a> in the country.</p>
<p>In May, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913717/two-sisters-raped-tortured-in-north-karachi-home">two sisters</a> were subjected to a sexual assault in their home in North Karachi, police and doctors had said.</p>
<p>In April, in a rare verdict, an additional district and sessions judge in Gujranwala handed down <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903932">10-year rigorous imprisonment</a> to a man for subjecting his wife to an unnatural sexual offence.</p></p>
