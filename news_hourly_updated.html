                <h2>11 more suspects arrested in Balochistan couple‚Äôs killing, case transferred to SCIW: police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least 11 more suspects, including a tribal leader, were arrested on Monday for their alleged involvement in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925555">killing of a man and a woman</a> in Balochistan after a video of the murder went viral on social media, with the case now handed over to the Serious Crimes Investigation Wing (SCIW), according to the police.</p>
<p>SCIW Superintendent of Police (SP) Syed Saboor Agha told <em>Dawn.com</em>, ‚ÄúEleven people have been arrested, including a tribal leader who issued directives to shoot the couple, and all of them will appear before a judicial magistrate today.‚Äù</p>
<p>The viral video showed a group of men leading a couple out of vehicles and into a desert before gunning them down with pistols and shooting the bodies. Political figures and activists said it was an ‚Äòhonour‚Äô killing incident. On Sunday, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PakSarfrazbugti/status/1946928844923195709" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced on X</a> that he had directed the Balochistan Police to take immediate action, following which one suspect was apprehended.</p>
<p>According to a first information report (FIR) ‚Äî a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em> ‚Äî registered by Station House Officer (SHO) Naveed Akhtar at Quetta‚Äôs Hanna-Urak Police Station, he lodged the complaint after receiving the video clip that had gone viral on social media, showing a man and a woman being brutally shot and killed by armed individuals.</p>
<p>SHO Akhtar stated that he, along with his team, reached Balochistan‚Äôs Dagari, situated on the outskirts of Quetta and, upon investigation, discovered that the incident occurred three days before Eidul Azha in the area of Sanjidi in Dagari.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe victims seen in the viral video have been identified as Bano Bibi and Ihsanullah,‚Äù the FIR said, naming eight suspects who allegedly shot the couple dead. The FIR also mentioned 15 other unknown suspects involved in the incident.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, SHO Naveed Akhtar said, ‚ÄúOwing to the nature of the murder, the case has now been transferred to the Serious Crime Investigation Wing for further investigation.‚Äù</p>
<p>Prior to being killed, the victims were allegedly taken to a tribal leader, who declared them guilty of being involved in an ‚Äòimmoral relationship‚Äô (locally termed ‚ÄòKaro Kari‚Äô) and ordered their execution, following which they were taken to the [desert] and shot dead, the FIR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe murder was filmed and uploaded to social media to spread fear and panic among the public,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>According to the FIR, a case was registered against the suspects under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting while armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly) and 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.</p>
<p>One of the main suspects ‚Äî tribal leader Sardar Sherbaz Satakzai ‚Äî was presented before an anti-terrorism court today with Judge Muhammad Mubeen presiding over the case. The suspect was handed over to SCIW on a two-day physical remand on the judge‚Äôs order upon the police‚Äôs request.</p>
<p>Chief Justice Balochistan High Court Justice Rozi Khan Barrech took notice of the case and summoned the additional chief secretary and inspector general of police Balochistan to the court in the matter.</p>
<p>In a press release issued by BHC ‚Äî seen by <em>Dawn.com</em> ‚Äî it was notified that Justice Barrech ‚Äúhas taken notice of the news circulating on electronic, print and social media of the murder of a couple for marrying out of choice at Dagari‚Äù. The statement added that, ‚ÄúIn this matter, the chief justice has summoned the chief secretary and IG Balochistan to court on July 22, 2025‚Äù.</p>
<p>The incident was widely condemned by politicians, civil society activists, and the public, who termed it ‚Äúbarbaric‚Äù and urged the government to take swift action against the perpetrators.</p>
<p>Separately, PPP MNA Shazia Marria moved an adjournment motion in the National Assembly to instead discuss the incident since it was a ‚Äúmatter of urgent national and human importance‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis tragic and barbaric act has shaken the conscience of the nation. Such heinous crimes constitute a grave violation of the teachings of Islam, and are in blatant disregard of the Constitution ‚Ä¶ which guarantees all citizens the right to life, dignity, due process, and equal protection under the law. Furthermore, such acts are deeply offensive to the cultural and moral values of our society, which emphasise compassion, justice and the sanctity of human life.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis House must condemn this crime in the strongest possible terms. I urge the federal government to immediately engage with the provincial government of Balochistan, obtain a comprehensive and transparent report, and ensure that those responsible are identified, arrested, and prosecuted without delay.‚Äù</p>
<p>Marri also said it was ‚Äúimperative‚Äù that the state be made the complainant in the FIR and subsequent legal proceedings to safeguard the integrity of the investigation, reinforce public confidence in the justice system and avoid any compromise or pressure on the victims‚Äô families.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849480">‚Äòhonour‚Äô killings</a> continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881836">Data</a> from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‚Äòhonour‚Äô killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‚Äòhonour‚Äô crimes in the country.</p>
<p>The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‚Äòhonour‚Äô.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#cm-vows-justice-to-be-ensured" id="cm-vows-justice-to-be-ensured" title="Permalink"></a>CM vows justice to be ensured</h2>
<p>Addressing a press conference to discuss the details of the case, CM Bugti said he stood with the victims and vowed that justice would be served regardless of tribal affiliation.</p>
<p>He said he immediately ordered the arrest of suspects within 24 hours of the video going viral, adding 12 people had been detained so far, including a tribal chief.</p>
<p>Bugti clarified misinformation circulating on social and mainstream media, rejecting claims that the victims were a newly married couple. ‚ÄúThe woman and man weren‚Äôt married. The woman had five children, and the man, aged around 45 to 50, also had four or five children,‚Äù he said, adding that these details did not justify the killing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is a murder, a crime, no matter what anyone has done. No one has the right to kill a person this ruthlessly and make videos,‚Äù he said.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He added that the Special Branch deputy superintendent of police (DSP) posted in Dagari were suspended for failing to report the incident to the government.</p>
<p>The chief minister also pointed out the spread of misinformation through social media and the lack of investigative journalism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPeople sitting in Karachi and Lahore don‚Äôt know what Dagari is. But still, did anyone do any investigation? No. It was the murderer himself who released the video.‚Äù</p>
<p>Bugti said that he had received a call from PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and that operations were underway upon his instructions. He said the government would follow constitutional channels, not tribal jirgas, to resolve the case.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#condemnations" id="condemnations" title="Permalink"></a>Condemnations</h2>
<p>Bilawal called the suspects ‚Äúbeasts‚Äù, saying that they deserved no concessions. ‚ÄúI have faith that the criminals involved in this murder will be brought to justice soon,‚Äù he said, according to the state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/domestic/bilawal-condemns-murder-of-couple-in-balochistan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)</a>.</em>  ‚ÄúThis murder should be a test case for the Balochistan government, as it is gender terrorism.‚Äù</p>
<p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif shared the video in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KhawajaMAsif/status/1946923637686284672" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, with a message for the people of Balochistan. Referring to the growing militancy in the province, he said: ‚ÄúThose who have taken up arms against the state ‚Äî start by raising your voice against the unjust system that surrounds you.‚Äù</p>
<p>He continued that the ones responsible for this ‚Äúoppression are your own brothers, not the travellers and labourers from other provinces‚Äù, pointing out the recent bus attack in Balochistan‚Äôs Kalat district, which left three people dead and other similar incidents in the recent past.</p>
<p>PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman also <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/sherryrehman/status/1946955545946337781" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">condemned</a> the murder in a post on X, labelling it an ‚Äúunforgivable crime‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCrushing the right to marry is a violation of fundamental human rights. Killing in the name of tribal decisions is a despicable act. The cycle of brutality in the name of honour must be stopped,‚Äù she wrote.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBy mercilessly killing the married couple, not only have law and justice been insulted, but the authority of the provincial government has also been challenged,‚Äù Rehman added. ‚ÄúThe chapter of oppression and barbarism under the guise of jirgas must be closed.‚Äù</p>
<p>The senator emphasised that the perpetrators must be brought to justice and that legislation to end ‚Äúoutdated customs‚Äù was indispensable.</p>
<p>Baloch activist Sammi Deen Baloch decried the shooting as an ‚Äòhonour‚Äô killing, appealing to Baloch elders to ‚Äúrespect women‚Äôs decisions‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs a woman, this chilling incident is deeply painful and heart-wrenching for me,‚Äù she wrote on X. ‚ÄúKilling any woman in the name of honour is not only a heinous crime but also the worst humiliation of humanity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI appeal to Baloch and Pashtun tribal elders, influential sections of society, and intellectuals to respect women‚Äôs decisions. Today‚Äôs woman is the same woman who is educated, aware, and fully capable of making decisions about her future.‚Äù</p>
<p>She demanded that the killing be investigated transparently and comprehensively so that the suspects would be brought to justice and ‚Äúno one dares to repeat such a barbaric act in the future‚Äù.</p>

                <h2>Aafia Siddiqui case: IHC issues contempt notice to PM Shehbaz, other federal cabinet members</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday issued contempt notices to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and other members of the federal cabinet for failing to submit a response in the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui.</p>
<p>Dr Aafia Siddiqui, a neuroscientist and educator, was convicted by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on charges of attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan and has been serving her <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924527">sentence</a> at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Carswell in the US since 2010.</p>
<p>On July 12, the IHC expr¬≠essed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923643">dissatisfaction</a> over the federal government‚Äôs failure to submit a report in the case concerning Aafia‚Äôs release, health and repatriation, with Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq threatening to ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923643">summon the entire cabinet</a>‚Äù if the report is not presented.</p>
<p>Justice Ishaq presided over a hearing for the case today. The judge said in his court order that he had warned the additional attorney general while passing his previous ruling that further inaction on the part of the government would lead to the issuance of a contempt notice.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924527">filed an appeal</a> before the Supreme Court against my earlier decision permitting amendments to the petition for continuation of this case,‚Äù the order read. ‚ÄúFor whatever reason, the government‚Äôs case had not been taken up by the Supreme Court.‚Äù</p>
<p>The judge said that since the government had not responded with the reasons despite being directed to do so, it was in contempt, leaving him with no option but to issue a notice of contempt to the federal government.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOffice is directed to initiate a contempt petition accordingly, in which all the members of the federal government will be respondents. The replies of all the ministers, including the prime minister, shall be filed within two weeks from today,‚Äù the order said.</p>
<p>At the outset of his order, the judge said: ‚ÄúEver since the demolition squad was catapulted into this high court after the 26th Constitutional Amendment, we have seen one heresy after another hurled at the edifice of justice, maiming it repeatedly and bringing it almost to its last breaths. This is yet another instance. The heresy I speak of now is besieging the dispensation of justice by a judge of the high court by the device of the ‚Äòweekly roster‚Äô controlled by the office of the chief justice. It is both heart-rending and amusing at the same time, a blend of paradox that this high court has become.‚Äù</p>
<p>Criticising the government‚Äôs actions during the current case, he said, ‚ÄúThe machinations of the executive appeared elsewhere, in the form of controlling the proceedings of this court through its roster.‚Äù</p>
<p>The judge noted that he was supposed to be on leave this week, but was informed that the cause list would not be issued without the leave of the chief justice, to which he submitted an application. He added that he was informed on Saturday that the chief justice did not sign it.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was informed on Saturday that the application was duly moved but the file remained on the table of the chief justice, who did not find even 30 seconds to sign it. Whether that was by design or oversight, I cannot say for sure, but given the manner in which the roster of judges has been used as a tool for the desired outcome in specific cases, and given the government‚Äôs stiff opposition to do what is right and to stand by the daughter of the nation at the critical juncture of the motion before a US court, I may be forgiven for thinking that it was the former. The correct legal position is that the office cannot use the shoulder of the chief justice in the exercise of administrative powers to obstruct judicial proceedings ordered by a judge in an ongoing case.‚Äù</p>
<p>Justice Ishaq called it ‚Äúyet another instance of the reproachable use of the administrative power to shackle the exercise of independent judicial authority‚Äù, stating that the government‚Äôs response, with reasons as to why it would not sign the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921306">amicus brief</a> in the case, would likely be delayed until his leave ended.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, the imperatives of justice shall not be defeated by such petty means. To the extent I can, I will exercise my judicial authority to the end of upholding the dignity of the high court and the justice it dispenses.‚Äù</p></p>
