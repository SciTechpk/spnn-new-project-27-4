‚Ä¢ Shares with UN chief concerns about inflammatory remarks by Delhi<br />
‚Ä¢ Pakistan returns Indian border guard</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday invited India to a comprehensive dialogue to address all contentious issues, including the Kashmir dispute and the water distribution, between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.</p>
<p>The prime minister floated this offer during his visit to the frontline area of Pasrur Cantonment in Sialkot, where he lauded the armed forces for giving an exemplary response to India under the ‚Äò<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/india-attacks-pakistans-air-bases-pakistan-retaliates#:~:text=Force.%20Pakistan%20Zindabad.%E2%80%9D-,Operations%20commence,-At%20around%203">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a>‚Äô conducted in response to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">Indian strikes</a> inside Pakistan following the Pahalgam incident. Pakistan had struck 26 Indian military facilities, including its airbases, using jets and missiles.</p>
<p>He said <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">Pakistan‚Äôs response</a> to the Indian attack on May 6-7 caused huge losses to the neighbouring country, in which the Pakistan Air Force downed multiple Indian Rafale aircraft. In reference to the Pakistani strikes on 26 military targets, the PM said Pakistan had ‚Äúavenged‚Äù the 1971 war.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúYou have taken revenge for the 1971 war‚Ä¶and now the whole nation is standing with you,‚Äù PM Shehbaz told troops during his address. He warned Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi against future aggression.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf you again attack us, you will lose everything‚Ä¶,‚Äù the PM said in a warning to his Indian counterpart. ‚ÄúWe are ready for war and dialogue. Now the choice is yours,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>With reference to PM Modi‚Äôs recent address to the nation, PM Shehbaz said: ‚ÄúDo not dictate us. Water is our red line; don‚Äôt even think about diverting our water. Yes, water and blood do not flow together. You have also hit our Neelum-Jhelum water project. If the damage was severe, we could have destroyed your major dams, including Baglihar Dam.‚Äù</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz again asked PM Modi to shun differences and sit for a dialogue. ‚ÄúLet us extinguish this fire. Let us sit together to talk on Kashmir and water,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>After the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>, India put the water treaty with Pakistan in abeyance, prompting a strong response from Pakistan. In an interview with an Indian media outlet last week, World Bank President Ajay Banga said there was no suspension clause in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is no provision in the treaty to allow for suspension the way it was drawn up. It either needs to be gone, or replaced by another one, and that requires the two countries to want to agree,‚Äù he said. He also said that the bank played no decision-making role and acted solely as a facilitator.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said the blatant aggression against innocent civilians resulting in the martyrdom of children, women and the elderly and calling them terrorists was utterly shameful and against all international laws, norms and morality.</p>
<p>According to the PM, despite Pakistan‚Äôs offer for a neutral probe, India deliberately evaded this path, as it had nothing to prove, and India launched the offensive based on a false pretext and bloated arrogance and ego, ‚Äúfor which it has got a very befitting response‚Äù.</p>

<p>During the visit, the prime minister received a comprehensive briefing on the conduct of the battle and the current operational preparedness of the troops. He met the officers and soldiers actively participating in the military operation, a statement issued by the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office said.</p>
<p>In a show of continued support for all branches of the military, the prime minister is scheduled to visit various air bases and naval bases in coming days to meet troops of the Pakistan Air Force and Pakistan Navy.</p>
<p>The PM noted that Pakistan had agreed to the ceasefire understanding in the larger interest of peace in the region. He reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs strong resolve to promote peace in South Asia, while defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs.</p>
<p><strong>Concerns shared with UN chief</strong></p>
<p>In his afternoon <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/GovtofPakistan/status/1922819218451390775" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">telephone call</a> with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, the premier expressed his deep appreciation for the UN secretary general‚Äôs leadership and diplomatic efforts to defuse the situation in South Asia.</p>
<p>He stated that the UN chief‚Äôs continued engagement and preventive diplomacy demonstrated his enduring commitment to the protection of the UN Charter‚Äôs principles and purposes, as well as to fostering peace in South Asia.</p>
<p>This was the third phone call between the two leaders in the last two weeks.</p>

<p>He also expressed concern over the continued provocative and inflammatory remarks made by the Indian leadership, which were a threat to the fragile regional peace. He emphasised that the just resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, was imperative to ensuring durable peace in South Asia.</p>
<p>The UN secretary general welcomed the ceasefire, while expressing condolences over the loss of civilian lives. He expressed his commitment to continued engagement with both sides to advance regional peace and stability.</p>
<p><strong>Speaks to UAE president</strong></p>
<p>PM Shehbaz held a telephone <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/CMShehbaz/status/1922679157261033836" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conversation</a> with Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>According to a statement, the PM conveyed profound gratitude for the UAE‚Äôs diplomatic efforts and constructive role during the recent crisis. He added that the UAE had stood by Pakistan through thick and thin.</p>

<p>No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but India blamed Pakistan. Islamabad rejects the accusations and has called for an independent probe.</p>

                <h2>IMF expects Rs20tr revenue, stricter spending</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Policy-level budget talks set to begin on Monday<br />
‚Ä¢ GDP growth projected at 3.6pc, inflation at 7.7pc<br />
‚Ä¢ Revenue collection forecast to increase by Rs1.4tr<br />
‚Ä¢ Fiscal deficit targeted at 5.1pc of GDP</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: As virtual technical-level discussions on the upcoming <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909569/budget-due-on-june-2-psdp-faces-16pc-cut">federal budget</a> begin, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Pakistan‚Äôs total revenue to grow to nearly Rs20 trillion in the next fiscal year, up from the current estimate of less than Rs17.8tr, with an emphasis on tight expenditure controls to ensure sustainable debt servicing.</p>
<p>After three days of technical discussions through video link, formal policy-level negotiations on budget finalisation are set to begin on Monday (May 19) and continue until Friday (May 23). The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691/imf-approves-disbursement-of-1bn-to-pakistan-under-7bn-deal">agreement</a> between the IMF staff mission and the authorities on next year‚Äôs budgetary measures and macroeconomic framework would lead to the announcement of the federal budget on June 2.</p>
<p>The IMF has already put on the table its projections for major economic indicators, including fiscal and monetary policies, envisaging an economic growth rate of 3.6 per cent and average inflation of 7.7pc. This means the inflation rate would be significantly higher than the current year‚Äôs average of 5.1pc. The combination of economic growth and inflation is expected to jack up revenue collection by more than Rs1.4tr from the current year‚Äôs estimated collection of about Rs12.4tr.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>However, besides the FBR‚Äôs revenue collection, a major push for expansion in revenue base is being envisaged to come from provincial governments and agriculture income tax would be a key area for additional efforts.</p>
<p>Overall revenues for the next year are targeted to cross Rs19.9tr or 15.2pc of GDP compared to Rs17.8bn of budget estimates for the current year or 15.9pc of GDP.</p>
<p>The Fund expects Pakistani authorities to continue to focus on expenditure control, trimming it from 21.6pc of GDP in the current year to Rs20.3pc next year.</p>
<p>But even then the expenditures would get close to Rs26.57tr next year compared to budget estimates of about Rs18.9tr. The two sides have yet to work out the final numbers on revenue collection and revised expenditures, particularly those that have arisen recently due to the security situation.</p>
<p>The IMF expects Pakistan to reduce its fiscal deficit from 5.6pc of GDP during the current year to 5.1pc next year, or about Rs6.67tr. The government is also being asked to maintain a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1869024">primary surplus</a> ‚Äî revenues minus non-interest expenditures ‚Äî of around Rs2.1tr, a key condition for improving debt sustainability. Achieving this target is anticipated to bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio from the current 77.6pc to 75.6pc in FY26.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Ministry of Finance has asked all the ministries and divisions to submit an additional pro forma (Form-III-C) to capture the climate-related component of subsidies to enhance and expand reporting on climate considerations in all allocations of the annual budget.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúClimate tagging of subsidies is one of the requirements under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) agreed with IMF,‚Äù read a circular issued to all government entities and ministries.</p>
<p>The federal budget is required to map climate relevance in three categories of adaptation, mitigation, and transition.</p>
<p>The public expenditure under the running of civil government and public sector development programme is being tagged and the process is now being extended to other expenditures like grants and subsidies to identify the overall climate-related public expenditure.</p>
