                <h2>PSX jacks up record 9pc in intraday trade as ceasefire with India holds</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) gained a record nine per cent on Monday during intraday trade ‚Äî the restored calm in the markets mirroring that of a recent Pakistan-India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> that boosted investor mood.</p>
<p>Saturday‚Äôs ceasefire, announced by US President Donald Trump, followed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">four days</a> of tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">strikes</a> between the nuclear-armed neighbours, as well as diplomacy and pressure from Washington.</p>
<p>The KSE-100 index opened with a gain of 9,929.48 points, or 9.26pc, to stand at 117,104.11 points from the previous close of 107,174.63 at 9:30am.</p>
<p>Due to the massive gains, the PSX was suspended for an hour after opening to control excessive volatility.</p>
<p>Later, the benchmark index stood at 116,857.00 points, 9,682.37 points (9.03pc) higher than yesterday‚Äôs close, at 1:30pm.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe market has reacted jubilantly to the ceasefire announcement after Pakistan established effective <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910381/deterrence-re-established-say-armed-forces">deterrence against India</a>,‚Äù noted Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe PSX has saluted the Pakistan Air Force this morning with a surge of over 9pc in the KSE-100 Index,‚Äù he remarked, in reference to the PAF‚Äôs actions in response to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186">India‚Äôs strikes</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Farooq noted that the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908601/sbp-cuts-interest-rate-by-100bps-to-11pc">interest rate cut</a> and the approval of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">$1 billion tranche</a> by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) ‚Äúfurther fueled investor enthusiasm‚Äù.</p>
<p>Commenting on the future investor mood, Farooq said market participants were now expected to shift their focus towards the upcoming federal budget for the next fiscal year, which is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909569">expected on June 2</a>.</p>

<p>Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, listed three main reasons for the robust market activity.</p>
<p>Other than the ceasefire and the IMF‚Äôs green light to the disbursement, Tariq mentioned US President Donald Trump‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910382/kashmir-takes-centre-stage-as-fragile-ceasefire-holds">recent statement</a> on increasing trade with Pakistan.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">mediating</a> the halt of hostilities between the South Asian arch-rivals, Trump not only offered his help in resolving the Kashmir dispute but also announced he would ‚Äúincrease trade substantially‚Äù with both Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, pointed out the heightened possibility of further improving ties with Gulf countries due to Pakistan‚Äôs enhanced geopolitical position.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis brief conflict has also demonstrated our military and technological superiority over India, strengthening our geopolitical position. As a result, it is likely to enhance ties with Gulf countries amid regional tensions and support growth in our defence and technology exports,‚Äù Ashraf told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>While noting the investor zest in light of the Pak-India ‚Äúconflict ending with dominance‚Äù, he said the attention was now expected to shift towards improving macroeconomic indicators, including <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908067">historically low inflation</a> and a record-high current account surplus.</p>
<p>Pakistan‚Äôs consumer inflation rate plunged to an all-time low of 0.3pc year-on-year <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908067">in April</a>, while the $1.195bn current account surplus <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904945">in March</a> was the highest-ever monthly surplus.</p>
<p>Indian shares also rallied today.</p>

                <h2>US, China agree to slash tariffs in trade war de-escalation</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The United States and China announced on Monday an agreement to drastically reduce tit-for-tat tariffs for 90 days, de-escalating a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904617">trade war</a> that has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902788">roiled</a> financial markets and raised <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905525">fears</a> of a global economic downturn.</p>
<p>After their first talks since US President Donald Trump launched his trade war, the world‚Äôs two biggest economies agreed in a joint statement to bring their triple-digit tariffs down to two figures and continue negotiations.</p>
<p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the weekend talks with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and international trade representative Li Chenggang as ‚Äúproductive‚Äù and ‚Äúrobust‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBoth sides showed a great respect,‚Äù Bessent told reporters.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903391">imposed</a> duties of 145 per cent on imports for China last month ‚Äî compared to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902420">10pc</a> for other countries in the global tariff blitz he launched last month.</p>
<p>Beijing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903545">hit back</a> with duties of 125pc on US goods.</p>
<p>Bessent said the two sides agreed to reduce those tariffs by 115pc, taking US tariffs to 30pc and those by China to 10pc.</p>
<p>In their statement, the two sides agreed to ‚Äúestablish a mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations‚Äù.</p>
<p>China hailed the ‚Äúsubstantial progress‚Äù made at the talks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis move‚Ä¶ is in the interest of the two countries and the common interest of the world,‚Äù the Chinese commerce ministry said, adding that it hoped Washington would keep working with China ‚Äúto correct the wrong practice of unilateral tariff rises‚Äù.</p>

<p>The dollar, which tumbled after Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905287">launched</a> his tariff blitz in April, rallied on the news while US stock futures soared. European and Asian markets also rallied.</p>
<p>The trade dispute between Washington and Beijing has rocked financial markets, raising fears the tariffs would rekindle inflation and cause a global economic downturn.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#bodes-well-for-the-future" id="bodes-well-for-the-future" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòBodes well for the future‚Äô</h2>
<p>The head of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, praised the talks on Sunday as a ‚Äúsignificant step forward‚Äù that ‚Äúbode well for the future‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAmid current global tensions, this progress is important not only for the US and China but also for the rest of the world, including the most vulnerable economies,‚Äù she added.</p>
<p>Ahead of the meeting at the discreet villa residence of Switzerland‚Äôs ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Trump had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909866/trump-floats-cutting-china-tariffs-to-80pc">signalled</a> he might lower the tariffs, suggesting on social media that an ‚Äú80% Tariff on China seems right!‚Äù</p>
<p>However, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified that the United States would not lower tariffs unilaterally, saying China would also need to make concessions.</p>
<p>The Geneva meeting came days after Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909458">unveiled</a> a trade agreement with Britain, the first with any country since he unleashed his blitz of global tariffs.</p>
<p>The five-page, nonbinding deal confirmed to nervous investors that Washington was willing to negotiate sector-specific relief from recent duties.</p>
<p>But Trump maintained a 10pc levy on most British goods, and threatened to keep it in place as a baseline rate for most other countries.</p></p>
