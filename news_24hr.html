            <p><p>The Finance Bill, 2025, was approved by parliament on Thursday, meaning that the Rs17.57 trillion budget for the coming fiscal year has been greenlit.</p>
<p>The PPP on Wednesday voiced strong reservations over a set of politically unpopular provisions in the federal budget for the next fiscal year, urging the government to amend “contentious” clauses ahead of its expected approval in the National Assembly today (Thursday).</p>
<p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s amendments to various legislation, including the Income Tax Ordnance, 2001, were all approved, while opposition amendments were rejected, according to a <em>Dawn.com</em> correspondent.</p>
<p>The bill was read out in the assembly and approved clause by clause. The session has been adjourned until 11am tomorrow.</p>

<p>Addressing the House, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said his party would “happily support the budget,” since the government had accepted the party’s proposals.</p>
<p>“We appreciate the government’s efforts as BISP’s (Benazir Income Support Programme) budget has been increased,” he said. “Moreover, the salaried class will not be taxed if their income equals to Rs1.2m per year and the solar tax has been reduced by 50 per cent.”</p>
<p>Bilawal added that after the PPP’s initial rejection, their recommendations regarding the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) were accepted.</p>
<p>“We are grateful to the government and the prime minister for accepting our proposals,” Bilawal said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, amendments to the Sales Tax Act, 1990, presented by Aurangzeb were approved by a majority vote in the House.</p>
<p>The amendment granted the finance committee powers to arrest traders involved in tax fraud exceeding Rs50 million. The federal government had earlier proposed an amendment to give the powers of arrest to the tax commissioner.</p>
<p>“The FBR will not have the power of arrest during the investigation stage,” the amendment added.</p>
<p>All amendments introduced by the opposition in the Sales Tax Act were rejected by majority vote.</p>
<p>Similarly, an amendment to the Salaries and Allowances Act was presented with the support of the finance minister, according to which ministers and ministers of state will receive the same salary as members of parliament.</p>
<p>The amendment was approved by a majority vote.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#107-institutions-granted-tax-exempt-status" id="107-institutions-granted-tax-exempt-status" title="Permalink"></a>107 institutions granted tax-exempt status</h2>
<p>During the session, 107 entities— including lawyers’ bodies, hospitals and government projects — were granted tax-exempt status as part of amendments to the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001.</p>
<p>The finance minister’s amendments were all approved, while those presented by the opposition were rejected.</p>
<p>According to the amendments, the following institutions and organisations are exempt from tax:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provincial bar councils</li>
<li>Pakistan Bar Council</li>
<li>The Military Foundation</li>
<li>Army Welfare Trust</li>
<li>Foundation University</li>
<li>Forman Christian College</li>

<li>The Edhi Foundation</li>
<li>Al-Shifa Trust and Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital</li>
<li>The Poverty Alleviation Fund</li>
<li>National Rural Support Programme</li>
<li>National Endowment Scholarship</li>
<li>Pakistan Agricultural Research Council</li>
<li>Audit Oversight Board</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the amended ordinance, the pensions of former presidents and their widows will also be tax-exempt.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Aurangzeb unveiled Pakistan’s annual <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292">federal budget</a> in a charged National Assembly session, outlining ambitious proposals to drive 4.2 per cent economic growth in the coming fiscal year while cutting back on overall spending and tightening tax measures.</p>
<p>The federal budget for fiscal year 2026 has a total outlay — the sum of expenditures and net lending of funds — of Rs17.573 trillion, representing a 6.9 per cent decrease from the previous year’s budget.</p>
<p>The government has proposed Rs16,286bn for current expenditure in the FY26 budget, a 5.33pc decrease from the previous year.</p>

            <p><p>The United States consulates in Karachi and Lahore on Thursday requested that all applicants for F, M or J nonimmigrant visas make their social media accounts public for vetting, after similar instructions were issued by the US Embassy in Delhi earlier this week.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump’s administration on Wednesday ordered the resumption of student visa appointments but significantly tightened its social media vetting in a bid to identify any applicants who may be hostile towards the country, according to an internal State Department cable reviewed by <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>US consular officers are now required to conduct a “comprehensive and thorough vetting” of all student and exchange visitor applicants to identify those who “bear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles”, said the cable, which was dated June 18 and sent to US missions on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In Instagram posts uploaded today, the consulates said: “Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to ‘public’ to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States.”</p>

<p>They added that since 2019, the US has required visa applicants to provide social media identifiers on immigrant and nonimmigrant visa application forms. The post stated that applicants had to fill out social media identifiers and account handles for each platform on the application form.</p>
<p>“Omitting social media information on your application could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future US visas,” the consulate warned.</p>

            <p><p>Pakistan has expressed concerns over the “worst forms of torture” the people of Palestine and Indian-occupied Kashmir are being subjected to by foreign occupation powers, the Foreign Office said in a statement on Thursday.</p>
<p>There have been widespread reports of systematic <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1567979">torture</a> and human rights violations by Indian occupation forces in held Jammu and Kashmir since the region was unilaterally annexed in 2019. Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911465/pakistan-focuses-on-held-kashmirs-missing-persons">continues</a> to provide political, moral, and diplomatic support to Kashmiris until they realise their inherent right to self-determination as per the UNSC resolutions.</p>
<p>In Gaza, Israeli forces have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920058/gazas-death-toll-rises-to-56156-health-ministry">killed</a> 56,156 people and injured 132,239 in the enclave since launching a military onslaught in October 2023. A human rights monitor <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896201">published</a> a report detailing the “shocking” treatment of Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons.</p>
<p>“Pakistan remains gravely concerned at the widespread and systematic use of torture as an instrument of oppression in situations of foreign occupation” the FO statement said on the occasion of the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture.</p>
<p>“The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849295">people</a> of the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) continue to be subjected to the worst forms of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1502591">torture</a> and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the occupying powers to suppress their right to self-determination.”</p>
<p>Pakistan stands in solidarity with the victims of torture worldwide and reaffirms its continued commitment to eradicating torture and upholding human dignity, it added.</p>
<p>“Islam upholds the sanctity and dignity of every human being. Any act of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment is incompatible with the values of justice, mercy, and compassion that are at the core of Islamic teachings.</p>
<p>“Guided by these values and its international obligations Pakistan remains committed to eradicating torture and strengthening protections for all individuals,” the statement said.</p>
<p>It added that “legal reforms, institutional safeguards, and oversight mechanisms continue to be strengthened by Pakistan to ensure accountability and uphold the rule of law,” adding that “measures are also being taken to provide victims with medical, legal, and psycho-social support.”</p>
<p>Pakistan reiterates its call on the international community to condemn the crimes of these occupying powers and to hold them accountable, in addition to helping end the plight of the victims of their torture and oppression, the FO concluded.</p>
<p>The UN General Assembly <a class="link--external" href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/torture-victims-day" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proclaimed</a> 26 June as the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture. It marks the moment when the in 1987 when the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment came into effect.</p>
<p>The <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/about-us/funding-and-budget/trust-funds/united-nations-voluntary-fund-victims-torture/international-day-support-victims-torture-26-june" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">day</a> is an opportunity to call on all stakeholders including UN member states, civil society and individuals to unite in support of people around the world who have been victims of torture and those who are still tortured today.</p></p>
