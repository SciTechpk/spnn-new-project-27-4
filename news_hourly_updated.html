                <h2>Govt unveils plan to expand Gwadar Port operations</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>GWADAR: The Ministry of Maritime Affairs has announced an ambitious plan to expand <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1883968">Gwadar Port’s</a> operational capacity by introducing additional shipp­ing lines and launching a ferry service connecting Pak­istan with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.</p>
<p>The announcement was made during a high-level meeting chaired by Federal Minister for Maritime Af­­fairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Tuesday. Senior ministry officials also attended the session.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>To launch ferry service connecting Pakistan with GCC countries</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“The initiative is part of the government’s strategy to enhance regional connectivity, boost maritime trade and position Gwadar as a major hub in the Arabian Sea,” Mr Chaudhry said. “We aim to transform Gwadar into a strategic transhipment and logistics centre, benefiting Pakistan and the wider region.”</p>
<p>He emphasised that with Gwadar Port now fully ope­rational, it is time to accelerate its integration into international maritime networks. He directed relevant dep­artments to pursue all necessary steps to increase the port’s commercial activity and unlock its full potential.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He said additional shipping lines will be connected to Gwadar to facilitate greater movement of goods, promote transit trade with Central Asia and the Middle East, and support Pakistan’s growing role in the regional logistics landscape.</p>
<p>“The new routes will reduce pressure on existing ports and ensure faster, more efficient cargo handling,” Mr Chaudhry stated.</p>
<p>In addition to enhancing cargo operations, the maritime ministry has also planned to launch a ferry service from Gwadar to GCC countries. The move is expected to provide an affordable, direct maritime link for passengers and cargo, particularly benefiting expatriate communities and cross-border traders.</p>
<p>“The ferry service will strengthen people-to-people ties, boost tourism and provide a new economic lifeline for Balochistan,” the minister said. “It will create local employment, improve supporting infrastructure and attract private sector participation, especially in the areas of ship services, hospitality and transportation.”</p>

                <h2>Jaishankar again disputes Trump’s ‘South Asia’ ceasefire claim</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>WASHINGTON: Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, currently in Washington to participate in a Quad meeting, has again publicly challenged US President Donald Trump’s assertions that he brokered a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> between India and Pakistan, following a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military escalation</a> between the two nuclear armed neighbours in May this year.</p>
<p>In an interview with <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.newsweek.com/jaishankar-india-exclusive-newsweek-trump-trade-deal-2092824'" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Newsweek</a></em>, Jaishankar firmly denied Trump’s version of events, saying: “I can tell you that I was in the room when Vice President [JD] Vance spoke to Prime Minister Modi on the night of May 9.”</p>
<p>“There was no linking of trade and ceasefire,” he added.</p>
<p>Jaishankar recalled that Vance warned Modi that Pakistan was preparing for a large-scale attack.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Tells Newsweek he was ‘in the room’ when Vance spoke to Modi, claims trade was never discussed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“We did not accept certain things,” he said, noting that Modi remained unfazed and signalled that India would respond decisively.</p>
<p>The next morning, he claimed, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio informed him that Pakistan was ready to talk. Later that day, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations, Major General Kashif Abdullah, directly contacted his Indian counterpart to request a ceasefire, the Indian minister asserted.</p>
<p>The remarks offer the first detailed Indian account of how the standoff ended — a version that contradicts Trump’s narrative. There was no official reaction from Pakistan’s Foreign Office until going to press.</p>
<p>The US president insists it was his personal intervention — via trade pressure and high-level calls — that prevented a nuclear conflict between the two South Asian neighbors.</p>
<p>India has publicly expressed frustration over what it sees as the Trump administration’s increasing tendency to insert itself into India-Pakistan affairs — particularly on the Kashmir issue. Trump’s repeated offers to “mediate” have drawn strong reactions in New Delhi, which has long rejected third-party involvement.</p>
<p>Trump has not only taken credit for defusing the May standoff but also praised Pakistan’s military leadership for its restraint — suggesting their cooperation made a peaceful resolution possible. While this framing may serve Washington’s broader diplomatic aims, it sits uneasily with New Delhi.</p>
<p>Islamabad, by contrast, has welcomed Trump’s acknowledgment of its role in easing the crisis. His remarks crediting an unnamed “quiet but decisive” Pakistani general are widely seen as referring to Field Marshal Asim Munir, the army chief.</p>
<p>The army chief’s Munir’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044">recent visit</a> to Washington — which included a White House meeting — marked a significant breakthrough after years of limited military engagement.</p>
<p>Following the visit, Secretary Rubio made two phone calls to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, further fuelling speculation about US efforts to play a back-channel role in managing tensions in South Asia.</p>
<p>In remarks at a separate engagement, Jaishankar declared that India will not “yield to nuclear blackmail” while responding to alleged terrorist attacks, reaffirming New Delhi’s claim that the May 9 strikes inside Pakistan were retaliation for the Pahalgam incident.</p>
<p>Later, at a news briefing in Washington following a Quad meeting, Jaishankar appeared to hurl a veiled warning at Pakistan when he said: “The world must display zero tolerance [towards terrorism]. Victims and perpetrators must never be equated, and India has every right to defend its people against terrorism. And we will exercise that right. We expect our Quad partners to understand and appreciate that.”</p>
