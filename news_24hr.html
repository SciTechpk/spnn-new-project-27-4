            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923927/imf-representative-hails-pakistans-strong-economic-reform-progress' target='_blank'><strong>IMF representative hails Pakistan’s ‘strong’ economic reform progress</strong></a>
            <p><p>An International Monetary Fund (IMF) representative hailed Pakistan’s “strong” economic reforms carried out under the lender’s $7 billion loan programme, the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Pakis­tan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845536">secured</a> a three-year aid package deal in July 2024. The programme, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860850">approved</a> by the IMF two months later, is set to allow the country to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”.</p>
<p>IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan Mahir Binici noted that the country’s performance under the 2024 Extended Fund Facility (EFF) had been “strong so far”, according to a press release issued by the SDPI on its guest lecture in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Binici termed the EFF’s successful <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913147/pakistan-imf-agree-on-budget-blueprint">first review</a> — also encompassing agreement on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292">federal budget</a> blueprint — by the IMF Executive Board in May as a key milestone.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>He stressed that structural reforms remained central to Pakistan’s long-term economic sustainability, particularly reforms that strengthen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910790">tax equity</a>, improve the business climate and encourage <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916455">private-sector-led investment</a>.</p>
<p>Addressing economists, researchers and policy experts, the SDPI statement said, Banici reaffirmed the Fund’s continued support for the country’s economic and climate reform agenda.</p>
<p>In March, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900322">unlocked</a> a new $1.3 billion arrangement with the IMF under its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893193#:~:text=The%20country%20had%20requested%20%241bn%20from%20IMF%E2%80%99s%20Resilience%20and%20Sustainability%20Trust%20(RSF)%20in%20October">Resilience and Sustainability Facility</a> (RSF) to build resilience against climate catastrophes through adaptation.</p>
<p>Binici noted that the RSF was designed to help countries like Pakistan bolster resilience to climate-related vulnerabilities and meet international climate commitments, the SDPI press release said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The IMF official mentioned that the key areas of reform under the RSF included enhancing public investment planning, promoting efficient and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894835">sustainable use</a> of water resources, improving institutional coordination for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893742">disaster preparedness</a> and financing, along with expanding the availability and transparency of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1890593">climate-related data</a>.</p>
<p>Binici stressed that “support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory”.</p>
<p>The IMF official also shed light on the evolving economic landscape across the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) region and Pakistan. He stated that growth across the Mena region, as well as in Pakistan, was expected to strengthen in 2025 and beyond.</p>
<p>However, he cautioned that “elevated trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation and weakening global cooperation continue to generate exceptional uncertainty and weigh on the global economic outlook”, underscoring the urgent need for prudent and forward-looking policy actions.</p>
<p>SDPI Executive Director Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri welcomed the IMF representative’s outreach, noting the importance of informed economic dialogue and multilateral cooperation in Pakistan’s journey toward sustainable development.</p>
<p>The lecture concluded with an interactive discussion on fiscal and monetary policy frameworks, external buffers and the role of international institutions in fostering inclusive growth, the statement added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>The IMF had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898053">praised</a> Pakistan’s implementation of the $7bn EFF as strong in March after both concluded the programme’s first biannual review on a positive note.</p>
<p>In May, an official said the IMF Executive Board found that Pakistan had “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912850">met all of the targets</a>” under the package and made progress on some of the reforms.</p></p>

            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will travel to Tianjin, China, tomorrow for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers, state media outlet <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/13-07-2025/dpm-to-represent-pakistan-at-sco-fms-meeting-in-china" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. Their foreign ministers’ meeting was held as a precursor to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1865753">annual summit</a> of its leaders set for the autumn.</p>
<p>According to the report, the top diplomats from Belarus, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan will also attend the event.</p>
<p>“The upcoming Council of Heads of State will take place on August 31 and September 1 in Tianjin, China,” <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>“At the invitation of the Foreign Minister of China Wang Yi, the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Pakistan Ishaq Dar will lead the Pakistan delegation to the meeting of the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers,” the Foreign Office (FO) said.</p>
<p>The CFM is the third-highest forum in the SCO format. It focuses on the issues of international relations, as well as the foreign and security policies of the organisation, the FO said.</p>
<p>The press release added that the forum approves the documents, including declarations and statements that are to be presented for the consideration of the Council of Heads of State (CHS), as well as the decisions to be adopted by the CHS.</p>
<p>“The upcoming CHS will take place from August 31 to September 1 in Tianjin, China,” the FO said.</p>
<p>The FO also reported that Dar spoke with Uzbekistan’s Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov today and discussed progress on the Framework Agreement on Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915258">Railway Project</a>.</p>
<p>“Both leaders also agreed to meet again at the sidelines of the upcoming SCO Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in Tianjin, China,” the FO added.</p>

<p>Pakistan is heading into the meeting amid heightened tensions with India.</p>
<p>India blamed Pakistan for the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> without evidence, triggering a military escalation.

<p>Last month, the SCO’s meeting of defence ministers <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920309">failed</a> to reach a consensus on a joint statement due to India’s refusal, while Defence Minister Khawaja Asif reaffirmed the country’s commitment to combating terrorism and promoting regional peace and security within the body’s framework.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923948/pnf' target='_blank'><strong>PSB seeks clarification from PNF on ‘first position’ in Asian Youth Netball Championship</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) has expressed serious reservations over the Pakistan Netball Federation’s (PNF) claim that the Pakistan Youth Girls Team secured “first position” in the Asian Youth Netball Championship 2025 and has directed the federation to submit a written explanation within three days, state-run <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>Last week, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922153/pakistan-clinch-asian-girls-netball-title">completed</a> an extraordinary undefeated campaign to claim the Asian Youth Girls Netball Championship title, overpowering the Maldives 60-35 in the Plate Group (PG) final.</p>
<p>Eleven teams were participating in the championship and had been divided into two groups: Group A (Gold Cup Division) with Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong and India, while Group B (Plate Cup Division) had Chinese Taipei, Japan, South Korea, Pakistan, Maldives and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>In an explanation letter issued by PSB on Sunday, reference was made to PNF’s letter, in which the federation claimed the team had secured first place. According to PSB, the claim was worded in a manner that created the impression of a gold medal victory.</p>
<p>The Board also raised concerns that PNF Chairman Mudassar Razzaq Arain reinforced this misleading impression during televised interviews on mainstream media, where he explicitly referred to a gold medal win and publicly thanked senior government officials for their appreciation.</p>
<p>A viral video of such an interview was also referenced in the official notice.
According to PSB, this purported achievement was used by the federation to apply for cash rewards under the 2024 Cash Award Policy, which subsequently led to government-level recognition and benefits.</p>
<p>The notice has instructed the netball federation to provide a comprehensive written explanation within three days. Failure to do so will result in the matter being referred to the competent authorities for further necessary action, according to <em>APP</em>.</p>
<p>Responding to the PSB’s letter, PNF Chairman Arain said in a video message that the sports board had misunderstood.</p>
<p>“I would like to clarify that Pakistan was in Pool ‘B’ and won all their matches in the Plate Division after competing against teams like Chinese Taipei, Japan, Korea, Pakistan, Maldives and Saudi Arabia,” Arain said.</p>
<p>He added that the PSB had neither provided any funds nor assistance for participating in this championship.</p>
<p>Copies of the PSB’s letter have also been sent to relevant federal ministers, the chairman of the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme, the secretary of the Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination, and the president of the Pakistan Olympic Association, <em>APP</em> added.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also lauded the team for their victory.</p>
<p>“Special appreciation for staying undefeated throughout the tournament!” he said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/CMShehbaz/status/1941066819651166521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1941066819651166521%7Ctwgr%5Ec084ad2092e9a26310063f6fcc7b7dc3d3705ba2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dawn.com%2Fnews%2F1922044" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X. “Very well played!”</p>
<p>The tournament took place from June 27 to July 4 at the Jeonju Hwasan Gymnasium in South Korea.</p></p>
