                <h2>NA passes bill to establish Pakistan Land Port Authority</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The National Assembly passed the Pakistan Land Port Authority Bill 2025 on Thursday to facilitate the movement of goods and people across border crossing points.</p>
<p>With the bill‚Äôs approval, Pakistan would become the third South Asian country, after Bangladesh and India, to have a land port authority. The Bangladesh Land Port Authority was created in 2002, while India did so in March 2012.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe House discussed and passed the Pakistan Land Port Authority Bill, 2025,‚Äù the NA‚Äôs official X account said. The bill was moved by Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry on behalf of Interior Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi.</p>
<p>Once approved by the Senate and signed by President Asif Ali Zardari, the bill will establish the Pakistan Land Port Authority, which would function as a statutory body responsible for inter-agency coordination to facilitate the movement of goods and people across border crossing points.</p>
<p>As MNA Ali Zahid, who was chairing the session, ordered the clause-by-clause reading of the bill, PPP‚Äôs Syed Naveed Qamar noted that his party had reservations on some clauses.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe legislative committee of the party went through the bill and suggested a whole number of amendments in the bill to make it a better authority,‚Äù Qamar, chairman of the NA‚Äôs Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, said.</p>
<p>‚Äú[‚Ä¶] We have accepted the bill after going through a lot of deliberations and negotiations with the committee,‚Äù Qamar noted.</p>
<p>On the invitation of Zahid, Qamar read out amendments to at least 12 clauses of the legislation, each of which Chaudhry said he had no objection to. They were individually moved before the House and voted in favour of, and subsequently, the bill was passed as well.</p>

<p>The PPP government made the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/775056/land-port-authority-for-cross-border-trade">first attempt</a> to establish a land port authority in 2012 under the ambit of the commerce ministry, while the PTI government made the <a class="link--external" href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2335944/plpa-to-start-operation-in-february-2022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">second attempt</a> in 2021.</p>
<p>The PML-N government had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1287704/formation-of-land-port-authority-discussed">discussed</a> the matter during its previous tenure in 2016, with various models of upgraded border posts for covered cargo at Jamrud, Taftan and Sost mulled.</p>
<p>In December 2024, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar moved the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.na.gov.pk/uploads/documents/6763fef237324_339.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bill</a> on behalf of Naqvi, but at the time, Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah had not referred it to the relevant committee.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The proposed legislation will provide a framework for the declaration, regulation, security and oversight of all land ports for promoting trade, fostering free competition, implementing border control and protecting the country‚Äôs strategic interests.</p>
<p>The port authority will establish a robust mechanism to carry out effective coordination with border agencies for trade facilitation in pursuance of commitments under international agreements and conventions for improved land port efficiency and regional port competitiveness.</p>
<p>The bill also proposes the establishment of a 16-member governing council for supervising the authority.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no single agency for the coordinated functioning of various government authorities and service providers at international border points. This lack of coordination sometimes causes a delay in the flow of goods and passengers.</p>
<p>High-tech equipment is also needed to be installed at land ports to check illegal immigration and smuggling of goods.</p></p>

                <h2>PMD issues heavy rain warning for Azad Kashmir and KP</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Thursday issued a warning for heavy rain across Azad Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and advised citizens to stay alert.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926631">fall</a> across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. However, heavy downpours also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1852031">trigger</a> deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>In a post on X, the PMD said at 3:30pm that a ‚Äúrain-bearing weather system‚Äù was forming in the Poonch, Bagh, Haveli and Sudhnoti areas of Kashmir.</p>
<p>According to the post, the system was likely to cause ‚Äúheavy rain with strong winds and thunderstorms‚Äù during the next 2-5 hours in the above-mentioned areas as well as Azad Kashmir‚Äôs Muzaffarabad, Kotli, Rawalakot, Bhimber, Mirpur and Neelum Valley.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Other areas that could come under the rain spell were KP‚Äôs Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur and Kohistan, along with Murree, Galyat, and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The PMD has advised the public to take precautions and stay updated.</p>
<p>At least 71 people have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929087">died</a> ‚Äî over half of them children ‚Äî and another 86 have been injured in rain-related incidents across KP since the start of the monsoon season in late June, according to the latest figures by KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).</p>
<p>On Sunday, the nationwide death toll from monsoon rains rose to 299, up from 234, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).</p>
<p>On Saturday, the PMD <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928396/heavy-rain-likely-from-tomorrow-amid-urban-flooding-risk">forecast</a> more rain, with wind-thundershowers in the upper and central regions of the country over this week. The department asked provincial disaster management authorities and district administrations to take preventative measures against possible urban flooding.</p></p>
