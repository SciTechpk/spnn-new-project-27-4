                <h2>Aurangzeb eyes ‚Äògame-changer‚Äô investment discussions with US</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has said the government aims to follow the ongoing trade talks with the United States by discussing investment, terming it a potential ‚Äúgame-changer‚Äù for economic ties between the two countries.</p>
<p>He made the remarks after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925024">meeting</a> with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer on Friday as part of a critical round of trade talks aimed at securing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901838">tariff relief</a> and expanding bilateral economic cooperation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOne thing we discussed was that we have to move beyond the immediate trade imperative, which is obviously very critical, but besides that, for the Pakistan-US relationship to be brought to the next level and bring in a real step change, [there is] an investment imperative that will hopefully emerge,‚Äù Aurangzeb said in a video statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAreas [for investment] have already been identified,‚Äù the minister said, mentioning <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902898">minerals and mining</a>, artificial intelligence, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912373">digital infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915365">cryptocurrency</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe feel this will be a real game-changer, God-willing, in terms of the economic relationship between Pakistan and the United States.‚Äù</p>

<p>Aurangzeb added that both sides committed to begin their talks with trade and follow them through ‚Äúvery quickly with investment discussions between the two countries and real execution of the investment upside that is available, so that it becomes a win-win‚Äù for Pakistan and the US.</p>
<p>The minister termed his dialogue with Lutnick and Greer ‚Äúvery constructive‚Äù. Pakistan‚Äôs Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh and Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul, who were present during the meeting, accompanied Aurangzeb in the video statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPositive progress over the last few weeks and months was reviewed. Equally importantly, we focused on the slightly outstanding aspects,‚Äù the finance czar said, adding there was a clear commitment from both sides to ‚Äúget closure‚Äù on those items.</p>
<p>The minister highlighted that as the US was Pakistan‚Äôs largest trading partner, it was quite critical to move forward in the ‚Äúsame spirit‚Äù in which the recent discussions had taken place.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the next few days, we hope that the coming leadership-level announcements will reflect all the hard work and efforts that have been put in both by Pakistan and the US side,‚Äù Aurangzeb said.</p>
<p>Pakistan aims to finalise a long-term reciprocal tariff agreement that would prevent the re-imposition of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901838">29 per cent tariff</a> on Pakistani exports ‚Äî primarily textiles and agricultural products. While Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922611/trump-dispatches-letters-outlining-new-tariffs-on-foreign-nations">announced</a> tariffs for some countries, talks with others are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923479">ongoing</a> ahead of his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922652/trump-announces-up-to-40pc-tariffs-on-several-nations#:~:text=%E2%80%94%20postponing%20their%20imposition%20to%20August%201.">extended</a> August 1 deadline.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922229/pakistan-us-reach-accord-on-trade-and-tariffs">reached</a> an initial understanding on a deal that could shape the future of the country‚Äôs key export sectors. A formal announcement on any deal is expected only after the US concludes similar ongoing negotiations with other trade partners.</p>
<p>A source close to the US administration has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925087#:~:text=The%20president%20wants%20concrete%20deliverables%20before%20the%20August%2015%20deadline">mentioned</a> a further deadline: ‚ÄúThe president wants concrete deliverables before the August 15 deadline. Countries that stall may find themselves on the wrong end of a tariff wall.‚Äù</p>
<p>A senior Pakistani official involved in the negotiations said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not here for aid. We‚Äôre here for serious negotiations and a possible deal. It‚Äôs about mutual benefit now ‚Äî trade, not dependence.‚Äù</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, influential US-based businessmen with stakes in cryptocurrency and rare earth mineral ventures have quietly supported Pakistan‚Äôs efforts to gain greater access to American markets.</p>
<p>In April, the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906732">partnered with</a> World Liberty Financial (WLF), a decentralised finance platform backed by US President Donald Trump. Earlier that month, a US delegation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903248">expressed</a> Washington‚Äôs strategic interest in the country‚Äôs mineral sector.</p></p>

<p>RIAT, which runs from July 18 to 20, is one of the world‚Äôs largest military airshows, has been running for over 50 years and powers the Royal Air Force Charitable Trust, according to its <a class="link--external" href="https://www.airtattoo.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924755">PAF contingent</a> comprising ‚Äústate-of-the-art JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter aircraft and the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, landed at the Royal Air Force Base Fairford in the UK to participate in the prestigious‚Äù RIAT 2025, a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.</p>

<p>The JF-17 Block-III was awarded the ‚ÄúSpirit of the Meet Trophy‚Äù for its ‚Äústriking livery and the incredible journey from Pakistan with non-stop air-to-air refuelling,‚Äù <em>PTV</em> reported.</p>
<p>According to ISPR‚Äôs press release earlier this week, the JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighters executed successful Air-to-Air Refuelling operations en route to the UK with the support of a PAF IL-78 aerial refuelling tanker.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThese awards were given in recognition of the aircrafts‚Äô excellent flying and technical skills,‚Äù <em>PTV</em> said.</p>
<p>It added that the JF-17C Block III represents Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúadvanced defence technology‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis success has honoured Pakistan‚Äôs aviation sector on an international level.‚Äù</p>
<p><em>PTV</em> called the success at RIAT a ‚Äútestament to the recognition of the capabilities of the Pakistan Air Force‚Äù.</p>
<p>In May, when Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">downed</a> Indian jets as retaliation for late-night strikes during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/pakistan-india-tensions">Pakistan-India conflict</a>, the PAF formally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">acknowledged</a> a month later that it was the Kamra-based 15 Squadron that led the charge in shooting down them down.</p>
<p>The event is now considered one of the largest air-to-air engagements in South Asia in more than half a century.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is a palpable sense of enthusiasm across the United Kingdom following the recent Pakistan-India conflict, as aviation enthusiasts and defence observers were eagerly looking forward to the arrival of the Pakistan Air Force‚Äôs JF-17 Thunder Block-III,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe aircraft‚Äôs combat-proven capabilities and operational excellence have garnered significant global attention, making its appearance at RIAT a highly anticipated highlight in the aerospace and defence community.‚Äù</p></p>
