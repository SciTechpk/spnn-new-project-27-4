            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: A Sup­reme Court judge on Friday questioned the haste shown by National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929441">auctioning</a> six Bahria Town properties when six references against Zain Malik were still pen­­d­ing adjudication before an accountability court, which would decide about confiscation of the properties if the accused was proved guilty.</p>
<p>“After instituting applications for the termination of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1587548">plea bargain</a> (deal appr­o­­ved in August 2020) betw­een Zain Malik and NAB, the references against the accused have been reverted to the preliminary  stage,” observed Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, a member of the  three-judge SC bench that had taken up the appeal against the Aug 4  short order of the Islamabad High Court.</p>
<p>As the IHC in its short order <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929028">allowed NAB</a> to go ahead with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913654">auction</a> of the six attached properties, the anti-graft watchdog sold one property and received conditional bids for two other properties, at a combined value of Rs2.27 billion.</p>
<p>However, the auction of three remaining properties was shelved for want of qualifying bids.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Three-member bench to hear Bahria Town appeal on regular basis from 13th</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The SC decided that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929220">appeals by Bahria Town</a> would be fixed before any available three-judge bench of the apex court for regular hearing from Aug 13.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>In its appeal, the Bahria Town contended that the IHC short order of dismissing its plea against the auction was bad in law and facts as it suffered from misreading and non-reading of the record and applicable legal provisions.</p>
<p>Both the Aug 4 order of the high court and the May 23 order of the accountability court were without lawful jurisdiction and in blatant violation of Section 88 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which does not authorise attachment of properties belonging to third parties, the SC was apprised.</p>
<p>The appellant argued that the IHC and the accountability court also failed to distinguish between the assets of the accused and those owned by a separate and independent juristic entity.</p>

            <p><p>BAJAUR: Amid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927600">talks</a> between the Bajaur Amn Jirga and terrorists for the latter’s peaceful return to Afghanistan, security officials have ruled out any compromise with anti-state elements here.</p>
<p>The seventh session of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928424">negotiation</a> between Jirga members and TTP leaders was held on Friday. Sources claimed that the terrorists, living among civilian population in Bajaur tribal district, were involved in sabotage and other crimes.</p>
<p>They said that the chief minister and security officials asked tribal elders to expel foreign terrorists, mostly Afghans, or vacate the area for one or two days for an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927454">operation</a> against terrorists.</p>
<p>While promising the continuation of operation against terrorists “at all costs,” the chief minister and security officials called for efforts to minimise collateral damage.</p>
<p>Security sources said the government’s direct talks with terrorists or their facilitators was out of the question until the latter surrendered. They said the ongoing tribal jirga was a logical step to ensure the maximum public safety ahead of any action.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The sources, however, said both the state and residents were opposed to any compromise with terrorists. They said that the authority to conduct armed operations against terrorists rested with the state.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the seventh round of talks between Bajaur Amn Jirga members and terrorist leaders concluded in Lowi Mamund tehsil here on Friday evening.</p>
<p>Jirga head Sahibzada Haroon Rashid didn’t update the media about the outcome of the negotiations. However, there is a high likelihood of the Jirga sharing “new developments” with the media shortly.</p>

            <p><p>Hasan Nawaz made a triumphant one-day international (ODI) debut, going 63 not out on Friday to power Pakistan over the West Indies by five wickets in their ODI series opener.</p>
<p>Nawaz and Hussain Talat formed a sixth-wicket partnership of 104 not out to rally the visitors in the day-night affair, with game two on Sunday and the concluder on Tuesday.</p>
<p>West Indies went 280 all out with Evin Lewis leading the way on 60 from 62 balls with three sixes and five fours while Shai Hope added 55 and Roston Chase contributed 53.</p>
<p>Needing 281 to win, Pakistan got 53 runs from Mohammad Rizwan before he was bowled lbw by Shamar Joseph in the 38th over with the visitors still 101 runs shy of victory, setting the stage for heroics by Nawaz and Talat.</p>
<p>Nawaz struck for six on the second ball of the 49th over and blasted the winning shot to the boundary off the final delivery by Joseph, giving Pakistan the victory with seven balls to spare.</p>
<p>In all, Nawaz reached 63 on 54 balls with three sixes and five fours while Talat finished on 41 from 37 balls with one six and four fours.</p>

<p>Pakistan won the toss and sent the hosts in to bat first, a choice that paid quick dividends when Brandon King was taken for four on the fifth ball of the opening over, bowled by Shaheen Shah Afridi — his first of four wickets — and caught by Babar Azam off stump.</p>
<p>Lewis exited on the last ball of the 19th over, bowled by Saim Ayub and caught by Afridi.</p>
<p>West Indies captain Hope was bowled by Afridi and caught by Rizwan on the second ball of the 41st over, leaving the hosts on 200 for five.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929203">Romario Shepherd</a> was sent off on four on the last ball of the 43rd over.</p>
<p>Chase made the third half-century for the West Indies with a boundary but went out on the next ball, caught by Azam and bowled by Naseem Shah, who also bowled out Gudakesh Motie and Jediah Blades on the last two Pakistan deliveries.</p>
