                <h2>Another 3 terrorists eliminated in Zhob anti-infiltration operation</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Security forces have eliminated another three terrorists attempting to infiltrate via the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Balochistan‚Äôs Zhob district, the military‚Äôs media wing said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The military‚Äôs anti-infiltration operation, which began on the night of August 7, has so far killed 50 terrorists.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn night [of] 10/11 August 2025, a deliberate sanitisation operation was conducted in surrounding areas of Sambaza along [the] Pakistan-Afghanistan border,‚Äù the Inter-Services Public Relations said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7388" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring the conduct of the operation, three more Indian sponsored <em>khawarij</em> were hunted down and successfully neutralised. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed <em>khawarij</em>,‚Äù the ISPR added.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna">Fitna al Khawarij</a></em> is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>It highlighted: ‚ÄúThe number of <em>khawarij</em> killed in four days‚Äô anti-infiltration operation has risen to 50.‚Äù</p>
<p>The ISPR noted that ‚Äú47 khwarij were sent to hell‚Äù previously following successful engagements by the security forces in the general area Sambaza of Zhob from August 7 to 9.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe security forces remain committed to secure the nation‚Äôs frontiers and thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Pakistan,‚Äù the military reaffirmed.</p>

                <h2>Pakistan‚Äôs outreach to Trump ‚Äòrattles‚Äô India, says Financial Times</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>PAKISTAN‚Äôs recent diplomatic <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927959">engagements</a> with the administration of United States President Donald Trump have led to a marked improvement in bilateral ties and drawn a strong reaction from India, the <em>Financial Times</em> reported in a detailed piece on Monday.</p>
<p>In a report by correspondents in Islamabad, New Delhi and Washi¬≠ngton, the <em>FT</em> described what it called an ‚Äúunexpected resurgence‚Äù in relations between Islamabad and Washington. The newspaper said Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir has twice been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929938">received</a> in high-level settings in the US this summer,  most recently in Florida, where he attended the retirement ceremony of Gen Michael Kurilla, head of US Central Command.</p>
<p>According to the  <em>FT</em>, Munir also met President Trump in June for a two-hour private <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">lunch</a>,  just a month after Pakistan and India experienced their bloodiest <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">confrontation</a> in decades. The meeting was notable given Mr Trump‚Äôs  earlier public criticism of Pakistan.</p>
<p>Michael Kugelman, a non-resident senior fellow at the Asia Pacific Foundation, told the <em>FT</em>:  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening in US-Pakistan relations is a surprise. I would describe the relationship now as one that‚Äôs enjoying an unexpected resurgence, even a renaissance. Pakistan has very successfully  understood how to engage with such an unconventional president.‚Äù</p>
<p>The <em>FT</em> attributed the change in tone to a diplomatic strategy by senior Pakistani officials, combining counterterrorism cooperation, outreach to individuals in Mr Trump‚Äôs business network, and agreements involving energy, mineral resources and cryptocurrency. These moves, it said, were accompanied by positive messaging towards the White House.</p>
<p>A key development cited in the report was the March arrest and transfer to US  custody of an ISIS-K suspect alleged to have organised the 2021 Kabul airport bombing. Mr Trump publicly commended Pakistan for the arrest in his State of the Union address.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The newspaper also detailed an April agreement between World Liberty Financial, a Trump-backed cryptocurrency initiative, and Pakistan‚Äôs crypto council. One of the venture‚Äôs co-founders remarked during a visit to Pakistan on the scale of the country‚Äôs mineral resources.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>On the regional response,  the <em>FT</em> said India reacted with ‚Äúdeep irritation‚Äù to the warming of ties,  particularly after facing a US tariff <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929231">increase</a> to 50 per cent, while Pakistan‚Äôs rate was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927992">set</a> at 19 per cent. Prime Minister Narendra Modi  <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917877/modi-maintains-there-was-no-us-mediation-in-ceasefire-with-pakistan">disputed</a> Mr Trump‚Äôs assertion that the US had mediated a May <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910060">ceasefire</a> between the two countries, with New Delhi emphasising that the agreement had been reached through direct channels between their armed forces.</p>
