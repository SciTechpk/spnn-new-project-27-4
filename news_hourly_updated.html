                <h2>Flooding will be ‚Äònew normal for Pakistan‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Authors of Nature study say flood risks can be mitigated by restoring natural floodplains, improving drainage, moving population away from riverbanks<br />
‚Ä¢ Extreme rainfall will become ‚Äòmore common and stronger‚Äô by end of the century</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Calling the 2022 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1724134">floods</a> ‚Äúa forewarning of elevated future flood risks‚Äù, a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/393468298_Anthropogenic_and_climatic_drivers_of_the_2022_mega-flood_in_Pakistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in a leading scientific journal warns that Pakistan is likely to experience more frequent and severe floods due to extreme rainfall events and human-induced development encro¬≠aching on floodplains.</p>
<p>Published in <em>Nature</em>, the article comprehensively evaluates the complex interplay of pluvial (direct rainfall) and fluvial (riverine) conditions, upstream snow cover dynamics, and anthropogenic changes in the natural landscape that contributed to the unprecedented 2022 flooding.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>The study says the Indus Plain in Pakistan experienced 19 flood disasters between 1950 and 2012, affecting an area of 599,459km¬≤, causing 11,239 deaths, and resulting in economic damages exceeding $39 billion.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA significant proportion of these flood events were predominantly attributed to monsoon rainfall, with around 10 out of 20 occurrences taking place after the 2000s,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>According to the paper, after a multi-year drought, the pre-monsoon rainfall in 2022 was 111 per cent higher than the long-term average of 1951‚Äì2021, increasing soil moisture by 30pc in the Indus Basin floodplains.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMonsoon rains were 547pc above average, with record-breaking cumulative weekly rainfall in July (200mm) on already saturated soils. Upstream drainage catchments (e.g., Chenab, Jhelum, and Ravi) received 33pc and 41pc more rain in pre-monsoon and monsoon periods, respectively,‚Äù it said, adding that August 2022‚Äôs streamflow at Sukkur Barrage, just upstream of the floodplains in Sindh, was 170pc larger than the historical average, due to the compounding effects of rain-on-snow and warmer temperatures accelerating snowmelt.</p>
<p>It said the 2022 flood was triggered by pre-monsoon rainfall followed by an intensified monsoon system, adding that during the monsoon season (July-Sep), rainfall in Sindh and Balochistan surged to ‚Äúbetween 600 and 1800mm, far exceeding historical average‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p><strong>Anthropogenic changes</strong></p>
<p>According to the study, riverine flooding was amplified by anthropogenic changes, extreme streamflow, and antecedent soil moisture conditions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe river water level during the 2022 flood surpassed the levels recorded during the historical catastrophic floods of 2010 and 2015 by 2.4m and 2.79m in Aug. For example, Jun 2022 flows at Sukkur Barrage were 32pc lower than the long-term average (1994‚Äì2021), while subsequent months saw increases of 26pc, 105pc, and 170pc, respectively.‚Äù</p>
<p>The study revealed human activities were land use adjacent to riverine ecosystems, characterised by intensive agricultural practices and high population density along riverbanks.</p>
<p>For instance, Larkana has consistently expanded toward the riverbanks, with cropland extended from about 37,000km¬≤ to 47,500km¬≤ between 2001 and 2022.</p>
<p>Another factor that contributed to these floods was the accelerated upstream snowmelt and rain-on-snow events.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄòAdding fuel to fire‚Äô</strong></p>
<p>According to the authors of the study, Dr Ali Mirchi and Dr Arfan Arshad, flooding risks in Pakistan could ‚Äúincrease dramatically‚Äù under a high-emission scenario, with intense rainfall events, especially 5-day extreme rainfall events in southern Pakistan projected to become ‚Äúmore common and stronger by the end of the century up to 58pc‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor example, the frequency of rainfall totals of more than 400mm over five days in this region would increase. At the same time, single-day rainfall extremes (RX1day) could rise by 44pc, pushing already vulnerable regions beyond their coping capacity,‚Äù they told <em>Dawn</em> via email.</p>
<p>They said Pakistan could focus on adaptation to mitigate these risks, such as restoring natural floodplains, improving drainage, and shifting development away from riverbanks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan cannot solve global warming alone, but local emission reductions combined with smarter land planning can reduce damage and save lives,‚Äù they said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo reduce the rainfall-induced direct flooding from urban runoff, we have to fix and upgrade drainage systems in both cities and rural areas to reduce flooding. These are practical, actions that can be done quickly and can go a long way in preventing the kind of widespread damage we saw during the 2022 floods,‚Äù the authors said, while stressing the need to improve early warning systems.</p>

                <h2>Fuel prices set for fresh hike amid global trends</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Prices of petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) are expected to increase by Rs5.25 and Rs6.50 per litre, respectively, for the upcoming fortnight starting July 16, owing to a rise in global oil prices and import premiums.</p>
<p>According to informed sources, the ex-depot price of petrol is projected to rise by about 2pc to Rs272.04 per litre, while HSD is likely to see a 2.5pc increase to approximately Rs279.48 per litre. The final prices will be announced after government approval.</p>
<p>Currently, petrol is priced at Rs266.79 per litre following a Rs8.36 per litre <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917324">hike</a> on June 30. Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws, and private vehicles, petrol has a direct impact on the budgets of middle- and lower-income households.</p>
<p>Diesel, which fuels heavy transport, agricultural machinery, and trains, stands at Rs272.98 per litre after a Rs10.39 hike earlier this month. Its price is considered highly inflationary, influencing the cost of food and other essential goods. Transporters have already begun adjusting fares in anticipation of the expected increase.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Petrol and diesel rates may rise by Rs5.25 and Rs6.50 per litre</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast, the prices of kerosene and light diesel oil are projected to decline by Rs3.80 and Rs2.25 per litre, respectively.</p>
<p>Despite zero general sales tax (GST) on petroleum products, the government is currently collecting close to Rs98 per litre in total levies on both petrol and diesel. This includes a petroleum development levy (PDL) of Rs78.02 on petrol and Rs77.01 on diesel and HOBC, along with a Rs2.25 per litre climate support levy (CSL). Additionally, a customs duty of Rs20-21 per litre is levied on both fuels, whether imported or locally refined.</p>
<p>Oil marketing companies and dealers are earning around Rs17 per litre as combined distribution and retail margins.</p>
<p>Petrol and diesel remain the primary drivers of fuel consumption, with monthly sales between 700,000 and 800,000 tonnes, compared to just 10,000 tonnes of kerosene.</p>
<p>In FY24, the government collected Rs1.161tr through the petroleum levy and aims to increase this by 27pc to Rs1.470tr in FY25. Despite zero GST, petroleum products continue to serve as a significant source of revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Oil falls 1pc</strong></p>
<p>According to a <em>Reuters</em> report, oil prices edged lower on Monday, as investors weighed new threats from US President Donald Trump for sanctions on buyers of Russian oil that may affect global supplies, while still worried about Trump‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901770">tariffs.</a></p>
<p>Brent crude futures fell 79 cents, or 1.12pc, to $69.57 a barrel by 1:04 pm EDT (1704 GMT). US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down $1.07, also 1.56pc, to $67.38.</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924158">announced</a> new weapons for Ukraine and threatened to hit buyers of Russian exports with sanctions unless Russia agrees to a peace deal in 50 days.</p>
<p>Oil prices rallied early, on expectations that Washington would impose steeper sanctions. But prices retreated as traders weighed the 50-day deadline.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe market took it as a negative because there seemed to be a lot of time to negotiate,‚Äù said Phil Flynn, senior analyst with Price Futures Group.</p>
