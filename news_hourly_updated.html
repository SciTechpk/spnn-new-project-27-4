                <h2>Budget 2025-26: Era of amnesty schemes is over, says Aurangzeb</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p><strong>‚Ä¢ Senate, National Assembly panels oppose carbon levy, term it undue burden on public<br />
‚Ä¢ Approve new taxes on high-value pensions, athletes<br />
‚Ä¢ Govt asked to reveal terms of IMF‚Äôs resilience facility</strong></p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917736/budget-2025-26-lawmakers-reject-solar-panel-tax-seek-relief-for-small-cars">parliamentary committees</a> on Thursday rejected the government‚Äôs proposal to impose a carbon levy on petroleum products, terming it an undue burden on the public, whereas the finance minister stressed that ‚Äúthe era of tax exemptions and amnesty schemes is over‚Äù.</p>
<p>However, they approved new taxes on high-value pensions and the income of international athletes.</p>
<p>The carbon levy became a focal point as the Senate and National Assembly Standing Committees on Finance and Revenue held simultaneous sessions at Parliament House for a clause-by-clause review of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917558">Finance Bill 2025-26</a>.</p>
<p>Chaired by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla and MNA Naveed Qamar, respectively, both panels proposed several amendments and struck down a number of measures. The Senate concluded its deliberations on the proposed tax provisions on Thursday.</p>
<p>The debate revolved around whether the measure should be classified as a levy or a tax, its revenue potential and provincial share, and whether its purpose is genuinely another tool for the federal government to raise additional funds.</p>
<p>Senator Sherry Rehman firmly distinguished bet¬≠w¬≠een fiscal instruments, stating there is a significant diff¬≠erence between a carbon levy and a carbon tax. Carbon levies are not stan¬≠dard practice, she said, add¬≠ing that it is carbon taxes that are typically imposed.</p>
<p>She argued that such a measure cannot be introduced through the Finance Bill, calling instead for dedicated legislation.</p>
<p>Senator Shibli Faraz criticised the move as contradictory. ‚ÄúOn the one hand, the government highlights climate change; on the other, it introduces a levy. This is not a carbon levy ‚Äî it is more like extortion,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Senator Mohsin Aziz cited the Supreme Court ruling in the Zafar Iqbal Jhagra case, stating that ‚Äúunder that decision, a carbon levy cannot be imposed. Doing so may constitute contempt of court.‚Äù He also raised concerns over unchecked fuel smuggling from Iran.</p>
<p>Sherry Rehman stressed that carbon taxes are usually applied to specific industries with targeted environmental goals, not levied directly on the general population. ‚ÄúYou are burdening ordinary men and women while labelling it climate finance,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur party‚Äôs position is clear. Such a levy cannot be implemented through the Finance Bill,‚Äù Ms Rehman clarified. Senator Faisal Vawda also opposed the carbon levy, terming it an undue burden on the general public.</p>
<p>MNA Syed Naveed Qamar also sought clarity on the projected revenue from the proposed carbon levy. In response, finance ministry officials said the measure is expected to generate Rs45 billion in fiscal year 2025-26.</p>
<p>Mr Qamar further questioned how much of that amount would accrue to the federal government if the levy is redefined as a tax. State Minister for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani clarified, ‚ÄúIf it is converted into a carbon tax, the federal government would receive Rs18bn‚Äù.</p>
<p>To this, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb asked, ‚ÄúWhere did this carbon tax proposal come from?‚Äù Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial resp¬≠onded, ‚ÄúThe matter surfaced earlier in the Senate Standing Commi¬≠ttee on Finance.‚Äù</p>
<p>MNA Dr Mirza Ikhtiar Baig offered a key clarification: ‚ÄúIf it remains a levy, the entire amount will go to the federal government. But if it becomes a tax, then the provinces will also be entitled to a share.‚Äù</p>
<p>Senator Mandviwalla asked for details on the specific use of those funds, while Senator Sherry Rehman demanded that ‚Äúthe government disclose the full terms of the IMF‚Äôs Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) agreement‚Äù.</p>
<p><strong>Surcharge cap removal</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Senate parliamentary committee rejected the surcharge cap removal on the plea that it would escalate costs for energy consumers. The committee also rejected the proposed tiered levies on small vehicles.</p>
<p>However, the committee approved proposals to tax annual pensions exceeding Rs10 million, withdraw income tax exemptions for international athletes and extend tax holidays for economic and special technology zones.</p>
<p>The National Assembly‚Äôs committee also deliberated on the government‚Äôs proposal to impose a 10 per cent sales tax on solar products. Mr Qamar said that the government has agreed to lower the sales tax rate from the proposed 18pc to 10pc on solar panels.</p>
<p>The FBR chairman said that parliament must take the final decision; once it does, the tax authority will implement the required amendment.</p>
<p>MNA Mubeen Arif remarked that if the Senate has recommended a 10pc rate, the National Assem¬≠bly committee should push for a further reduction. Mr Qamar clarified that the recommendation did not come from the Senate but originated within the NA committee itself.</p>
<p>Provisions relating to fraud were deferred for further deliberation, and the Finance Bill was held over for reconsideration at the next meeting.</p>
<p>The committee recommended reviewing the Ex¬≠¬≠port Finance Scheme for raw cotton and suggested aligning taxes on local cotton production with those on imported cotton.</p>
<p><strong>New energy vehicle adoption</strong></p>
<p>Members also discussed the New Energy Vehicle Adoption Levy Act, 2025, and noted the lack of a comprehensive plan for transitioning to electric vehicles, citing the scarcity of charging stations.</p>
<p>It was further noted that hybrid vehicles have not been included in the proposed measures. Given these concerns, the committee decided to defer consideration of the matter until the next meeting, with directions to the ministry to present a comprehensive and actionable plan for the implementation of the objectives outlined in the proposed Finance Bill.</p>
<p>The committee also considered the proposed amendments to the Stamp Act. During detailed deliberations, it was observed that the term non-filer is being used in the proposed amendment, even though this category has been removed from the applicable laws. In light of this inconsistency, the committee decided to defer consideration of the amendment until the next meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Tax amnesty scheme</strong></p>
<p>Finance Minister Aurangzeb said that there will be no more tax exemptions or tax amnesty schemes. He said the era of tax exemptions and amnesty schemes is over. ‚ÄúWe are now focused on expanding the tax net, and that process is actively underway,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>The committee‚Äôs debate underscored deep concerns over tax compliance, as the FBR proposed stringent enforcement measures ‚Äî barring unregistered individuals from operating bank accounts and disconnecting utilities for non-compliant Tier-1 retailers ‚Äî while acknowledging systemic gaps, with only 35,000 of 300,000 industrial units registered for sales tax.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Lawmakers weighed punitive amendments to Section 14AC against the practical risk of overreach. While MNA Javed Hanif endorsed the tougher stance, others like Shar¬≠mila Faruqi urged a shift towards incentives rather than penalties.</p>
<p>Opposition leader Omar Ayub questioned how many connections had actually been cut for non-filers, warning that excessive powers for tax officers could be counterproductive.</p>
<p>The FBR chief acknowledged evasion tactics and stressed the need for enhanced powers, while assuring that deterrents such as bank account fre¬≠ezes would be temporary.</p>

            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918321/e-bikes-rickshaws-get-rs9bn-subsidy-under-national-electric-vehicle-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <h2>E-bikes, rickshaws get Rs9bn subsidy under National Electric Vehicle policy</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The government on Thursday launched the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911526">National Electric Vehicle</a> (NEV) Policy 2025-30, describing it as a transformative step in Pakistan‚Äôs journey towards industrial growth, environmental protection and energy efficiency.</p>
<p>One of the key targets under the policy is to ensure that electric vehicles account for 30 per cent of all new vehicles sold in the country by 2030.</p>
<p>This transition is projected to save 2.07 billion litres of fuel annually, resulting in nearly $1bn in foreign exchange savings. Additionally, the policy aims to reduce carbon emissions by 4.5 million tonnes and cut healthcare-related costs by $405m each year.</p>
<p>Addressing a news conference, Special Assistant to the Prime Mi¬≠¬≠nister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan said the new EV policy is in line with the premier‚Äôs vision of promoting clean, sustainable and affordable transport while boosting local industry and protecting the environment.</p>
<p>He emphasised that the transport sector is a major source of carbon emissions in Pakistan and urgently needs reform.</p>
<p>Mr Akhtar announced that an initial subsidy of Rs9bn has been allocated for the fiscal year 2025-26, under which 116,053 electric bikes and 3,171 electric rickshaws will be facilitated. Besides, 25pc of this subsidy is reserved for women to provide them with safe, affordable and eco-friendly mobility.</p>
<p>He said a fully digital platform has also been introduced to ensure transparent online application, verification and disbursement of subsidies.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Furthermore, the policy outlines the installation of 40 new EV charging stations on motorways, with an average distance of 105 kilometres between them.</p>
<p>The policy also includes the introduction of battery swapping systems, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) schemes and mandatory integration of EV charging points in new building codes to facilitate wider adoption in urban areas.</p>
<p>Currently, over 90pc of parts for two- and three-wheelers are already manufactured locally and to encourage local manufacturing, incentives are being provided to domestic producers.</p>
<p>The government will also introduce special support packages for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to further boost localisation.</p>
<p>He also highlighted that locally produced goods were 30-40pc cheaper than imported alternatives. In the two-wheeler segment alone, more than 90pc of parts are now produced locally.</p>
<p>The Auto Industry Development and Export Policy will remain in place until 2026 and will be phased out gradually by 2030, he added.</p>
<p>The PM‚Äôs special assistant noted that the policy was developed through consultations with over 60 experts, institutions and industry stakeholders, guided by a steering committee under the Ministry of Industries and Production since September 2024.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The committee will hold monthly and quarterly review meetings, while the auditor general of Pakistan will conduct a performance audit every six months.</p>
<p>He stressed that the NEV Policy 2025-30 is not only an environmental revolution but also a foundation for industrial growth, local employment, energy efficiency and technological self-reliance in the country.</p>
<p>The policy is expected to yield savings of around Rs800bn over the next 24-25 years through reduced fuel imports, the use of cheap electricity and revenue from carbon credits. Charging vehicles with electricity will also reduce capacity payments from Rs174bn to Rs105bn, and carbon credits could generate around Rs15bn in revenue.</p>
<p>The country‚Äôs total energy demand for EVs over the next five years is projected at 126 terawatt-hours, which can be met using the existing surplus in the national grid.</p>
<p>He added that an electric rickshaw or bike user is expected to recover their initial investment within a year and 10 months due to the low cost of charging compared to petrol.</p>
<p>For instance, if the additional cost of an electric bike is Rs150,000, this can be recouped within less than two years through fuel savings.</p>
<p>Mr Khan concluded by saying that the government has also provided exemptions on customs duties and sales tax on EV parts to support the local industry.</p>
