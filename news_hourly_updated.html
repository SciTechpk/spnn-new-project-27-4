                <h2>Assistant commissioner among 5 killed in Bajaur blast</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least five people, including an assistant commissioner, were killed and 11 others injured on Wednesday in a bomb explosion in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Bajaur district.</p>
<p>Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafique told <em>Dawn.com</em> that five people, including two policemen and a civilian, were killed in the explosion targeting a government vehicle on Nawagai Road in Siddiqabad railway attack area of Khar tehsil.</p>

                <h2>PSX scales 130,000 barrier as market climbs by 2,100 points</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Bulls continued their reign over the trading floor at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday as shares scaled the 130,000-point barrier to reach a new high after climbing by 2,100 points.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index opened on a positive note, rising by 1,430.07 points (1.12 per cent) to reach 129,629.49 points at 10:07am, from the previous close of 128,199.42 points.</p>
<p>Shares then rose further to reach 130,344.03 points at close, gaining 2,144.61 points (1.67pc) from yesterday.</p>
<p>The PSX extended its record-breaking <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920553">rally</a> for the fourth consecutive session today, which analysts <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921539">attributed</a> to easing inflation and signs of macroeconomic stability.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, said the increase in tax rate on income from debt securities, along with a change in the taxation structure for mutual funds to proportionate holdings of equities and fixed income, has resulted in inflows to equities from fixed income.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSignificant reduction in inflation rate ‚Äî fell to a low of nine years ‚Äî with improved outlook has increased the odds for further reduction in policy rate, which will help in continuation of flows towards equities,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The annual inflation rate has dropped sharply to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921571/inflation-slumps-to-9-year-low-at-449pc">nine-year low</a> of 4.49pc during the fiscal year 2024-25 from 23.41pc in the previous year. Pakistan is currently experiencing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902445">disinflation</a>, which reflects a slowdown in the rate of inflation, as opposed to deflation, which indicates a general decline in overall price levels.</p>
<p>Optimism around fiscal reforms announced in the federal budget also contributed to the rally.</p>
<p>‚ÄúContinuation of monetary easing due to falling inflation driven by fiscal discipline, strong external account and focus on structural reforms would keep equities in the limelight,‚Äù Ashraf said a day ago.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921539#:~:text=Prime%20Minister%20Shehbaz%20Sharif%20expressed%20gratitude">statement</a>, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif asserted the KSE-100‚Äôs record close reflected growing confidence in the government‚Äôs economic policies. He described the index‚Äôs performance as a testament to the strengthening and stabilising sentiment surrounding the national economy.</p></p>
