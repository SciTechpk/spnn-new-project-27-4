            <p><p>At least two people were killed while 15 others were injured in a bomb blast targeting a police vehicle in the Wana tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lower South Waziristan district on Thursday, police said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">surge</a> in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">broke</a> a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.</p>
<p>“The blast was caused by a remote-controlled explosive device planted near a police vehicle [in the Rustam Bazaar],” Deputy Superintendent of Police Imranullah was quoted as saying by the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/domestic/blast-in-wana-bazaar-claims-two-lives-injures-14-including-cops/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em></a>.</p>
<p>According to a list of casualties issued by South Waziristan police spokesperson Anayat Khan, two men lost their lives, while 15 others, including two police constables, were injured in the blast today.</p>
<p>The wounded policemen were identified as Zubair Salaam Khan from the district’s Dabkot area and Fareedun Zubair from Birmal tehsil. An unknown person was listed as seriously injured out of those hurt.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Lower South Waziristan’s District Police Officer (DPO) Tahir Khan had earlier told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “The wounded were immediately taken to the Wana District Headquarters Hospital.”</p>
<p>Security forces cordoned off the area after the blast and initiated a search operation to trace the perpetrators, DPO Khan added.</p>
<p>Investigation was also underway to determine the nature of the bomb used, the officer noted.</p>
<p>The incident follows residents’ complaints of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929167/action-sought-against-armed-men-roaming-wana-bazaar">open display of firearms</a> and the free movement of armed men in Wana’s Rustam Bazaar, an important commercial hub of Lower South Waziristan.</p>
<p>Sources said no one was allowed to roam Rustam Bazaar openly carrying weapons, and that strict measures would be implemented soon to curb the practice.</p>
<p>Pakistan witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928076/militant-attacks-see-slight-rise-in-july-says-think-tank">slight uptick</a> in militant violence in July, according to a report released by the think tank Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss). KP, including its tribal districts, remained the epicentre of militancy, accounting for 53 of the 82 attacks recorded nationwide.</p>
<p>A day ago, a police constable was among <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929116/2-injured-as-upper-south-waziristan-dcs-vehicle-comes-under-attack">two people injured</a> when Upper South Waziristan Deputy Commissioner Asmatullah Wazir’s vehicle came under attack in the district’s Ladha tehsil.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, four security personnel and a policeman were among <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929080">seven people martyred</a> in two separate firing incidents in KP’s Karak and Peshawar districts.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, unidentified attackers fired a rocket targeting a Scout camp in Wana. Although there were no reports of casualties or property damage, the explosion caused widespread fear and concern among residents.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, two militant commanders and the brother of a tribal elder were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928528/two-terrorists-elders-brother-killed-in-waziristan-clash">killed in a clash</a> between the banned TTP (Gul Bahadar group) and family members of elder Malik Ashiq Noor in the Dana area of Lower South Waziristan’s Birmal tehsil.</p>

<p>Separately, a cop was injured as police and civilians repulsed a late-night terrorist attack on the Khuni Khel police post in KP’s Bannu district.</p>
<p>“Police personnel responded strongly to the terrorist attack while showing bravery and determination,” Bannu DPO Saleem Abbas Kulachi said in a statement.</p>
<p>“A policeman got injured by the terrorists’ firing and was taken to a hospital,” the officer added, noting that residents also joined the police and took up positions against the attackers.</p>
<p>DPO Kulachi stressed that the residents’ courage further heightened the police’s courage. “The net around the terrorists is being tightened,” he asserted.</p>
<p>According to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/domestic/bravery-and-unity-police-civilians-repel-terrorist-attack-on-khuni-khel-checkpost/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">APP</a></em>, the assault was carried out using both light and heavy weaponry by terrorists from the outlawed TTP and Tehreek-i-Jihad Afghanistan (TTG), operating under the combined name Al-Ittihad al-Mujahideen.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a>, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773/3-terrorists-killed-during-joint-operation-in-kps-bannu-police">in July</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, a fire exchange following a terrorist attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu left a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928472">constable and three terrorists dead</a>, while three cops were injured.</p>
<p>Bannu has also seen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923850">multiple</a> quadcopter <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927953">attacks</a> over the past month, which the military says are carried out by the TTP.</p></p>

            <p><p>At least seven people were injured on Thursday after a fire at a factory in the Karachi Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) near Landhi caused part of a building to collapse, officials said, as rescue efforts were underway.</p>
<p>Fire incidents are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1873202">common</a> in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1872866/fire-erupts-in-high-rise-near-chundrigar-road">metropolis</a> due to the absence of adequate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1873091/fire-erupts-in-model-colony-warehouse-after-cylinder-blast">fire safety measures</a> in buildings.</p>
<p>“The injured were taken to a nearby hospital via Edhi ambulance,” Rescue 1122 said in a statement. “The fire, which began at a garment factory near the KEPZ, is still blazing with intense rescue efforts to curb it.”</p>

<p>At least four ambulances, six fire brigade trucks, and a snorkel reached the site of the incident along with fire and rescue teams upon receiving information of the incident, Rescue 1122 said.</p>
<p>Further investigation into the incident is underway.</p>
<p>A massive <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916181">fire</a> that broke out at a factory in KEPZ in June was brought under control after 36 hours. The blaze destroyed three factories completely and left five people injured, including four firefighters who sustained burns and injuries from falling debris, the officials said.</p>
<p>A similar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903361">incident</a> took place in April. No casualties were reported, but four people, including one firefighter, were affected by smoke inhalation, while 12 fire tenders worked for four hours to bring the fire under control.</p>

            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) maintained its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929082">record-setting spree</a> due to “strong” corporate results as it breached 146,000 points during intraday trade on Thursday.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 992.53 points (0.68 per cent) to reach an intraday high of 146,081.02 points at 12:37pm, from the previous close of 145,088.49 points.</p>
<p>However, the shares soon declined slightly, standing at 145,613.09 points at 3:09pm, gaining 524.60 points (0.36pc) from yesterday.</p>
<p>The market also witnessed fluctuations, reaching a low of 145,250.17 points at around 11am — still above yesterday’s close.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “Investor interest in companies posting strong corporate results or anticipated to report robust profitability has propelled the index to a new record high.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Additionally, the recent imposition of an additional 25pc tariff on India has further bolstered market sentiment,” he added, referring to the United States’ <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929119/trump-imposes-additional-25pc-tariff-on-indian-goods-relations-hit-new-low">recent levy</a> on New Delhi, which will raise duties on some Indian <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929293/india-exporters-say-50pc-trump-levy-severe-setback">exports</a> to as high as 50pc.</p>
<p>Commenting on the stock market’s future, Ashraf said: “We expect the KSE-100 to reach 165,215 [points] by December 25, supported by sustained earnings growth, declining fixed income yields, and a relatively stable rupee.”</p>
<p>Reacting yesterday to the PSX’s record-setting spree, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif asserted it was a “reflection of investors’ confidence in government policies”.</p>
