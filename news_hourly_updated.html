                <h2>FO rejects ‚Äòunfounded allegations‚Äô of involvement of Pakistani nationals in Russia-Ukraine conflict</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Tuesday rejected claims of Pakistani nationals being involved in the Ukraine conflict after a statement by Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
<p>Zelensky <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928754/pakistani-mercenaries-fighting-for-russia-claims-zelensky">claimed</a> on Monday that his troops in northeastern Ukraine were fighting foreign ‚Äúmercenaries‚Äù from various countries, including China, Pakistan and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/pakistan-rejects-baseless-and-unfounded-allegations-of-the-involvement-of-pakistani-nationals-in-the-conflict-in-ukraine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by the FO today said Pakistan ‚Äúcategorically rejects the baseless and unfounded allegations of the involvement of Pakistani nationals in the conflict in Ukraine‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo date, Pakistan has not been formally approached by the Ukrainian authorities, nor has any verifiable evidence been presented to substantiate such claims.‚Äù</p>
<p>The statement added that the government would take up this matter with the Ukrainian authorities, ‚Äúand seek clarification in this regard‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan reaffirms its commitment to the peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict through dialogue and diplomacy, in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter,‚Äù the statement said.</p>

<p>In a post on X on Monday, Zelensky said: ‚ÄúWe spoke with commanders about the frontline situation, the defence of Vovchansk, and the dynamics of the battles.</p>

<p>The Russia-Ukraine war began when President Vladimir Putin ordered the latter‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676939">invasion</a> on Feb 24, 2022.</p>
<p>The government has on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1737577">separate</a> occasions <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1776567">rebuffed</a> allegations that the country was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1789255/pakistan-signed-contracts-with-two-us-companies-for-arms-sales-to-ukraine-claims-bbc-report">providing arms</a> to Ukraine.</p>
<p>During a visit to Pakistan in July 2023, then-Ukra¬≠inian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1765927#:~:text=%E2%80%98No%20arms%20deal%20with%20Ukraine%E2%80%99">rejected</a> similar reports, clarifying that the two nations had no deals for the supply of arms and ammunition.</p>
<p>Initially taking a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1678013">neutral</a> stance on the matter and maintaining that in its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1839772">diplomatic moves</a> till last year, Pakistan has called for <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/foreign-correspondent/pakistan-calls-for-meaningful-dialogue-diplomacy-to-end-escalating-ukrainian-conflict/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">de-escalation</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926704">ceasefire</a> in recent months as the war crossed the three-year mark.</p>
<p>Pakistan has historically maintained good relations with Ukraine, having <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/134944/ukraine-stops-defence-sales-to-pakistan">purchased</a> weapons systems from it in the past, but has also been strengthening <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859729">ties with Russia</a> in recent years.</p></p>

                <h2>Youm-i-Istehsal: PM notes India‚Äôs occupation of Kashmir ‚Äòdefining conflict‚Äô in South Asia</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif termed India‚Äôs occupation of Kashmir the ‚Äúdefining conflict‚Äù of South Asia as Pakistan marked six years on Tuesday since New Delhi deprived the held region of its special autonomy.</p>
<p>Pakistan is observing Youm-i-Istehsal (Exploitation Day) today to mark the sixth anniversary of India revoking Kashmir‚Äôs special autonomy and to show solidarity with Kashmiris.</p>
<p>On Aug 5, 2019, India‚Äôs Narendra Modi-led government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1498227">stripped</a> the Muslim-majority territory of its special status by repealing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1763985">Article 370</a> of the constitution, splitting the former state into two territories directly ruled by New Delhi.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir remained the defining conflict of the South Asia region, and the driver of India‚Äôs continued rogue behaviour,‚Äù PM Shehbaz said in a statement.</p>
<p>The premier also recalled the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">India-Pakistan conflict</a>, noting: ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">unprovoked aggression</a> against Pakistan in May 2025, and its swift and comprehensive <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">military defeat</a> are only the latest evidence of the urgent need for the international community to ensure that the resolution of the Kashmir dispute becomes a global priority.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe will and aspirations of the Kashmiri people, in accordance with UN Security Council <a class="link--external" href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/111955/?ln=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resolutions</a>, are the only path forward,‚Äù he stressed.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz noted that a ‚Äújust resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was a key pillar of Pakistan‚Äôs foreign policy‚Äù.</p>
<p>The prime minister reiterated ‚Äústrongest condemnation‚Äù of India‚Äôs illegal and unilateral actions to alter the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898092">demographic structure</a> and political landscape of India-occupied Kashmir (IoK).</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He also flayed India‚Äôs efforts to silence genuine Kashmiri leaders as part of the ‚Äúwider hegemonic and extremist agenda‚Äù that informed its illegal occupation of the disputed region.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe imprisonment of Kashmiri leaders and activists, including <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1202138">Shabbir Ahmed Shah</a>, Muhammad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1869419">Yasin Malik</a> and Masarrat Alam Bhatt, will never dim the resolve of our Kashmiri sisters and brothers,‚Äù he asserted.</p>
<p>Urging the international community to play a role in halting human rights crimes in IoK and reversing the 2019 action, the premier reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúunflinching‚Äù stance, moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in his statement, President Asif Ali Zardari also referred to the recent conflict with India, emphasising that ‚Äúthis year‚Äôs ‚ÄòYoum-e-Istehsal‚Äô assumes greater significance‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile the resounding success of the ‚ÄòOperation Bunyanum Marsoos‚Äô is a matter of great pride for the people of Pakistan, the day also underscores the need for a settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people, for a lasting peace in South Asia,‚Äù the president said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

<p>He highlighted that Indian authorities had taken a number of steps, aimed at changing the IIOJK‚Äôs demographic structure and political landscape, during the last six years.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese measures include gerrymandering of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1688423">electoral constituencies</a>, allowing addition of non-Kashmiris to electoral rolls, issuance of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1577106">domicile certificates</a> to outsiders, granting more powers to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924441/opp-calls-for-held-kashmir-governor-to-step-down">lieutenant governor</a> in administrative matters, and introduction of <a href="https://">new laws</a> on ownership of land and property,‚Äù he noted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Kashmiri people are confronted with the danger of becoming a disempowered community in their own land. The genuine leadership of the Kashmiri people remains behind bars. The intimidation of innocent people, arbitrary detentions, and the so-called ‚Äòcordon and search‚Äô operations have become a matter of routine,‚Äù Zardari said.</p>
