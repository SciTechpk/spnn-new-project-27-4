                <h2>Nine terrorists killed in separate operations across KP: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Security forces killed nine terrorists ‚Äúsponsored‚Äù by India during a series of operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday, according to the military‚Äôs media wing.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), nine ‚ÄúIndian-sponsored <em>khawarij</em>‚Äù were killed in three separate engagements.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAn intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted by the security forces in Dera Ismail Khan district, on [the] reported presence of Indian sponsored <em>khwarij</em>,‚Äù the military‚Äôs media wing said, using the term designating terrorists affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.</p>
<p>During the engagement, security forces ‚Äúeffectively engaged the <em>khawarij</em> location and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian-sponsored <em>khawarij</em> were sent to hell‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to the statement, another IBO was conducted in Tank District and two more Indian-sponsored <em>khawarij</em> were ‚Äúsent to hell‚Äù by the security forces.</p>
<p>In the third operation in Khyber district‚Äôs Bagh area, ‚Äúown troops successfully neutralised three more Indian-sponsored khawarij‚Äù, the ISPR said.</p>
<p>The statement added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the dead terrorists, who were involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other <em>kharji</em> found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country,‚Äù the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005">12 terrorists</a> belonging to ‚ÄúIndian proxy‚Äù outfits were killed by security forces while two personnel were martyred in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the ISPR had said on Monday.</p>
<p>It added that intelligence-based operations (IBOs) were conducted on Saturday and Sunday against the TTP in KP and the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Front in Balochistan.</p>
<p>An IBO was conducted in Lakki Marwat district during which troops engaged the enemy at its location and sent ‚Äúfive Indian sponsored‚Äù terrorists to ‚Äúhell‚Äù, it said. In a second IBO in the Bannu district, two ‚ÄúIndian-sponsored‚Äù terrorists were ‚Äúsuccessfully neutralised‚Äù by the security forces.</p>
<p>It further said that terrorists ambushed a security forces convoy in another incident in North Waziristan district‚Äôs general area of Mir Ali, adding that two ‚ÄúIndian sponsored‚Äù terrorists were ‚Äúsent to hell‚Äù after the effective response of troops.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, during the intense fire exchange, two brave sons of the soil, Sepoy Farhad Ali Turi (age: 29 years, resident of Kurram district) and Lance Naik Sabir Afridi (age: 32 years, resident of Kohat district) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced martyrdom.‚Äù</p>
<p>Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">accused</a> India of activating its ‚Äúassets‚Äù to inte¬≠nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting ‚Äúirr¬≠e¬≠futable evidence‚Äù of Ind¬≠ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind¬≠ian military personnel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPost-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the <em>Fitnah-al-Khawarij</em> and the independent terrorist cells ‚Ä¶ to increase their activity,‚Äù he had said, using the state-designated term for the banned TTP.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>A significant improvement was seen in Pakistan‚Äôs internal security landscape in April 2025, ‚Äúas both militant attacks and resultant casualties dropped sharply compared to March‚Äù, according to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907799">data</a> released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS).</p>
<p>Pakistan ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p></p>

<p>According to a statement from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office, upon arrival at the Istanbul Airport, the prime minister was received by Turkish Minister for National Defence Yasar Guler, Governor Istanbul Davut Gul, President of Pakistan-Turkiye Cultural Association Burhan Kayaturk, Pakistan‚Äôs Ambassador to Turkiye Yousaf Junaid, Consul General Istanbul Nouman Aslam, senior officials of the Turkish government and Pakistani diplomats posted in Turkiye.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPM Shehbaz Sharif will meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan today,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúThe two leaders will discuss further expanding cooperation between Turkiye and Pakistan in diverse fields, including defence, economy, tourism and culture.‚Äù</p>
<p>The statement added that the purpose of the prime minister‚Äôs visit was to ‚Äúthank the people of Turkiye, particularly President Erdogan, for supporting Pakistan‚Äôs principled stand in the recent Pakistan-India tension.‚Äù</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Minister of Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant Tariq Fatemi also accompanied the premier.</p>
<p>This is the first leg of the premier‚Äôs four-nation visit aimed at strengthening ties with the friendly countries. Apart from Turkiye, he will also visit Iran, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan from May 25-30, according to the <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/curtain-raiser-prime-ministers-visit-to-turkiye-iran-azerbaijan-and-tajikistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Foreign Office</a>.</p>

<p>During the visit, PM Shehbaz will have ‚Äúwide-ranging discussions with the leaders of these countries on an entire range of issues covering bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance,‚Äù the Foreign Office said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe will also have the opportunity to express the deepest appreciation and acknowledgement for the support extended to Pakistan by the friendly countries during the recent crisis with India,‚Äù it noted.</p>
<p>Fahrettin Altun, Erdogan‚Äôs head of communications <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/fahrettinaltun/status/1926561438107107658" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on X</a> said, ‚ÄúDuring the meeting, bilateral relations, regional and international issues, including the fight against terrorism, will be discussed.‚Äù</p>
<p>Altun said ‚Äúvarious aspects of bilateral relations between Turkiye and Pakistan will be evaluated‚Äù, according to a Google translation of his post.</p>
<p>Joint steps taken within the scope of the Pakistan-Turkiye High Level Strategic Cooperation Council as per the two leaders‚Äô <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891812">last meeting</a> in February will be reviewed, the Turkish official said.</p>
<p>While in Tajikistan ‚Äî likely the last leg of his tour ‚Äî the premier will also attend the International Conference on Glaciers being held in its capital, Dushanbe, on May 29 and 30.</p>
<p>As tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi escalated, with India launching deadly strikes on Pakistan on May 6, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909193/erdogan-conveys-turkiyes-solidarity-to-pm-shehbaz-amid-india-escalation">conveyed his solidarity</a> to the prime minister and said it supported Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúcalm and restrained policies‚Äù.</p>
<p>Following the tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">airbase attacks</a> and a US-brokered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> between the two neighbours, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev had ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911194/azerbaijan-hails-pakistans-remarkable-success-during-recent-military-strife-with-india-pmo">warmly congratulated</a> PM Shehbaz upon Pakistan‚Äôs remarkable success‚Äù, according to the PM Office.</p>
<p>Iran had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">offered to mediate</a> during the escalation and paid a visit to both <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">Islamabad</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909355/irans-foreign-minister-repeats-call-for-restraint-in-india-pakistan-standoff">New Delhi</a> in peace efforts, which were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911597">appreciated</a> by PM Shehbaz and the military‚Äôs spokesperson.</p>

<p>The diplomatic support voiced by Turkiye and Azerbaijan stoked anger in India as people <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cancelled their holidays</a> in popular resorts in the two countries.</p>
<p>The moves <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911469">intensified</a> as Adani group-operated Mumbai and Ahmedabad airports ended the ground handling concession agreements with √áelebi, an Istanbul-headquartered airport.</p>
<p>Small Indian grocery shops and major online fashion retailers also began a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912015">boycott of Turkish products</a> ranging from chocolates, coffee, jams and cosmetics to clothing.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz‚Äôs tour adds to Pakistan‚Äôs spree of diplomatic engagement amid tensions with New Delhi.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Dar held a telephonic conversation with Uzbekistan Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov, where views were ‚Äúexchanged on current regional situation‚Äù.</p>
<p>The two leaders discussed existing bilateral relations, particularly the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894417/pakistan-and-uzbekistan-agree-to-expand-bilateral-trade-to-2bn#:~:text=%E2%80%98Detailed%20negotiations%E2%80%99%20held%20on%20joint%20railway%20project">Railway Line Project</a>, the FO <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1926519844997927089" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>
