                <h2>4 terrorists killed in operation in Balochistan‚Äôs Kalat area: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Security forces killed four terrorists in an operation in the Kalat district of Balochistan, the military‚Äôs media wing said in a statement on Sunday.</p>
<p>There has been an increase in the frequency of attacks against security forces in Balochistan in recent times. Earlier this week, three people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924597">killed</a> and seven others were injured as a passenger bus was fired upon in Kalat.</p>
<p>The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) stated that the intelligence-based operation took place on the night of July 19-20, upon the ‚Äúreported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, <em>Fitna al Hindustan</em>‚Äù.</p>
<p>In May this year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525#:~:text=The%20government%20has%20designated%20all%20terrorist%20organisations%20in%20Balochistan%20as%20Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan,%20state%20media%20PTV%20News%20reported.">designated</a> all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna-Al-Hindu¬≠stan</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring the conduct of [the] operation, [our] own forces effectively engaged the terrorists‚Äô location, and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>According to the ISPR, weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from the dead terrorists, who were actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvnews/urdunewsdetail/10614" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PTV News</a></em> reported that security forces seized a <em>Fitna Al Hindustan</em> flag as well.</p>
<p>‚Äú[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation‚Äôs unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,‚Äù the statement concluded.</p>
<p>On Saturday, a senior officer belonging to the security forces was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925314/security-official-martyred-in-quetta-blast">martyred</a> in a bomb attack at the Western Bypass area, according to officials.</p>
<p>Police said a magnetic explosive device was attached to the officer‚Äôs vehicle, which exploded in the Jabl-i-Noor area, a locality on the outskirts of Quetta.</p>
<p>CCTV footage from a nearby camera showed a motorcyclist passing close to the vehicle moments before the explosion. He reportedly attached the explosive device to the driver‚Äôs side door. A few seconds later, the blast took place.</p>
<p>Pakistan ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents.</p></p>

                <h2>6 killed, 12 injured as bus overturns in Sindh‚Äôs Thatta: rescue service</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least six people were killed and 12 others were injured when a bus overturned and fell into a ditch near Makli in Sindh‚Äôs Thatta district on Sunday morning, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>According to the Edhi rescue service, the bus overturned near the Thatta Bypass, following which a rescue team reached the site of the incident and transported the injured to a hospital.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe bodies of the six victims were initially taken to a mortuary in Orangi Town,‚Äù the service said in a statement, adding that they were later transported to Edhi‚Äôs morgue in Karachi‚Äôs Sohrab Goth.</p>
<p>The bus was carrying a group of picnickers from Karachi to Keenjhar Lake when it overturned while taking a sharp turn, killing six passengers and injuring dozens others, state-owned <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLocal authorities and rescue teams were quick to respond, reaching the crash site within minutes. The injured were rushed to Karachi hospitals, with several reported to be in critical condition,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>In another incident, at least one person was killed and several others, including women and children, were critically injured when a passenger bus overturned on the Gambat National Highway in Sindh‚Äôs Khairpur district.</p>
<p>According to <em>APP</em>, the incident took place while the bus was en route from Karachi to Swabi. Rescue teams, along with local police, reached the incident site and rushed the injured to nearby hospitals for medical aid.</p>

<p>Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah expressed deep sorrow over the loss of lives in the bus accidents, according to a statement issued by his spokesperson Abdul Rashid Channa.</p>
<p>Expressing sympathy with the Makli incident victims, he issued directives to the Thatta deputy commissioner (DC) to ensure the provision of immediate medical assistance to the injured. The chief minister further told him to immediately contact their families and fully cooperate.</p>
<p>Expressing sorrow over the Khairpur coach accident, CM Murad issued similar instructions to the Khairpur DC to ensure medical treatment of the wounded. He urged people to drive carefully to protect precious lives.</p>
<p>Accidents are common on highways and motorways across Pakistan, caused by reckless driving, speeding, driver fatigue, and poor vehicle maintenance. Poor road conditions contribute to mishaps, while weak enforcement of traffic laws allows violations to go unchecked, worsening the situation.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, four people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924364">lost</a> their lives and another six were injured ‚Äî all from the same family ‚Äî after their speeding car crashed into a wall next to a drain on Hawkes‚Äô Bay Road in Karachi‚Äôs Mauripur area.</p>
<p>South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said the family was returning from the Hawke‚Äôs Bay beach, and the accident most likely happened as a result of speeding.</p>
<p>In an incident on July 15, a collision between a trailer and a truck left one dead and three injured near Karachi‚Äôs New Sabzi Mandi on the Super Highway.</p>
<p>On June 19, a speeding dumper truck overturned on a 4x4 vehicle on Rashid Minhas Road, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918288">killing</a> a woman and an accompanying five-year-old girl.</p>
<p>On June 11, a young man was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916541">killed</a> and his wife injured in an accident after an unknown vehicle hit their bike on the Super Highway. The same day, two boys were killed after a water tanker hit them near Abdullah College in North Nazimabad.</p></p>
