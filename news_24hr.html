            <p><p>India will never restore the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Islamabad, and the water flowing to Pakistan will be diverted for internal use, Home Minister Amit Shah said in an interview with <em>Times of India</em> on Saturday.</p>
<p>Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">unilaterally suspended</a> its participation in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">1960 IWT</a>, which governs the usage of the Indus river system, on April 23, shortly after 26 civilians were killed in India-held Kashmir. Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack. The latter has denied the allegations and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe.</a></p>
<p>The accord remains dormant despite a ceasefire agreed upon by the two nuclear-armed neighbours last month following their worst fighting in decades.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned India’s unilateral suspension of the IWT, describing it as a “blatant violation and act of water aggression”, and warned that Pakistan would give a befitting response in line with decisions made at the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting held on April 24.</p>
<p>“No, it will never be restored,” Shah told the daily.</p>
<p>“We will take water that was flowing to Pakistan to Rajasthan by constructing a canal. Pakistan will be starved of water that it has been getting unjustifiably,” Shah said, referring to the northwestern Indian state.</p>
<p>The latest comments from Shah, the most powerful cabinet minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet, reveal Delhi’s intentions as Islamabad’s hopes for negotiations on the treaty in the near term.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Last month, <em>Reuters</em> reported that India plans to dramatically increase the water it draws from a major river that feeds Pakistani farms downstream, as part of retaliatory action.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Pakistan’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to <em>Reuters</em>’ request for comments.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>But it has said in the past that the treaty has no provision for one side to unilaterally pull back, and that any blocking of river water flowing to Pakistan will be considered “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">an act of war</a>”.</p>
<p>Islamabad is also exploring a legal challenge to India’s decision to hold the treaty in abeyance under international law.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#held-kashmirs-cm-opposes-diverting-waters-to-other-states" id="held-kashmirs-cm-opposes-diverting-waters-to-other-states" title="Permalink"></a>Held Kashmir’s CM opposes diverting waters to other states</h2>
<p>Indian-held Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Friday opposed diverting the state’s waters to Punjab and other neighbouring states now that the IWT with Pakistan stands suspended, asking why they should get more water when they already have three rivers while parts of the Union Territory are facing an acute water shortage, India’s  <em>Telegraph</em> reported.</p>
<p>“Nobody will take it. At least I will not allow it as of now. First allow us to use our water, then we will talk about others. There is a drought-like situation in Jammu. There is no water in taps,” Abdullah told reporters.</p>
<p>Abdullah was reacting to the purported central government move to conduct a feasibility study for constructing a 113km-long canal to direct the surplus flow from the three western rivers of the Indus water system, the report said.</p>
<p>“Why should I take water to Punjab? There are already three rivers with Punjab (and the other two states) under the Indus Waters Treaty. Did they give us water when we needed it?” he was quoted as having said.</p>
<p>Omar referred to Punjab’s purported refusal to share water during disputes over the Ujh multipurpose project and the Shahpur Kandi barrage in Jammu in the past. “We were in dire straits then but they kept us waiting for years…. After years, some work was done on the Shahpur Kandi barrage,” he said.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Pakistan hockey team will face off against New Zealand today in the final of the FIH Nations Cup in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</p>
<p>The match will begin at 6pm. New Zealand had reached the final after edging Korea in a shootout in the other semi-final.</p>

<p>In a pulsating <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918646/pakistan-edge-france-in-thriller-to-reach-nations-cup-final">semi-final clash</a> at the National Hockey Stad­ium, Pakistan had staged a stunning comeback a day ago and overcame France 3-2 on penalties to book their place in the final.</p>
<p>The victory not only marked Pakistan’s entry into their second consecutive Nations Cup final but also kept alive their hopes of qualifying for the prestigious FIH Men’s Pro League for the first time.</p>
<p>It was a match that saw the Green Shirts display a blend of youthful flair, tactical discipline and mental resilience. Down 2-0 midway through the third quarter, Pakistan clawed their way back into the contest through a sequence of brilliantly orchestrated goals, eventually forcing a shootout after a 3-3 deadlock in regulation time.</p>
<p>“We were ready for this win for a long time,” Player of the Match Rana Waheed had said after the final whistle. “Everything we have — we gave everything. [We are] thankful to Allah Almighty for helping us. We are really proud of the team and looking forward to the finals now.”</p>
<p>The win over France was especially significant, given Pakistan’s dramatic journey to the semi-finals. Despite a 4-3 defeat to New Zealand in their final group game — in which they had led 3-1 — Pakistan advanced ahead of hosts Malaysia on goal difference. Both teams had ended with four points, but Pakistan’s tally of nine goals edged Malaysia’s eight.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s Nations Cup campaign had begun with a thrilling 3-3 draw against Malaysia, followed by a convincing 5-2 victory over Japan. Although they faltered against New Zealand, they did enough across their group matches to qualify for the knockouts.</p>
<p>The team’s resurgence comes amid growing optimism in Pakistan’s hockey circles. With a young core and renewed focus on grassroots development, the Green Shirts are aiming to restore some of the lost glory associated with the sport that once made them global champions.</p>
<p>Friday’s win not only reaffirmed Pakistan’s promise but also put them within one win of rejoining the FIH Pro League — a competition featuring the world’s top national teams.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918704/govt-appoints-naveed-asghar-as-acting-wapda-chairman' target='_blank'><strong>Govt appoints Naveed Asghar as acting Wapda chairman</strong></a>
            <p><p>Naveed Asghar Chaudhry has been appointed to the position of acting chairman of the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), according to a notification issued by the Ministry of Water Resources on Saturday.</p>
<p>The appointment of Asghar follows the resignation of retired Lieutenant General Sajjad Ghani earlier in the day. Ghani served in the role for almost three years before stepping down.</p>
<p>Asghar previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1688680/wapda-chairman-charge">served</a> as the interim Wapda chairman in 2022 after retired Lt Gen Muzammil Hussain resigned due to “personal reasons”. He then <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1704577">passed the role</a> to retired Lt Gen Ghani three months later.</p>
<p>He will now serve again as Wapda chairman “for a period of three months or until the appointment of [a] regular chairman […] with immediate effect and until further orders”, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Asghar will take on the position in addition to his current role as Wapda’s Member (Finance) under the Water Resources Division.</p>
<p>Asghar previously accompanied Ghani as he visited the sites of major projects during his time as chairman, such as the construction of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1733578">Mohmand Dam</a> on the River Swat.</p>
<p>In May, Ghani <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909425">visited</a> the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project — located approximately 41km from Muzaffarabad — after the dam site was damaged in Indian attacks a day earlier.</p>
<p>He strongly condemned the attack, saying, “International laws, including the Geneva Convention, do not allow attacking water structures even during a full-scale war.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Also in May, he persuaded the participants of a jirga to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911352">call off</a> a two-week sit-in, assuring them that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had constituted a committee to address the concerns of families whose land had been acquired for the Dasu hydropower project.</p>
<p>Dasu residents also staged protests in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894050">February</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906583/dasu-dam-hit-families-demonstrate-to-demand-land-payments">April</a> this year, presenting various demands, including the immediate release of payments under a relocation package</p>
<p>In April, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904488">highlighted</a> glaring inefficiencies and massive financial mismanagement in key national hydropower projects, in particular the Dasu Hydropower Project and the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project.</p>
<p>The next month, Ghani <a class="link--external" href="https://%20https://www.dawn.com/news/1914256" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed</a> that a number of key targets in the Greater Karachi Bulk Water Supply Scheme, better known as the K-IV Project, had been achieved.</p>
<p>Underlining the importance of the K-IV Project for Karachi, which was formally launched in 2011, he had directed the project team to accelerate construction activities to meet the deadlines.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>However, the project immediately faced a new <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916618">setback</a> this month, as the federal government has allocated only Rs3.2 billion in the budget against the required amount of Rs40bn for the scheme, sparking fears that the city may have to wait for “another 10 years” or more for the completion of the plan.</p></p>

Many Zambians have raised the issue of this looting for years, but have met coordinated resistance. Consequently, Zambia’s treasury loses billions of dollars in revenue. These losses are driven by well-known multinationals working in concert with certain insiders close&nbsp;to the Zambian state.</p><p>Your editorial also says: “The US decision to cut $50m a year in aid to Zambia … is dreadful, and the reason given, corruption, rings hollow.” Alas, I disagree and wish to place this in context.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/ordinary-zambians-lose-out-twice-to-global-looting-and-local-corruption">Continue reading...</a></p>
