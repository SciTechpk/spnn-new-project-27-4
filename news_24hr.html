            <p><p>The PTI formally expelled its five members of the National Assembly (MNA) for voting in favour of the 26th Constitutional Amendment Bill last August, it emerged on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Constitution (Twenty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2024, also known as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866480/what-is-the-26th-constitutional-amendment">Constitutional Package</a>, is legislation that takes away the Supreme Court’s suo motu powers, sets the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowers the prime minister to appoint the next CJP from among the three most senior SC judges.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The party last October decided to take <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866814">legal action</a> against its lawmakers, who had voted in favour of the 26th Constitutional Amendment in violation of the party’s policy.</p>
<p>Expulsion notices — dated July 12 and available with <em>Dawn.com</em> — were issued to MNAs Aurangzeb Khan Khichi (NA-159, Vehari IV), Muhammad Ilyas Choudhry (NA-62, Gujrat I), Usman Ali (NA-142, Sahiwal II), Mubarak Zeb Khan (NA-8, Bajaur), and Zahoor Hussain Qureshi (NA-146, Khanewal III).</p>
<p>“[During] the PTI … parliamentary party meeting held on September 2, 2024 [in] Islamabad, … it was unanimously resolved that [the] PTI parliamentary party will not support the proposed amendments [to] the Constitution and will oppose the bill when it is moved in the National Assembly or is put to voting at any stage,” the notice read.</p>
<p>“You voted in favour of the bill and, therefore, you violated the directions and instructions of the PTI parliamentary party [that] were binding on you as a parliamentarian especially when you had won the election with support of [the] PTI and had taken oath that you would follow instructions of [the] PTI and that you would stand loyal to the party.”</p>
<p>The document recalled that show-cause notices were issued to the five MNAs in November to prove that they had not “defected” from the party, but they did not respond. Moreover, personal hearings were held for the MNAs, but they did not offer any explanation or defence, the notice read.</p>
<p>Two of the notices, addressed to Khichi and Mubarak Zeb, noted that they had defected and joined the PML-N. The remaining three notices took note of the fact that the recipients were sitting on treasury benches and “attended meetings of that [ruling] party”.</p>
<p>“Thus, you having voted in favour of the 26th Constitutional (Amendment) Act, 2024, have violated the party’s instructions and directions which were binding on you,” the notice read.</p>
<p>“Therefore, you are hereby declared to have violated your commitment, oath and loyalty to the party. You have acted contrary to the instructions of the party … and joined another parliamentary party in the National Assembly. You are therefore expelled from the party (PTI) forthwith. Needless to add that you also stand disqualified on account of aforesaid conduct.”</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923927/imf-representative-hails-pakistans-strong-economic-reform-progress' target='_blank'><strong>IMF representative hails Pakistan’s ‘strong’ economic reform progress</strong></a>
            <p><p>An International Monetary Fund (IMF) representative hailed Pakistan’s “strong” economic reforms carried out under the lender’s $7 billion loan programme, the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Pakis­tan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845536">secured</a> a three-year aid package deal in July 2024. The programme, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860850">approved</a> by the IMF two months later, is set to allow the country to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”.</p>
<p>IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan Mahir Binici noted that the country’s performance under the 2024 Extended Fund Facility (EFF) had been “strong so far”, according to a press release issued by the SDPI on its guest lecture in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Binici termed the EFF’s successful <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913147/pakistan-imf-agree-on-budget-blueprint">first review</a> — also encompassing agreement on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292">federal budget</a> blueprint — by the IMF Executive Board in May as a key milestone.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>He stressed that structural reforms remained central to Pakistan’s long-term economic sustainability, particularly reforms that strengthen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910790">tax equity</a>, improve the business climate and encourage <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916455">private-sector-led investment</a>.</p>
<p>Addressing economists, researchers and policy experts, the SDPI statement said, Banici reaffirmed the Fund’s continued support for the country’s economic and climate reform agenda.</p>
<p>In March, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900322">unlocked</a> a new $1.3 billion arrangement with the IMF under its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893193#:~:text=The%20country%20had%20requested%20%241bn%20from%20IMF%E2%80%99s%20Resilience%20and%20Sustainability%20Trust%20(RSF)%20in%20October">Resilience and Sustainability Facility</a> (RSF) to build resilience against climate catastrophes through adaptation.</p>
<p>Binici noted that the RSF was designed to help countries like Pakistan bolster resilience to climate-related vulnerabilities and meet international climate commitments, the SDPI press release said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The IMF official mentioned that the key areas of reform under the RSF included enhancing public investment planning, promoting efficient and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894835">sustainable use</a> of water resources, improving institutional coordination for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893742">disaster preparedness</a> and financing, along with expanding the availability and transparency of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1890593">climate-related data</a>.</p>
<p>Binici stressed that “support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory”.</p>
<p>The IMF official also shed light on the evolving economic landscape across the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) region and Pakistan. He stated that growth across the Mena region, as well as in Pakistan, was expected to strengthen in 2025 and beyond.</p>
<p>However, he cautioned that “elevated trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation and weakening global cooperation continue to generate exceptional uncertainty and weigh on the global economic outlook”, underscoring the urgent need for prudent and forward-looking policy actions.</p>
<p>SDPI Executive Director Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri welcomed the IMF representative’s outreach, noting the importance of informed economic dialogue and multilateral cooperation in Pakistan’s journey toward sustainable development.</p>
<p>The lecture concluded with an interactive discussion on fiscal and monetary policy frameworks, external buffers and the role of international institutions in fostering inclusive growth, the statement added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The IMF had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898053">praised</a> Pakistan’s implementation of the $7bn EFF as strong in March after both concluded the programme’s first biannual review on a positive note.</p>
<p>In May, an official said the IMF Executive Board found that Pakistan had “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912850">met all of the targets</a>” under the package and made progress on some of the reforms.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923961/sinner-downs-alcaraz-to-win-first-wimbledon' target='_blank'><strong>Sinner downs Alcaraz to win first Wimbledon</strong></a>
            <p><p>Jannik Sinner downed defending champion Carlos Alcaraz 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 on Sunday to win his first Wimbledon title, gaining sweet revenge for his painful <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916052">defeat</a> in the French Open final.</p>
<p>The world number one is the first Italian to win at the All England Club and now has four Grand Slams to his name at the age of 23.</p>
<p>The tennis world has been captivated by the emergence of the new rivalry to follow the storied “Big Three” era of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.</p>
<p>Sinner and two-time <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845803">defending</a> Wimbledon champion Alcaraz have now shared the past seven Grand Slam titles between them, with the Italian winning four of those.</p>
<p>Defeat in Paris last month was a bitter blow for Sinner, who led by two sets and squandered three match points in the final.</p>
<p>Prior to Sunday’s victory, he had lost five consecutive times against Alcaraz, including the final of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908725">Italian Open</a> in the first tournament he played after returning from a three-month <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892248">doping ban</a>.</p>
<p>But this time, he turned the tables in impressive fashion.</p>
<p>Both players were solid on serve until the fifth game, when Alcaraz sprayed a forehand long to hand Sinner the first break of the match.</p>
<p>But the Spaniard levelled at 4-4 to the delight of the Centre Court crowd, which included Prince William and his wife Catherine, Princess of Wales.</p>
<p>Sinner double-faulted to hand Alcaraz a second set point.</p>
<p>The Italian laced a searing forehand down the line, but Alcaraz produced a magical backhand winner, pointing his finger to his ear as the crowd rose to their feet.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#momentum-shift" id="momentum-shift" title="Permalink"></a>Momentum shift</h2>
<p>Sinner, still wearing a protective white sleeve after his nasty fall in his fourth-round match against Grigor Dimitrov, broke in the first game of the second set and led 3-1 after play was briefly halted by a flying cork.</p>
<p>Sinner shook his racket after winning the first point as he served for the set and was rewarded with cheers before levelling the match with a whipped forehand.</p>
<p>The third set was a tense affair that went with serve until the ninth game when Sinner broke as Alcaraz slipped over on the baseline, and he went 2-1 up.</p>
<p>The momentum was now all with Sinner and he broke again in the third game of the fourth set to take the match by the scruff of the neck.</p>
<p>The chance was always there that Alcaraz would produce the magic he found at Roland Garros, but Sinner stayed ice-cool.</p>
<p>The Spaniard had two break points to hit back in the eighth game, but Sinner shut the door impressively.</p>
<p>Sinner stepped up to serve for the championship amid a cacophony of noise, staying focused to seal the deal on his second championship point.</p>
<p>The Italian cruised through the first three rounds at Wimbledon, losing just 17 games — equalling an Open era record set in 1972. But he got lucky in the fourth round against inspired Bulgarian 19th seed Dimitrov, who was leading by two sets when he suffered an injury that forced him to quit.</p>
<p>Sinner got back into the groove against 10th seed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923148/sinner-powers-into-wimbledon-semi-finals-to-ease-injury-fears">Ben Shelton</a> in the quarter-finals before demolishing seven-time champion Djokovic in the last four.</p>
<p>Alcaraz had been aiming to become just the fifth man in the Open era to win three consecutive Wimbledons after Bjorn Borg, Pete Sampras, Federer and Djokovic.</p></p>
