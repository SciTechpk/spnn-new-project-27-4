            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914758/jui-fs-fazl-assails-child-marriage-law-announces-protest-rallies-across-country' target='_blank'><strong>JUI-F’s Fazl assails child marriage law, announces protest rallies across country</strong></a>
            <p><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday rejected the recently enacted Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Act 2025, announcing nationwide protest rallies aimed at “creating awareness” among the public.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911451">bill</a>, which sought to protect the rights of children and eventually eradicate marriages of children under the age of 18 in Islamabad, was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914268/president-zardari-signs-bill-to-curb-child-marriage-into-law">signed into law</a> by the president on May 27 after sailing through both houses of parliament.</p>
<p>However, the move attracted <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913987">strong opposition</a> from religious segments of society, with the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) — a constitutional body responsible for giving legal advice on Islamic issues to the government and the Parliament — ruling that “classifying marriage under the age of 18 as rape did not conform with Islamic law.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Addressing a press conference in Peshawar today, the JUI-F chief rejected the law, alleging that it “made fornication easier while making legitimate marriages difficult”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is a strange country — during the time of General Musharraf, a constitutional amendment was passed in the name of women’s rights that decriminalised sexual intercourse outside of marriage,” Fazl said. “It took it out of the realm of sin.</p>
<p>“Now, they are trying to ban the marriage of people under 18. The CII has already rejected this and all ulemas and their parties have agreed that it contradicts the Quran and sunnah,” he added, lamenting that despite constitutional guarantees, the Constitution was “being trampled”.</p>
<p>Announcing that the JUI-F would “take steps” to protest the legislation, Fazl announced a series of rallies and a large conference in Hazara Division in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on June 29.</p>
<p>“We will stage rallies, but they won’t focus on one subject, like Al-Aqsa Mosque,” the party chief explained. “Now, we will host rallies to create awareness about national sovereignty and Islamic governance.”</p>
<p>He added, “God willing, we will present our stance to the world freely. Islam is a faith that moves with the world and can be beneficial.”</p>
<p>Underage marriages are practised in some parts of the country, most commonly in rural areas, driven largely by poverty and limited access to education. According to a 2019 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1456915/21pc-girls-in-pakistan-become-victim-of-child-marriage-who-reports">World Health Organisation</a> report, about 21 per cent of girls in Pakistan were married before 18.</p>
<p>The same year, the Senate passed the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1479198">Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Bill, 2018</a> — a private member bill presented by PPP  Senator Sherry Rehman, proposing that the legal minimum age of marriage in the country be set at 18.</p>
<p>At that time, JUI-F had opposed the bill as well, calling it “contradictory to Islamic principles,” and suggesting that the bill should be sent to the CII before being discussed in the Senate. It was, however, not passed by the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Similarly, in 2021, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1630556">Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Marriage Restraint Bill, 2021</a> presented by PPP MPA Nighat Orakzai — aimed at banning marriages of people under the age of 18 — could not become law.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Sindh government had promulgated the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1112097">Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act 2013</a>.</p></p>

            <p><p>Acting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi on Sunday described the improvement of ties with Pakistan as a “very positive development in bilateral relations,” the Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, both nations <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912541/china-makes-taliban-regime-islamabad-agree-on-ties-upgrade">agreed</a> to upgrade their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912365">diplomatic relations</a> by exchanging envoys — a key step towards normalising ties after years of strained relations between Islamabad and the Taliban administration in Kabul.</p>
<p>Pakistan on Friday announced its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914300">elevation</a> of diplomatic representation in Afghanistan from Charge d’Affaires to Ambassador level, as bilateral ties “move on a positive trajectory.”</p>
<p>According to the statement, Muttaqi spoke to Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar over the phone and discussed upgrading diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>“Muttaqi called it a positive step and expressed hope that the remaining stages would be completed soon,” the statement said. “Both sides expressed that upgrading the level of diplomatic relations would pave the way for expanding cooperation in many areas.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Foreign Office (FO) said that Muttaqi welcomed Pakistan’s decision to upgrade its diplomatic relations to the Ambassador level and informed that Afghanistan has decided to follow suit.</p>
<p>“Both leaders also reviewed the implementation of decisions taken during DPM/FM’s visit to Kabul on 19 April 2025 and vowed to continue working together to establish mutual trust between the two brotherly nations,” the FO said in a statement.</p>
<p>It added that both nations agreed to “work closely” to swiftly finalise a framework agreement for the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line Project for regional connectivity.</p>
<p>Experts believe that the conversation between Dar and Muttaqi indicates that the two sides remain focused on increasing convergence and cooperation in their bilateral interactions.</p>
<p>“After a period of unprecedented friction in the relations for the past three years, the actions by both sides to upgrade diplomatic representation, releasing held goods of Afghan companies at Pakistani ports, addressing impediments in trade and transit and extension of CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) to Afghanistan are positive and forward-looking measures,” Pakistan’s former ambassador to Afghanistan, Mansoor Ahmad Khan, told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>He added that these decisions should be implemented to “strengthen bilateral relations and make progress for achieving regional connectivity with Central Asia and beyond”.</p>
<p>China has played a key role in the normalisation of relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Both nations made the announcements days after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated in a statement “to strengthen exchanges and diplomatic contacts late last month.</p>
<p>“Afghanistan and Pakistan expressed a clear willingness to elevate diplomatic relations and agreed in principle to exchange ambassadors as soon as possible,” he said after he hosted Dar and Muttaqi at an informal trilateral meeting in Beijing.</p>
<p>Pakistan-Afghanistan ties have been marred by deep mistrust, cross-border attacks, and sharp disagreements over the presence of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants operating from Afghan territory.</p>
<p>Islamabad has long <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904015">accused</a> Kabul of harbouring TTP fighters, who were blamed for a 70 per cent increase in attacks inside Pakistan in 2024.</p>

<p>Separately, Russia officially accepted Afghanistan’s nomination of an ambassador to Moscow, the Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday, as economic and political ties grow between the two sanction-hit nations.</p>
<p>Russia in April <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904942/">suspended</a> its ban on the Taliban, which it had designated for more than two decades as a terrorist organisation, in a move that paved the way for Moscow to normalise ties with the leadership of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“We hope this new phase will allow both countries to expand cooperation in various fields,” said Muttaqi in a statement.</p>
<p>Diplomats say formally presenting ambassadorial credentials to a foreign head of state signals a step towards recognition.</p></p>

            <p><p>Pakistan’s top military man General Sahir Shamshad Mirza has stressed the need to move towards conflict resolution instead of management, warning that its absence could result in a destructive escalation.</p>
<p>The remarks follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. As New Delhi launched <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> in early May, killing civilians, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downed five Indian jets</a> in retaliation. After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>Gen Mirza, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, made the remarks at the annual <a class="link--external" href="https://www.iiss.org/events/shangri-la-dialogue/shangri-la-dialogue-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shangri-La Dialogue 2025</a> organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore on Saturday evening.</p>
<p>During a panel discussion, titled “<a class="link--external" href="https://www.iiss.org/events/shangri-la-dialogue/shangri-la-dialogue-2025/special-sessions/special-session-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Regional Crisis-Management Mechanisms</a>”, Gen Mirza said: “It has become imperative to move beyond conflict management towards conflict resolution. This will ensure sustainable peace and an assured crisis management.”</p>
<p>He then stressed that an “early resolution of Kashmir [dispute] in line with the UN Security Council <a class="link--external" href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/111955/?ln=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resolutions</a> and as per the aspirations of the people is essential” for an enduring peace in South Asia.</p>
<p>The CJCSC cautioned: “Given the Indian policies and polities’ extremist mindset, the absence of a crisis management mechanism may not give enough time to the global powers to intervene and affect cessation of hostilities. They will be probably too late to avoid damage and destruction.”</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>During his address, Gen Mirza also highlighted the Kashmir dispute and the recent military clash between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>“When there is no crisis, Kashmir is never discussed, and as we always say that it is the Kashmir dispute resolution in line with the aspirations of the people of Kashmir and in line with the <a class="link--external" href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/111955/?ln=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UNSC resolutions</a> that will address many issues.</p>
<p>“The core that resides between Pakistan and India is Kashmir,” the CJCSC pointed out.</p>
<p>He added that unless countries did not “enter conflict resolution” — which he said could initially be through conflict management and then lead to resolution — issues would “always erupt”.</p>
<p>Other speakers on the panel included Canada’s Deputy Minister of National Defence Stefanie Beck and Fiji’s army chief Major Gen Jone Logavatu Kalouniwai. India’s Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan also addressed a separate <a class="link--external" href="https://www.iiss.org/events/shangri-la-dialogue/shangri-la-dialogue-2025/special-sessions/special-session-1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discussion</a> on defence innovation yesterday.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In an apparent reference to the Kashmir dispute, the CJCSC also noted: “Crisis prevention is better than crisis fighting. Suppressed disputes, whether territorial or ideological, cannot be indefinitely managed.”</p>
<p>Gen Mirza said the recent Pak-India escalation had underscored “how regional crisis management frameworks remain hostage to countries’ belligerence”, noting that the only line of contact between the two countries was the director general military operations <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911867">(DGMO) hotline</a>.</p>
<p>The top general further said that following the military conflict, the “threshold of an escalatory war has come dangerously low, implying greater risk on both sides, not just in the disputed territory but all of India and all of Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“Emboldening of India as a net security provider by the West and its ambition to become a regional hegemon is disincentivising it to engage in conflict management options,” CJCSC Mirza asserted.</p>
<p>He went on to state that Pakistan desired a “peaceful coexistence with India based on mutual respect, sovereign equality and most importantly, dignity and honour”.</p>
<p>“We seek a principal order, an order anchored in sovereign equality and restraint. In this, crisis management is not merely a set of tools but a strategic ethic,” he added.</p>
<p>The CJCSC stressed the need for Asia-Pacific and South Asia regions to re-energise and strengthen existing bilateral, regional and multilateral frameworks instead of chalking out new mechanisms. “States need to communicate more and more often and more effectively.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#conventional-warfare-threshold-now-dangerously-lower" id="conventional-warfare-threshold-now-dangerously-lower" title="Permalink"></a>‘Conventional warfare threshold now dangerously lower’</h2>
<p>During the IISS session, Gen Mirza also asserted that following the Pakistan-India military clash, the threshold of strategic stability had been lowered to “dangerous levels”.</p>
<p>He stated, “The threshold of what we say conventional warfare has significantly degraded.”</p>
<p>Gen Mirza pointed out that the 1965 and 1971 wars with India were “always confined to the disputed territory”. “[However,] this time, it has transcended that and come to the international border.”</p>
<p>The CJCSC highlighted: “Instead of targeting the borders first, which used to be the conventional domain or erstwhile domain, the cities have been targeted and the borders have relatively remained, if not silent, comfortable.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He noted that strategic stability hinged on conflict resolution, adding: “The lowering of this threshold to the dangerous levels, if next time such a conflict occurs and the cities are targeted first, […] there could be a chance — I’m not trying to create an alarm but I’m speaking based on logic — there could be a possibility that before the international community intervenes because of the restricted or constricted times window, the damage and destruction may have already taken place.”</p>
<p>On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi had launched a series of air strikes in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">Punjab</a> and Azad Kashmir, resulting in at least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910848">40 civilians</a> losing their lives with 121 others injured.</p>
<p>The military has confirmed that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910992">13 security personnel</a>, including members of the Pakistan Army and the Pakistan Air Force, were martyred while over 75 were injured during the confrontation with India.</p>
<p>Gen Mirza noted that by those attacks, India had “crossed the threshold of disputed territory into the international border”.</p>
<p>He recalled that India’s strikes on Pakistan “disturbed the deterrence stability”, which had to be restored while remaining within the conventional domain. However, he added, strategic stability was still disturbed.</p>
<p>Highlighting the absence of a crisis management mechanism, “jingoistic” role of Indian media and its leadership’s mindset, he said, “Had there been no third party mediation, it would have gone to the next levels.”</p>
<p>The top general mentioned the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">United States</a>, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as the “interlocutors”.</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#asia-pacific-direly-needs-organic-security-architecture" id="asia-pacific-direly-needs-organic-security-architecture" title="Permalink"></a>‘Asia-Pacific direly needs organic security architecture’</h2>
<p>Speaking on crisis management in Asia-Pacific, CJCSC Mirza termed it the “geopolitical cockpit of the 21st century”. “Its trajectories will shape the security architecture not only for this region but for the world.”</p>
<p>Offering eight observations, he stated that the crisis management debate in the Asia-Pacific must also focus on South Asia, adding that structures holding the modern state system were losing vitality.</p>
<p>He also called for institutionalised protocols, inclusion of key stakeholders and peaceful dispute resolution; highlighted the importance of communication; and stressed that emerging technologies compress the decision space.</p>
<p>“Misconception, narrative warfare and information distortion are the oxygen for escalation. We must disarm not only militarily but rhetorically,” Gen Mirza observed. “Power and interests, not morality or principles, now reign supreme.”</p>
<p>On the challenges faced by the Asia-Pacific, CJCSC Mirza made four observations, one being: “Asia-Pacific today appears to be descending into an extended era of great power contestation and strategic uncertainties.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He further pointed out that the Asia-Pacific direly needed an “institutional security architecture organic to the region itself”, which was missing as it had “largely been guided by extra-regional powers”.</p>
<p>On South Asia, the CJCSC remarked: “A looming threat of a global scale resides.</p>
<p>“South Asian strategic outlook is shaped by competing interests of the global power play, complicated <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911193">Iran-West relations</a>, perpetual instability in Afghanistan, India-Pakistan-China equation and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900227">unresolved Kashmir dispute</a> that remains at the core of India-Pakistan dyad, leading to regional instability in the geostrategic realm.”</p></p>
