                <h2>PM Shehbaz expresses satisfaction on ‚Äòcordial and productive‚Äô COAS-Trump meeting in call with Rubio</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday expressed satisfaction on the ‚Äúcordial and productive discussion‚Äù between US President Donald Trump and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir during a call with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p>
<p>The COAS, who visited Washington earlier this week, was invited to a luncheon at the White House and discussed joint counterterrorism efforts and expanding bilateral trade during a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093/trump-coas-munir-talk-counterterrorism-and-trade-in-cordial-meeting-ispr">‚Äúcordial‚Äù meeting</a> with Trump, the military‚Äôs media wing said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir met with Trump at the White House yesterday, becoming the first serving chief of army staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. The occasion also marked the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">first time</a> a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law.</p>
<p>According to state broadcaster <em><a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvworld/newsdetail/7701" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PTV News</a></em>, the PM‚Äôs conversation with Washington‚Äôs top diplomat was described as ‚Äúwarm and cordial‚Äù, with the discussion revolving around key bilateral and regional issues.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prime minister expressed satisfaction over the recent meeting between President Trump and ‚Ä¶ Field Marshal Asim Munir, in Washington, terming it productive and cordial,‚Äù the report read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prime minister conveyed his best wishes for US President Donald Trump, lauding his bold leadership and commending Secretary Rubio‚Äôs diplomatic efforts that facilitated a ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India,‚Äù <em>PTV News</em> reported. ‚ÄúHe emphasised that this understanding averted a potential catastrophe between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.‚Äù</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The PM was also quoted as saying that Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúpositive remarks‚Äù about Pakistan were encouraging for lasting peace in the region and reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs willingness to resolve disputes with India ‚Äî namely the Kashmir issue, the Indus Waters Treaty and counter-terrorism ‚Äî through dialogue.</p>
<p>Discussing security, PM Shehbaz reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs resolve to eliminate terrorism and counter groups such as the Balochistan Liberation Army and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecretary Rubio acknowledged Pakistan‚Äôs efforts in combating terrorism and assured full US cooperation in addressing these threats,‚Äù <em>PTV News</em> reported.</p>
<p>Additionally, PM Shehbaz underscored the need for Pakistan and the US to enhance collaboration in sectors including trade, investment, energy, mining, rare earth minerals and information technology.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBoth sides agreed that their discussions should now lead to concrete action across multiple areas of mutual interest. To further strengthen ties, the prime minister emphasised the importance of frequent high-level exchanges,‚Äù <em>PTV News</em> reported, adding that the PM extended an invitation to Trump and Rubio to visit Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecretary Rubio expressed appreciation for the call and reaffirmed the US‚Äôs commitment to enhancing cooperation with Pakistan,‚Äù <em>PTV News</em> said. ‚ÄúHe praised Pakistan‚Äôs adherence to the ceasefire with India and its continued efforts for peace in the region, especially given its close ties with Iran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRubio affirmed Washington‚Äôs intent to work closely with Islamabad to promote regional and global peace and stability.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pakistan has been steadily improving ties with the US.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said that Pakistan and the US will continue to strengthen their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917668/pakistan-us-agree-to-advance-talks-on-reciprocal-tariffs-aurangzeb">economic partnership</a> as both sides agreed to advance negotiations on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">reciprocal tariffs</a> through constructive engagement.</p>
<p>While speaking at an event in Islamabad, Aurangzeb said he had a constructive and positive conversation with the US Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick. He said that both countries are moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe government will stay the course of reforms in taxation, energy and other sectors,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have also carried out tariff reforms to move towards [a] competitive economy.‚Äù</p>
<p>In March, it was announced that Pakistan and the US would hold a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900767">counter-terrorism dialogue</a> in June.</p>
<p>This was agreed during a meeting between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and acting US Ambassador Natalie Baker. During the meeting, Pakistan-US relations, matters of mutual interest and bilateral cooperation were discussed in detail.</p>

<p>In his remarks on the recent conflict with India, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who was addressing a crowd in Karachi upon his return from a foreign diplomatic tour, said, ‚ÄúFor the first time in history, the leader of Pakistan‚Äôs army, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, has a meeting with Trump at the White House.‚Äù</p>
<p>Bilawal questioned India‚Äôs claims, saying, ‚ÄúIf Pakistan is ‚Äòterroristan‚Äô [and] involved in terrorism, then what is our military leader doing in Washington?‚Äù</p>
<p>He said, ‚ÄúWhat does the field marshal‚Äôs meeting at the White House signify then?‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúIs the general of a failed nation called there? No.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis highlights that India lost the war and Pakistan won the war. The talks were a congratulatory meeting,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúI consider this a success for Pakistan by the US.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>Child killed, 5 injured after suspected drone hits KP‚Äôs South Waziristan: police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A child was killed and five others were injured after a suspected drone hit Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs ‚ÄãSouth Waziristan District on Friday.</p>
<p>Wana Police Spokesperson Habib Islam told <em>Dawn.com</em>: ‚ÄúThe attack took place after 11am, as a result of which one child was killed while five people were injured.‚Äù</p>
<p>Makin Station House Officer Abdul Qadir Mehsud also confirmed the drone attack and told <em>Dawn.com</em> locals have set a date for June 23 to hold a jirga with the higher authorities regarding law and order, in which they have invited people belonging to every school of thought.</p>
<p>KP MPA Asif Khan Mehsood told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the alleged incident involved a drone which ‚Äútargeted school children,‚Äù although it was not known whether the drone was Pakistani or from another country.</p>
<p>PTI MNA Zubair Khan Wazir strongly condemned the incident. ‚ÄúTargeting innocent schoolchildren is a deeply distressing and unforgivable act,‚Äù he said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.facebook.com/wanians/posts/pfbid0ee9Vq8puVRBVAYseVtMn86gRLMb2kSPjwd8JF5MAqc1KWf8oEPRPSUoPjWTKJSyEl?__cft__%5B0%5D=AZWhgRwG5NIZJOKG-r9zCbMN9uh0hUskK2mg9FTjcBcARTIRMeeUX8uejp-QovUy3kIIthYsmWyTBkf59lMZDyOPwZoz4VQ_R0xnRmKSbOYe8_24xZVau0cEUOY_79tjrLgsGgNVpV8bvDjIuRZXhRhBnMpDUkKbuUtGxEClUwD6roaYo_lb0qsGqqKILZvCVxRDOV6cZpl3C9kv7XTuhlEM&amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on social media.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is a grave incident that warrants a thorough and impartial investigation so that the perpetrators are brought to justice.‚Äù</p>
<p>The incident was condemned by other politicians from the province as well, such as Afrasiab Khattak and Mohsin Dawar.</p>
<p>Last month, seven minors were among <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913695">22 people injured</a> in an alleged quadcopter strike in the Wana tehsil.</p>
<p>The incident came within a fortnight after a suspected quadcopter munitions drop claimed the lives of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912007/locals-stage-sit-in-as-kp-minister-denounces-killing-of-3-children-in-alleged-north-waziristan-drone-strike">four children and injured five others</a> in North Waziristan District‚Äôs Mir Ali tehsil. The military clarified that security forces were ‚Äúfalsely implicated‚Äù in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>Locals there staged a sit-in for over a week with the victims‚Äô bodies, demanding justice, before finally announcing on May 27 that they had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913645">ended their protest</a> after reaching an agreement with the local administration.</p>
<p>In March, at least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901160">11 people</a> were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, but officials said was an operation carried out against militants. According to locals, the deceased were civilians, including women and children, working as shepherds.</p>
<p>An alleged drone attack in the Konrai Raghzai area of Upper South Waziristan district <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860946">killed one person and injured three others</a> in September last year. While the local sources confirmed the drone attack, there was no official confirmation of the drone strike.</p></p>
