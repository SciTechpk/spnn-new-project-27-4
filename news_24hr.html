            <p><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday said that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910113/world-community-hails-ceasefire-decision-between-pakistan-and-india">ceasefire</a> between India and Pakistan was extended until May 18, adding that the matter will “ultimately go to dialogue” between the civilian leadership of the two nations.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">American intervention</a> for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>On Monday, the director general of military operations for both sides <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910567">held</a> the first round of talks via hotline after the ceasefire.</p>
<p>Speaking in the Senate today, FM Dar said that a military-to-military conversation took place between the two countries today, where they decided to extend the ceasefire until May 18.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, the matter will go to dialogue between the civilian leadership of the countries,” FM Dar said. “Right now, these are military-to-military communications.”</p>
<p>He said that a political dialogue would take place between the two countries and that a “resolution for all the problems will be discussed”.</p>
<p>“We have told the world that we will carry out a composite dialogue,” Dar said.</p>
<p>A day prior, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911132">invited</a> India to a comprehensive dialogue to address all contentious issues, including the Kashmir dispute and the water distribution, between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)</em>, Dar said that Pakistan did not request a ceasefire during the recent escalation with India.</p>
<p>Instead, it [ceasefire] was initiated following a call from the US Secretary of State, who conveyed that India was willing to halt hostilities, Dar said.</p>
<p>Dar emphasised that Pakistan had exercised restraint and communicated this to all friendly nations even before the outbreak of hostilities.</p>
<p>“We told our friends we would not initiate an attack, but we would certainly respond if provoked,” he said, adding that Pakistan’s response was measured, decisive, and in line with international norms.</p>

<p>Paying tribute to the bravery and proficiency of Pakistan Air Force (PAF) falcons for inflicting a crushing defeat on the enemy during the operation, the premier said the success has also strengthened the belief of our friends and supporters in us.</p>
<p>Addressing the PAF falcons during his visit to Kamra Airbase today, PM Shehbaz said the PAF falcons “blew away the enemy’s pride into dust in a matter of just a few hours”.</p>
<p>He said, “Our daring eagles have taught a lesson to the enemy that if it ever tries to engage in any misadventure again, it will be served a destructive blow.”</p>
<p>The prime minister vowed that the nation will never forget the sacrifices of those martyred during this unprovoked aggression of the enemy.</p>
<p>He said we will uphold the dignity of our martyrs’ sacrifices and will build a prosperous and great country.</p>
<p>Directing his address to India, the premier said while India’s war-fever is over, we are ready to talk with it for peace.</p>
<p>He said let us remind India of the conditions for peace foremost among which is ensuring the right to self-determination for Kashmiri people under UNSC resolutions.</p>
<p>The prime minister said India mocked itself globally by unjustifiably blaming Pakistan for the Pahalgam incident, while there are irrefutable pieces of evidence of India’s involvement in terrorist activities inside Pakistan.</p>

<p>Separately, the Senate passed a resolution paying tribute to the armed forces for demonstrating “unwavering resolve, unparalleled Professionalism, and steadfast dedication in the successful execution of Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos.”</p>
<p>The resolution, presented by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, said the operation was carried out with exceptional restraint and maturity, reflecting the conduct of a responsible nuclear state.</p>
<p>It congratulated the people of Pakistan for rising above all political, ethnic, and ideological divides and differences, demonstrating unity in support of national leadership across the political spectrum and speaking with one voice and one purpose to defend the people, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and dignity of the country.</p>
<p>It honoured the sacrifices of the valiant martyrs who laid down their lives in the defence of the sovereignty and national honour of the country.</p>
<p>It condemned “the brutal and unprovoked Indian attacks on innocent civilians, including women, children and mosques”.</p>
<p>It urged the government to proactively engage the international community for a peaceful, just and lasting resolution of the Indian-held Kashmir, stressing the critical importance of strict adherence to the Indus water treaty.</p></p>

            <p><p>Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Thursday warned in an interview with British broadcaster <em><a class="link--external" href="https://news.sky.com/story/pakistan-vows-swift-response-if-india-violates-ceasefire-13368060" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sky News</a></em> that any Indian ceasefire violation would be met with a “swift and assured response” by Pakistan, cautioning that serious escalation could result in mutual destruction.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>.

It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>On May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">announced</a> that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan. According to the government, forty civilians — including seven women and 15 children — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910733">lost</a> their lives in the Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Sky News</em>, DG ISPR warned that by rooting for war, India was carving out a “recipe for mutual destruction,” adding that the world now recognised the extent of the nuclear threat.</p>
<p>“Any sane player like the USA understands this absurdity and what the Indians are trying to do here,” Lt Gen Chaudhry told the publications.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Talking about India’s actions in Kashmir, he accused the country of trying to “internalise the issue and harassing” Kashmiri people with a heavy troop presence.</p>
<p>“It is a problem that has to be resolved by the people of Kashmir as per the United Nations Security Council resolution,” he said.</p>
<p>He continued: “Anyone who tries to violate our territory and integrity and sovereignty, our response will be brutal.”</p>
<p>DG ISPR warned that a “serious escalation between India and Pakistan would destroy both sides” under the concept of mutually assured destruction — a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy which posits that a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by an attacker on a nuclear-armed defender with second-strike capabilities would result in the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender.</p>
<p>In a press conference <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910381">held</a> last week after the ceasefire was brokered, DG ISPR had cautioned that a conflict between Islamabad and New Delhi “can lead to peril of more than 1.6 billion people.”</p>
<p>“In reality, there is no space for war between India and Pakistan,” he added.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911229/trump-promises-to-strengthen-ties-with-uae-on-gulf-tour' target='_blank'><strong>Trump promises to strengthen ties with UAE on Gulf tour</strong></a>
            <p><p>President Donald Trump on Thursday pledged to strengthen US ties to the United Arab Emirates on a visit to the Gulf state that is expected to deepen cooperation on artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Trump began a visit to the UAE on the latest stage of a tour of wealthy Gulf states after hailing plans by Doha to invest $10 billion in a US military facility during a trip to Qatar.</p>
<p>“I have absolutely no doubt that the relationship will only get bigger and better,” Trump said in a meeting with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.</p>
<p>“Your wonderful brother came to Washington a few weeks ago and he told us about your generous statement as to the 1.4 trillion,” Trump said, referring to a UAE pledge to invest $1.4tn in the US over 10 years.</p>
<p>Trump was referring to Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Sheikh Mohamed’s brother and the UAE’s national security adviser and chairman of two of Abu Dhabi’s deep-pocketed sovereign wealth funds.</p>
<p>“And all I can say is thank you very much,” Trump added.</p>
<p>“We will work very hard to deserve it.”</p>
<p>Sheikh Mohamed told Trump the UAE was “keen to continue and strengthen this friendship for the benefit of the two countries and peoples”, adding to Trump: “Your presence here today, your excellency, the president, confirms that this keenness is mutual.”</p>
<p>Before his departure for the UAE, Trump said in a speech to US troops at the Al Udeid Air Base southwest of Doha that defence purchases signed by Qatar on Wednesday are worth $42bn.</p>
<p>He was met at the airport in Abu Dhabi by Sheikh Mohamed, and the two leaders visited the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, its white minarets and domes, impressive in the late-afternoon light.</p>
<p>“It is so beautiful,” Trump told reporters inside the mosque, which he said had been closed for the day.</p>
<p>“First time they closed it. It’s in honour of the United States. Better than in honour of me. Let’s give it to the country. That’s a great tribute.”</p>
<p>The UAE’s leaders want US help to make their wealthy Gulf nation a global leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>The US has a preliminary agreement with the UAE to allow it to import 500,000 of Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips a year, starting this year, <em>Reuters</em> reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The deal would boost the UAE’s construction of data centres vital to developing AI models.</p>
<p>But the agreement has provoked national security concerns among sectors of the US government, and the terms could change, sources said.</p>
<p>At the presidential palace, Trump and Sheikh Mohamed could be seen in TV footage in conversation with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.</p>
<p>Trump said he would probably return to Washington on Friday after a regional trip that began on Tuesday, although he said it was “almost destination unknown — because they’ll be getting calls, ‘could you be here? Could you be there?’”</p>
<p>Trump had hinted that he could stop in Istanbul for talks on Ukraine.</p>
<p>The two countries have finalised a technology framework agreement that was expected to be signed later on Thursday, a source with knowledge of the matter told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>The agreement requires commitments on both sides to the security of technology, the source said, without immediately providing details.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#deals-diplomacy" id="deals-diplomacy" title="Permalink"></a>Deals, diplomacy</h2>
<p>Some big business agreements have been signed during Trump’s four-day swing through the Gulf region, including a deal for Qatar Airways to purchase up to 210 Boeing widebody jets, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910908">$600bn</a> commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the US and $142 billion in U.S. arms sales to the kingdom.</p>
<p>The trip has also brought a flurry of diplomacy.</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911193/trump-says-us-close-to-a-nuclear-deal-with-iran">said</a> in Qatar that the United States was getting very close to securing a nuclear deal with Iran, and Tehran had “sort of” agreed to the terms.</p>
<p>He also announced on Tuesday that the US would remove longstanding sanctions on Syria and subsequently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910971/trump-meets-syrian-president-says-he-is-looking-into-normalising-ties">met</a> with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa.</p>
<p>He urged Sharaa to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911119">establish ties</a> with Syria’s longtime foe, Israel.</p>
<p>AI is likely to be a focus of the final leg of Trump’s trip.</p>
<p>Former US president Joe Biden’s administration had imposed strict oversight of exports of US AI chips to the Middle East and other regions.</p>
<p>Among the Biden administration’s fears were that the prized semiconductors would be diverted to China and buttress Beijing’s military strength.</p>
<p>Trump has made improving ties with some Gulf countries a key goal of his administration.</p>
<p>If all the proposed chip deals in Gulf states, and the UAE in particular, come together, the region would become a third power centre in global AI competition after the United States and China.</p>
<p>Trump compared his visit to Saudi Arabia with one by his predecessor in 2022, when Biden gave the Saudi crown prince a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1699757">fist bump</a>.</p>
<p>“I shook more hands, more than any human being is capable of doing,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One.</p>
<p>“He travels all the way to Saudi Arabia, in that case, and he gives him a fist bump. That’s not what they want. They don’t want a fist bump. They want to shake his hand.”</p></p>
