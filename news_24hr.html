            <p><p>US President Donald Trump has said Washington had averted what could have been a nuclear war between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting drones</a> sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns. On May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, Trump announced that a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> had been reached between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>“The situation had escalated to the point where nuclear war could have broken out,” Trump said in an interview with US outlet <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-says-comey-knew-assassination-meaning-behind-deleted-social-media-post#:~:text=pointed%20to%20a%20recent%20ceasefire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News</a></em> on Friday.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to a question about getting both countries to step back from the brink of war, Trump called it a “bigger success than I will ever be given credit for”.</p>
<p>“Those are major nuclear powers […] and they were angry. […] It was tit-for-tat, it was getting deeper and more missiles,” he said. He added the next step would have been “the N-word”, responding in the affirmative to the host confirming he meant “nuclear”.</p>
<p>“That’s the worst thing that can happen,” Trump noted. Referring to discussions he said he had with both Pakistan and India on trade, the US president said: “I’m using trade to settle scores and make peace.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Trump said that he had great conversations with Pakistan. “You know we can’t forget them because it takes two to tango.”</p>
<p>“So proud of what we’re able to do with India and with Pakistan,” the US president said.</p>
<p>He continued that Pakistan would love to trade with the US. “They are brilliant people. They make amazing products. We don’t do much trading with them.”</p>
<p>As the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810/trumps-tariffs-stoke-global-trade-war-as-china-eu-hit-back">imposed heavy levies</a> on dozens of allies and rivals alike on April 2, Pakistan was hit by a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901838/economists-see-hurdles-and-opportunities-for-pakistan-as-us-imposes-29pc-tariff-on-country">29 per cent tariff</a> on goods it exports to the US. The government has said it is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906864">seeking ways</a> to address the existing trade imbalance between the two countries.</p>
<p>On trade with New Delhi, Trump said that India was one of the highly tariffed nations, making it almost “impossible to do business”.</p>
<p>However, India is ready to cut 100pc of its tariffs for the US, he added. “That deal will come soon,” the president said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, he had stated that India had offered a trade deal that proposed “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911203">no tariffs</a>” for American goods.</p>
<p>This interview was the third time in a week that the US president expressed his intention of deepening trade ties with Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>“We’re going to do a lot of trade with Pakistan … and India,” Trump said earlier this week, recalling that he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910565/trump-says-warned-pakistan-india-of-no-trade-if-fighting-not-halted">warned</a> both countries of “not doing any trade” if they did not stop fighting. A day after the ceasefire, he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910382#:~:text=adding%20that%20he%20also%20intended%20to%20%E2%80%9Cincrease%20trade%20substantially%20with%20both%20of%20these%20great%20nations%E2%80%9D">said</a> he was going “to increase trade substantially with both of these great nations”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The US-brokered ceasefire had brought a halt to a week of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909156/nuclear-war-can-break-out-at-any-time-in-case-of-pak-india-standoff-khawaja-asif">record escalation</a> between Pakistan and India as the latter took a series of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988">unprovoked military actions</a> despite Islamabad’s call for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a> into India’s allegations over the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>The military has confirmed that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910992">13 security personnel</a>, including members of the Pakistan Army and the Pakistan Air Force, were martyred while over 75 were injured during the confrontation with India.</p>
<p>It has also stated that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910848/40-civilians-11-personnel-martyred-in-indian-strikes">40 civilians</a> — including seven women and 15 children — lost their lives during the Indian aggression, while 121 others sustained injuries.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Britain is working with the US to ensure a ceasefire between India and Pakistan endures and that “confidence-building measures” and dialogue take place, according to its foreign minister David Lammy.</p>
<p>“We will continue to work with the United States to ensure that we get an enduring ceasefire, to ensure that dialogue is happening and to work through with Pakistan and India how we can get to confidence and confidence-building measures between the two sides,” Lammy told <em>Reuters</em> in Islamabad at the end of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911413/india-should-adhere-to-ceasefire-pakistan-will-respond-if-hostilities-resume-fo#:~:text=FM%20Dar%20appreciates%20UK%20role%20in%20de%2Descalation">two-day visit</a>.</p>

<p>Asked about India’s April 23 suspension of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>, potentially <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911383">squeezing</a> Pakistan’s water supply, Lammy said: “We would urge all sides to meet their treaty obligations.”</p>
<p>The Pakistan Commission on Indus Waters earlier this month <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908458">shared</a> a detailed report with the federal government about massive violations of the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) by New Delhi. Pakistan plans to launch <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907454">international legal action</a> against India over its move to hold the critical water-sharing agreement in abeyance.</p>
<p>Pakistan has said Britain and other countries, in addition to the United States, played a major role in de-escalating the fighting. Diplomats and analysts say the ceasefire <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911472">remains fragile</a>.</p></p>

            <p><p>Former foreign minister and PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi has been moved from Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat Jail to the Punjab Institute of Cardiology (PIC) on Saturday after he suffered heart pain, according to his lawyer.</p>
<p>Qureshi was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845990">indicted</a> in July 2024 by an anti-terrorism court in a case pertaining to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279/special-report-may-9-mayhem-and-military-trials-a-year-on">May 9 riots</a>. Shadman police had registered a case against PTI leaders, including Qureshi, and activists on charges of attacking and burning the police station.</p>
<p>The same month he was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1846704">transferred</a> from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi to Kot Lakpat on a police request. It had stated that frequent transportation of the PTI leader from Rawalpindi to Lahore was not feasible for the authorities as well as for the accused.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em> today, Advocate Rana Mudassar, Qureshi’s lawyer, said the his client suffered heart pain early morning, after Fajr prayers. He underwent a medical assessment by prison doctors.</p>
<p>“He was shifted to the PIC by Rescue 1122 after his health failed to improve,” Mudassar said, adding that Qureshi was currently undergoing various tests at the hospital.</p>
<p>The PTI leader’s family had been informed about his condition, the lawyer added.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911469/friendless-against-pakistan-india-curbs-business-with-turkiye-azerbaijan' target='_blank'><strong>Friendless against Pakistan, India curbs business with Turkiye, Azerbaijan</strong></a>
            <p><p>NEW DELHI: With India finding itself friendless in the conflict with Pakistan, it has started taking revenge on countries who helped Islamabad in the recent military flare-up, reports said on Friday.</p>
<p>The bizarre spectacle of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s supporters resorting to criticism and trolling of US President Donald Trump after he re-hyphenated the India-Pakistan saga as a bilateral issue he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">could help resolve</a>, the anger turned on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911114/turkiye-azerbaijans-support-for-pakistan-angers-indians">Turkiye and Azerbaijan</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding Turkiye, the Adani group-operated Mumbai and Ahmedabad airports have ended the ground handling concession agreements with Çelebi, an Istanbul-headquartered airport ground handling major. Air India is lobbying with the government to cancel the wet lease arrangement the Indigo Airlines has with its Turkish counterpart.</p>
<p>While the move against Turkish Airlines is being considered, the two airports have ordered Çelebi to immediately hand over all its ground handling facilities in order to ensure uninterrupted operations at the airports, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/delhi-mumbai-ahmedabad-airports-terminate-contracts-celebi-turkey-10009820/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Indian Express</a></em>, citing a statement by the two airports, reported.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The recent development follows a similar announcement by Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) on Thursday which further strained ties with Çelebi entities for ground handling and cargo operations at the national capital’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport.</p>
<p>“We will continue to provide seamless service to all airlines without disruptions through new ground handling agencies selected by us. All existing employees of Celebi at CSMIA (Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, Mumbai) and SVPIA (Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport, Ahmed­abad) will be transferred to new ground handling agencies on their existing terms and conditions of employment. Ground handling operations at our airports will remain unaffected,” the <em>Indian Express</em> quoted the spokespersons for the two airports as saying.</p>
<p>The anger has turned on the Muslim army spokeswoman as well who was the face of the military operation against Pakistan. A BJP minister from Madhya Pradesh described her as a sister of terrorists. A high court judge in Madhya Pradesh has ordered an FIR against the politician Vijay Shah.</p>
<p>Not to relent, the BJP’s demons continue to stalk it. Now Madhya Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Jagdish Devda has courted another row after he made statements allegedly insulting the armed forces, saying that the “personnel were bowing down to Prime Minister Narendra Modi”.</p>
<p>Speaking at a civil defence volunteers event in Jabalpur on Friday, Mr. Devda said: “Today the entire country, the country’s army and our soldiers bow down at the feet of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The reply he has given cannot be praised enough.”</p>
<p>The remarks, however, have drawn immediate criticism from the opposition Congress with leaders alleging that the BJP has a “sponsored programme” running to insult the forces and demanding an apology from him.</p>
<p>Political reactions poured in across party lines over the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910970/indias-congress-party-seeks-removal-of-bjp-minister-over-insult-to-col-sofiya">insulting remarks</a> against Col Sofiya Qureshi.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh questioned Mr Modi’s silence, calling the remarks “disgraceful” and a reflection of a “diseased mindset.”</p>
<p>Similar criticism was voiced by leaders, including Sachin Pilot, Y.S. Sharmila, Harish Rawat, Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati, and Trinamool Congress MP Sagarika Ghosh.</p>
<p>State Congress leaders, including MPCC chief Jitu Patwari, filed police complaints across multiple cities, while party workers held demonstrations in protest.</p>
<p>The military flare-up saw China expressing solid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586/china-reaffirms-support-for-pakistan-amid-escalation-with-india">diplomatic support</a> to Pakistan, but there wasn’t a country other than Israel to stand with India without hyphenating it with Pakistan.</p>
