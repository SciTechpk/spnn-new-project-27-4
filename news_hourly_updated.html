                <h2>Pakistan wants Trump to arrange talks with India</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ PM calls US president ‚Äòman for peace‚Äô; says offer of impartial probe into Pahalgam was met with aggression<br />
‚Ä¢ Bilawal says New Delhi can‚Äôt be ‚Äònet security provider‚Äô in the region if it can‚Äôt even defend its own skies<br />
‚Ä¢ Dar blames political rhetoric from Indian leaders for keeping South Asia tensions high</p>
<p>WASHINGTON / ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari have praised US President Donald Trump for his role in helping <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">de-escalate</a> the latest India-Pakistan military confrontation, and urged Washington to facilitate a comprehensive dialogue between the two nuclear neighbours.</p>
<p>Speaking at an event at the US Embassy in Islamabad marking the 249th anniversary of American independence, PM Shehbaz said the recent four-day conflict had revealed the ‚ÄúPahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909771/dg-ispr-says-india-has-no-evidence-for-pahalgam-incident-or-alleged-attacks-in-last-48-hours">incident</a> was a false-flag operation‚Äù, and credited President Trump for playing a decisive role in ensuring a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire.</a></p>
<p>The premier said that the US president had shown beyond any doubt that ‚Äúhe is a man for peace ‚Ä¶ and beneficial business deals‚Äù.</p>
<p>He added, ‚ÄúPresident Trump is a man against escalation and a man against cold and hot war.‚Äù</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">downed</a> six Indian fighter jets in self-defence after Indian aggression on May 6-7 resulted in the deaths of 33 Pakistani civilians.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe responded with restraint and patience,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur offer for an impartial international probe into the Pahalgam incident was met with aggression instead.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that India ‚Äúshould have come out with solid evidence and convinced the world about the occurrence of the incident‚Äù.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also extended heartfelt felicitations to the US president and people of the United States, on his behalf and on behalf of the Pakistani nation, on celebrating their Independence Day.</p>
<p>He said the bilateral ties between the US and Pakistan were entering into renewed friendship, and the close contacts were being revived.</p>
<p><strong>Facilitate dialogue</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, speaking to US-based Pakistani journalists in Washington, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said President Trump ‚Äúdeserves credit‚Äù for helping facilitate the ceasefire between Pakistan and India last month.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe should also pay attention to what the US president is saying. On 10 different occasions, he has taken credit for facilitating the ceasefire between India and Pakistan ‚Äî and rightly so. He deserves that credit, because it was his efforts that helped make the ceasefire possible,‚Äù said Mr Bhutto-Zardari, the leader of the Pakistani delegation that began a three-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915108">visit</a> to Washington on Wednesday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo, if the US is willing to help Pakistan in maintaining this ceasefire, it is reasonable to expect that an American role in arranging a comprehensive dialogue would also be beneficial for us,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>While India publicly denies that President Trump played any role in the ceasefire agreement and consistently rejects third-party mediation on bilateral issues, Mr Bhutto-Zardari‚Äôs remarks appear aimed at drawing the US into a more proactive diplomatic role in South Asia.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes, America has an establishment, a thought pattern,‚Äù he acknowledged, ‚Äúbut knowing the ground realities, we are not delusional. We know what the realities of this city (Washington) are, what its geopolitics are, but we are here because we believe that our message is the message of truth. It aligns with international laws and relevant UN Security Council resolutions.‚Äù</p>
<p>His comments also targeted what he described as a failed US strategy of building up India as a regional security anchor. Referring to New Delhi‚Äôs recent troubles, he said: ‚ÄúWhat security will that net security provider provide to others when it cannot do that for itself? They were supposed to protect others, but couldn‚Äôt protect their own planes.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe concept of India as a counterweight to China now seems hollow. It‚Äôs not even a paperweight anymore. This approach, I believe, must now be re-evaluated,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>India has long pitched itself as a ‚Äúnet security provider‚Äù in the Indo-Pacific region ‚Äî a concept US policymakers have also endorsed. But Mr Bhutto-Zardari said this strategy had outlived its utility.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI believe that this strategy of building up India as the net security provider has failed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI believe what can really provide security to this region, and to the rest of the world, is peace bet¬≠ween India and Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>Rhetoric sustaining tensions</strong></p>
<p>Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday expressed readiness for a comprehensive dialogue with India, but warned that rising political rhetoric from Indian leaders is sustaining high tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals following last month‚Äôs military confrontation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhenever they (Indians) want a dialogue, at any level, they will find us ready, but we are not desperate,‚Äù Mr Dar said during a press briefing in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Mr Dar said that although the ceasefire has held, political tensions remain inflamed by statements from Indian leaders, particularly Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently described the military exchange as ‚Äújust a trailer‚Äù ahead of upcoming elections in Bihar.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPolitical rhetoric is still on, possibly for internal reasons,‚Äù Mr Dar said. ‚ÄúI wish sense prevails. We are peace lovers, focused on economic revival, but dignity, sovereignty and territorial integrity come first.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mr Dar insisted that any future dialogue between Pakistan and India must be comprehensive, addressing terrorism, water rights under the Indus Waters Treaty, and broader bilateral issues. ‚ÄúWhen India is ready for talks, it will find us ready for talks on all issues.‚Äù</p>
<p>He also rejected Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishan¬≠kar‚Äôs assertion that the talks should only cover the issue of terrorism, saying it wouldn‚Äôt work.</p>

                <h2>Provinces take the lead on Rs4.2tr in uplift spending</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ NEC approves plan with consensus as govt eyes 4.2 per cent growth in next fiscal year<br />
‚Ä¢ Centre to finance projects worth Rs1 trillion amid 29pc PSDP cut, provincial allocations to fund the rest<br />
‚Ä¢ Sindh, KP ‚Äòunhappy‚Äô with exclusion of projects from federal budget<br />
‚Ä¢ Premier, all CMs to meet today on Indian moves against Pakistan‚Äôs water</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Fuelled by a 22pc increase in provincial allocations, the National Economic Council (NEC) on Wednesday approved with consensus a record Rs4.22 trillion national development outlay for the next fiscal year to upgrade growth rate to 4.2pc from 2.7 this year, despite an IMF-decreed 29pc cut in the public sector development programme (PSDP) compared to the current year.</p>
<p>The provincial expansionary stance is expected to come under the International Monetary Fund‚Äôs watch, which has been pushing for greater provincial cash surpluses to support the federal government in delivering a healthy amount for debt servicing, besides effective taxation of the agriculture income under a new national fiscal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910966">pact.</a></p>
<p>The meeting of the NEC ‚Äî the country‚Äôs highest economic decision-making forum ‚Äî was moved up by a day so that the prime minister, who chaired the meeting, could travel abroad. All provincial chief ministers, the deputy prime minister, and federal ministers for planning, finance and information were present. PM‚Äôs adviser Rana Sanaullah also attended the meeting.</p>
<p>The meeting also decided that the PM and all CMs would meet on Thursday morning for a special meeting in light of India‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913144">move</a> to disrupt Pakistan‚Äôs water share. They will ponder a strategy to safeguard Pakistan‚Äôs water resources.</p>
<p>The development portfolio includes Rs1tr from PSDP, Rs2.869 trillion from the provincial annual development plans (ADPs), and Rs355bn for separate projects by the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) through their resources.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the Centre has allocated Rs880bn for the PSDP, down 20pc when compared to the current year‚Äôs revised allocation of Rs1.1tr and 37pc lower than the original allocation of Rs1.4tr. Yet, the government pitched the PSDP at Rs1tr after including Rs120bn to be generated through a petroleum levy imposed by the prime minister last month to finance projects in Balochistan.</p>
<p>The provincial share for next year has gone up by 22pc from Rs2.358tr. The provinces had pitched Rs2.795tr ADPs two days ago at the meeting of the Annual Plan Coordination Committee (APCC), but revised it to Rs2.869tr for the next year.</p>
<p><strong>Punjab leads charge</strong></p>
<p>The next year‚Äôs development plan is led by Punjab with a record Rs1.204tr, 20pc higher than the Centre, up 10.6pc compared to the current year‚Äôs Rs1.089tr. This is the first time a federating unit has exceeded the federal allocation, showing enhanced financial muscle of the provinces. Sindh trailed just behind the Centre with Rs967bn allocation, a healthy 27pc increase from its current year‚Äôs Rs705bn development fund. Punjab and Sindh enhanced their allocations by Rs16bn and Rs80bn respectively over what they had reported to the APCC on Monday.</p>
<p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa announced to invest Rs417bn in development next year, showing a massive 33pc increase over the current year‚Äôs allocation of Rs313bn. It had reported Rs440bn ADP in APCC but scaled down by Rs23bn. Balochistan, mostly dependent on the federal support, would announce Rs281bn development plan, up 12pc over the current year‚Äôs Rs252bn. Likewise, estimates for SOE‚Äôs projects were also jacked up to Rs355bn from Rs288bn two days ago.</p>
<p>Sources said despite their own heavy allocations, the Sindh and KP chief ministers complained over exclusion of their projects from the federal budget, while the Balochistan chief minister thanked the Centre for giving special attention to the restive province. KP chief minister‚Äôs adviser on finance Muzammil Aslam, however, appreciated the centre‚Äôs limitations in the given circumstances.</p>
<p>The cash-strapped government, however, did not forget protecting allocations for coalition partners‚Äô parliamentarians scheme at Rs50bn and also enhanced funds for PML-N‚Äôs trademark road-building projects.</p>
<p>All other sectors, including special areas like Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, would be handicapped by lower allocations, as all sectors, including energy, food, and water, faced funding constraints.</p>
<p>Based on these spending plans, the government set next year‚Äôs growth <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915125">target</a> at 4.2pc, supported by 4.4pc target in agriculture output, 4.3pc in industry and 4pc in the services sector, and an inflation rate at 7.5pc.</p>
<p>It set the target for national savings at 14.3pc of GDP in FY 2025-26, slightly higher than the current year‚Äôs 14.1pc and total investment of 14.7pc of GDP, up from 13.8pc in FY 2024-25. This reflects a narrowing saving investment gap to be financed through modest external inflows.</p>
<p>Public investment is projected to increase from 2.9pc to 3.2p; similarly, private investment is also projected to rise from 9.1pc of GDP to 9.8pc. Fiscal and monetary policies will aim for consolidation and stability, with an expected inflation of 7.5pc due to the low base effect and risk of ongoing trade tensions and domestic tariff rationalisation measures.</p>
<p>The agriculture growth will be supported by a recovery in important crops (6.7pc) and cotton ginning (7pc), as well as robust performance in livestock.  The industrial sector is expected to benefit from a significant revival in LSM with 3.5pc growth, the planning ministry said, with 3pc growth in mining and quarrying, ‚Äúalongside sustained growth momentum in construction and energy, gas and water supply‚Äù.</p>
<p>The services sector, which forms the largest share of GDP, is set to grow by 4pc, underpinned by stronger performance in wholesale and retail trade, transport, storage &amp; communications, financial services and real estate.</p>
