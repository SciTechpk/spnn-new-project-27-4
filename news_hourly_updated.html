                <h2>Chakwal faces flash floods after receiving 400mm rain in 10 hours</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Punjab‚Äôs Chakwal district recorded 400 millimetres of rain overnight due to a cloudburst, triggering flash floods across the city as heavy rains continue to lash Punjab, a statement from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Thursday.</p>
<p>At least 28 people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924584">killed</a> and 90 others injured in rain and storms across Punjab between Tuesday and Wednesday. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924232">issued</a> a warning of torrential rains with wind-thundershowers that will last throughout the country till July 17.</p>
<p>Pakistan experiences Monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>PDMA Spokesperson Irfan Ali Kathia district said, ‚ÄúChawkwal recorded 400mm of rain in 10 hours, which left many areas flooded.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said water has begun to recede with the cessation of the downpour, and evacuation efforts are underway to rescue the trapped citizens.</p>
<p>The district administration has been alerted, while the relevant rescue departments, including Water and Sanitation Agencies (WASA), Rescue 1122, and other civil personnel, have been summoned to the field to oversee rescue efforts, according to District Commissioner Chakwal, Quratul Ain Malik.</p>
<p>In light of the situation, relief arrangements have been made in hospitals and public buildings, Malik said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the PDMA spokesperson Kathia added that the district administration was in contact with the military as well in case of additional support.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe PDMA assured the district administration of support in rescue and relief efforts and is personally overseeing the rescue operation until all citizens are safely evacuated,‚Äù Kathia said. ‚ÄúThe district administration is continuing to monitor the situation, particularly in low-lying areas.‚Äù</p>
<p>District Emergency Operation Centre, including the PDMA Control Room, are on high alert, he said, adding that ‚Äúhelicopters and other rescue resources are also on standby.‚Äù</p>

<p>Meanwhile, PMD on Thursday issued a flood alert for the Gawalmandi bridge in Rawalpindi as the water level in the Leh Nullah continued to rise due to heavy rains.</p>
<p>PMD also indicated that the Kattarian bridge could face flooding as well if the water level surpasses 15.7 feet.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll stakeholders have been advised to stay alert,‚Äù the weather advisory said.</p>

<p>Heavy downpour in Mandi Bahauddin left one dead and injured 11 people on Wednesday, as the city recorded 210mm of rainfall.</p>
<p>Shah Hussain, 10, drowned while bathing in the rainwater, while in another incident, two boys ‚Äî Qasim, 08, and Huzaifa, 06‚Äî were electrocuted during the rain.</p>
<p>Nine people were injured after the roofs of three dilapidated houses collapsed at separate locations. Areas in the city, such as College Chowk, Pindi Purani, and Jail Chowk, remained submerged under two to four feet of water.</p></p>

                <h2>PAF to showcase advanced JF-17 Thunder jets at UK airshow</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A contingent of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), featuring the advanced JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter jets and C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, arrived at the Royal Air Force Base Fairford in the United Kingdom to take part in the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) 2025, a statement from the military‚Äôs media wing said on Thursday.</p>
<p>RIAT, which will run from July 18 to 20, is one of the world‚Äôs largest military airshows, has been running for over 50 years and powers the Royal Air Force Charitable Trust, according to its <a class="link--external" href="https://www.airtattoo.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPAF‚Äôs participation in RIAT, one of the world‚Äôs largest military airshows, underscores Pakistan Air Force‚Äôs commitment to showcasing its professional excellence, operational capability and the indigenous strength of its aviation industry,‚Äù a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.</p>
<p>Adding to the operational significance of this international deployment, Pakistan Air Force‚Äôs JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighters executed successful Air-to-Air Refuelling operations en route to the UK with the support of a PAF IL-78 aerial refuelling tanker</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe intricate refuelling operation demonstrated PAF‚Äôs long-range operational capabilities and the proficiency of its air and ground crew in conducting extended operations beyond national borders.</p>
<p>‚ÄúJF-17 Block-III is an EASA Radar and Long Range BVR equipped 4.5 generation multi-role fighter aircraft which is capable of undertaking a wide variety of combat missions, bolstering airpower application in the face of contemporary challenges, thereby strengthening national security,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>In May, when Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">downed</a> 5 Indian jets as retaliation for late-night strikes during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/pakistan-india-tensions">Pakistan-India conflict</a>, the PAF formally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">acknowledged</a> a month later that it was the Kamra-based 15 Squadron that led the charge in shooting down the jets.</p>
<p>The event is now considered one of the largest air-to-air engagements in South Asia in more than half a century.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is a palpable sense of enthusiasm across the United Kingdom following the recent Pakistan-India conflict, as aviation enthusiasts and defence observers were eagerly looking forward to the arrival of the Pakistan Air Force‚Äôs JF-17 Thunder Block-III,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe aircraft‚Äôs combat-proven capabilities and operational excellence have garnered significant global attention, making its appearance at RIAT a highly anticipated highlight in the aerospace and defence community.‚Äù</p></p>
