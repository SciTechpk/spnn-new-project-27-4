                <h2>Foreign Office slams India‚Äôs MEA for ‚Äòtwisting‚Äô COAS Asim Munir‚Äôs remarks</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Monday castigated India‚Äôs Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) for ‚Äúdistorting‚Äù and ‚Äútwisting‚Äù remarks made by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir during his recent visit to the United States.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir on Sunday completed his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930030/coas-says-india-wont-be-allowed-to-choke-indus-river">second high-profile trip</a> to the US in less than two months. Like his previous visit, he engaged with both political and military leadership in the host country. In Tampa, Florida, the army chief attended the US Central Command‚Äôs (Centcom) change of command ceremony.</p>
<p>His most closely watched appearance came later at a black-tie dinner hosted by Adnan Asad, Pakistan‚Äôs honorary consul in Tampa. The event was attended by about 150 guests, including Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Ambassador Rizwan Shaikh, embassy officials, and prominent members of the diaspora.</p>
<p>Comments Field Marshal Munir made at the event were later picked up and, according to the FO, distorted by Indian media outlets. Responding to Indian media reports, the MEA had said earlier today: ‚ÄúOur attention has been drawn to remarks reportedly made by the Pakistani COAS while on a visit to the US. Nuclear sabre-rattling is Pakistan‚Äôs stock-in-trade.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe international community can draw its own conclusions on the irresponsibility inherent in such remarks, which also reinforce the well-held doubts about the integrity of nuclear command and control in a state where the military is hand-in-glove with terrorist groups.‚Äù</p>
<p>The MEA had also said that it was ‚Äúregrettable‚Äù that the alleged remarks were ‚Äúmade from the soil of a friendly third country‚Äù.</p>

</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In a terse response to the Indian MEA‚Äôs statement, the FO said: ‚ÄúPakistan strongly rejects the immature remarks made by the Indian MEA earlier today, which is yet another demonstration of their chronic tendency to distorting facts and twisting statements out of context.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Indian narrative of an alleged ‚Äònuclear blackmail‚Äô is a misleading and self-serving construct. Pakistan remains firmly opposed to the use or threat of use of force. India‚Äôs sabre-rattling and warmongering whenever confronted, invite unfounded allegations bereft of rationality.‚Äù</p>
<p>The FO said Pakistan was a responsible nuclear-weapon state with an ‚Äúelaborate command and control structure under full civilian control‚Äù that had always exercised ‚Äúdiscipline and restraint‚Äù while dealing with issues of such importance.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPakistan‚Äôs sustained and credible counterterrorism efforts are internationally acknowledged. Our security forces remain the bulwark against terrorism. The Indian MEA‚Äôs spurious insinuations are irresponsible and without a shred of evidence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe also note with concern a pointless reference to the third countries, in a bid to exert pressure on Pakistan. This not only reflects India‚Äôs lack of diplomatic confidence but also constitutes a futile attempt to unnecessarily involve other countries.‚Äù</p>
<p>The FO said that ‚Äúcontrary to India‚Äôs belligerent and jingoistic approach‚Äù, Pakistan would continue to act as a responsible member of the global community.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, any act of Indian aggression or violation of Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity will be met with an immediate and matching response. The onus of any ensuing escalation will rest squarely with the Indian leadership,‚Äù it warned.</p></p>

                <h2>Lahore ATC acquits Qureshi in 2 more May 9 cases; convicts Dr Yasmin, Ejaz Chaudhry and others</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Monday acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi in two more cases related to the May 9 riots, while sentencing Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudry, Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mehmoodur Rashid to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting party founder Imran Khan‚Äôs arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, following which thousands were arrested.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>The ATC had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929899/verdict-in-two-may-9-riots-cases-reserved">reserved its verdict</a> in the two cases on Saturday related to the May 9 riots ‚Äî the Shadman police station attack and burning of police vehicles near Jinnah House ‚Äî after completing proceedings at Kot Lakhpat jail. The judge concluded the hearings inside the jail in two sessions during the whole day.</p>
<p>ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced the judgments today and convicted Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema and Rashid in both cases.</p>
<p>PTI leaders Aliya Hamza and Sanam Javed were also sentenced to five years in prison in the Shadman case.</p>
<p>Advocate Rana Mudassar confirmed today‚Äôs sentencing to <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>In the Shadman police station case, the court indicted 25 accused out of 41 nominated in the challan and recorded statements of 45 prosecution witnesses. At least 15 accused have been declared proclaimed offenders in this case.</p>
<p>In the police vehicles torching case, the court indicted 17 accused, declared seven proclaimed offenders and recorded statements of 65 prosecution witnesses.</p>
<p>Last month, the Lahore ATC had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925887/lahore-atc-acquits-qureshi-sentences-yasmin-rashid-ejaz-chaudhry-and-others-to-10-years-in-may-9-riots-case">acquitted</a> Qureshi while sentencing Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema, Rashid and others to 10 years in prison over a May 9 riots case related to violence on Sherpao Bridge.</p>
<p>Sarwar Road police had registered a case against PTI leaders and workers on charges of ransacking and burning public property at Sherpao Bridge in the Cantonment area during the violent protests.</p>
<p>Chaudhry had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929752/ptis-zartaj-gul-ejaz-chaudhry-appeal-to-lhc-against-atc-convictions-in-may-9-riots-cases">filed two petitions</a> in the Lahore High Court on Saturday, pleading with the court to suspend his sentence and conviction, along with ordering his release on bail. He further requested the court in the second petition to set aside his conviction and acquit him in the case in the ‚Äúinterest of justice‚Äù.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com:443/feeds/home#ptis-gohar-blasts-convictions" id="ptis-gohar-blasts-convictions" title="Permalink"></a>PTI‚Äôs Gohar blasts convictions</h2>
<p>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan assailed the convictions, saying: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve said before that if injustice is allowed to thrive, then the voice of the people will be silenced.‚Äù</p>
<p>Lamenting that the PTI‚Äôs mandate was stolen, Gohar said that the government did not have the people‚Äôs respect or vote and did not have the people‚Äôs trust.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYet we sat [in parliament] so that we could move forward and protect the nation, save democracy, free the courts and ensure the supremacy of order.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf this blade of injustice doesn‚Äôt stop, the nation will suffer a great loss,‚Äù he warned.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe condemn the judgments and reject them,‚Äù Gohar added. ‚ÄúJustice has been killed.‚Äù</p>
<p>The PTI chairman further said that the party condemned the riots on May 9, stating that they should not have happened and should not happen again. However, he added that the party submitted a petition requesting a hearing on the allegations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat hearing has not happened, our petition was ignored and no decision was made,‚Äù he stated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBecause the courts didn‚Äôt grant us justice, political tensions and instability rose. We don‚Äôt get justice and it keeps getting killed,‚Äù Gohar emphasised.</p>
<p>He said that Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai was saying the right thing: ‚ÄúPeople need to rise up, their voice cannot be silenced.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will carry on our movement until the true leader of the world‚Äôs 6th biggest party is released.‚Äù</p>
<p>Referring to those convicted in today‚Äôs hearing, Gohar said that the party members were voices who were representatives of the state who did not condone violence against it.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf their voices are silenced, if the knife of injustice plunges deeper, then there will be a lot of division. This needs to end,‚Äù Gohar emphasised.</p>
<p>According to Gohar, the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) summoned the party leadership, who requested a meeting with Imran. ‚ÄúHe (the CJP) said he is pursuing judicial reforms and would allow us to meet Imran in Adiala,‚Äù Gohar recalled.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been six months and there has been no meeting. We submitted a privileged motion to meet Imran, but there has been no action on it.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe even submitted requests and raised the issue in parliament, but nothing happened,‚Äù he added.</p></p>
