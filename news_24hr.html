            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929938/coas-munir-terms-his-2nd-us-visit-a-new-era-in-islamabad-washington-ties' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir terms his 2nd US visit ‘a new era’ in Islamabad-Washington ties</strong></a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir termed his second visit to the United States in just 1.5 months a “new dimension” in ties between Washington and Islamabad, state-run <em>PTV News</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1954547015989313986" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on Sunday.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir is undertaking an official visit to the United States and has engaged in high-level interactions with senior political and military leadership, as well as members of the Pakistani diaspora, the military’s media wing said earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The visit comes shortly after he went to the US in June on a five-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917414">official visit</a>, where he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093/trump-coas-munir-talk-counterterrorism-and-trade-in-cordial-meeting-ispr">met</a> with US President Donald Trump over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">luncheon</a>, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.</p>
<p>Addressing members of the Pakistani diaspora in the US in Tampa city of Florida, Field Marshal Munir was quoted as having said: “My second visit after a gap of just one and a half months marks a new dimension in Pak-US relations.”</p>
<p>He added that the aim of these visits was to take the relations on a constructive, sustainable and positive path.</p>
<p>“It is an honour for me to address Pakistanis living in the US,” he said, adding, “Overseas Pakistanis are a source of pride and dignity and are as enthusiastic as other Pakistanis.”</p>
<p>Speaking on regional issues, the army chief said: “India wants to present itself as a ‘<em>Vishva Guru</em>’ (global teacher), but in practice, it is nothing like that.”</p>
<p>“The involvement of India’s intelligence agency, RAW [Research and Analysis Wing] in transnational terrorist activities is a cause of serious concern at the global level,” he added.</p>
<p>He cited the example of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1869510">killing</a> of a Sikh leader in Canada, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1801517">case</a> of eight Indian naval officers in Qatar, and incidents like <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904756">Kulbhushan Jadhav.</a></p>
<p>“Pakistan has fought a successful diplomatic war against India’s discriminatory and duplicitous policies,” Field Marshal Munir added.</p>
<p>Commenting on the recent conflict with India, he said: “This Indian aggression has brought the region to the brink of a dangerously flaming war, where any mistake would lead to a bilateral conflict.”</p>
<p>He also said that Pakistan was extremely grateful to US President Donald Trump, “whose strategic leadership has not only stopped the Pakistan-India war but also prevented many wars in the world.”</p>
<p>Speaking on the issue of Kashmir, He said: “Occupied Kashmir is not an internal matter of India but an unfinished international agenda. As the Quaid-e-Azam had said, Kashmir is the ‘jugular vein’ of Pakistan.”</p>
<p>He added that there were also UN Security Council resolutions on occupied Kashmir, and Pakistan fully supports these resolutions.</p>
<p>He also spoke on the topic of terrorism, saying: “Many terrorist organisations from Afghanistan, including <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em>, are active against Pakistan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna">Fitna al Khawarij</a> is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>He added that Pakistan’s progress and prosperity are linked to Pakistanis living around the world, saying, “Pakistan is currently the last bulwark against terrorism.”</p>
<p>“There is no sympathy for terrorists, and they will have to face justice with all their might,” he continued. “Pakistan is the last stronghold against terrorism at this time.”</p>
<p>The army chief said a potential trade deal with the United States is expected to bring significant investment.</p>
<p>“Pakistan has achieved remarkable successes on the international diplomatic front,” he added.</p>
<p>“Implementation is underway on several MoUs [memorandums of understanding] with the US, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and China, which will enhance economic cooperation and investment.”</p>
<p>He said Pakistanis living abroad are a source of dignity and pride, and they are as passionate and committed as those in Pakistan.</p>
<p>“Overseas Pakistanis are not a case of “brain drain” but rather a “brain gain.”</p>
<p>The COAS also said that social media today is a powerful platform, but “anti-state elements are using it to create engineered chaos”.</p>
<p>During the trip in June, Field Marshal Munir had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918382">stressed</a> the “immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect” with Washington.</p>
<p>Today’s <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7386" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on the visit said: “In Tampa, COAS attended the Retirement Ceremony of outgoing Commander United States Central Command (Centcom), General Michael E. Kurilla, and the Change of Command Ceremony marking the assumption of command by Admiral Brad Cooper.</p>

    </blockquote>
</span></div>

<p>“COAS lauded General Kurilla’s exemplary leadership and his invaluable contributions to strengthening bilateral military cooperation, and extended his best wishes to Admiral Cooper, expressing confidence in continued collaboration to address shared security challenges.</p>
<p>In June, Gen Kurilla hailed Pakistan as a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524/us-centcom-chief-lauds-phenomenal-partner-pakistan-in-counter-terrorism-efforts">phenomenal partner</a>” in the arena of counter-terrorism, citing their struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State.</p>
<p>The field marshal also met with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine, where matters of mutual professional interest were discussed and Munir extended an invitation to General Caine to visit Pakistan.</p>
<p>The army chief also interacted with the chiefs of defence from friendly nations on the sidelines of the meeting, ISPR said.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929989/mastung-blast-derails-6-bogies-as-jaffar-express-targeted-2nd-time-in-a-week' target='_blank'><strong>Mastung blast derails 6 bogies as Jaffar Express targeted 2nd time in a week</strong></a>
            <p><p>No loss of life was reported after a bomb blast on a railway track in Balochistan’s Mastung district derailed six bogies of the Jaffar Express, an official said on Sunday.</p>
<p>With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province’s transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train. Fortunately, there was no loss of life.”</p>
<p>The incident occurred near the Spezand station in Mastung’s Dasht tehsil, when the train was heading from Quetta to Peshawar City station with 350 passengers on board.</p>
<p>“Security forces and rescue teams rushed to the site as soon as they were alerted about the incident, and began a search operation after cordoning off the area,” Kashif said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Four bogies of the Jaffar Express had been placed back on the track, while efforts were underway to restore the other two,” the official noted.</p>
<p>A relief train of the Pakistan Railways brought the 350 passengers back to Quetta, while bogies stuck on the track will be returned to the city as well, according to a later statement from Kashif, who said that all tickets will be refunded.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, Kashif said the services of the Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail were suspended till August 14.</p>
<p>The Bolan Mail will resume its operations on August 16 (Saturday), when it will depart from Karachi “in its proper turn” and will arrive in Quetta the next day, he added.</p>
<p>Today’s incident comes just three days after Quetta-bound Jaffar Express <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929447">narrowly escaped</a> a disaster in Balochistan’s Sibi, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train passed.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In another near-miss incident on July 24, a powerful explosion ripped through the Quetta-Sibi rail section, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926300">damaging a bogie</a> of the Bolan Mail.</p>
<p>A July 28 derailment of the Jaffar Express train in Sindh’s Sukkur was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927185">initially attributed</a> to an explosion — even by government-run media — but the Ministry of Railways later said a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927307">technical fault</a> was the cause.</p>
<p>In June, a powerful explosion of a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks caused four bogies of the Jaffer Express to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917945">derail in Jacobabad</a>. No one was hurt in the incident.</p>
<p>In April, the 3UP train heading from Karachi to Quetta was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904018">stopped</a> at Jacobabad railway station due to security reasons.</p>
<p>Train services betw­een Quetta and the rest of the country were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900566">restored</a> on March 27, after they were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897306/all-trains-to-and-from-balochistan-suspended">suspended</a> due to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419">unprecedented hijacking</a> of the Pesha­war-bound Jaffar Express earlier that month.</p>
<p>The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897595/balochistan-standoff-ends-after-all-jaffar-express-hostages-rescued#:~:text=In%20all%2C%2021%20passengers%20lost%20their%20lives%2C%20while%20four%20FC%20personnel%20were%20martyred%2C%20the%20ISPR%20DG%20said.">21 passengers</a> and four security personnel. “All 33 terrorists” were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.</p></p>

            <p><p>A child drowned on Sunday while her two siblings were missing in the Swat River in the Butkhela area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand district, according to officials.</p>
<p>Malakand Assistant Commissioner Waheedullah Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em> that three siblings were bathing in the river when the incident occurred.</p>
<p>“A 12-year-old girl’s body was recovered from the river, while the search for her two brothers is continuing,” Waheedullah said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nasir Khan, district emergency officer for the Rescue 1122 Malakand, said in a statement that the incident occurred near the Japan bridge in Butkhela, over the river.</p>
<p>“The three siblings drowned in the river and their ages were between 10 to 13,” Nasir was quoted as saying. “The search for the remaining two bodies will continue and civil defence teams are also taking part.</p>
<p>The Rescue 1122 official identified the recovered girl as 12-year-old Azra and her missing brothers as 10-year-old Bilal and 13-year-old Muhammad Sadiq.</p>
<p>“The search operation in the river has now paused and will resume early tomorrow morning,” Nasir added.</p>
<p>On July 31, a girl was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927839/girl-rescued-while-two-still-missing-in-indus-river-in-kps-shangla">rescued</a> by locals while two were still missing after falling into the Indus River in KP’s Shangla district, according to the police.</p></p>
