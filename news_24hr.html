            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir has stressed the “immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect” with the United States, the military’s media wing said on Friday.</p>
<p>COAS Munir is on a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917414">five-day</a> official visit to the US, where he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093/trump-coas-munir-talk-counterterrorism-and-trade-in-cordial-meeting-ispr">met with</a> President Donald Trump over luncheon, becoming the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">first</a> serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. National Security Advisor Lt Gen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907660/in-a-first-isi-chief-made-national-security-adviser">Muhammad Asim Malik</a> — also the intelligence chief — has accompanied Gen Munir.</p>
<p>COAS Munir held an interaction in Washington DC with prominent US think tanks and representatives of the strategic affairs institutions, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7326" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>Senior scholars, analysts, policy experts and representatives of leading international media outlets were also part of the “comprehensive and candid exchange”, ISPR added.</p>
<p>The army chief “underscored the immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect, shared strategic interests, and economic interdependence”, the statement said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Evaluating the Pakistan-US partnership, Gen Munir underlined the “historical convergences between the two nations, particularly in areas such as counterterrorism, regional security and economic development”.</p>
<p>In his remarks, the army chief also highlighted Pakistan’s “unwavering commitment to regional peace and stability, and its constructive role in fostering a rules-based international order”.</p>
<p>The army chief also noted the “malign influence of certain regional actors in sponsoring and perpetuating terrorism as a tool of hybrid warfare”, the statement added.</p>
<p>He mentioned this as he alluded to the details and analysis of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910729/operation-bunyanum-marsoos-11-soldiers-martyred-78-wounded-while-defending-pakistan">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a> during the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186">conflict</a> with India and “elaborated on Pakistan’s perspective on terrorism”.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir emphasised that Pakistan had been on the “front lines of the global war against terrorism, having rendered immense sacrifices — both human and economic — in pursuit of a safer and more secure world”.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has repeatedly <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a> that Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911617#:~:text=which%20lost%2090%2C000%20lives%20and%20over%20%24150%20billion%20economic%20losses">lost</a> 90,000 valuable lives and incurred $150 billion worth of economic losses over the past few decades.</p>
<p>During the session, COAS Munir also invited international partners to explore collaborative opportunities in various sectors to “unlock shared prosperity”.</p>
<p>He highlighted Pakistan’s “remarkable untapped potential, particularly in the domains of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915901">information technology</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1871762">agriculture</a>, and its vast and underexploited reserves in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903248">mining</a> and mineral sectors”, echoing topics discussed in his meeting with Trump and previous Pak-US interactions.</p>
<p>The army chief also provided a detailed exposition of Pakistan’s “balanced approach to regional and global conflicts, advocating for dialogue, diplomacy, and adherence to international law”, the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He reaffirmed that Pakistan continues to play a “responsible and proactive role in mitigating regional tensions and promoting cooperative security frameworks”. The statement comes amid heightened tensions in the Middle East amid the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/israel-iran-conflict">Israel-Iran war</a> as the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918216/how-trump-a-self-proclaimed-peacemaker-embraced-israels-campaign-against-iran">weighs</a> whether to intervene militarily or not.</p>
<p>Participants, the ISPR said, noted the “openness and clarity of the COAS’s perspectives and appreciated Pakistan’s consistent and principled policies”. “The interaction was marked by a spirit of mutual understanding and was widely regarded as a positive step toward enhancing strategic dialogue between Pakistan and the United States,” it added.</p>
<p>The interaction also provided an opportunity to articulate Pakistan’s principled stance on key regional and global issues, and to deepen understanding of Pakistan’s strategic outlook, the military’s media wing noted. It reflected the country’s “commitment to transparent diplomacy, international engagement, and the pursuit of peaceful coexistence through principled and proactive dialogue”.</p></p>

            <p><p>An Islamabad court on Friday extended the physical remand of the main suspect in the murder case of social media influencer Sana Yousaf for another three days.</p>
<p>Islamabad Police had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915163/faisalabad-suspect-held-for-17-year-old-social-media-influencers-islamabad-murder-over-repeated-rejections">arrested</a> Umar Hayat, the main suspect in the 17-year-old’s murder, on June 3, nearly a day after she was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915163/murder-case-filed-after-17-year-old-social-media-influencer-shot-dead-in-islamabad">gunned down</a> in her house in the federal capital. Police had claimed the man murdered Sana because she repeatedly refused his advances.</p>
<p>Hayat was presented before the court of Judicial Magistrate Mohammad Hafeez upon the completion of his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917547/accused-in-sana-yousuf-murder-case-given-in-police-custody">four-day</a> physical remand. His <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915468">14-day judicial remand</a> at the Adiala Jail for his identification parade had already been completed, with the victim’s mother and aunt identifying him.</p>

<p>Deputy district public prosecutors (DDPPs) Adnan Ali and Raja Naveed Hussain, along with Investigation Officer (IO) Mazhar Bashir Khan, appeared on behalf of the state before Magistrate Hafeez.</p>
<p>Hussain informed the judge that the vehicle used by the suspect had been recovered, while his phone was yet to be taken into custody. “The suspect is quite clever and understands the gravity of the crime, which is why he is not letting us recover his mobile phone,” he said.</p>
<p>IO Bashir then requested the court to extend the detained man’s remand by seven days for further “investigation and recovery”, according to the written order.</p>
<p>However, the magistrate approved the remand for another three days, directing the police to produce the suspect before the court on June 23.</p>

<p>Sana’s mobile phone and the murder weapon had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915163#:~:text=recovered%20the%20murder%20weapon%20and%20pistol%20from%20the%20man%2C%20as%20well%20as%20the%20mobile%20phone%20used%20by%20the%20slain%20girl">recovered</a> from the suspect’s possession when he was arrested.</p>
<p>“The ruthless killer took the phone with him after the murder to destroy evidence. In order to apprehend the accused, raids were conducted at over 11 locations in three cities. The accused is a 22-year-old unemployed man who repeatedly attempted to contact the victim. Upon her refusal to respond, he committed the murder,” said the police.</p>
<p>The incident had sparked widespread outrage across the country, including from <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193702/the-murder-of-teenage-tiktok-star-sana-yousaf-is-exposing-the-rot-in-our-society">citizens</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915375/mahira-khan-saba-qamar-other-stars-call-for-justice-for-sana-yousaf-in-a-world-that-keeps-failing-girls">celebrities</a> and even President Asif Ali Zardari’s daughter, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916285/dont-let-them-silence-you-says-aseefa-on-sana-yousaf-murder">MNA Aseefa</a>.</p></p>
