            <p><p>Brics leaders at a summit on Sunday took aim at US President Donald Trump’s “indiscriminate” import tariffs and recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921439/the-israel-iran-ceasefire-appears-to-be-holding-whats-next-for-the-middle-east">Israeli-US strikes</a> on Iran.</p>
<p>The 11 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910457">emerging nations</a> — including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — account for about half the world’s population and 40 per cent of global economic output.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>The bloc is divided about much, but found common cause when it comes to the mercurial US leader and his stop-start <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922286/trump-says-probably-12-tariff-letters-being-sent-out-on-monday">tariff wars</a> — even if it avoided naming him directly.</p>
<p>Voicing “serious concerns about the rise of unilateral tariff” measures, Brics members said the tariffs risked hurting the global economy, according to a summit joint statement.</p>
<p>Trump fired back at the bloc directly on social media on Sunday night.</p>
<p>“Any country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of Brics will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10 per cent Tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy,” Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114809574296066307" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on his Truth Social platform.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch    media--uneven  media--stretch">
        <div class="media__item  "><img alt="" src="https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/070831292696e2e.png" /></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Earlier, Brics also offered symbolic backing to fellow member Iran, condemning a series of military strikes on nuclear and other targets carried out by Israel and the United States.</p>
<p>In April, Trump threatened allies and rivals alike with a slew of punitive duties, before offering a months-long reprieve in the face of a fierce market sell-off.</p>
<p>Trump has warned he will impose unilateral levies on partners unless they reach “deals” by August 1.</p>
<p>In an apparent concession to US allies such as Brazil, India and Saudi Arabia, the summit declaration did not criticize the United States or its president by name at any point.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#no-show" id="no-show" title="Permalink"></a>No show</h2>
<p>Conceived two decades ago as a forum for fast-growing economies, the BRICS have come to be seen as a Chinese-driven counterbalance to US and western European power.</p>
<p>But as the group has expanded to include Iran, Saudi Arabia and others, it has struggled to reach meaningful consensus on issues from the Gaza onslaught to challenging US global dominance.</p>
<p>Brics nations, for example, collectively called for a peaceful two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict — despite Tehran’s long-standing position that Israel should be destroyed.</p>
<p>An Iranian diplomatic source said his government’s “reservations” had been conveyed to Brazilian hosts. Still, Iran stopped short of rejecting the statement outright.</p>
<p>In perhaps a further sign of the diplomatic sensitivities, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister skipped Sunday’s discussions entirely, according to a Brazilian government source.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is among the world’s leading beneficiaries of high-tech US military exports and is a long-standing US partner.</p>
<p>The political punch of this year’s summit has been depleted by the absence of China’s Xi Jinping, who skipped the meeting for the first time in his 12 years as president.</p>
<p>The Chinese leader is not the only notable absentee. Russian President Vladimir Putin, charged with war crimes in Ukraine, also opted to stay away, participating via video link.</p>
<p>He told counterparts that Brics had become a key player in global governance.</p>
<p>The summit also called for regulation governing artificial intelligence and said the technology could not be the preserve of only rich nations.</p>
<p>The commercial AI sector is currently dominated by US tech giants, although China and other nations have rapidly developing capacity.</p></p>

            <p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet on Monday with US President Donald Trump, who expressed hope for a “deal this week” between Israel and Hamas that sees hostages released from the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Indirect <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922220/hamas-ready-for-immediate-talks-on-ceasefire-proposal">negotiations</a> between Israel and Hamas began on Sunday evening in Doha, aiming to broker a ceasefire and reach an agreement on the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.</p>
<p>Trump said on Sunday that there was a “good chance” of reaching an agreement.</p>
<p>“We’ve gotten a lot of the hostages out, but pertaining to the remaining hostages, quite a few of them will be coming out,” he told journalists.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, speaking before boarding his flight to Washington on Sunday, said his meeting with Trump could “definitely help advance this” deal.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said he dispatched the team to Doha with “clear instructions” to reach an agreement “under the conditions that we have agreed to.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>He previously said Hamas’ response to a draft US-backed ceasefire proposal, conveyed through Qatari and Egyptian mediators, contained “unacceptable” demands.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#important-mission" id="important-mission" title="Permalink"></a>‘Important mission’</h2>
<p>Two Palestinian sources close to the discussions told <em>AFP</em> the proposal included a 60-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921634/trump-urges-60-day-gaza-ceasefire-deal-ahead-of-netanyahu-visit">truce</a>, during which Hamas would release 10 living hostages and several bodies in exchange for Palestinians detained by Israel.</p>
<p>However, they said, the group was also demanding certain conditions for Israel’s withdrawal, guarantees against a resumption of fighting during negotiations, and the return of the UN-led aid distribution system.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has an “important mission” in Washington, “advancing a deal to bring all our hostages home,” said Israeli President Isaac Herzog after meeting him on Sunday.</p>
<p>Trump is not scheduled to meet the Israeli premier until 6:30pm (3:30am PKT) on Monday, the White House said, without the usual presence of journalists.</p>
<p>Of the 251 hostages taken by Hamas during the 2023 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1779807">attack</a>, 49 are still being held in Gaza, including 27, the Israeli military says, are dead.</p>
<p>Since Hamas’s October 2023 attack sparked the massive Israeli offensive in Gaza, mediators have brokered two temporary halts in the fighting. They have seen hostages freed in exchange for some of the thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Recent efforts to broker a new truce have repeatedly failed, with the primary point of contention being Israel’s rejection of Hamas’s demand for a lasting ceasefire.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#enough-blood" id="enough-blood" title="Permalink"></a>‘Enough blood’</h2>
<p>In Gaza, the territory’s civil defence agency reported 26 people killed by Israeli forces on Sunday, 10 of them in a strike in Gaza City’s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood.</p>
<p>“We are losing young people, families and children every day, and this must stop now,” Sheikh Radwan resident Osama al-Hanawi told <em>AFP.</em></p>
<p>“Enough blood has been shed.”</p>
<p>Contacted by <em>AFP</em>, the Israeli military said it could not comment on specific strikes without precise coordinates.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#hundreds-killed-seeking-aid" id="hundreds-killed-seeking-aid" title="Permalink"></a>Hundreds killed seeking aid</h2>
<p>The offensive has created dire humanitarian conditions for the more than two million people in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>A US- and Israel-backed group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), took the lead in food distribution in the territory in late May, when Israel partially lifted a more than two-month blockade on aid deliveries.</p>
<p>But its operations have had a chaotic rollout, with repeated reports of aid seekers <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919902/israel-kills-another-46-waiting-for-aid-in-gaza">killed</a> near its facilities while awaiting rations.</p>
<p>UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the GHF over concerns that it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The UN human rights office said last week that more than 500 people have been killed waiting to access food from GHF distribution points.</p>
<p>The Gaza health ministry on Sunday placed the toll even higher, at 751 killed. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed at least 57,418 people in Gaza.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922486/death-toll-in-lyari-building-collapse-stands-at-27-as-rescue-operation-ends-on-3rd-day' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll in Lyari building collapse stands at 27 as rescue operation ends on 3rd day</strong></a>
            <p><p>Rescuers on Sunday concluded their operation to recover people from the site of a five-storey building which collapsed in Karachi earlier this week, with the final death toll standing at 27.</p>
<p>Rescue teams worked overnight on Friday to pull out more bodies from the rubble of the building situated in Lyari on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market.</p>
<p>“The rescue operation was completed on Sunday evening,” Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>. “No more human casualties have been found; thus, the total death toll stands at 27 people, whose bodies were earlier recovered and transported to Civil Hospital Karachi.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that acting Rescue 1122 Director General Dr Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh remained on the ground for over 30 hours, directly commanding the rescue operation.</p>
<p>Khan said that the exact cause of the collapse would be determined later, but suggested it was “because the building was dilapidated”.</p>
<p>“A day before the collapse, residents felt a ‘shock’. It can be said now that it was not an earthquake, but the building’s structure being shaken or dislocated,” Khan said. “There were 12 families, though some families had already left the building after the tremors.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#difficulties" id="difficulties" title="Permalink"></a>Difficulties</h2>
<p>The Rescue-1122 spokesperson said that there was a lack of coordination among different rescue organisations and that staffers from two private rescue organisations fought during the operation.</p>
<p>“They sustained injuries to the head during the scuffle,” Khan said. “It would have been more appropriate if one organisation had been given command, under which all rescue institutions could have worked.”</p>
<p>Another problem, according to Khan, was that relatives remained at the site as they were not willing to be moved to any government or private shelter. The rescue workers faced “immense pressure” from the relatives, he added.</p>
<p>Khan added that there was difficulty in moving heavy machinery like cranes due to the narrow streets.</p>
<p>“We used the same high-tech equipment that was used during the recent earthquake in Turkiye,” Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>. “The use of such high-tech equipment, like life detectors helped rescue several people safely with some minor injuries. Without this equipment, the use of heavy machinery might have caused further injury.”</p>
<p>He said that over 100 personnel took part in the operation for three days, working in different shifts.</p>
<p>At around 1:30pm, Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “it will take five to six more hours to complete the rescue operation”.</p>
<p>A total of 27 bodies were recovered, including nine women, 15 men, a 13-year-old child, a 10-year-old child, and a one-year-old infant. The bodies were transported to Civil Hospital Karachi by Edhi Ambulance.</p>
<p>Ten people who were injured have been discharged.</p>
<p>While speaking to the media today after leading the Ashura procession, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah provided details on the building collapse.</p>
<p>“Immediate rescue efforts were launched to save any survivors trapped under the rubble,” he said, adding that the bodies recovered had been handed over to the families.</p>
<p>He echoed Khan’s statement of rescue operations being expected to conclude today.</p>
<p>The chief minister assured that a detailed inquiry into the causes of the collapse would be conducted, with committees already formed to investigate the matter thoroughly.</p>
<p>He revealed that over 480 buildings in old city areas, mostly in District South, have been declared dangerous.</p>
<p>“The government plans to assist affected residents in finding alternative housing,” he said.</p>
<p>CM Murad added that the recently collapsed building was constructed only a few months ago, apparently without proper approval, and those responsible for unauthorised construction would face strict punishment.</p>
<p>He also urged the public to verify that any building they purchase has proper approval from the Building Control Authority.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that several people resist evacuation due to poverty and lack of alternatives, often buying or renting cheaper properties without checking safety approvals and later demanding government protection.</p>
<p>While empathising with these difficulties, he stressed that sometimes strict action is necessary to ensure public safety, as demonstrated by recent enforcement measures.</p></p>
