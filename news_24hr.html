            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919759/defence-minister-asif-blasts-western-hypocrisy-says-iran-never-initiated-war-with-israel' target='_blank'><strong>Defence Minister Asif blasts ‘western hypocrisy’, says Iran never initiated war with Israel</strong></a>
            <p><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has strongly condemned the Israeli aggression towards Iran and criticised the Western world’s “double standard”, saying that the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) performance was “tainted with hypocrisy and a selective approach”.</p>
<p>Asif earlier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919222/pakistan-stands-firm-with-iran-asif">stressed</a> that Pakistan stood in “complete solidarity” with Iran amid Israel’s unprovoked and “unjustified aggression” against Tehran, which began on June 13 and escalated over 12 days. The conflict intensified after the US intervened by striking three of Iran’s nuclear sites. Tehran first responded by launching missiles at Tel Aviv, then targeted US bases in Qatar following the American strikes. On Tuesday morning, US President Donald Trump announced that Iran and Israel had reached a “ceasefire”.</p>
<p>Israel, without evidence, claimed that its initial strike on Iran was “preventive”, meant to address an immediate, inevitable threat from the Islamic Republic’s part to construct a nuclear bomb. Tel Aviv also suggested that the IAEA report released on June 12, which condemned Iran for material violations of its Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) commitments until the early 2000s, constituted such an emergency. However, the IAEA also seemed to reject that claim, since there was nothing in the report that was not already known to the relevant parties, according to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/6/15/the-real-reason-israel-attacked-iran" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a>.</em></p>
<p>In an <a class="link--external" href="https://www.irna.ir/news/85871529/%D9%88%D8%B2%DB%8C%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D9%BE%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%BA%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D9%88-%D8%A2%DA%98%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B3-%D8%A8%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%84%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B1%DA%98%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%A2%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%87" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with an Iranian state-run news agency <em>IRNA</em> in Islamabad, Asif said, “Unlike Iran, the Westerners have destroyed the opportunity for diplomacy and are the cause of the beginning of the aggressions of the Zionist regime and the United States.”</p>
<p>The defence minister emphasised that Iran’s approach had been “very constructive’ and Tehran never sought confrontation, adding that Israel wanted to “overshadow the region to push the situation towards war”.</p>
<p>He added that “a regime that is not even a member of the NPT and there is no monitoring and inspection of its nuclear arsenals, can do anything and has the authorisation to carry out any aggression and attack on Palestine, Gaza, Yemen and now against Iran.”</p>
<p>“All these countries are the targets of these deliberate and reckless actions of Tel Aviv, which is not held accountable by the IAEA,” Asif further said.</p>
<p>He condemned Israel’s “terrorist attacks and the US aggressive crime against Iran’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">nuclear facilities</a>”, considering these actions contrary to international law, the UN Charter and humanitarian norms.</p>
<p>“I think the situation has escalated to a dangerous level, especially over the past few weeks when Iran continuously emphasised the need for negotiations and participation in this entire process, and that the Iranians have never left the negotiating table,” he was quoted as saying by <em>IRNA</em>.</p>
<p>“Iran has never initiated the war, but both the destruction of diplomacy and the initiation of the war were carried out by the other side (America and Israel), which led to the illegitimate aggression of Israel against the nation,” he added.</p>
<p>Asif further said, “It is ridiculous that the West always wants Iran to return to the negotiating table, because the Iranians did not leave the negotiating table, but have always demanded interaction and negotiations.”</p>
<p>He noted that even when Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was negotiating with the Europeans, another aggression against the country took place.</p>
<p>Asif said Israel’s “continued aggression against Palestinians had now reached Iran”, calling it a “conspiracy planned and implemented by the Zionist regime”.</p>
<p>“Iranians stand with Palestine, and this is never a crime. Human dignity and the defence of religious values must be followed by the international community, and they must stand against Israeli aggression and rush to help the Palestinians,” he reaffirmed.</p>
<p>He added that the US and Israel were trampling on all international laws, human values and traditions, and “massacring children, women, old and young in Gaza”.</p>
<p>The defence minister told the people of Iran to stand firm and steadfast because “God is with them and all nations in the world feel the pain of the Iranian nation because this is a crime and a clear aggression against Iran, and these crimes will definitely be responded to.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Six people were killed and seven were injured after a passenger bus caught fire after colliding with a loader rickshaw carrying petrol on the Western Bypass in Quetta, police said on Monday.</p>
<p>Fatal road accidents on highways <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906089">occur frequently</a> in Pakistan, mainly due to overspeeding, hazardous overtaking and disregard for traffic rules.</p>
<p>According to Shalkot Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Athar Rashid, “In the tragic incident, five passengers on the bus were killed and seven others were injured.”</p>
<p>He said that the bodies of the deceased had become unrecognisable due to the burns.</p>
<p>“The injured were taken to the Bolan Medical Complex and Civil Hospital, and two of them are in critical condition,” he said.</p>
<p>DSP Rashid added that the local bus was going from Nawan area to Hazarganji when the accident occurred at the Raisani area on the Western Bypass, adding that the bus caught fire after colliding with a petrol-laden loader rickshaw.</p>
<p>In a statement, Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind expressed sorrow over the incident.</p>
<p>“We express our heartfelt sympathy to the families of the passengers who died in the tragic accident,” he said. “The injured are being provided with immediate and the best medical assistance. Treatment and facilities are being ensured for them.”</p>
<p>Rind said that an investigation was launched into the incident, stating, “Strict action will be taken against those responsible once the investigation is completed.”</p>
<p>He also said that all possible help and support will be provided to the affected families.</p>
<p>Separately, Adviser on Local Government Hamza Zehri also extended condolences to the bereaved families, directing authorities to provide facilities to the injured.</p>
<p>He said, “No one will be allowed to play with the lives and property of citizens. [The] Metropolitan Corporation should seize mini petrol pumps and installations established in densely populated areas of the city.”</p>
<p>“Those responsible for the Western Bypass incident will be identified and punished,” he added.</p>
<p>In April, a bus driver was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903481">burnt alive</a> and seven passengers were injured as their bus caught fire after hitting a mini-truck laden with pesticides at Gojra on the M-4 motorway near Nawan Lahore interchange.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a fatal collision between two cars near Dhabeji on the Karachi-Thatta section of the National Highway <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884245">claimed</a> four lives, among them a newly-wed man and his mother, and left six injured when the vehicles caught fire following the accident.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919730/amnesty-calls-out-authorities-for-failing-to-protect-kp-civilians-from-repeated-quadcopter-attacks' target='_blank'><strong>Amnesty calls out authorities for failing to protect KP civilians from ‘repeated quadcopter attacks’</strong></a>
            <p><p>Rights organisation Amnesty International on Tuesday criticised Pakistani authorities for “failing to protect the lives and property of civilians” in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa amid a surge in suspected quadcopter and drone attacks.</p>
<p>The statement came in response to reports of multiple such attacks in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860946">Khyber Pakhtunkhwa</a> and Balochistan over the past year. In <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901160/11-killed-in-mardan-security-action">March</a>, at least 11 people were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, while in May,  a suspected quadcopter munitions drop claimed the lives of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912007/locals-stage-sit-in-as-kp-minister-denounces-killing-of-3-children-in-alleged-north-waziristan-drone-strike">four children and injured five</a> others in North Waziristan District’s Mir Ali tehsil. The military clarified that security forces were “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912393/security-forces-falsely-implicated-in-north-waziristan-incident-ispr">falsely implicated</a>” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918509/child-killed-5-injured-after-suspected-drone-hits-kps-south-waziristan-police">Last Friday</a>, a child was killed and five others were injured after a suspected drone hit South Waziristan District, prompting condemnations from KP politicians.</p>
<p>“Pakistani authorities have failed to take action to protect the lives and property of civilians in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa who continue to pay the price of an escalating number of drone strikes in the province,” today’s statement by Amnesty said, quoting the group’s South Asia Deputy Regional Director Isabelle Lassée.</p>
<p>“Use of drones and quadcopters to conduct attacks resulting in the unlawful killing of civilians violates international law. Reports that the strikes have hit homes and volleyball games indicate a reckless disregard for civilian life.”</p>
<p>The statement added that Friday’s drone strike was part of an “alarming series of attacks” which have escalated since March of this year.</p>

<p>“While Pakistani authorities have often denied responsibility for these attacks, they are obligated to conduct prompt, independent, transparent and effective investigations into these attacks and bring all those responsible to justice through fair trials.”</p>
<p>Last month, 22 civilians, including children and youth, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913755">injured</a> when a suspected quadcopter dropped munitions in the Birmal tehsil of Lower South Waziristan district, officials confirmed.</p>
<p>The incident occurred near Karmazi Stop on the Wana-Azam Warsak Road.</p>
<p>In October of last year, as many as 13 civilians, mostly children, who received <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866955">injuries</a> when a quadcopter allegedly dropped explosives on a marketplace in Tirah valley here on Monday, were brought to hospitals in Peshawar for treatment, local sources had told <em>Dawn</em>.</p></p>

            <p><p><strong>Emmanuel Mwamba </strong>and <strong>Fiona Mulaisho</strong> respond to an editorial on US aid cuts to Zambia and huge sums taken out of the country by multinationals</p><p>Your editorial (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/10/the-guardian-view-on-zambias-trumpian-predicament-us-aid-cuts-are-dwarfed-by-a-far-bigger-heist">The Guardian view on Zambia’s Trumpian predicament: US aid cuts are dwarfed by a far bigger heist, 10 January</a>) highlights research by Prof Andrew Fischer, and the exploitation of Zambia’s commodity resources via illicit financial schemes. Many Zambians have raised the issue of this looting for years, but have met coordinated resistance. Consequently, Zambia’s treasury loses billions of dollars in revenue. These losses are driven by well-known multinationals working in concert with certain insiders close&nbsp;to the Zambian state.</p><p>Your editorial also says: “The US decision to cut $50m a year in aid to Zambia … is dreadful, and the reason given, corruption, rings hollow.” Alas, I disagree and wish to place this in context.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/ordinary-zambians-lose-out-twice-to-global-looting-and-local-corruption">Continue reading...</a></p>
