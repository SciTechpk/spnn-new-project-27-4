                <h2>Fazl, others urge govt to review decision to nominate Trump for Nobel Peace Prize</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistani politicians on Sunday raised their concerns over the government’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514/govt-to-recommend-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize-for-decisive-diplomatic-intervention-in-india-pakistan-crisis">decision</a> to recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, as Washington <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">joined</a> Israel’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">war</a> with Iran.</p>
<p>The government had decided to nominate Trump for the prestigious award to hail his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” during last month’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">Pak-India conflict</a>, when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">US mediation</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/GovtofPakistan/status/1936159807326900577" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, it had highlighted that Trump “demonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi”, which ultimately secured a ceasefire.</p>
<p>However, after the US bombed Iran’s Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites, with Trump saying they were “totally obliterated”, leaders across the political spectrum joined Pakistani <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193760/can-you-believe-pakistan-nominated-trump-for-a-nobel-peace-prize-the-internet-cant-either">citizens</a> in voicing their reservations.</p>
<p>Veteran politician Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who heads his own faction of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F), demanded that the government rescind its decision.</p>
<p>“President Trump’s claim of peace has proven to be false, the proposal for the Nobel Prize should be withdrawn,” Fazl told workers at a party meeting in Murree today, according to a JUI-F <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/juipakofficial/status/1936808805804765304" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>

<p>He said that Trump’s recent meeting and lunch with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir “pleased Pakistani rulers so much” that they recommended nominating the US president for the Nobel prize.</p>
<p>The JUI-F chief noted that Trump won the presidential election with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20what%20I%20want%20to%20be%3A%20a%20peacemaker%20and%20unifier.">slogan of peace</a> but was “proven false in his claim”.</p>
<p>Fazl said that when Pakistan “destroyed India’s defence force”, President Trump intervened and said he had declared a ceasefire.</p>
<p>“[But] Trump has supported the Israeli attacks on Palestine, Syria, Lebanon and Iran. How can this be a sign of peace?” Fazl questioned. “With the blood of Afghans and Palestinians on America’s hands, how can he claim to be a proponent of peace?”</p>
<p>Trump campaigned for office as a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20what%20I%20want%20to%20be%3A%20a%20peacemaker%20and%20unifier.">peacemaker</a>” who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end wars in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging five months into his presidency.</p>
<p>The US has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1873752">several</a> times <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1815897">vetoed</a> resolutions calling for a ceasefire in Gaza at the UN Security Council, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915498/us-vetoes-security-councils-call-for-gaza-ceasefire">latest</a> earlier this month.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Fazl said his party was in favour of friendship with the US but not of its “slavery”.</p>
<p>“National sovereignty, the right of the people to govern themselves, and economic freedom should be maintained in relations with America,” the JUI-F chief asserted.</p>
<p>Fazl further said that in the last three months, a US delegation has visited him three times, after which he attended their diplomatic ceremony in Islamabad.</p>
<p>He also expressed his view that the attacks on Iran were an attempt to stop China’s economic growth in the Middle East. China is the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899284#:~:text=China%20is%20the%20largest%20importer%20of%20Iranian%20oil.">largest importer</a> of Iranian oil.</p>
<p>“Pakistan’s economic strength in the region has been affected the most. The economic balance is shifting towards Asia instead of Europe, which is a good omen for Asia,” he said.</p>

<p>Calls to reconsider the government’s decision also came from other politicians.</p>
<p>Former senator Mushahid Hussain <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/Mushahid/status/1936730192094876044" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X: “Since Trump is no longer a potential peacemaker, but a leader who has willfully unleashed an illegal war, [the] Pakistan government must now review, rescind and revoke his Nobel nomination!”</p>
<p>He said Trump had been “trapped by Netanyahu and Israeli war lobby, committing [the] biggest blunder of his presidency”.</p>
<p>“Trump will now end up presiding over [the] decline of America!”</p>

<p>Trump “engaged in deception and betrayed his own promise not to start new wars”, Mushahid said in another <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/Mushahid/status/1936641176360112359" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a>, strongly condemning the US attacks on Iran.</p>
<p>Hussain, former chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Defence, had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514/govt-to-recommend-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize-for-decisive-diplomatic-intervention-in-pak-india-crisis#:~:text=request%20for%20comment.-,Mushahid%20Hussain,-%2C%20former%20chairman%20of">previously said</a> that if the nomination “panders to Trump’s ego, so be it”.</p>

<p>In a separate <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTIofficial/status/1936692515794551145" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a>, the opposition PTI condemned the “unprovoked” US strikes and voiced “total support” for Iran’s sovereignty.</p>
<p>Raoof Hasan, head of PTI’s political think-tank, said the government’s decision was now a “cause of unmitigated shame and embarrassment for those who were instrumental in making the choice”.</p>
<p>“That’s why it is said that legitimacy can neither be bought nor gifted,” said Hasan, as he took a jibe at the government. He also <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/RaoofHasan/status/1936655007140450692" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denounced</a> the US’s “total disregard for international covenants” through the attacks on Iran.</p>

                <h2>Suicide bombing at Damascus church kills 20</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least 20 people were killed and dozens injured when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the Mar Elias Church in the Dweila neighbourhood of the Syrian capital Damascus on Sunday, health authorities and security sources said.</p>
<p>It was the first suicide bombing in Damascus since Bashar al-Assad was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1877481">toppled</a> by an Islamist-led rebel insurgency in December.</p>
<p>Syria’s interior ministry said the suicide bomber was a member of Islamic State. “He entered the church, opened fire and then detonated his explosive vest,” a ministry statement added.</p>
<p>A security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two men were involved in the attack, including the one who blew himself up.</p>
<p>Islamic State has been behind several attempted attacks on churches in Syria since Assad’s fall, but this was the first to succeed, another security source told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>Syria’s state news agency cited the health ministry as saying that 52 people were also injured in the blast.</p>
<p>A livestream from the site by Syria’s civil defence, the White Helmets, showed scenes of destruction from inside the church, including a bloodied floor and shattered pews and masonry.</p>
<p>Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the offensive against Assad before taking over in January for a transitional phase, has repeatedly said he will protect minorities.</p>
<p>“We unequivocally condemn the abhorrent terrorist suicide bombing at the Mar Elias Greek Orthodox Church in Damascus, Syria,” the Greek foreign ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We demand that the Syrian transitional authorities take immediate action to hold those involved accountable and implement measures to guarantee the safety of Christian communities and all religious groups, allowing them to live without fear.”</p>
<p>Islamic State had previously targeted religious minorities, including a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1264204">major attack</a> on Shia pilgrims in Sayeda Zainab in 2016 — one of the most notorious bombings during Assad’s rule.</p>
<p>The latest assault underscores the group’s continued ability to exploit security gaps despite the collapse of its territorial control and years of counterterrorism efforts.</p></p>
