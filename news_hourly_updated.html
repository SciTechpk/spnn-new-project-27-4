            <p><p>In a breakthrough moment amid military escalation between India and Pakistan, both nations have agreed to a ceasefire pushed by United States President Donald Trump, with politicians hailing the move.</p>
<p>The intense military exchange began in the early hours of Saturday after India attacked Pakistani airbases. Soon afterwards, Pakistan launched its retaliatory operation, Bunyan-um-Marsoos, which came to an end on Saturday afternoon when both nations agreed to a full ceasefire, effective 4:30 PKT.</p>
<p>The ceasefire was announced by US President Trump in a <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114483405683675564" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on his social media platform Truth Social.</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#operations-commence" id="operations-commence" title="Permalink"></a>Operations commence</h2>
<p>At around 3:30am on Saturday, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that India targeted the Pakistan Air Force‚Äôs (PAF) Nur Khan (Chaklala, Rawalpindi), Murid (Chakwal) and Rafiqui (Shorkot in Jhang district) air bases, adding that all PAF assets remained safe.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference, he said that India was ‚Äúpushing the whole region towards a dangerous war with its madness, aggression and deceit‚Äù. The DG ISPR also said that India had fired missiles at Afghanistan and used drones to conduct attacks as well.</p>
<p>The military spokesperson said that ‚Äúthe majority‚Äù of Indian missiles fired at PAF airbases were intercepted by the armed forces‚Äô air defence systems. He noted that the few Indian missiles that were not intercepted and ‚Äúsneaked in‚Äù had ‚Äúnot been able to cause any damage‚Äù to PAF‚Äôs flying assets, as per the initial damage assessment reports.</p>
<p>The DG ISPR said that the air defence systems of the armed forces were able to ‚Äúsuccessfully prevent the desired objectives of India‚Äù.</p>
<p>He added the missiles and drone attacks by India on Afghanistan shortly after attacks on the territory of Indian Punjab were ‚Äúpart of a larger sinister plan to push the region and beyond into havoc‚Äù.</p>
<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry said that the PAF had the electronic signatures of all Indian missiles, including ‚Äúfrom where they were initiated and what was targeted‚Äù.</p>
<p>The military‚Äôs spokesperson assured the nation that the armed forces were ‚Äúvigilant and thwarting all these cowardly acts of aggression by Indians‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese blatant acts of aggression by India actually reflect the paranoia within Indian mindset which continues to grow after failure of each of these acts and the paranoia continues to also grow once it realises that they cannot break the resolve and will of the people of Pakistan which actually strengthens and further grows with each such cowardly act.‚Äù</p>
<p>He further said that the ‚Äúgrowing frustration and paranoia‚Äù of the Indians would be ‚Äúfurther compounded‚Äù.</p>
<p>At 4:38am, state-run <em>PTV News</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1920986800597668347" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that the Pakistani military had launched its counter-attack against Indian aggression.</p>

<p>He said the kingdom was deeply concerned about the current situation in South Asia, and reiterated his country‚Äôs call for de-escalation, as well as peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes between Pakistan and India, in accordance with international law and the UN Security Council‚Äôs relevant resolutions, the PMO said.</p>
<p>While discussing the prevailing situation in South Asia, the PM strongly condemned India‚Äôs missile and drone strikes against Pakistan that had resulted in the martyrdom of scores of innocent civilians, including women and children, as well as damage to civilian infrastructures.</p>
<p>He stressed that India‚Äôs unprovoked and unjustified acts of aggression had violated Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity, and seriously endangered regional peace and stability.</p>
<p>Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar received Adel Al-Jubeir at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and exchanged views on the evolving regional situation.</p>
<p><strong>FO briefing</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, at the weekly briefing, the FO spokesperson said that in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, the Indian leadership has ‚Äúonce again used the bogey of terrorism to advance its sham narrative of victimhood, jeopardising regional peace.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs jingoism and war hysteria should be a source of serious concern for the world,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>The spokesperson reiterated that Pakistan rejected any attempt to link it to the attack in Pahalgam.</p>
<p>He noted that a number of countries and international organisations had called on both countries to exercise restraint over the past two weeks, and it was ‚Äúhighly deplorable that India did not pay heed to these calls‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe international community should hold India accountable for its irresponsible, unlawful and belligerent conduct,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe assertion that Pakistan escalated the situation through the Pahalgam attack of April 22 is totally absurd. To date, India has not been able to produce any credible and verifiable evidence of Pakistan‚Äôs involvement in the attack.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo the contrary, the acts of aggression committed by its armed forces had the approval and support of its entire government,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThus, it is India that has escalated the situation by violating Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty and killing civilians.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that ‚Äúthe Pakistani forces did not attack Pahalgam, but the Indian forces did attack multiple locations in Pakistan,‚Äù adding that Pakistan reserves the right to take all measures in its self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter.</p>
<p>The spokesperson noted that on April 26, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had called for a ‚Äúneutral and transparent‚Äù investigation into the Pahalgam attack, yet ‚ÄúIndia chose the path of belligerence and aggression.‚Äù</p>
<p>The FO spokesperson also said Indian claims of targeting terrorists or terrorist infrastructure ‚Äúare blatantly false [and] it is a matter of record that Indian strikes resulted in the martyrdom of civilians, including women and children.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mr Khan said ‚Äúthe current Indian dispensation is bent upon weaponising water; holding in abeyance of IWT is unilateral and illegal.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan is an agrarian economy. Millions of people are dependent on the water being regulated by the treaty. The Indian decision is equivalent to an attack on the people of Pakistan and the economy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor Pakistan, the Indian announcement is of no legal consequence. The treaty remains enforced and fully binding on the parties,‚Äù he said.</p>
