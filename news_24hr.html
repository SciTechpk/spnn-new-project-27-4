            <p><p>Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad on Thursday said that no decision has been made to postpone the federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-26, clarifying that the previously announced date of June 10 remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Amid <a class="link--external" href="https://www.geo.tv/latest/606744-govt-may-postpone-budget-again-amid-eid#:~:text=Earlier%20today,%20Finance%20Ministry%20sources%20indicated%20that%20the%20federal%20government%20could%20further%20delay%20the%20presentation%20of%20the%20Budget%202025%E2%80%9326%20due%20to%20scheduling%20constraints%20posed%20by%20Eid%20holidays." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">media reports</a> claiming that the budget had once again been rescheduled due to the Eidul Azha holidays, Schehzad wrote on X today that no decision has been made to postpone or reschedule the budget.</p>
<p>“As communicated earlier, the upcoming Federal Budget FY26 is on schedule to be announced on June 10, 2025,” he wrote. “Similarly, the upcoming Pakistan Economic Survey FY25 is scheduled to be announced on June 9, 2025.”</p>

<p>Additionally, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal told reporters that there was no change in the budget date.</p>
<p>“The federal budget will be presented on June 10,” he told the media after exiting a committee meeting at the National Assembly.</p>
<p>According to the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), Eidul Azha is expected to fall on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912584">June 7</a>, which means the third day of Eid will likely fall on June 9 — the same day the Economic Survey is due to be released.</p>
<p>Last week, Schehzad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912867">announced</a> on X that the federal budget would be presented on June 10, while the Pakistan Economic Survey would be released a day earlier.</p>
<p>Before that, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909569">announced</a> that the federal government will present the next fiscal year’s budget on June 2, with a 16 per cent lower development allocation of Rs921 billion, resulting in the likely closure of about 200 ongoing development projects.</p>
<p>Last year, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1839433">presented</a> his first federal budget with a total outlay of Rs18.9 trillion, which analysts said was broadly “in line with IMF guidelines”.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb, during the budget presentation, said that the goal was to widen the tax base to avoid burdening existing taxpayers.</p></p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday landed in Tajikistan as he continues his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912856">four-nation tour</a> of friendly countries.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the PM and his delegation, including Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, visited Turkiye, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913442">Iran</a> and Azerbaijan, expressing gratitude for their support during a recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military escalation</a> with India.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the PM took part in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913863">trilateral summit</a> with Turkiye and Azerbaijan. He reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to hold talks with India on the Kashmir dispute and counterterrorism, stressing New Delhi wanted the same “in all sincerity”.</p>
<p>According to state broadcaster <em>PTV News</em>, the PM arrived in the Tajik capital Dushanbe today for his two-day visit, being received by Tajik PM Kokhir Rasulzoda at the airport.</p>
<p>“Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant Syed Tariq Fatemi also accompanied the prime minister,” <em>PTV News</em> reported.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914060/pakistan-unveils-first-govt-led-strategic-bitcoin-reserve' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan unveils first govt-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve</strong></a>
            <p><p>Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib has unveiled the country’s first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.</p>
<p>Saqib was recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913419">appointed</a> as Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Crypto and Blockchain, with the status of a minister of state. He has been on a tour of the United States seeking investment in Pakistan’s crypto markets.</p>
<p>He made the announcement about the reserve after delivering a keynote address before an elite audience, which included United States Vice President JD Vance, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr, at the <a class="link--external" href="https://b.tc/conference/2025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bitcoin Vegas 2025</a> in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is no longer defined by its past. It is being reborn as a forward-looking hub of digital innovation — powered by its youth, sharpened by necessity, and led by a new generation of tech statesmen,” said Saqib, in a statement issued by his office.</p>
<p>“I’m not just here as a minister,” he said. “I’m here as the voice of a generation — a generation that is online, on-chain, and unstoppable.”</p>

</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In his keynote speech, Saqib announced the establishment of a national bitcoin wallet, “holding digital assets already in state custody — not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signalling long-term belief in decentralised finance.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He also thanked Trump for his role as a peacemaker in the recent India-Pakistan conflict and for his commitment to crypto adoption.</p>
<p>He revealed that the government had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913238">allocated</a> 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity in first phase for bitcoin mining and AI data centres, opening doors to sovereign miners, tech firms, and clean energy partners around the world.</p>
<p>The statement noted Pakistan having over 40 million crypto wallets and one of the “largest and most active freelancer economies in the world”.</p>
<p>It added that Saqib was leading the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912539">creation</a> of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) — a regulatory body designed to empower builders, protect investors, and formalise digital finance frameworks for the future.</p>
<p>“Both Pakistan and bitcoin have suffered from bad PR,” Saqib declared. “But if you look past the headlines, you’ll see something else: talent, resilience, and vision.”</p>
<p>He called on global crypto builders to come and invest in Pakistan. “If you’re building something real — come build it in Pakistan. Come build wallets for the unbanked. Come tokenise land. Come scale your mission with our youth and our unstoppable grit.”</p>
<p>During his keynote, Saqib delivered a “blueprint for the future of emerging markets in Web3 that positions Pakistan as a tech-forward, youth-powered, and opportunity-rich nation ready to lead,” the statement concluded.</p>
<p>On February 25, the government had announced it was considering establishing a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897897">National Crypto Council</a> to adopt emerging digital currencies in line with global trends. In March, it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896070">appointed</a> Saqib as the chief adviser to the finance minister on the PCC and later made him the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897964#:~:text=Bilal%20Bin%20Saqib%2C%20who%20was%20recently%20appointed%20as%20chief%20adviser%20to%20the%20finance%20minister%2C%20has%20been%20made%20the%20council%E2%80%99s%20CEO.">council’s CEO</a>.</p>
<p>According to a press release, Saqib will now be responsible for developing a comprehensive, FATF-compliant regulatory framework for digital assets, launching bitcoin mining initiatives, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, finance, and land records.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Additionally, he will also facilitate “licensing and oversight of virtual asset service providers (VASPs)” and champion “investor protection and Web3 ecosystem growth” in the country.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the government has announced the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913342">allocation</a> of 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the first phase of a national initiative to power bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.</p>
<p>According to the Finance Division, the ambitious initiative was part of a broader strategy to “monetise surplus electricity, create high-tech jobs, attract billions of dollars in foreign direct investment, and generate billions of dollars for the government”.</p></p>
