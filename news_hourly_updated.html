                <h2>12 terrorists of ‚ÄòIndian proxy‚Äô outfits killed in KP, Balochistan engagements: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Twelve terrorists of ‚ÄúIndian proxy‚Äù outfits were killed by security forces while two personnel were martyred in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the military‚Äôs media wing said on Monday.</p>
<p>The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said the intelligence-based operations (IBOs) were conducted on Saturday and Sunday against the banned militant Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan group in KP and the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Front in Balochistan.</p>
<p>It said an IBO was conducted in Lakki Marwat district during which troops engaged the enemy at its location and sent ‚Äúfive Indian sponsored‚Äù terrorists to ‚Äúhell‚Äù.</p>
<p>In a second IBO in Bannu district, two ‚ÄúIndian sponsored‚Äù terrorists were ‚Äúsuccessfully neutralised‚Äù by the security forces.</p>
<p>It added that terrorists ambushed a security forces convoy in another incident in North Waziristan district‚Äôs general area of Mir Ali, adding that two ‚ÄúIndian sponsored‚Äù terrorists were ‚Äúsent to hell‚Äù after the effective response of troops.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, during the intense fire exchange, two brave sons of soil, Sepoy Farhad Ali Turi (age: 29 years, resident of Kurram district) and Lance Naik Sabir Afridi (age: 32 years, resident of Kohat district) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced martyrdom.‚Äù</p>
<p>The ISPR said sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the areas. ‚ÄúSecurity forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian abetted and prosecuted terrorism perpetrated through their proxies, and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,‚Äù it concluded.</p>
<p>In the first Balochistan encounter, troops engaged the terrorists at their location in Awaran district‚Äôs general area of Gishkur and killed ‚ÄúIndian-sponsored terrorist Younas‚Äù in an intense fire exchange, while two more were injured.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn another engagement in Turbat City, Kech district, security forces successfully neutralised two Indian-sponsored terrorists; terrorist ring leader Sabr Ullah and terrorist Amjad alias Bichoo,‚Äù the ISPR said.</p>
<p>It added that weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from the terrorists, who were actively involved in multiple activities against law enforcement agencies and target killing of innocent civilians.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any terrorist present in the area, as security forces of Pakistan, in step with the nation, remain determined to thwart attempts by Indian proxies at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari lauded the security forces for the successful operations, terming it a positive step and saying they would continue until the complete elimination of terrorism from the country.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur resolve to eliminate terrorist elements and defend the country will remain unwavering,‚Äù he was quoted as saying in a statement from the presidency.</p>
<p><em>The Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to security forces for the operations and commended them for their professional expertise and for taking timely action against the ‚ÄúIndian agenda‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Indian conspiracy of putting in danger the life and property of innocent and unarmed citizens in Balochistan by perpetrating terrorism had been exposed,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz further said, ‚ÄúWe will foil the nefarious designs of India to undermine peace and security in Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908833">seven soldiers were martyred</a> in a blast from an improvised explosive device planted by the ‚ÄúIndian proxy‚Äù terrorist group Balochistan Liberation Army in Kacchi district.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNefarious designs of India and its proxies operating on Pakistani soil will be defeated by the valiant security forces, law enforcement agencies and the brave nation of Pakistan,‚Äù the ISPR had said.</p>
<p>Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">accused</a> India of activating its ‚Äúassets‚Äù to inte¬≠nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting ‚Äúirr¬≠e¬≠futable evidence‚Äù of Ind¬≠ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind¬≠ian military personnel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPost-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and the independent terrorist cells ‚Ä¶ to increase their activity,‚Äù he had said, using the state-designated term for the banned TTP.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Militant violence and security operations intensified in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901722/militant-attacks-in-march-surged-to-highest-level-since-2014">report</a> by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.</p>
<p>Pakistan ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>

                <h2>Locals stage sit-in as KP minister denounces killing of 3 children in alleged North Waziristan drone strike</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Relief Minister Haji Nek Muhammad Dawar on Monday strongly condemned the deaths of three children and injuries to women from an alleged drone strike in the North Waziristan district.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://www.facebook.com/nekmuhammadkhanpti/posts/pfbid0ReuaMTZ5GLzsH5Tz7d2XQiN5uDm8UvwNse1jpFKUaxJz8aEa1FKKujRiiSi7XH54l" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on his Facebook account said the alleged incident occurred in the district‚Äôs Hormuz village in Mir Ali tehsil.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have already clearly said on the floor of the KP Assembly that all types of operations and war operations should be kept away from civilian populations, so that the common people, especially innocent women and children, are not harmed,‚Äù the post read.</p>
<p>He later told <em>Dawn.com</em>: ‚ÄúWe will raise our voice at every forum and make every effort to bring those responsible to justice.‚Äù</p>
<p>The minister added that he stood with the affected family and would provide them with all possible assistance. He also ordered an immediate investigation and sought a detailed report from the institutions concerned.</p>
<p>No official statement has been issued at the federal level yet or from provincial authorities.</p>
<p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman also addressed the incident in the National Assembly today in the form of ‚Äúpositive advice‚Äù for the government.</p>
<p>He said the rulers and the establishment needed to think about giving strength, reassurance and confidence to the nation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf today still drones fall in Waziristan [‚Ä¶] how will we respond to the people? These are sensitive matters and should be reconsidered. We cannot maintain national unity without thinking about this.‚Äù</p>

<p>Meanwhile, locals began a sit-in in the tehsil‚Äôs centre with the bodies. All those who died belonged to one family, they said.</p>
<p>Local tribal leaders termed the incident a ‚Äúgovernment failure‚Äù and said that North Waziristan was being targeted once again. They demanded that an impartial commission be formed immediately to investigate the incident, adding that the sit-in would continue until they were satisfied with the investigation.</p>
<p>Former MNA Mohsin Dawar strongly condemned the alleged strike.</p>
<p>JUI-F leader Hafiz Hamdullah also expressed regret over the alleged incident and criticised the lack of coverage on the issue.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe media is silent. The federal government is silent. The KP government is silent. Politicians are silent,‚Äù he said in a post on X.</p>
