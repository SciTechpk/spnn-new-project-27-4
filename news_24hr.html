            <p><p>Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on mutual visa exemption during the 12th session of the Pakistan-UAE Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC), the Foreign Office (FO) said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The session was held following a hiatus of <a class="link--external" href="https://www.moib.gov.pk/News/64780" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">13 years</a> after it was scheduled in October 2024. The <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/11th-session-of-pakistan-uae-joint-ministerial-commission" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">last session</a> was held in Islamabad from November 6-7, 2013.</p>
<p>The FO said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1937752634267414594" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> that the session, held in Abu Dhabi a day ago, was co-chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his UAE counterpart Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan.</p>
<p>“Prior to the formal proceedings, a working group meeting of the JMC was held under the leadership of Special Assistant to the PM Tariq Bajwa and Minister of State of the UAE Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh, the statement said.</p>
<p>“The JMC reviewed the full scope of bilateral relations and agreed on concrete measures to strengthen cooperation in trade, banking, culture, investment, aviation, railways, energy, food security, climate change, defence, healthcare, manpower, higher education and information technology.”</p>

<p>It also said that both sides emphasised promoting institutional mechanisms and inter-ministerial coordination, and discussed regional and global developments.</p>
<p>“A protocol, outlining procedural frameworks for follow-up actions, coordination through sectoral working groups and facilitation for reciprocal visits, was also signed,” the statement added.</p>
<p>According to FO, “In addition to the protocol of the session, MoU on ‘Mutual Exemption of Entry Visa Requirements’ and ‘Establishment of a Joint Task Force to Promote Investments’ as well as an Agreement on ‘Artificial Intelligence and Digital Economy’ were signed.”</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MIshaqDar50/status/1937708404660744263" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Dar said that he signed an agreement with Al-Nahyan on “mutual visa exemption for the holders of diplomatic and official passports of our two countries”.</p>
<p>“This important step reflects our shared resolve to further strengthen our fraternal ties and deepen institutional collaboration across all levels,” he added.</p>

<p>The FO said that both sides expressed satisfaction with the outcomes and agreed to hold the 13th Session of the JMC in Pakistan on mutually agreed-upon dates.</p>
<p>“The successful convening of the JMC session underscores the deep-rooted and multifaceted relationship between Pakistan and the UAE and their shared vision for a dynamic and progressive partnership,” it added.</p>
<p>The UAE is Pakistan’s third-largest trading partner after China and the United States, is home to more than a million Pakistani expatriates and is the second-largest source of remittances after Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UAE, Faisal Tirmizi, had said that the bilateral trade between Pakistan and the UAE <a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvworld/newsdetail/4542" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exceeded</a> US$10.9 billion in the fiscal year 2023–24, including goods and services.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, PM Shehbaz Sharif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916754/pm-shehbaz-discusses-regional-peace-bilateral-ties-with-uae-leadership">met</a> UAE President and Ruler of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan during his official one-day visit to the Gulf state, where he discussed matters of bilateral and regional interest.</p>
<p>The high-level engagement aimed at reaffirming Pakistan’s gratitude to friendly nations that supported Islamabad’s position during its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">recent standoff</a> with New Delhi.</p></p>

            <p><p>Pakistan and the United States have decided to conclude trade talks focused on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917668/pakistan-us-agree-to-advance-talks-on-reciprocal-tariffs-aurangzeb">reciprocal tariffs</a> next week after a virtual meeting between Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.</p>
<p>The negotiations are part of a broader push to reset economic ties at a time of shifting geopolitical alignments and Pakistan’s efforts to avoid steep US duties on exports.</p>
<p>“Both sides showed satisfaction on the ongoing negotiations and resolved to conclude the trade negotiations next week,” the finance ministry said in a statement, adding that a longer-term strategic and investment partnership is also under discussion.</p>
<p>“The discussion focused on meaningful engagement in trade, investment and deepening economic ties mutually beneficial to both sides, with technical-level trade-related discussions to be concluded next week,” it added.</p>
<p>Pakistan faces a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901838/economists-see-hurdles-and-opportunities-for-pakistan-as-us-imposes-29pc-tariff-on-country">29 per cent</a> tariff on exports to the US under President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810/trumps-tariffs-stoke-global-trade-war-as-china-eu-hit-back">measures</a> to target countries with large trade surpluses with the US. Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906864">surplus</a> was around $3 bn in 2024.</p>
<p>To offset the imbalance and ease tariff pressures, Islamabad has offered to import more US goods, including crude oil, and to open up investment opportunities through concessions for US firms in Pakistan’s mining sector.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the two countries co-hosted a webinar promoting investment in Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903248">mineral sector</a>, including the $7bn <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885389">Reko Diq</a> copper-gold project.</p>
<p>Senior officials from both governments and US investors discussed public-private partnerships and regulatory reforms. The US Export-Import Bank is reviewing financing proposals worth $500 mn to $1 bn in Reko Diq.</p></p>

            <p><p>A Belarusian man on Wednesday was arrested for allegedly picking up a one-year-old Afghan boy and throwing him to the ground in the arrivals hall at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport, inflicting spinal and cranial injuries, Britain’s <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/monster-confesses-trying-murder-boy-35449081" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Daily Mirror</a></em> newspaper reported.</p>
<p>According to the newspaper, 31-year-old construction worker Vladimir Vitkov was arrested and confessed to “trying to murder” the child, who had arrived in Russia with his family after fleeing Iran due to its 12-day war with Israel.</p>
<p>“Yazdan, aged 18 months, is now fighting for his life with serious skull fractures and spinal injuries,” <em>The Mirror</em> read, adding that Vitkov was on board the same flight as the child and his mother.</p>
<p>Both <em>The Mirror</em> and British newspaper <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14841817/Boy-two-coma-airline-passenger-throws-floor-airport-lounge.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Daily Mail</a></em> reported that the boy suffered skull fractures and spinal injuries, with the latter reporting that the boy was “in a coma”.</p>
<p>Graphic CCTV showed Vitkov picking up the boy before “hurling him to the ground of Moscow airport’s arrivals hall”.</p>
<p>“The attacker — described as a ‘monster’ by a Russian official — apparently checks to see if anyone is watching and then suddenly grabs the child, throwing him hard on the floor in the arrivals section of Sheremetyevo airport,” <em>The Mail</em> reported.</p>
<p>According to <em>The Mail</em>, Vitkov reportedly flew to Moscow from Cyprus or Egypt and was rapidly taken into custody after the incident, amid suspicions he was under the influence of drugs.</p>
<p><em>The Mirror</em> reported that Vitkov had been fired from a nuclear power plant construction job in Egypt after failing a spot check for drugs and alcohol and was returning home via Moscow, citing a friend of the suspect’s.</p>
<p>“He (Vitkov) ‘confessed’ when a police interrogator asked: ‘Explain what you did’,” <em>The Mirror</em> reported. Vitkov responded with, “I attempted to murder a child.”</p>
<p><em>The Mail</em> reported that police are examining whether there was a racist or other motivation for the act against the child. However, <em>The Mirror</em> said that when his motive was questioned, he replied that he did not know because he was “under the influence of drugs”.</p>
<p>“Reports said cannabis had been found in his possession, and there were traces of the drug in his blood. <em>Mash</em> news outlet reported today that he had drunk three bottles of whisky and obtained cannabis in Cairo before the incident,” <em>The Mirror</em> reported.</p>
<p>Moscow region children’s ombudswoman Ksenia Mishonova was quoted as saying, “A drug-addled monster grabbed a toddler in the arrivals hall and threw him on the floor with all his might. All this is incredibly difficult to bear.</p>
<p>“I hope the detained monster will receive the full severity of the law. I wish the child a speedy recovery. May the parents have the strength to survive this.”</p>
<p><em>The Mirror</em> quoted the ombudswoman as saying she hopes Vitkov receives “hard labour until he is feeble with old age”.</p>
<p>“I am always very, very careful, but here I no longer have the strength not to say simply [this was] a stoned drug addict, a monster,” she said after seeing the boy in hospital.“</p>
<p>The Iranian Ambassador to Russia, Kazem Jalali, condemned the incident as “completely inhuman”, according to Iran’s <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/06/25/3342532/iranian-envoy-condemns-brutal-assault-on-afghan-toddler-at-moscow-airport" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tasnim</a></em> news agency.</p>
<p>“A video has been circulated showing a child being brutally slammed to the ground. Some have claimed the attacker is Jewish, but I cannot confirm that,” Jalali told <em>Tasnim</em>.</p>
<p>The ambassador added that Tehran immediately contacted Russian authorities to confirm the victim’s nationality.</p>
<p>“It was initially reported that the child was Iranian,” Jalali said. “Russian Foreign Ministry colleagues told us that the file is officially listed under Afghanistan. The innocent child, currently in a coma, is apparently from an Afghan family.”</p></p>
