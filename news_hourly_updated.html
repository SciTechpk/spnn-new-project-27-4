                <h2>Defence Minister Asif blasts ‚Äòwestern hypocrisy‚Äô, says Iran never initiated war with Israel</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has strongly condemned the Israeli aggression towards Iran and criticised the Western world‚Äôs ‚Äúdouble standard‚Äù, saying that the International Atomic Energy Agency‚Äôs (IAEA) performance was ‚Äútainted with hypocrisy and a selective approach‚Äù.</p>
<p>Asif earlier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919222/pakistan-stands-firm-with-iran-asif">stressed</a> that Pakistan stood in ‚Äúcomplete solidarity‚Äù with Iran amid Israel‚Äôs unprovoked and ‚Äúunjustified aggression‚Äù against Tehran, which began on June 13 and escalated over 12 days. The conflict intensified after the US intervened by striking three of Iran‚Äôs nuclear sites. Tehran first responded by launching missiles at Tel Aviv, then targeted US bases in Qatar following the American strikes. On Tuesday morning, US President Donald Trump announced that Iran and Israel had reached a ‚Äúceasefire‚Äù.</p>
<p>Israel, without evidence, claimed that its initial strike on Iran was ‚Äúpreventive‚Äù, meant to address an immediate, inevitable threat from the Islamic Republic‚Äôs part to construct a nuclear bomb. Tel Aviv also suggested that the IAEA report released on June 12, which condemned Iran for material violations of its Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) commitments until the early 2000s, constituted such an emergency. However, the IAEA also seemed to reject that claim, since there was nothing in the report that was not already known to the relevant parties, according to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/6/15/the-real-reason-israel-attacked-iran" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a>.</em></p>
<p>In an <a class="link--external" href="https://www.irna.ir/news/85871529/%D9%88%D8%B2%DB%8C%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D9%BE%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%BA%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D9%88-%D8%A2%DA%98%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B3-%D8%A8%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%84%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B1%DA%98%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%A2%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%87" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with an Iranian state-run news agency <em>IRNA</em> in Islamabad, Asif said, ‚ÄúUnlike Iran, the Westerners have destroyed the opportunity for diplomacy and are the cause of the beginning of the aggressions of the Zionist regime and the United States.‚Äù</p>
<p>The defence minister emphasised that Iran‚Äôs approach had been ‚Äúvery constructive‚Äô and Tehran never sought confrontation, adding that Israel wanted to ‚Äúovershadow the region to push the situation towards war‚Äù.</p>
<p>He added that ‚Äúa regime that is not even a member of the NPT and there is no monitoring and inspection of its nuclear arsenals, can do anything and has the authorisation to carry out any aggression and attack on Palestine, Gaza, Yemen and now against Iran.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll these countries are the targets of these deliberate and reckless actions of Tel Aviv, which is not held accountable by the IAEA,‚Äù Asif further said.</p>
<p>He condemned Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúterrorist attacks and the US aggressive crime against Iran‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">nuclear facilities</a>‚Äù, considering these actions contrary to international law, the UN Charter and humanitarian norms.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think the situation has escalated to a dangerous level, especially over the past few weeks when Iran continuously emphasised the need for negotiations and participation in this entire process, and that the Iranians have never left the negotiating table,‚Äù he was quoted as saying by <em>IRNA</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIran has never initiated the war, but both the destruction of diplomacy and the initiation of the war were carried out by the other side (America and Israel), which led to the illegitimate aggression of Israel against the nation,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Asif further said, ‚ÄúIt is ridiculous that the West always wants Iran to return to the negotiating table, because the Iranians did not leave the negotiating table, but have always demanded interaction and negotiations.‚Äù</p>
<p>He noted that even when Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was negotiating with the Europeans, another aggression against the country took place.</p>
<p>Asif said Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúcontinued aggression against Palestinians had now reached Iran‚Äù, calling it a ‚Äúconspiracy planned and implemented by the Zionist regime‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIranians stand with Palestine, and this is never a crime. Human dignity and the defence of religious values must be followed by the international community, and they must stand against Israeli aggression and rush to help the Palestinians,‚Äù he reaffirmed.</p>
<p>He added that the US and Israel were trampling on all international laws, human values and traditions, and ‚Äúmassacring children, women, old and young in Gaza‚Äù.</p>
<p>The defence minister told the people of Iran to stand firm and steadfast because ‚ÄúGod is with them and all nations in the world feel the pain of the Iranian nation because this is a crime and a clear aggression against Iran, and these crimes will definitely be responded to.‚Äù</p></p>

            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919683/psx-climbs-nearly-6000-points-amid-announcement-of-iran-israel-ceasefire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <h2>PSX climbs nearly 6,000 points amid announcement of Iran-Israel ‚Äòceasefire‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) climbed by 5759.16 points after an earlier halt in trading on Tuesday, in the wake of  US President Donald Trump announcing a complete ceasefire between Israel and Iran to end a 12-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">war</a>.</p>
<p>The KSE-100 index climbed by 6079.16 points, or 5.23 per cent, to close at 122,246.63 points.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, shares at the PSX had climbed by 5,878 points a few hours after it opened. It reached an earlier intraday high of 122,045.62 from the last close of 116,167.47 yesterday, before a market halt was initiated.</p>
<p>Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, attributed the rise to the overnight announcement of a ceasefire, with broad-based gains across sectors.</p>
<p>Farooq said, ‚ÄúThe Pakistan market rallied earlier today following the overnight announcement of a ceasefire.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, reports during the day of Israeli claims that Iran has violated the ceasefire dampened sentiment, pulling the market down from an intraday high of 122,045.62 to 121,926.63 currently. Despite the pullback, local fundamentals remain intact, and the rally could resume if the ceasefire holds. Geopolitical developments will continue to drive market direction in the near term.</p>
<p>Global shares rallied and the dollar extended declines as a ceasefire to end a 12-day war between Iran and Israel came into effect, while oil prices dived to nearly two-week lows on easing concerns about supply disruptions, <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>
<p>At 11:26am, a PSX notice informed that due to a 5pc increase in the KSE-30 index from the previous trading day close of the index, a market halt had been triggered as per PSX regulations and all equity and equity-based markets have been suspended accordingly.</p>
<p>The market reopened after a gap of an hour at 12:31pm.</p>
<p>Farooq explained, ‚ÄúIf the KSE-30 Index moves ¬±5pc from the previous day‚Äôs close and remains at that level for five consecutive minutes, trading is stopped for 60 minutes.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that this mechanism kicks into action whether the index rises by 5pc or falls by that margin to help cool the market down.</p>
<p>The PSX had endured a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919518/psx-plunges-3855-points-on-geopolitical-jitters">sharp sell-off</a> on Monday, as escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East ‚Äî sparked by reported US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and Tehran‚Äôs threat to close the Strait of Hormuz ‚Äî sent shockwaves through global markets, triggering panic selling and wiping out more than 3,800 points from the benchmark KSE-100 index.</p>
<p>The Israeli government said it had achieved all its objectives in the war with Iran, and that it had agreed to the US-proposed ceasefire after removing the ‚Äúdual existential threat‚Äù of Tehran‚Äôs nuclear programme and ballistic missiles.
Israel nonetheless warned it would ‚Äúrespond forcefully‚Äù to any Iranian violation of the truce.</p>
<p>Oil prices fell 5pc after Israel agreed to the proposal.</p>
<p>The ceasefire agreement, as outlined by Trump on social media in a surprise late-night post, would see the arch enemies stop firing in staggered phases.</p>
<p>According to Trump, Iran would unilaterally halt all operations beginning 4am GMT (9am PKT) on Tuesday, with Israel following suit 12 hours later.</p>
<p>After Trump‚Äôs announcement, Iran‚Äôs Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi posted on social media that ‚Äúas of now, there is no ‚Äòagreement‚Äô on ceasefire or cessation of military operations‚Äù.</p>
<p>However, he added that if Israel stopped ‚Äúits illegal aggression‚Äù, Tehran would have ‚Äúno intention to continue our response afterwards‚Äù.</p>
