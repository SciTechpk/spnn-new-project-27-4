                <h2>Bilawal-led team stresses need for Pak-India dialogue in meetings with US Congress members</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A high-level delegation led by PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has stressed the need for dialogue with India in a series of meetings with US Congress members in Washington, state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/05-06-2025/multiparty-delegation-holds-series-of-meetings-with-us-congressmen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Pakis¬≠tan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">launched</a> a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi‚Äôs growing lobbying presence there. As part of its global outreach, the team will also visit London and Brussels.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow">delegation</a> comprises former foreign ministers Bilawal, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh¬≠mina Janjua.</p>
<p>During Wednesday‚Äôs discussions at Capitol Hill, the delegation underscored the urgency of dialogue on the Kashmir issue, noting it was an ‚Äúunfinished agenda of the United Nations‚Äù.</p>
<p>It stressed the imperative of respect for international law, UN Security Council resolutions and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), <em>Radio Pakistan</em> added.</p>
<p>Bilawal emphasised that sustainable peace in South Asia hinged on dialogue, restraint and a just resolution of the Kashmir dispute, rather than ‚Äúunilateralism or intimidation‚Äù.</p>
<p>He briefed members of Congress on India‚Äôs recent acts of unprovoked aggression, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910848">targeting of civilians</a>, as well as the ‚Äúdeeply concerning‚Äù and unilateral <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">suspension</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>.</p>
<p>Bilawal appreciated the US, particularly ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915520/pakistan-wants-trump-to-arrange-talks-with-india">President Donald Trump</a>, for his constructive role in helping <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">de-escalate tensions</a> and supporting efforts towards a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>‚Äù, according to the report.</p>
<p>The delegation reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs principled stance on regional peace, counterterrorism efforts and recent Indian aggression, reaffirming Pakistan‚Äôs commitment ‚Äúto peace, responsible conduct, and rejection of baseless allegations‚Äù.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, members of the Congress welcomed the Pakistani delegation, urging ‚Äúboth countries to demonstrate restraint and prioritise regional peace and stability‚Äù, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> stated.</p>
<p>They reiterated the US support for the people of Pakistan and its commitment to aiding the country‚Äôs economic progress.</p>
<p>Bilawal took to X earlier today, <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/BBhuttoZardari/status/1930424636124123533" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying</a> he had a ‚Äúconstructive exchange with Senator Chris Van Hollen on Pakistan‚Äôs deep concerns over India‚Äôs increasingly belligerent posture and its refusal to engage, whether through dialogue, joint investigation, or third-party facilitation‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚ÄúShared Pakistan‚Äôs concerns over the new abnormal imposed by Mr. Modi, where every incident by nameless actors triggers unprovoked aggression, risking war between two nuclear-armed neighbours,‚Äù Bilawal <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/BBhuttoZardari/status/1930425560074711461" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X.</p>

<p>Addressing an event at the US Embassy in Islamabad marking the 249th anniversary of American independence, the premier said Trump had shown beyond any doubt that ‚Äúhe is a man for peace ‚Ä¶ and beneficial business deals‚Äù.</p>

                <h2>‚ÄòVery blessed‚Äô: Muslim pilgrims pray at Mount Arafat in Haj apex</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Muslim pilgrims prayed atop Mount Arafat on Thursday during the high point of the annual Haj pilgrimage, as Saudi officials called on participants to refrain from being outside during the hottest hours of the day.</p>
<p>Thousands of pilgrims began to gather before dawn around the hill and the surrounding plain where Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is believed to have given his last sermon.</p>
<p>While some arrived early to take advantage of the relatively cool morning, carrying colourful umbrellas, many pilgrims will remain for hours of prayers and Holy Quran recitals until the evening in the most arduous portion of Haj.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>After sunset, they will head to Muzdalifah, halfway between Arafat and the sprawling tent city of Mina, where they will gather pebbles so they can perform the symbolic ‚Äústoning of the devil‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is something that I used to see every year on the TV screen during Haj and I always thought: ‚ÄòI wish I could be here‚Äô,‚Äù said 33-year-old Ali from Pakistan, one of 1.5 million pilgrims who had arrived in Saudi Arabia for the pilgrimage.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve been trying to get here‚Ä¶ for the past 3 years,‚Äù he added as he gazed at the mount. ‚ÄúI feel very blessed.‚Äù</p>
<p>Hundreds of pilgrims dressed in white dotted the mount itself, with many more at its foot praying or taking pictures.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Saudi authorities called on pilgrims to stay inside their tents between 10am and 4pm (12pm and 6pm PKT) and on Thursday, when the desert sun is at its harshest.</p>
<p>Fans spraying mist and providing cool air were dispersed at the foot of the mount.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Temperatures this year have already exceeded 40 degrees Celsius as one of the world‚Äôs largest annual religious gatherings, bringing together devotees from around the globe, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915010">kicked off</a> earlier this week.</p>
<p>Officials have beefed up heat mitigation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915198/saudi-readies-for-worst-case-scenario-in-sweltering-haj">efforts</a>, aiming to avoid a repeat of last year‚Äôs Haj, which saw 1,301 pilgrims <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1840835">die</a> as temperatures reached 51.8C.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI came here early to [avoid] the sun and later I will pray inside my tent,‚Äù said 54-year-old Adel Ismail, from Syria.</p>
<p>To make this year‚Äôs pilgrimage safer, authorities have expanded infrastructure, deployed thousands of extra personnel and relied on an arsenal of high-tech tools to help better manage crowds.</p>
<p>Authorities have mobilised more than 40 government agencies and 250,000 officials, doubling their efforts against heat-related illness following the lethal heatwave of 2024.</p>
<p>Shaded areas have been expanded by 50,000 square metres, thousands more medics will be on standby, and more than 400 cooling units will be deployed, the Haj minister has told <em>AFP.</em></p>

<p>Through tears of joy, Iman Abdel Khaleq said she had wanted to perform Haj for 10 years and was overwhelmed with emotion as she arrived at Arafat.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big dream for me that I had almost given up hope of realising,‚Äù the woman in her fifties told <em>AFP</em> from the foot of the mount.</p>
<p>Authorities said a majority of the deaths in 2024 were among unregistered pilgrims who lacked access to amenities like air-conditioned tents and buses.</p>
<p>This year, they have also cracked down on unregistered pilgrims looking to sneak into Makkah, relying on frequent raids, drone surveillance and a barrage of text alerts.</p>
<p>Haj permits are allocated to countries on a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870331">quota</a> basis and distributed to individuals by a lottery.</p>
<p>But even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs prompt many to attempt Haj without a permit, even though they risk arrest and deportation if caught.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia earns billions of dollars a year from Haj, and Umrah, which is undertaken at other times of the year.</p></p>
