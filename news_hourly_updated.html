                <h2>More funds to be allocated for education sector in upcoming budget: KP CM</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ali Amin Gandapur on Tuesday vowed that the provincial government will make education a ‚Äútop priority‚Äù in the upcoming budget and allocate more resources towards the sector, state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/13-05-2025/more-funds-to-be-allocated-for-education-sector-in-upcoming-budget-kp-cm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>The chief minister‚Äôs concerns follow in the wake of the unexpected <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910614/shortage-of-books-troubles-students-teachers-in-kp">textbook shortage</a> in the province which has disrupted classes, high dropout rates, and Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúlow‚Äù ranking in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854348">District Education Performance Index Report 2020-23</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPresiding over a meeting in Peshawar, he directed measures to enhance teachers‚Äô capacity, ensure 100 per cent merit in new recruitments, and establish schools in rented buildings in areas where they are urgently needed,‚Äù the report said.</p>
<p>During the meeting, it was decided that comprehensive and multi-faceted measures would be taken to increase student enrollment in schools. In this regard, schemes would be included in the upcoming budget to support various activities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGandapur expressed concern that in some districts,  the rate of out-of-school children remains alarming, and the declaration of an education emergency is a necessary step to reduce this number and improve enrollment rates,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The chief minister emphasised strengthening the monitoring system and taking steps to provide missing facilities such as laboratories, examination halls, and other essential infrastructure in existing schools.</p>
<p>During the last two decades, students received books from the provincial government free of charge at the start of the scholastic year in April.  Two years ago, the government decided to deliver only half of the required books as the costs reached over Rs10 billion, directing the schools‚Äô administration to collect old books from the students promoted to the next grades and fulfil the remaining book requirements.</p>
<p>This year, however, a complex situation has emerged in schools as the textbook board claims that it has printed all the books requested by the education department but students and teachers have complained about a shortage of books.</p>
<p>In August last year, an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854348">official report</a> placed the country‚Äôs education system in the ‚Äòlow‚Äô performance category and highlighted critical areas requiring attention to improve education outcomes.</p></p>

                <h2>Junaid Akbar submits resignation as PAC chairman to PTI</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>PTI MNA Junaid Akbar on Tuesday said he had handed over his resignation as the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to the party.</p>
<p>The development came after it emerged that PTI founding chairman Imran Khan had directed Akbar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910714">to resign</a> from the position and focus on provincial matters.</p>
<p>In a video statement issued today, Akbar confirmed that he had handed over his resignation to PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, saying that he readily accepted the decision of the party and Imran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhatever the decision of the party and the decision of Imran Khan, I will not think for a moment and will readily accept it,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Akbar said the position was a responsibility given by the party and he would accept any decision by the PTI founder, including handing over the party presidency or resignation from the assembly.</p>
<p>PTI‚Äôs central information secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram, had confirmed to <em>Dawn</em>, that Akbar would step down as PAC chairman. He said Imran had conveyed the message through his sister Aleema Khan during their last meeting and announced that Akbar would be replaced by Omar Ayub Khan. He said Aleema conveyed the message to Salman Akram Raja after coming out of Adiala Jail.</p>
<p>Akbar was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1887487">elected unopposed</a> as chairman of the PAC in January this year. In the same month, he was appointed by Imran as the president of PTI‚Äôs KP chapter, replacing Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.</p>
<p>The position had been vacant since the February 2024 general elections, which brought the PML-N government to power. The PAC chairmanship is usually held by the leader of the opposition or their nominee, though there is no legal requirement for this parliamentary tradition.</p>
<p>After the general elections, the PTI made several U-turns over nominating a candidate for the post of PAC chairman. Sher Afzal Marwat was initially nominated, followed by the names of Akram and Omar. Ultimately, Akbar‚Äôs name was finalised for the post.</p></p>
