            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921342/fuel-prices-go-up-in-aftermath-of-israeli-attacks-on-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Fuel prices go up in aftermath of Israeli attacks on Iran</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday increased the prices of petrol and diesel by Rs8.36 and Rs10.39 per litre, respectively, for the next fortnight ending July 15, owing to higher international prices following Israeli <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">attacks</a> on Iran.</p>
<p>In a late-night announcement, the Ministry of Finance said the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) had reviewed and adjusted prices for petroleum products in view of fluctuations in the international market.</p>
<p>The ex-depot price of high-speed diesel (HSD) was increased by Rs10.39 per litre (four per cent) to Rs272.98 per litre <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917324">from</a> Rs262.59. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD and its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables. Transport fares seldom come down despite lower diesel rate.</p>
<p>The ex-depot price of petrol was set at Rs266.79 per litre against Rs258.43, up by Rs8.36 or 3.3pc. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of middle- and lower-middle class.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>At present, the government is charging about Rs100 per litre tax on both petrol and HSD, with fresh imposition of Rs2.5 per litre climate support levy with effect from July 1. Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all petroleum products, yet the government is charging Rs78 per litre petroleum development levy (PDL) on petrol, diesel and high-octane products that normally impact the masses.</p>
<p>The government is also charging about Rs19 per litre customs duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.</p>
<p><strong>LPG price cut</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, Ogra notified a decrease in the price of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) by Rs7.51 per kg or 3.1pc for the month of July. Ogra notified the new price for 11.8kg cylinder at Rs2,750.60 for July against Rs2,838.31 for June. It said the LPG producer price was linked with Saudi Aramco-CP and US dollar exchange rate.</p>
<p>As compared to previous month, Saudi Aramco-CP price has decreased by 4.29pc, while the average dollar exchange rate slightly increased by 0.47pc, resulting in a decline in the LPG consumer price by Rs88.71 per 11.8kg cylinder (3.1pc).</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921312/government-sees-exports-rising-inflation-at-5-7pc-in-fy26' target='_blank'><strong>Government sees exports rising, inflation at  5-7pc in FY26</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday projected a positive export outlook and a moderate rise in inflation to a range of 5-7 per cent for 2025-26, citing improved global economic conditions and domestic recovery trends.</p>
<p>In its Monthly Economic Update and Outlook for June, the Ministry of Finance said Composite Leading Indicators (CLIs) of Pakistan’s major trading part-ners — including the UK, US, Eurozone and China — were all operating above their long-term average of 100, suggesting a likely increase in demand for Pakistani exports.</p>
<p>For June, inflation is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921197/countrys-june-inflation-likely-to-remain-between-3-4pc-finance-ministry">expected</a> to remain between 3–4pc. The ministry also forecast a positive outlook for Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) in the coming months, driven by robust trends in cement despatches and automobile sales. “The uptick in private sector credit reflects growing production activity and improved investor confidence,” the report said.</p>
<p>On the external front, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897182">rising</a> remittances and exports are expected to keep the current account in surplus during FY25.</p>
<p>From July to May FY25, the current account posted a surplus of $1.8bn, in stark contrast to a deficit of $1.6bn during the same period last year.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Remittances, export growth and fiscal discipline drive economic optimism</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goods exports rose 4pc to $29.7bn, while imports increased 11.5pc to $54.1bn, widening the trade deficit to $24.4bn from $20bn a year earlier. Key export gains were seen in knitwear (14.5pc), garments (16.4pc), and bedwear (10.6pc). Major import increases were recorded in palm oil (26.3pc) and electrical machinery (13.6pc), while crude oil imports declined 1.7pc.</p>
<p>Service exports grew 8.5pc to $7.6bn, with imports rising 6.6pc to $10.3bn, resulting in a $2.7bn services trade deficit. IT exports surged by 18.7pc to $3.5bn.</p>
<p>Worker remittances saw a sharp increase of 28.8pc, reaching $34.9bn from $27.1bn in the same period last year, led by higher inflows from Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</p>
<p>Net foreign direct investment (FDI) stood at $2bn, slightly down from $2.1bn a year ago.</p>
<p>China remained the top investor with $790.4m, followed by the UK with $229m and Hong Kong with $215.2m. The financial services sector attracted the most FDI at $628.9m, followed by power ($562.8m) and oil &amp; gas exploration ($265.6m).</p>
<p>However, foreign portfolio investment recorded net outflows, with $312.5m from the private sector and $311.9m from the public sector. As of June 13, the country’s foreign exchange reserves stood at $17bn, including $11.7bn held by the State Bank of Pakistan.</p>
<p>On the fiscal side, the report noted that revenue growth outpaced expenditure growth during July-April FY25, reflecting the success of the government’s fiscal consolidation drive.</p>
<p>The fiscal deficit declined to 3.2pc of GDP, down from 4.5pc in the same period last year, while the primary surplus improved to 3.2pc of GDP from 1.5pc a year earlier.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921393/trump-signs-order-lifting-sanctions-on-syria' target='_blank'><strong>Trump signs order lifting sanctions on Syria</strong></a>
            <p><p>President Donald Trump signed on Monday an executive order terminating a US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1564119">sanctions</a> programme on Syria, allowing an end to the country’s isolation from the international financial system andbuilding on Washington’s pledge to help it rebuild after a devastating civil war.</p>
<p>The move will allow the US to maintain sanctions on Syria’s ousted former president Bashar al-Assad, his associates, human rights abusers, drug traffickers, people linked to chemical weapons activities, the Islamic State and ISIS affiliates and proxies for Iran, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters in a briefing.</p>
<p>Assad was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1877638">toppled</a> in December in a lightning offensive by Islamist-led rebels and Syria has since taken steps to re-establish international ties.</p>
<p>Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani said Trump’s termination of the Syria sanctions programme would “open door of long-awaited reconstruction and development,” according to a post by the foreign minister on social media platform X.</p>
<p>He said the move would “lift the obstacle” against economic recovery and open the country to the international community.</p>
<p>Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa and Trump met in Riyadh in May where, in a major policy shift, Trump unexpectedly announced he would lift US sanctions on Syria, prompting Washington to significantly ease its measures.</p>
<p>Some in Congress are pushing for the measures to be totally repealed, while Europe has announced the end of its economic sanctions regime.</p>
<p>“Syria needs to be given a chance, and that’s what’s happened,” U.S. Special Envoy for Syria Thomas Barrack told reporters in a briefing call. He described Monday’s move as “the culmination of a very tedious, detailed, excruciating process of, how do you unwrap these sanctions.”</p>
<p>The White House in a fact sheet said the order directs the Secretary of State to review the terrorism designations of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a rebel group that Sharaa led that has roots in al Qaeda, as well as Syria’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.</p>
<p>The White House said the administration would continue to monitor Syria’s progress on key priorities including “taking concrete steps toward normalising ties with Israel, addressing foreign terrorists, deporting Palestinian terrorists and banning Palestinian terrorist groups”.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#layers-of-us-sanctions" id="layers-of-us-sanctions" title="Permalink"></a>Layers of US sanctions</h2>
<p>A <em>Reuters</em> investigation published on Monday revealed the role of Syrian government forces in the killing of more than 1,500 Syrian Alawites over three days of massacres along the country’s Mediterranean coast in March. The Trump administration had no comment on the <em>Reuters</em> report.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear if Washington was lifting the sanctions on any of the factions that Reuters found were involved.</p>
<p>Syrians hope the easing of sanctions will clear the way for greater engagement by humanitarian organisations working in the country, encouraging foreign investment and trade as it rebuilds.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of Trump’s announcement in May, the US Treasury Department issued a general license that authorised transactions involving the interim Syrian government as well as the central bank and state-owned enterprises.</p>
<p>However, the US has imposed layers of sanctions against Syria, some of which are authorised by legislation, including the Caesar Act. Repealing the measures is necessary for Syria to attract long-term investment without parties fearing the risk of violating U.S. sanctions.</p>
<p>“We are now, pursuant to the executive order, going to look at suspension criteria for the Caesar Act,” a senior administration official said.</p>
<p>Most of the US sanctions on Syria were imposed on Assad’s government and key individuals in 2011 after civil war erupted in the country.</p>
<p>The dismantling of the US sanctions programme on Syria includes terminating from Tuesday a national emergency declared in 2004 and revoking linked executive orders, according to the order signed on Monday.</p>
<p>The executive order also directs additional actions, including some with respect to waivers of export controls and other restrictions, the order read.</p></p>
