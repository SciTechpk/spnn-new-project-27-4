            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met with China’s President Xi Jinping on Tuesday as he represented Pakistan in a joint call of the foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) member states.</p>
<p>The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. The group’s foreign ministers meet as a precursor to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1864831">annual summit</a> of its leaders, which will be hosted <a class="link--external" href="https://www.chinadailyasia.com/hk/article/615887" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by China</a> this autumn in Tianjin.</p>
<p>In a post on X today, Dar <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MIshaqDar50/status/1945012596056187239" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>  he was “delighted” to meet with Xi at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing before the SCO meeting and conveyed the “warm greetings of the leadership, government and people of Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“As iron-clad brothers and all-weather strategic cooperative partners, we remain committed to deepening Pak-China enduring friendship and advancing shared regional goals,” he posted on X.</p>

<p>The Chinese president, welcoming the heads of delegations, underlined the “salience of regional cooperation” under the ambit of the SCO, according to the <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1944974129993822435" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> (Mofa).</p>

<p>Dar also met with the foreign ministers of various SCO member states on the sidelines of the joint call on Xi.</p>
<p>“Always good to exchange views for strengthening regional understanding and cooperation in such a challenging time,” he <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MIshaqDar50/status/1944996187607646493" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X about his meeting with his Iran, Uzbekistan and Belarus counterparts.</p>

            <p><p>The United Kingdom’s government on Tuesday launched e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an “enhanced” border and immigration system.</p>
<p>The announcement came just a day after the two countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924280/pakistan-uk-ink-accord-to-boost-economic-cooperation">formally signed</a> the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-uk-evisas-for-pakistani-students-and-workers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> today, the British High Commission (BHC) in Islamabad said: “The UK Government is replacing physical immigration documents for most student and worker visas with a digital proof of immigration status, an e-visa.”</p>
<p>British High Commissioner Jane Marriott <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/JaneMarriottUK/status/1945002473325752743" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X that the facility was for “most students and workers applying for more than 6 months”.</p>

<p>An e-visa is an online record of a person’s immigration permission in the UK and will make the visa process easier and more secure, the BHC noted in its statement.</p>
<p>“E-visas are tried and tested, with millions of people already using them on select immigration routes,” it highlighted.</p>
<p>Students and workers who intend to stay in the UK for a period longer than six months will be eligible to apply for the e-visa. The UK government plans to expand the scheme to all visa applications, according to the statement.</p>
<p>In 2024, the UK government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854346">announced</a> that the country’s immigration system was transitioning to a fully digital format, replacing physical documents with an online immigration system.</p>
<p>The BHC outlined the following eligibility criteria for the e-visa:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students, including short-term study for 11 months</li>
<li>Global Business Mobility routes (specifically, Senior or Specialist Worker, Graduate Trainee, UK Expansion Worker, Service Supplier, Secondment Worker)  </li>
<li>Global Talent   </li>
<li>International Sportsperson   </li>
<li>Skilled Worker (including health and care)  </li>
<li>Temporary Work routes (specifically, Charity Worker, Creative Worker, Government Authorised Exchange, International Agreement, and Religious work routes) </li>
<li>Youth Mobility Scheme  </li>
</ul>
<p>Applicants applying as dependents or for visas other than study or work, eg. general visitor visa, will still need a physical visa, the statement noted.</p>
<p>Those with existing in-date physical visas do not need to take any action.</p>
<p>Marriott noted that the changes were set to make the visa process simpler for students and workers. “It also means applicants can hold onto their passports, saving time,” she pointed out.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>She clarified that updating from a physical visa to an e-visa will have no impact on a person’s present immigration status.</p>
<p>“Holders can link their travel document (such as passport) to their UKVI (UK Visas and Immigration) account to facilitate straightforward international travel,” the statement read.</p>
<p>The UKVI — introduced in 2024 — is an account that visa holders staying in the UK for longer than six months are required to create. It serves as an online record of people’s immigration status.</p></p>

            <p><p>India’s Fauja Singh, believed to be the world’s oldest distance runner, has died in a road accident aged 114, his biographer said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Singh, an Indian-born British national, nicknamed the “Turbaned Tornado”, died after being hit by a vehicle in Punjab state’s Jalandhar district on Monday.</p>
<p>“My Turbaned Tornado is no more,” Fauja’s biographer Khushwant Singh <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/Singhkhushwant/status/1944789373276258782" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X.</p>

<p>Singh did not have a birth certificate but his family said he was born on April 1, 1911.</p>
<p>He ran full marathons (42 kilometres) till the age of 100.</p>
<p>His last race was a 10km event at the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/788536/101-year-old-runner-shines-at-last-race">2013 Hong Kong Marathon</a> when 101, where he finished in one hour, 32 minutes and 28 seconds.</p>
<p>He became an international sensation after taking up distance running at the ripe old age of 89, after the death of his wife and one of his sons, inspired by seeing marathons on television.</p>
<p>Although widely regarded as the world’s oldest marathon runner, he was not certified by Guinness World Records as he could not prove his age, saying that birth certificates did not exist when he was born under British colonial rule in 1911.</p>
<p>Singh was a torchbearer for the Olympics at <a class="link--external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060102015817/http://www.athens2004.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Athens 2004</a> and <a class="link--external" href="https://www.olympics.com/en/olympic-games/london-2012" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">London 2012</a>, and appeared in advertisements with sports stars such as David Beckham and Muhammad Ali.</p>
<p>His strength and vitality were credited to a routine of farm walks and a diet including Indian sweet “laddu” packed with dry fruits and home-churned curd.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/narendramodi/status/1944962205734085051" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paid tribute</a> to Singh on social media.</p>
<p>“Fauja Singh was extraordinary because of his unique persona and the manner in which he inspired the youth of India on a very important topic of fitness,” said Modi on X.</p>
