                <h2>SC constitutional bench goes live for first time, resumes hearing review pleas on reserved seats</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A constitutional bench (CB) of the Supreme Court on Monday live-streamed its proceedings for the first time as it resumed hearing a set of review pleas against the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621">top court‚Äôs ruling</a> that had declared the PTI eligible for reserved seats.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In its July 12, 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">short order</a>, eight out of 13 judges ruled that 39 out of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621#:~:text=the%20verdict%20stated.-,List%20of%2080%20MNAs,-The%20verdict%20listed">list of 80 MNAs</a> were and are the returned candidates of the PTI, setting it to emerge as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845532">single largest party</a> in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>However, the ruling had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1868333">not been implemented</a> by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860119">National Assembly</a>, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had raised some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859716">objections</a>. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1846084">PML-N</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847508/ppp-takes-cue-from-pml-n-files-review-petition-on-sc-reserved-seats-verdict">PPP</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850678#:~:text=ECP%20files%20review%20plea">ECP</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, a full-strength 13-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin Khan took up the review pleas earlier this month. However, Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi declared the applications as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908809/two-judges-object-as-sc-accepts-review-pleas-on-reserved-seats-for-hearing">inadmissible</a> during the first hearing and were not part of the subsequent proceedings.</p>
<p>Justice Aminuddin has noted that the two judges had not been excluded by the CB itself, but had stepped back voluntarily.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621">detailed verdict</a> on the reserved seats case, which was authored by senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, the SC had observed that the ECP‚Äôs numerous ‚Äúunlawful acts and omissions‚Äù had ‚Äúcaused confusion and prejudice to PTI, its candidates and the electorate who voted for PTI‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>It had also castigated the ECP for failing to fulfil its ‚Äúrole as a guarantor institution and impartial steward‚Äù of electoral processes.</p>
<p>On September 14, 2024 ‚Äî the day the government was supposed to lay the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859132">26th Amendment</a> in both Houses of the parliament but could not ‚Äî the Supreme Court, through a clarification, had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1858957">reprimanded the ECP</a> for not implementing its July 12 ruling in the reserved seats case.</p>
<p>Later on October 18, in yet <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866044">another clarification</a>, Justice Shah reiterated that the effect of an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850580/law-to-sap-pti-strength-bulldozed-through-parliament">amendment</a> made in the Elections Act 2017 in August last year could not undo the reserved seats case verdict.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The bill, titled ‚ÄúElections (Second Amendment) Act, 2024‚Äù, was seen as aimed at <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850590">circumventing</a> the apex court‚Äôs verdict on the reserved seats case by barring independent lawmakers from joining a political party after a stipulated period.</p>
<p>A six-judge CB of the apex court was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875874/sc-to-take-up-pti-plea-against-tweaks-to-elections-act-on-dec-4th">set to take up</a> the PTI‚Äôs petition challenging those tweaks to the election laws in December 2024. A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1864669">separate plea</a> of the PTI against the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1805488">Jan 13, 2024 ruling</a> denying it its election symbol is also pending before the SC.</p>
