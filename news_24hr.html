            <p><p>An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Faisalabad on Thursday sentenced PTI leaders, including Omar Ayub Khan, Shibli Faraz, Hamid Raza, and Zartaj Gul, to 10 years of imprisonment for their involvement in the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1752003">PTI supporters</a>, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">arrest</a>, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">attacking</a> the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.</p>
<p>Out of 185 PTI workers accused, 108 have been sentenced by the court today.  PTI’s Member of the Provincial Assembly (MPA), Junaid Afzal Sahi, was sentenced to three years in prison. Meanwhile, MPA Khayal Ahmad Kastro, Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Zain Qureshi, and former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry have been acquitted in the cases.</p>
<p>Reacting to the development, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the party will challenge the decision in the high courts.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media in Islamabad today, Gohar said: “We will raise the issue with PTI Founder Imran Khan on the future course of action regarding whether we should return to the parliament or launch a movement.”</p>
<p>He said that the “political cases against PTI members were baseless”, adding that the PTI believed in running the system instead of believing in extremism.</p>
<p>“We do not believe in violence or incitement in politics. Those who have been convicted today do not believe in politics of violence.”</p>
<p>In a post on X, the PTI condemned the sentences in the strongest terms and branded the cases “false, fabricated, and politically motivated”, adding that the opposition leaders in both houses were sentenced to prevent the party’s mass mobilisation on August 5.</p>
<p>“Through this decision, six of our National Assembly members, three Punjab Assembly members and one senator have been sentenced,” the party stated. “This decision is not only a clear violation of the Constitution and the law but also another dark stain on the face of justice.</p>
<p>“The judiciary’s continuous transformation into a rubber stamp at the behest of the state system, issuing such grave verdicts one after another under political pressure without transparent trials, evidence, cross-examination of witnesses, or the right to defence, is a dangerous trend that is completely undermining the credibility of the judicial system,” the statement added.</p>
<p>The PTI added that this is the “first time” opposition leaders in both houses of parliament have been sentenced “solely based on their loyalty to Imran Khan’s political narrative, public representation, and constitutional struggle”.</p>
<p>“The real purpose of these decisions is not to deliver legal justice but to make a concerted effort to prevent the public protest scheduled for August 5, which was announced by Imran Khan himself,” the party claimed.</p>

<p>“Today’s sentences and the warrants issued against several other leaders this morning are all links in the chain of fear that the state system harbours toward Imran Khan’s peaceful public movement.”</p>
<p>Moreover, the party branded the sentences “part of a systematic plan aimed at suppressing the public awakening and political consciousness emerging under Imran Khan’s leadership”.</p>
<p>However, the PTI wrote that these sentences only ignited their resolve, ahead of the protests slated for August 5.</p>
<p>“Imran Khan’s vision lives in our hearts, and our loyalty to it remains unwavering.
Our leaders and workers are ready for every sacrifice, because we believe that only those nations survive the darkness of oppression that resist,” the statement read.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914290">May</a>, an ATC in Islamabad sentenced PTI members, including MNA Abdul Latif, to 27 years of imprisonment for attacking a police station during the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>In December 2024, <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7126" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">military courts</a> had sentenced 85 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their involvement in violent attacks on military installations during the riots on May 9.</p>

            <p><p>The provincial ombudsman for protection against harassment of women at workplaces on Thursday ordered the removal of K-Electric (KE) Chief Executive Officer Moonis Alvi after finding him guilty of workplace harassment.</p>
<p>Alvi, along with other KE employees, was accused of workplace harassment by the company’s former chief marketing and communication officer, Mahreen Aziz Khan, said the order issued by provincial ombudsman Justice (R) Shahnawaz Tariq.</p>
<p>In her application, Khan had accused Alvi, Chief People Officer Rizwan Dallia, Chief of Security Col (R) Wahid Asghar, and Member of the Board of Directors and Chairman Board HR Committee Khalid Rafi, of “causing harassment, intimidation and mental agony”.</p>
<p>The ombudsman’s order said that Alvi had “committed harassment, created a hostile environment and caused mental agony at the workplace to [Khan] and her team”.</p>
<p>Consequently, Alvi was penalised under Section 4(4)(ii)(c) of the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, and ordered removed from his service instantly, along with a penalty of Rs2.5 million, which shall be paid to Khan as compensation within 30 days of the order being passed.</p>
<p>It said that if he failed to pay the fine amount within the stipulated period, it would be recovered as land revenue in terms of the Land Revenue Act, 1967, through the concerned deputy commissioner from Alvi’s moveable and immoveable properties, including bank accounts.</p>
<p>It also said that his CNIC and passport would be be blocked through Nadra and the Ministry of Interior till recovery of the fine. The order said it was self-executory and in case of its non-compliance, contempt proceedings under Section 10(1)(vi) of the act would be initiated against the concerned delinquent officers.</p>
<p>The order can be appealed in the high court.</p>
<p>Regarding the three others accused, the order said: “There is no direct evidence for committing harassment to the complainant; therefore, they are discharged from the allegations of harassment as alleged by the complainant.”</p>
<p>Alvi responded to the development in a series of posts on X.</p>
<p>“I have always upheld the values of integrity and dignity in professional interactions, and I deeply believe in fostering safe and inclusive workplaces for all.</p>
<p>“The recent verdict is deeply distressing to me,” he said.</p>

<p>“While I respect the legal process and the institutions that uphold it, I must, in good conscience, state that the findings do not reflect the truth of the situation as I experienced it.</p>
<p>He added: “This has been a painful journey — not just professionally, but personally.”</p>
<p>Alvi said he was currently reviewing the decision with his legal counsel and would be exercising his right to appeal.</p>
<p>“It is for anyone who feels wronged to be heard. I remain committed to ensuring that the truth is fully brought to light, through all lawful means available,” he said on X.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Khan’s legal adviser, Barrister Talal Wasif Qavi, released a statement on her behalf.</p>
<p>“This judgment affirms that no one who disrespects the daughters of this nation deserves to hold any office — public or private. It is a clear message that power cannot shield misconduct.</p>
<p>“Across Pakistan, working women face harassment in silence. This case proves they no longer need to be afraid. Justice is possible,” the statement read.</p>
<p>“This decision serves as a beacon of hope for every working woman who has been forced into silence. We stand with all women who speak out — and will continue to fight until dignity and safety are guaranteed in every workplace.”</p>
<p>Alvi was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922828">reappointed</a> as the CEO by KE’s board of directors on July 7.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1573865">2020</a>, he and other senior KE officials were booked after another citizen died from electrocution in Karachi. Following the incident, the government formed a special committee to streamline KE operations and called for the removal of its top leadership over poor service during the monsoon.</p>
<p>Sources said government board members had pushed to replace Alvi and the distribution head with professionals capable of handling crises and ensuring efficient service.</p></p>

            <p><p>Pakistan and the US finalised a trade deal on Wednesday night, expected to lower tariffs — although no figure was announced — while US President Donald Trump cited a pact aimed at helping <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927725/us-makes-deal-to-tap-pakistans-oil-reserves">develop Pakistan’s oil reserves</a>.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927252/aurangzeb-to-arrive-in-us-for-final-round-of-tariff-talks">currently</a> in Washington for negotiations on a tariff deal and also began meetings with senior US officials on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“In a landmark development, Pakistan and the United States finalised a trade agreement today aimed at boosting bilateral trade, expanding market access, attracting investment, and fostering cooperation in areas of mutual interest,” the Pakistani embassy in the US posted on X on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114943927434273211" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> the deal on his platform Truth Social early Thursday morning.</p>
<p>“We have just concluded a deal with the country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves,” Trump wrote.</p>
<p>“We are in the process of choosing the oil company that will lead this partnership. Who knows, maybe they’ll be selling oil to India some day!”</p>
<p>There was no formal announcement from either side on what tariff rate was agreed upon, but the Pakistani embassy said the agreement “will result in reduction of reciprocal tariff especially on Pakistani exports to the United States.”</p>

<p>“This deal marks the beginning of a new era of economic collaboration especially in energy, mines and mineral, IT, cryptocurrency and other sectors,” the embassy said.</p>
<p>“The deal complements Pakistan’s existing efforts of broadening the scope of Pak-US economic ties and to include partnerships at the US states level. The agreement enhances Pakistan’s access to the US market and vice versa.”</p>
<p>The deal was reached during a meeting of Aurangzeb, US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer. Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul and Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh were also present during the meeting.</p>
<p>The Pakistan embassy said the deal is expected to spur increased US investment in Pakistan’s infrastructure and development projects.</p>
<p>“This trade agreement underscores the commitment of both nations to deepen their bilateral relationship and explore all avenues for strengthening trade and investment ties.”</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked Trump for his leadership role in finalising the “historic US-Pakistan trade agreement”, saying in a post on X that  “this landmark deal will enhance our growing cooperation so as to expand the frontiers of our enduring partnership in days to come.”</p>

<p>Aurangzeb called the deal a “win-win” for both countries.</p>
<p>“Today marks the culmination of the journey we started a few months back,” he said in a video message released by the Ministry of Finance on Thursday.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb reflected on the progress made since the talks related to the tariffs began, highlighting efforts to address non-tariff barriers, correct the trade imbalance, and review tariff lines on both sides.</p>

<p>“We had a very constructive final round of discussion which then lead to finalising the trade deal, which was later on announced by President Trump.</p>
<p>“From our perspective, it was always going beyond the immediate trade imperative. The whole point of this is that trade and investment have to go hand in hand,” the finance minister said.</p>
<p>He expressed his gratitude to several people and entities for their involvement in the process.</p>
<p>“The role of the private sector is prominent, because when we were trying to figure out how to reduce or end the trade imbalance, the private sector was the first constituent who came up and said they will help,” Aurangzeb said.</p>
<p>He thanked the commerce secretary and Ambassador Sheikh, and their respective teams, saying, “Where we stand today is because of our teamwork.”</p>
<p>While reiterating Trump’s message in his post, Aurangzeb called it a “real win-win situation for Pakistan and the United States”</p>
<p>“We are in a good place today in Pakistan in terms of where we have arrived before August 1, and for that, I congratulate everyone.</p>
<p>“I think we have come a long way from where we were to where we are today in terms of our overall strategic partnership between Pakistan and the US. It will, God willing, go from strength to strength as we go forward.”</p>
<p>Pakistan, which Washington has designated a “major non-NATO ally” in its effort to counter China’s influence in the region, faced a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810/trumps-tariffs-stoke-global-trade-war-as-china-eu-hit-back">potential tariff</a> of 29 per cent declared in April that was later suspended for 90 days to allow trade talks.</p>
<p>Last week, Dar said both nations were “very close” to a trade deal that could come within days, after he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926640">met</a> US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday.</p>
<p>They discussed expanding trade and ties in critical minerals and mining, the two sides said afterwards. Other Pakistani officials have also visited for talks in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Under Trump, Washington has sought to renegotiate trade deals with many countries, which he threatened with tariffs for trade relations he calls unfair, a characterisation many economists dispute.</p>
<p>US total goods trade with Pakistan was an estimated $7.3 billion in 2024, the office of the US trade representative says on its website, up from about $6.9bn in 2023.</p>
<p>In 2024, its goods trade deficit with Pakistan was $3bn, up 5.2pc from 2023.</p></p>
