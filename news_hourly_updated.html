                <h2>FO assails Indian home minister‚Äôs ‚Äòbrazen disregard‚Äô for int‚Äôl agreements with remarks on never restoring IWT</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Saturday slammed Indian Home Minister Amit Shah‚Äôs ‚Äúbrazen disregard‚Äù for international agreements after the latter said New Delhi would never restore the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Islamabad.</p>
<p>Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">unilaterally suspended</a> its participation in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">1960 IWT</a>, which governs the usage of the Indus river system, on April 23, shortly after 26 civilians were killed in India-held Kashmir. Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack. The latter has denied the allegations and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe.</a> The accord remains dormant despite a ceasefire agreed upon by the two nuclear-armed neighbours last month following their worst fighting in decades.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo, it will never be restored,‚Äù Shah told <em>The Times of India</em> earlier today. ‚ÄúWe will take water that was flowing to Pakistan to Rajasthan by constructing a canal. Pakistan will be starved of water that it has been getting unjustifiably.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The latest comments from Shah, the most powerful cabinet minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs cabinet, reveal Delhi‚Äôs intentions as Islamabad hopes for negotiations on the treaty in the near term.</p>
<p>Responding to Shah‚Äôs comments, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said they reflected ‚Äúa brazen disregard for the sanctity of international agreements‚Äù and noted that the IWT is an apolitical agreement without provisions for unilateral action.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs illegal announcement to hold the treaty in abeyance constitutes a clear violation of international law, the provisions of the treaty itself, and the fundamental principles governing inter-state relations,‚Äù the FO stated.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúSuch conduct sets a reckless and dangerous precedent ‚Äî one that undermines the credibility of international agreements and raises serious questions about the reliability and trustworthiness of a state that openly refuses to fulfil its legal obligations.‚Äù</p>
<p>The FO added that ‚Äúweaponising water for political ends‚Äù is irresponsible and contrary to the behaviour of a responsible state. It demanded that India immediately restore the full implementation of the IWT.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor its part, Pakistan remains firmly committed to the treaty and will take all necessary measures to protect its legitimate rights and entitlements under it,‚Äù the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Addressing a crowd of supporters on Friday night, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had said that New Delhi must accept the IWT, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918592/kashmir-now-a-global-issue-says-bilawal">warning</a> that if it refused to honour the treaty, ‚Äúwe will fight another war and take all six rivers. We know how to defend our rivers.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned India‚Äôs unilateral suspension of the IWT, describing it as a ‚Äúblatant violation and act of water aggression‚Äù, and warned that Pakistan would give a befitting response in line with decisions made at the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting held on April 24.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Last month, <em>Reuters</em> reported that India plans to dramatically increase the water it draws from a major river that feeds Pakistani farms downstream, as part of retaliatory action.</p>
<p>The FO did not immediately respond to <em>Reuters</em>‚Äô request for comments, but it has said in the past that the treaty has no provision for one side to unilaterally pull back, and that any blocking of river water flowing to Pakistan will be considered ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">an act of war</a>‚Äù.</p>
<p>Islamabad is also exploring a legal challenge to India‚Äôs decision to hold the treaty in abeyance under international law.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar slammed Shah‚Äôs ‚Äúprovocative and inflammatory‚Äù comments on the IWT, warning that stopping Pakistan‚Äôs water will be considered an act of war.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan is taking all necessary steps to ensure regional stability,‚Äù Dar told the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting hosted by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe provocative and inflammatory statements being made by the Indian leadership, as well as India‚Äôs unilateral and illegal actions, especially its decision to hold the IWT in abeyance, represent an intent to further destabilise the region,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet me state categorically that Pakistan will not allow India to stop water for our people. It will be treated as an act of war.‚Äù</p>

<p>Indian-held Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Friday opposed diverting the state‚Äôs waters to Punjab and other neighbouring states now that the IWT with Pakistan stands suspended, asking why they should get more water when they already have three rivers while parts of the Union Territory are facing an acute water shortage, India‚Äôs  <em>Telegraph</em> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNobody will take it. At least I will not allow it as of now. First allow us to use our water, then we will talk about others. There is a drought-like situation in Jammu. There is no water in taps,‚Äù Abdullah told reporters.</p>
<p>Abdullah was reacting to the purported central government move to conduct a feasibility study for constructing a 113km-long canal to direct the surplus flow from the three western rivers of the Indus water system, the report said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy should I take water to Punjab? There are already three rivers with Punjab (and the other two states) under the Indus Waters Treaty. Did they give us water when we needed it?‚Äù he was quoted as having said.</p>
<p>Omar referred to Punjab‚Äôs purported refusal to share water during disputes over the Ujh multipurpose project and the Shahpur Kandi barrage in Jammu in the past. ‚ÄúWe were in dire straits then but they kept us waiting for years‚Ä¶. After years, some work was done on the Shahpur Kandi barrage,‚Äù he said.</p></p>

                <h2>Ogra advises oil marketing companies to ensure maintenance of mandatory 20-day stock levels</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) on Saturday advised all oil marketing companies (OMCs) to ensure the maintenance of their mandatory 20-day stock levels amid the impact of the Iran-Israel conflict on global oil supply.</p>
<p>In a statement issued today, the authority‚Äôs spokesperson said: ‚ÄúOgra has confirmed that the country currently holds sufficient stocks of petroleum products to meet existing demand.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, in view of anticipated future requirements and the prevailing market situation, Ogra has formally advised all oil marketing companies (OMCs) to ensure the maintenance of their mandatory 20-day stock levels, in line with the conditions stipulated in their respective licences.‚Äù</p>
<p>The spokesperson said Ogra remained committed to monitoring the situation closely and would continue to take proactive steps to ensure national energy security.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917618/country-has-ample-petroleum-stocks">high-level meeting</a> on Monday reviewed petroleum products prices and supply dynamics in response to the evolving geopolitical situation following Israel‚Äôs recent attack on Iran and the resulting volatility in the international oil markets.</p>
<p>The committee was constituted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif with a task to monitor petroleum product pricing and supply dynamics. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chaired the first meeting of the committee in the Finance Division.</p>
<p>An official announcement said that the committee meeting was attended by senior representatives from key federal ministries, regulatory authorities, and energy sector experts. The formation of this committee reflects the government‚Äôs proactive approach to safeguarding national energy interests and ensuring market stability during a time of heightened international uncertainty.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the members assessed the global and domestic petroleum market situation. The committee expressed satisfaction that Pakistan currently held adequate stocks of petroleum products and there is no immediate risk of supply disruption.</p>
<p>However, members emphasised the need for continued vigilance given the rapidly changing regional context.</p>
<p>To ensure timely response and effective coordination, a working group will monitor developments on a daily basis, and the full committee will meet weekly to review the situation and submit recommendations to the prime minister.</p>
<p>The committee has been entrusted with the tasks to closely monitor the forward/futures prices of petroleum products and the predictability of supply chain in view of the current conflict in the region. IT will also determine Forex implications of price volatility for the short and medium term.</p>
<p>According to the terms of reference of the committee, it will suggest a plan (if required) to ensure that there are no supply disruptions and the market is well supplied and carry out detailed analysis of the fiscal impact, in the event of a protracted conflict.</p>
<p>The Petroleum Division has been designated to provide secretarial support and ensure effective implementation of the committee‚Äôs mandate.</p>
<p>The government remains fully committed to maintaining energy security, stabilising markets, and protecting the national interest during this critical time, added the announcement.</p></p>
