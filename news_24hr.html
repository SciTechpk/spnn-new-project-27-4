            <p><p>The body of a child who was swept away in the Swat River on Friday has been recovered from Charsadda, rescue officials said on Sunday, making this the 12th body recovered from the incident.</p>
<p>At least 19 people have been killed and six others injured in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa amid heavy rains and the consequent flash floods and landslides, according to data from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).</p>
<p>KP Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Bilal Faizi said the child’s body was recovered from Charsadda and shifted to a hospital.</p>
<p>“He will be shifted to his native area in an ambulance,” Faizi said.</p>
<p>“One person remains missing and a search operation is underway.”</p>
<p>According to Faizi, a total of 17 people were reported missing on Friday when torrential flash floods triggered by heavy rains affected several areas in Swat and Malakand divisions.</p>
<p>Four people were rescued, while 11 bodies had been recovered. Today, a 12th body was recovered, leaving one person who remains missing.</p>
<p>Separately, the body of a young man who drowned in a flooded river in Lower Dir two days ago has been recovered in Charsadda, according to Faizi.</p>
<p>“The rescue team had been conducting continuous search operations for the past two days, after which the body was found,” Faizi said.</p>

<p>More rain is expected in the next 24-48 hours across most districts of KP, according to a statement from KP PDMA.</p>
<p>Flooding is expected in Swat, Chitral, Abbotabad, Mansehra, Peshawar, Bannu and Waziristan. An increase in the water level is expected in Swat River and Panjokra River and its tributaries, PDMA said.</p>
<p>Low-level flooding is expected in the Kabul River over the next 48 hours.</p>
<p>“Land sliding and flooding in local rivers and canals is likely in mountainous areas. PDMA has issued alerts to district administrations to take precautionary  measures,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 and other relief teams have been directed to utilise all available resources.</p>
<p>PDMA has directed local administration to control traffic at sensitive places and highways, as well as direct travelers on national highways and provincial highways to take precaution. It was also directed that alternative routes be made for traffic flow.</p>
<p>“Ensure the cleanliness of rivers and drains and drainage systems to avoid urban flooding,” PDMA said.</p>
<p>The public was requested to take shelter in safe places during wind, hail and thunderstorms, while institutions were directed to disseminate weather alerts in local languages.</p>
<p>Farmers were directed to harvest crops early and store them in safe places, while cattle farmers were directed to protect their livestock.</p>
<p>“PDMA’s Emergency Operations Center is fully functional. The public should report any untoward incident to 1700,” the statement said.</p></p>

            <p><p>Israel’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/920700">attack</a> on the Evin prison in Iran’s capital, Tehran on June 23 killed 71 people, Iranian judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir said on Sunday.</p>
<p>At the end of an air war with Iran, Israel struck Tehran’s jail for political prisoners, in a demonstration that it was expanding its targets beyond military, civilian and nuclear sites to aim at symbols of Iran’s ruling system. According to Iranian health ministry figures, 610 people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920790">killed</a> on the Iranian side in the 12-day war, 13 of them children and 49 women, before a ceasefire went into effect last week.</p>
<p>“In the attack on Evin prison, 71 people were martyred, including administrative staff, youth doing their military service, detainees, family members of detainees who were visiting them and neighbours who lived in the prison’s vicinity,” Jahangir said in remarks carried on the judiciary’s news outlet <em>Mizan</em>.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Jahangir had previously said that part of Evin prison’s administrative building had been damaged in the attack, and people were killed and injured. The judiciary added that the remaining detainees had been transferred to other prisons in Tehran province.</p>
<p>Evin prison holds a number of foreign nationals, including two French citizens detained for three years.</p>
<p>“The strike targeting Evin prison in Tehran, put our citizens Cecile Kohler and Jacques Paris in danger. It is unacceptable,” France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot had said on social media X after the attack.</p>

            <p><p>The Republican-controlled US Senate narrowly advanced President Donald Trump’s, sweeping <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912732">tax-cut and spending bill</a> on Saturday, during a marathon weekend session marked by political drama, division and lengthy delays as Democrats sought to slow the legislation’s path to passage.</p>
<p>Lawmakers voted 51-49 to open debate on the 940-page megabill, with two of Trump’s fellow Republicans joining Democrats to oppose the legislation that would fund the president’s top immigration, border, tax-cut and military <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886467/trade-immigration-culture-wars-trumps-big-promises">priorities</a>.</p>
<p>Trump on social media hailed the “great victory” for his “great, big, beautiful bill”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-3/5  w-full  media--left    media--uneven  media--stretch">
        <div class="media__item  "><img alt="" src="https://i.dawn.com/primary/2025/06/29110216e2e1d91.png" /></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>After hours of delay, during which Republican leaders and Vice President JD Vance worked behind closed doors to persuade last-minute holdouts to support the measure, Democrats demanded that the megabill first be read aloud in the chamber — a task that could delay the start of the debate until Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>Democrats say the bill’s tax cuts would disproportionately benefit the wealthy at the expense of social programs for lower-income Americans.</p>
<p>“Senate Republicans are scrambling to pass a radical bill, released to the public in the dead of night, praying the American people don’t realise what’s in it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor.</p>
<p>“Democrats are going to force this chamber to read it from start to finish,” he said.</p>
<p>Once the bill has been read, lawmakers will begin up to 20 hours of debate on the legislation. That will be followed by a marathon amendment session, known as a “vote-a-rama,” before the Senate votes on passage. Lawmakers said they hoped to complete work on the bill on Monday.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Republican Senators Thom Tillis and Rand Paul voted against opening debate, a move that seemed for a time to be in danger of failing.</p>
<p>Trump attacked Tillis, who opposed the bill’s cuts to the Medicaid healthcare program for lower-income Americans, which he said would be devastating for his native North Carolina. Tillis is up for reelection next year.</p>
<p>“Numerous people have come forward wanting to run in the Primary against ‘Senator Thom’ Tillis. I will be meeting with them over the coming weeks,” the president posted.</p>
<p>Paul opposed the legislation because it would raise the federal borrowing limit on the $36.2 trillion US debt by an additional $5tr.</p>
<p>“Did Rand Paul Vote ‘NO’ again tonight? What’s wrong with this guy???” Trump said on social media.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#in-limbo" id="in-limbo" title="Permalink"></a>In limbo</h2>
<p>Saturday’s vote was in limbo for hours as Vance, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other top Republicans sought to persuade last-minute holdouts to support the legislation. It was not clear what deals, if any, were struck to win over their support.</p>
<p>Hardline Republican Senators Rick Scott, Mike Lee and Cynthia Lummis, who want deeper cuts in federal spending, voted to support the bill in the end. Another hardliner, Senator Ron Johnson, initially voted no but flipped his vote and backed the legislation.</p>
<p>Trump was monitoring the vote from the Oval Office late into the night, a senior White House official said.</p>
<p>The megabill would extend the 2017 tax cuts that were Trump’s main legislative achievement during his first term as president, cut other taxes and boost spending on the military and border security.</p>
<p>The nonpartisan Joint Tax Committee released an analysis projecting that the Senate bill’s tax provisions would reduce government revenue by $4.5tr over the next decade, increasing the $36.2tr US government debt.</p>
<p>The White House said this month the legislation would reduce the annual deficit by $1.4tr.</p>
<p>The world’s richest person, Elon Musk, also took a swipe at the bill, which would end tax breaks for the electric vehicles that his automaker Tesla manufactures.</p>
<p>Calling the bill “utterly insane and destructive,” he risked reigniting a feud with Trump that raged earlier this month, before Musk backed down from his rhetoric.</p>
<p>“The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!” Musk wrote in a post on his social media platform X.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#medicaid-changes" id="medicaid-changes" title="Permalink"></a>Medicaid changes</h2>
<p>Republicans from states with large rural populations have opposed a reduction in state tax revenue for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903408">Medicaid</a> providers, including rural hospitals. The newly released legislation would delay that reduction and would include $25 billion to support rural Medicaid providers from 2028 to 2032.</p>
<p>The legislation would raise the cap on federal deductions for state and local taxes to $40,000 with an annual 1pc inflation adjustment through 2029, after which it would fall back to the current $10,000. The bill would also phase the cap down for those earning more than $500,000 a year.</p>
<p>That is a major concern of House Republicans from coastal states, including New York, New Jersey and California, who play an important role in keeping the party’s narrow House majority.</p>
<p>Republicans are using a legislative manoeuvre to bypass the Senate’s 60-vote threshold to advance most legislation in the 100-member chamber.</p>
<p>Democrats will focus their firepower with amendments aimed at reversing Republican spending cuts to programs that provide government-backed healthcare to the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as food aid to low-income families.</p>
<p>The bill also would raise the Treasury Department’s debt ceiling by trillions of dollars to stave off a potentially disastrous default on the nation’s debt in the coming months.</p>
<p>If the Senate passes the bill, it will then return to the House of Representatives for final passage before Trump can sign it into law. The House passed its version of the bill last month.</p></p>
