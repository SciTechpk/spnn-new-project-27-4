                <h2>DG ISPR rubbishes rumours of army chief becoming president</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has rubbished rumours of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir becoming the president.</p>
<p>His statement follows a similar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923280/interior-minister-rebuts-rumours-about-president-zardari-resigning-from-office">rebuttal</a> by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi early in July, when he clarified that no idea existed ‚Äúabout the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency‚Äù.</p>
<p>Gen Chaudhry, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general, told <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2025/08/03/pakistans-army-chief-is-cosying-up-to-donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Economist</a></em> that ‚Äútalk of his boss becoming president is ‚Äònonsense‚Äô‚Äù.</p>
<p><em>The Economist</em> noted that COAS Munir‚Äôs popularity has surged since the May <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">conflict with India</a>. It added that the ruling coalition‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921643">recently acquired</a> two-thirds majority in the parliament needed for a Constitutional Amendment ‚Äúignited rumours that the army chief could become president too‚Äù.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856908">government</a>, as well as the military, have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1876905">repeatedly</a> warned about ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=fake%20news%20and%20propaganda%20have%20become%20so%20common%20and%20there%20is%20no%20accountability%20for%20it.%E2%80%9D">fake news and propaganda</a>‚Äù proliferating on social media, with Gen Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847283/dg-ispr-lt-gen-ahmed-sharif-addresses-press-conference-in-pindi#:~:text=theories%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20added.-,%E2%80%98Digital%20terrorism%E2%80%99,-Questioned%20about%20criticism">digital terrorism</a>‚Äù under the laws.</p>
<p>On July 10, Naqvi asserted that President Asif Ali Zardari ‚Äúenjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces‚Äù.</p>
<p>He quoted the president as having ‚Äúclearly‚Äù stated: ‚ÄúI know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.‚Äù</p>
<p>Naqvi stressed that the ‚Äúsole focus‚Äù of COAS Munir was Pakistan‚Äôs strength and stability, and ‚Äúnothing else‚Äù.</p>
<p>In May, President Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formally decorated COAS Munir with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912748/president-pm-decorate-coas-munir-with-rank-of-field-marshal">rank of field marshal</a> for his ‚Äúsagacious leadership and exceptional strategy‚Äù during the recent conflict with India.</p>

<p>The rank of field marshal is the highest rank of armies built on the pattern of the British Army. It has only been awarded to one other ‚Äî Gen Ayub Khan ‚Äî by the presidential cabinet in 1959. It is a ceremonial five-star rank that usually signifies extraordinary leadership and wartime achievement.</p>
<p>In a subsequent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913061">dinner</a> hosted by the army chief, Field Marshal Munir lauded the political leadership for their ‚Äústrategic foresight‚Äù during <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> against India.</p>
<p>The next month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who belongs to PM Shehbaz‚Äôs PML-N, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918558/whats-behind-khawaja-asifs-praise-for-hybrid-system">hailed</a> the ‚Äúexisting hybrid model of governance‚Äù in the country. In a separate interview, he also termed it as a ‚Äúpractical necessity‚Äù for Pakistan, saying the system was ‚Äúdoing wonders‚Äù.</p></p>

                <h2>PSX witnesses yet another record intraday high of over 144,000</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) continued its record-setting rally for a fourth consecutive session on Wednesday, soaring past 144,000 points during intraday high.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,041.24 points (0.73 per cent) to reach 144,078.40 points at 1:29pm, from the previous close of 143,037.16 points.</p>
<p>The market reached an intraday high of 144,285.74 points at 11:37am, gaining 1,248.58 points (0.87pc) from yesterday‚Äôs close.</p>
<p>Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, told <em>Dawn.com</em>: ‚ÄúThe market is up as corporate results are expected to be better.‚Äù</p>
<p>A key factor behind the market‚Äôs upbeat performance was the release of Pakistan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929033/non-tax-bonanza-pushes-tax-ratio-to-21-year-high">fiscal data</a> for FY25. The government reported a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929033/non-tax-bonanza-pushes-tax-ratio-to-21-year-high#:~:text=These%20windfalls%20reduced%20the%20fiscal%20deficit%20to%20a%209%2Dyear%20low%20of%205.4pc%20in%20FY25">nine-year low</a> fiscal deficit of 5.38pc, with revenue growth of 36pc year-on-year (YoY), outpacing an 18pc rise in expenditures.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>This performance surpassed both the government‚Äôs and the International Monetary Fund‚Äôs (IMF) forecast of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911133">5.6pc GDP deficit</a>. The positive fiscal data, along with market optimism over fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability, is expected to fuel further market momentum in the coming sessions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation pointed to the government‚Äôs approval to resume subsidies for the fully-funded <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920470#:~:text=Pakistan%20Remittance%20Initiative%20%E2%80%94%20a%20government%20scheme%20designed%20to%20incentivise%20banks%20and%20exchange%20companies%20to%20solicit%20the%20flow%20of%20remittances">remittances scheme</a>, as well as speculations regarding steps to resolve the power sector‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903565">circular debt</a>, as catalysts for the bullish close.</p>
