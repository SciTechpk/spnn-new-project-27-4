            <p><p>The Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) on Saturday reviewed complaints against different judges of the superior judiciary, “unanimously” dismissing 19 of them.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi called the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922929">SJC meeting</a> to consider around two dozen pending complaints against superior court judges and a set of recommendations to streamline the process of handling complaints and to ensure transparency while probing allegations of misconduct against judges.</p>
<p>According to a press release dated today, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, the council examined 24 complaints under Article 209 of the Constitution. It said, “19 complaints were unanimously decided to be filed while five others were deferred for the time being.”</p>
<p>The meeting was chaired by CJP Afridi and attended by senior puisine judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Munib Akhtar, Lahore High Court Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and Sindh High Court Chief Justice  Muhammad Junaid Ghaffar.</p>
<p>The press release also said, “The proposed draft of SJC Secretariat Service Rules, 2025 was approved by the council,” adding that the Procedure of Enquiry, 2005 and amendments in the Code of Conduct “needed to be examined from legal and drafting point of view” which required further deliberation.</p>
<p>The SJC had appointed Justice Akhtar as head of a committee to propose amendments to the code of conduct.</p>
<p>In February, the SJC <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1890556/supreme-judicial-council-examines-complaints-against-judges">examined</a> as many as 46 complaints against constitutional office-holders, disposed of 40 of them, sou­ght comments on five complaints and as­­ked for further information in one case.</p></p>

            <p><p>Police in Japan’s Shiga prefecture have arrested an Indian man for allegedly raping a teenage girl last month, local news outlet <em>Kyoto Shimbun</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/-/1518217" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Shiga’s Otsu police arrested the man, identified as a 24-year-old temporary worker, on Thursday on suspicion of assaulting and raping a teenage high school girl.</p>
<p>The man allegedly assaulted the “girl living in the prefecture, including by choking her, and then having sexual intercourse with her at a hotel in Otsu city”.</p>
<p>The incident took place in the early hours of June 21, according to the report, which was also carried by <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.tokyoreporter.com/japan-news/breaking/indian-national-accused-of-raping-school-girl-in-shiga-hotel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tokyo Reporter</a></em>.</p>
<p>It quoted the Otsu police as saying that the suspect and the girl did not know each other. The man had gone with her to the front of a hotel under the pretence of asking for directions, then forced her into a room, the police said.</p>
<p>The suspect denied the charges and was quoted as saying, “I did not force her.”</p>

<p>In India, a court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892554">jailed</a> a 31-year-old man for life in February following the rape and murder of a young Irish woman in the tourist resort state of Goa, nearly eight years after the crime.</p>
