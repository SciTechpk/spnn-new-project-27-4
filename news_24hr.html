            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930420/phc-halts-appointments-of-new-na-senate-opposition-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>PHC halts appointments of new NA, Senate opposition leaders</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Tuesday issued a stay order for the appointments of new opposition leaders in the National Assembly and the Senate following the disqualification and removal of PTI’s Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz from their respective roles.</p>
<p>On August 5, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928901">disqualified</a> Ayub and Faraz, along with other opposition MNAs and MPAs, following their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">convictions</a> in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927964/pti-opposition-leaders-over-100-others-sentenced-for-may-9-riots#:~:text=judgements%20in%20three%20separate%20cases">three</a> cases related to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9, 2023 riots</a>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, on August 8, both leaders were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929551">removed</a> from their posts through notifications issued by the NA and Senate secretariats.</p>
<p>A division bench comprising Justices Arshad Ali and Dr Khurshid Iqbal took up separate petitions filed earlier today by Ayub and Faraz against the denotification of their parliamentary roles.</p>
<p>PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan appeared as the counsel for both petitioners.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The bench issued notices to the ECP and other respondents, directing them to halt the appointments for the opposition leader in both houses of the parliament, which are currently vacant.</p>
<p>The court adjourned the hearing till August 15 (Friday), seeking replies from the respondents.</p>
<p>During the hearing, Gohar informed the bench of the details of recent developments. “When an MNA becomes the opposition leader, then the ECP’s role does not remain anymore,” he asserted.</p>
<p>“May 9 was an unfortunate incident, which should not have happened,” the PTI leader said. He contended that the ECP recently also disqualified <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927477/haste-raises-eyebrows-as-ecp-disqualifies-another-pti-lawmaker">MNA Abdul Latif</a> from the NA-1 by “citing the wrong reference of the [2012] <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1013436/sc-says-it-cannot-order-musharrafs-trial-for-treason#:~:text=2012%20Azhar%20Siddiq%20case">Azhar Siddique case</a>”.</p>
<p>“We won 180 seats, entered the parliament with 90 seats, and are now left with 23,” the PTI lawyer lamented.</p>
<p>“Now the government wants to bring another party’s opposition leader,” Gohar claimed, requesting the court to issue directives to stop any further action against Ayub and Faraz.</p>
<p>A PHC bench comprising Justice Ali and Justice Farah Jamshed had also barred the ECP from taking any action against Ayub and Faraz on August 6, but to no avail since the order came a day after their disqualification.</p>
<p>The court had also granted the two leaders, as well as Zartaj Gul, protective bail till August 20.</p>

<p>Speaking to the media outside the PHC, Gohar called for the “season of disqualifications” to come to an end.</p>
<p>“These disqualifications are not the solution to any issue,” the PTI leader emphasised. “I will request everyone to come to their senses now.”</p>
<p>Refuting reports of friction within the party leadership, he asserted: “There is no weakness in our team; we are being oppressed.”</p>
<p>Gohar also reaffirmed the PTI’s intention to stage gatherings across the country on August 14 to “celebrate Independence Day and raise voice” for ex-premier Imran Khan’s release, despite the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930003">government’s call</a> to reschedule the protests.</p>

<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTIofficial/status/1953459018187354362" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> issued by the PTI and attributed to Imran has termed August 14 as the “next important day” of the party’s fresh <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928760/pti-to-kick-off-free-imran-movement-today">protest movement</a>.</p>
<p>However, Gohar also acknowledged the need for a dialogue to solve the ongoing political crisis.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media outside the PHC, Ayub highlighted “rising” inflation in the country. “These people (government) are enjoying themselves by burdening the people of Pakistan,” he said.</p>
<p>He alleged: “There has been a scandal of more than Rs500 billion in the petroleum sector. There was another scandal worth Rs2,000bn which has come to light.”</p>

<p>On <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9, 2023</a>, PTI supporters, protesting party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, following which thousands were arrested.</p>
<p>PTI parliamentarians convicted in May 9 cases would face automatic disqualification under Article 63(1)(g) of the Constitution, which bars members convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude or corrupt practices.</p>
<p>A Faisalabad anti-terrorism court on July 31 had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">senten­ced</a> over PTI 100 leaders and workers to jail terms of up to 10 years in connection with the riots. Ayub, Faraz, PTI’s Zartaj Gul and Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza were among the key opposition leaders handed rigorous imprisonment.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>They were convicted under sections 109 (punishment for abetment) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) in a case registered at Ghulam Muhammadabad police station.</p>
<p>In another case registered at the same police station, 60 out of 67 accused were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927964/pti-opposition-leaders-over-100-others-sentenced-for-may-9-riots">convicted</a>, while seven were acquitted.</p>
<p>In the case filed at the Civil Lines police station, 107 out of 108 accused were sentenced to 10 years in prison and one person was handed a three-year jail term, while 77 were acquitted.</p>
<p>Former information minister Fawad Chaudhry, MNA Zain Qureshi (son of PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi), MPA Khayal Ahmad Kastro and Faizullah Kamuka were acquitted in all three cases.</p>
<p>The judge had issued arrest warrants for those convicted who were not present in court and had directed the police to arrest all convicts and bring them before the court for imprisonment.</p>

<p>Separately, on July 23, a Lahore ATC had handed Yasmin Rashid, Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed and other PTI leaders 10-year rigorous imprisonment in a case related to vandalism at <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925804/atc-hears-final-arguments-in-sherpao-bridge-violence-case">Sherpao Bridge</a>. However, Qureshi and five others were acquitted.</p>
<p>The same day, a Sargodha ATC had sentenced dozens of PTI leaders, including then-Punjab Assembly opposition leader Malik Ahmed Khan Bhachar, in another May 9 riots case registered at the Musakhel police station.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1880141">December 21</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881338">Dec 26</a> last year, a military court sentenced 85 civilians, including ex-premier Imran Khan’s nephew Hassaan Niazi, to up to 10 years for their involvement in the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>However, days later, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884089">mercy petitions</a> of 19 accused were later accepted on humanitarian grounds, while 48 other pleas had been processed to Courts of Appeal.</p></p>

            <p><p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Tuesday dismissed talk of any potential legislation regarding a 27th constitutional amendment as “baseless rumours”.</p>
<p>Even though the 26th Amendment is still mired in controversy, the power corridors in Islamabad are abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment, which, according to the insiders, will further “fine-tune” the structure and the functioning of the superior judiciary.</p>
<p>With the 26th Amendment, the government introduced sweeping changes to the judicial framework. Sources had said certain contentious matters, such as a separate constitutional court, left unresolved in the 26th Amendment, would now be taken up in the new amendment.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters in Hyderabad about the matter, Bilawal addressed the “baseless rumours”, stating: “So far, no federal minister, prime minister or party member has approached me regarding any amendments.”</p>
<p>He also highlighted that the 26th Amendment was passed after reaching a consensus with compromise from political parties. “PPP wanted constitutional courts, but we compromised,” he said.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MediaCellPPP/status/1955195709377954135" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the PPP quoted him as saying, “The 26th Constitutional Amendment is an eternal success. Judicial reforms and constitutional courts were a demand of the Charter of Democracy, but we prioritised a constitutional bench over a constitutional court for the sake of consensus.”</p>
<p>Though the speculations are rife, there has been no official word regarding the 27th Constitutional Amendment. At present, the proposal to further reform the judiciary is at a very initial stage, but consultations are reportedly underway within the ruling PML-N and some legal circles. Despite these purported consultations, any draft for this proposed bill has yet to see the light of day.</p>

<p>On Sunday, PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929988">said</a> that the party would approach the legal fraternity following “new drama” surrounding the legislation. “In this case, we will approach the lawyers’ community regarding this legislation,” he said, adding, “We will begin by meeting with the Islamabad Bar this month.”</p>
<p>In June, amid speculation in legal circles about the government planning to bring in the 27th Amendment, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915322">endorsed</a> the amendment while calling for broad-based judicial reforms, including the nationwide rotation of judges.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#nfc-award" id="nfc-award" title="Permalink"></a>NFC award</h2>
<p>While responding to a question about amending the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, Bilawal said, “Absolutely. Further changes must come in NFC.”</p>
<p>He continued, “The previous NFC award was given before passing the 18th Amendment, which was before 2010.”</p>
<p>He said that various responsibilities of the federal government were handed to the provinces, adding, “But the NFC is the same as it was prior to the 18th Amendment.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The PPP chairman continued, “The Constitution says that the NFC award must be regularly given after five years. It is already mentioned that the shares of provincial governments cannot be reduced in new NFC awards.”</p>
<p>“All provinces must be given more resources as per the increased responsibilities after the 18th Amendment.”</p>
<p>He added, “We must immediately call NFC and give new awards. All provinces must be given resources according to the 18th Amendment.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Pakistan on Tuesday welcomed the US’ <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930224/us-state-department-designates-bla-majeed-brigade-as-foreign-terrorist-organisations">decision</a> to designate the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and Majeed Brigade to its Foreign Terrorist Organisation list, according to a Foreign Office (FO) press release.</p>
<p>The US State Department made the announcement yesterday, stating that the designations demonstrated the US President Donald Trump’s commitment to counter-terrorism.</p>
<p>In today’s <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/pakistan-welcomes-us-designation-of-baloch-liberation-army-bla-and-majeed-brigade-as-foreign-terrorist-organisations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>, the FO emphasised that Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349">proscribed</a> the Majeed Brigade — BLA’s suicide squad — as a terrorist entity since July 18, 2024.  The BLA itself was proscribed in 2006, according to the National Counter-Terrorism Authority’s <a class="link--external" href="https://nacta.gov.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/proscribed-organizations-06-oct-2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">list of proscribed organisations</a>.</p>

<p>“BLA/Majeed Brigade is involved in multiple terrorist attacks in Pakistan, including the heinous <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897237/rescue-operation-for-hostages-underway-after-terrorists-attack-jaffar-express-in-balochistan">Jaffer Express</a> terrorist incident and the Khuzdar bus attack that resulted in the loss of precious lives,” the release said.</p>
<p>At least 26 hostages lost their lives in the Jaffar Express attack in March, for which the BLA <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901013/jaffar-express-departs-from-quetta-after-17-day-hiatus#:~:text=claimed%20by%20Balochistan%20Liberation%20Army%20terrorists%2C">claimed responsibility</a>. In the Khuzdar bus attack, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913363">10 people</a> — including two students — lost their lives during a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912542/pm-vows-strong-action-against-perpetrators-after-school-bus-blast-in-khuzdar">suicide attack</a> on a school bus in May.</p>
<p>The group was also behind the 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1863586">attack</a> near the Karachi airport, which killed three people, including two Chinese nationals, as well as the Gwadar Port Authority Complex <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1822759">attack</a>, which claimed the lives of eight soldiers.</p>
<p>“Pakistan remains a steadfast bulwark against terrorism. Our sacrifices have secured critical counter-terrorism successes, not only for the country, but for regional stability and global security.”</p>
<p>It added that the country remained unwavering in its resolve to protect its citizens and eliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. “Pakistan remains committed to cooperating with the international community to overcome this common challenge.”</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi welcomed the US decision and sincerely thanked US President Donald Trump and his administration.</p>
<p>“This is a major diplomatic victory for Pakistan and another defeat for our eternal enemy,” Naqvi was quoted as saying in a post on X by his ministry.</p>
<p>“This move by the US is an acknowledgement of Pakistan’s immense sacrifices in the war against terrorism,” adding that Pak-US cooperation against terrorism is welcome.</p>
<p>“A path has been created for action on a global level against the BLA and Majeed Brigade.”</p>

<p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also welcomed the US’s decision while speaking to reporters at an event in Hyderabad.</p>

<p>“When India and Pakistan fought a war, BLA and Majeed Brigade openly voiced support for Modi,” he said.</p>
<p>“Now the US has endorsed this point, which is a huge success for Pakistan.”</p>

<p>He noted that although it helps when other countries declare these groups as terrorist organisations, “we must try to declare it as such through the UN so that international financing, especially that of Indian intelligence agencies and facilitators, is tackled”.</p>
<p>The <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/asim-munirs-visit-to-the-u-s-strengthens-pakistans-position-exposes-indias-terror-links/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that security sources said that Field Marshal Asim Munir’s recent visit to the US had significantly contributed to the global recognition of Pakistan’s stance on regional security and had once again “exposed India’s involvement in state-sponsored terrorism”.</p>
<p>According to the sources, “India’s covert support for terrorism has been brought to light through Field Marshal Munir’s successful military diplomacy.</p>
<p>“The US designation of BLA and the Majeed Brigade as terrorist organisations is a direct outcome of the field marshal’s efforts.”</p>
<p>The sources emphasised that the US move to blacklist the BLA and Majeed Brigade as global terrorist organisations represented international validation of Pakistan’s position.</p>
<p>Security sources concluded by warning that India’s terrorist designs posed a serious threat not only to regional stability but also to global peace.</p>

<p>Islamabad had previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925093/pakistan-seeks-listing-of-majeed-brigade-as-terror-group">requested</a> that the Majeed Brigade be listed as an international terrorist organisation. In 2019, the State Department <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1491717">labelled</a> the BLA as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT), making it a crime for anyone in the US to assist the militants, but did not designate the Majeed Brigade at that time.</p>
