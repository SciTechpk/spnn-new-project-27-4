            <p><p>At least seven people died and six were injured early on Monday when a landslide hit individuals working at a water channel in Gilgit-Baltistan’s (GB) Danyor city, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660/situationer-unprecedented-melting-in-g-b">melting glaciers</a> have become more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921009/at-least-8-dead-13-injured-in-rain-related-incidents-across-gb-punjab-and-sindh-officials#:~:text=two%20sisters%20died%20after%20being%20swept%20away">late June</a>.</p>
<p>The situation worsened when deadly floods <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20so%20far%2C%2010%20fatalities%20and%20four%20injuries%20have%20been%20reported">10 deaths</a> have been confirmed across the region, with a dozen tourists <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928659/funeral-held-in-absentia-for-missing-tourists-in-gbs-babusar-after-14-days-of-search-efforts">missing</a>.</p>
<p>Thirteen workers, mainly young people, were attempting to restore the water supply in the main water channel from Danyor nullah to Danyor town, which had been damaged due to the recent floods, when the landslide hit at 2am today.</p>
<p>“Thirteen workers restoring the water supply were buried under the rubble,” Gilgit’s Rescue 1122 said in a statement.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Stating the casualties, it said the injured were taken to a hospital. District Emergency Officer (operations) Abdul Basit was present at the site to supervise the restoration, Rescue 1122 added.</p>
<p>Muhammad Akbar, one of the residents who took part in the rescue operations, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the bodies and injured had been moved to “various hospitals in Gilgit and Danyor”.</p>
<p>On July 22, a flash flood in Danyor nullah <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930#:~:text=Rescue%201122%20said%20a%20flash%20flood%20in%20Danyor%20nallah%20inundated%20residential%20communities">inundated</a> residential communities and damaged crops and irrigation channels. The deluge also damaged link roads and suspension bridges, cutting road links to affected areas.</p>
<p>Hussain Akbar Shah, another local, said thousands of Danyor residents were facing a shortage of drinking water and irrigation water as the valley depended on water from the nullah.</p>
<p>A statement by the GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq stated that the total number of workers was 15, out of whom seven were confirmed dead.</p>
<p>An emergency has been declared at hospitals in Gilgit, the spokesperson added. “Our hearts are saddened by this unfortunate accident. Gilgit is in a state of mourning,” Faraq said.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Funeral prayers were later held for the workers who died in the incident. Residents also protested at Danyor Chowk against the incident, holding the government responsible for it.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters, area elders led by former GB minister Muhammad Iqbal said the government had failed to res­tore the disrupted water supply despite repeated assurances.</p>
<p>The elders noted that although residents had managed to temporarily restore the pipeline, subsequent flooding destroyed it again, while the government had not started work on it. The protesters demanded that the government take action, or they would launch protests.</p>
<p>GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan expressed his condolences on the incident and announced compensation for the bereaved families.</p>
<p>“The families of those who died in the Danyor nullah [incident] will receive compensation as per the government policy,” CM Gulbar said, directing that the wounded be provided with the best medical treatment.</p></p>

            <p><p>Prominent <em>Al Jazeera</em> journalist Anas Al Sharif, who had previously been threatened by Israel, was among four colleagues in an Israeli airstrike on Sunday, in an attack widely condemned by media and rights groups.</p>
<p>Israel’s military said it targeted and killed Al Sharif, alleging he had “headed a Hamas cell and was involved in rocket attacks against Israel”.</p>
<p><em>Al Jazeera</em> rejected the claim and said that before his death, Al Sharif had also dismissed earlier claims by Israel that he was connected to Hamas.</p>
<p>Al Sharif, aged 28, was among a group of four <em>Al Jazeera</em> journalists and an assistant who died in a strike on a tent near Shifa Hospital in eastern Gaza City, Gaza officials and <em>Al Jazeera</em> said. An official at the hospital said two other people were also killed in the strike.</p>
<p>Calling Al Sharif “one of Gaza’s bravest journalists”, <em>Al Jazeera</em> said the attack was a “desperate attempt to silence voices in anticipation of the occupation of Gaza”.</p>
<p>The other journalists killed were Mohammed Qreiqeh, photographers Ibrahim Al Thaher, and Mohamed Nofal and Mohammed Noufal.</p>

<p>Al Sharif was previously part of a <em>Reuters</em> team, which in 2024 won a Pulitzer Prize in the category of Breaking News Photography for coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said in a statement that Al Sharif was the head of a Hamas cell and “was responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF (Israeli) troops,” citing intelligence and documents found in Gaza as evidence.</p>
<p>Journalists’ groups and <em>Al Jazeera</em> denounced the killings.</p>
<p>A press freedom group and a United Nations expert previously warned that Al Sharif’s life was in danger due to his reporting from Gaza. UN Special Rapporteur Irene Khan said last month that Israel’s claims against him were unsubstantiated.</p>
<p><em>Al Jazeera</em> said Al Sharif had left a social media message to be posted in the event of his death that read, “…I never hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or misrepresentation, hoping that God would witness those who remained silent.”</p>
<p>Last October, Israel’s military had named Al Sharif as one of six Gaza journalists it alleged were members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, citing documents it said showed lists of people who completed training courses and salaries.</p>
<p><em>Al Jazeera</em> categorically rejects the Israeli occupation forces’ portrayal of our journalists as terrorists and denounces their use of fabricated evidence, the network said in a statement at the time.</p>
<p>The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which in July urged the international community to protect Al Sharif, said in a statement that Israel had failed to provide any evidence to back up its allegations against him.</p>
<p>Israel’s pattern of labelling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom, said Sara Qudah, CPJ’s director for the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>Al Sharif, whose X <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/AnasAlSharif0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">account</a> showed more than 500,000 followers, posted on the platform minutes before his death that Israel had been intensely bombarding Gaza City for more than two hours.</p>
<p>Hamas said the killing may signal the start of an Israeli offensive.</p>
<p>“The assassination of journalists and the intimidation of those who remain paves the way for a major crime that the occupation is planning to commit in Gaza City,” Hamas said in a statement.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would launch a new offensive to dismantle Hamas strongholds in Gaza, where a hunger crisis is escalating after 22 months of conflict.</p>
<p>“Anas Al Sharif and his colleagues were among the last remaining voices in Gaza conveying the tragic reality to the world,” <em>Al Jazeera</em> said.</p>
<p>The Gaza government media office said 237 journalists have been killed since the war started on October 7, 2023. The Committee to Protect Journalists said at least 186 journalists have been killed in the Gaza conflict.</p></p>

            <p><p><strong>• Protesters demand tax exemption for GB residents and clearance of 280 stuck consignments<br />
•  Federal committee, including GB leadership, meets today to discuss resolution</strong></p>
<p>GILGIT: The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929586/traders-continue-sit-in-halting-travel-trade-on-kkh-for-20th-day">ongoing sit-in</a> on Karakoram Highway (KKH) has disrupted travel and trade between Pakistan and China via Khunjerab Pass for the 22nd consecutive day on Sunday as deadlock between government and protesters persisted.</p>
<p>The federal committee constituted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will meet on Monday (today) to make recommendations for resolving the issue. GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmed Mirza, PPP President Amjad Hussain Advocate, former GB chief minister and PML-N President Hafeezur Rehman have also been included in the committee.</p>
<p>Trade and travel between Pakistan and China, as well as business activities at the Sost Dry Port, have remained shut for the past 22 days.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927464">protest sit-in</a>, called by the Tajir Ittehad Action Committee — backed by trade organisations, government and opposition parties, and religious groups in the region — is being staged at Sost, blocking trade activities between Pakistan and China in support of their demands.</p>
<p>Members of a committee formed by Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan to resolve the matter had met the protest organisers on Friday. They discussed the issues and prepared recommendations to present to the Prime Minister’s committee.</p>
<p>The protesters have given a two-point agenda to the committee. They demanded exemption of GB residents from income tax, sales tax, and other federal taxes on items imported from China through the Khunjerab Pass.  They also demanded Customs clearance of 280 consignments stuck at Sost Dry Port for over a year under a one-time amnesty scheme.</p>
<p>The protesters announced that they would not call off their protest until their demands are implemented.</p>
<p>Addressing the protest, Rehan Shah, PML-N Hunza president, said that the people of GB have long been demanding their constitutional and legal rights. He added that political, religious, and trade organisations — along with both government and opposition members in GB — support these demands.</p>
<p>He stated that GB has been deprived of constitutional and legal rights for the past seven decades.</p>
<p>Zahoor Karim, PPP local president, said the federal government should only collect taxes after giving GB representation in Pakistan’s National Assembly and Senate. He stressed that the “economic murder” of GB residents would not be tolerated.</p>
<p>“The FBR has introduced policies to deprive GB people of their economic resources. Trade between Pakistan and China has been closed for a year, and goods worth billions of rupees are stuck at Sost Port — some damaged by rain and others expired,” he said.</p>
<p>Protesters said that the majority of GB residents depend on cross-border trade between Pakistan and China through the Khunjerab Pass.</p>
