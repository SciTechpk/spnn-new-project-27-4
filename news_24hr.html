            <p><p>At least eight more people were killed and 13 injured on Sunday in separate rain-related incidents across Karachi, some areas of Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan, according to rescue officials.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities. According to rescue officials, at least 32 people have been killed across four provinces over the last two days as heavy rains triggered flash floods and damaged houses. Meanwhile, some people lost their lives due to electrocution.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Rescue 1122 issued a statement outlining more deaths and injuries in Lahore as a result of rain-related incidents.</p>
<p>“Rescue 1122 received 10 emergency calls about collapsing walls in different parts of the city,” the statement read. “One woman was killed and 10 others were seriously injured. They were moved to different hospitals and received medical aid in Rescue Emergency ambulances.”</p>
<p>The statement added that there were also reports of falling trees across Lahore due to strong winds and rain, however, there were no fatalities or injuries.</p>
<p>“Rescue 1122 staff are present at the highways and are removing fallen trees from the roads,” the statement added.</p>
<p>However, in a separate report, Rescue 1122 said that a billboard fell due to the intense rain and wind and fell on a motorcyclist and his family in Lahore.</p>
<p>According to Rescue 1122, the 50-year-old motorcyclist was killed, while his 35-year-old wife and child were injured, bringing the overall death toll to eight. The injured were transported to Jinnah Hospital.</p>

<p>In Karachi, two people, including the younger brother of former lawmaker and PPP Karachi leader Javed Nagori, were electrocuted in rain-related incidents, according to officials and relatives.</p>
<p>City Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Arif Aziz told <em>Dawn.com</em> that Abdullah Anwar, 41, was sitting at a meeting place in Khadda Market near Sumair Arcade in Lyari, where an electric wire had fallen.</p>
<p>He said Anwar attempted to plug something into a rainwater-drenched wall socket when he suffered an electric shock and died. The SSP said the victim was dead with the wire in his hand when the police arrived.</p>
<p>The body was moved to the Civil Hospital Karachi, where doctors confirmed the cause of death as an electric shock, said police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed.</p>
<p>Nagori, while speaking briefly to <em>Dawn.com</em>, confirmed that the victim was his younger brother.</p>
<p>In another incident, a young man was electrocuted in the metropolis’ Clifton area. Boat Basin Police Station House Officer Malik Riaz Niazi said the man, in his early 30s, was passing by the Parklane Hospital when he apparently touched a wet electric pole and suffered an electric shock.</p>
<p>The body was moved to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) for legal formalities, where his identity could not be ascertained immediately.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, rescue official Sherbaz Khan confirmed to <em>Dawn.com</em> that two sisters died after being swept away by flood waters in the Kargah Nala of Gilgit Baltistan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Punjab’s Sharifpura, two people were killed and one injured when the roof of a mud house collapsed. The bodies and the injured were shifted to Services Hospital, according to Rescue 1122.</p>
<p>Heavy rains were recorded in various districts of Punjab over the past 24 hours, according to Irfan Ali Kathia, Director General of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).</p>
<p>Lahore Airport recorded 65 mm of rain, while 32mm was recorded in Chakwal and 14mm in Dera Ghazi Khan 14. Rain was also recorded in Attock, Noorpur, Thal, Narowal, Kasur, Jhang, Toba, Tek Singh, Bhakkar and Khanewal.</p>
<p>“This spell of monsoon rain will likely continue until July 1,” Kathia was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>“Monsoon rains are also expected across most districts of Punjab in the next 24 hours,” he said.</p>
<p>The DG urged citizens to take precautionary measures and stay in safe places during thunderstorms.</p>
<p>“Keep the speed of the vehicle slow and maintain a reasonable distance. In case of emergency, contact PDMA helpline 1129.”</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921016/50pc-increase-in-fixed-gas-charges-notified-for-domestic-consumers' target='_blank'><strong>50pc increase in fixed gas charges notified for domestic consumers</strong></a>
            <p><p>The government on Sunday notified a 50 per cent increase in fixed gas charges for domestic consumers, according to a notification from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).</p>
<p>On Friday, the federal cabinet’s Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920726/ecc-okays-up-to-50pc-hike-in-gas-charges">approved</a> the hike in fixed gas charges for all consumers from July 1. The ECC decided to increase fixed charges by 50pc for domestic consumers and shift the partial burden to bulk, power sector and industrial consumers.</p>
<p>According to the Ogra notification,  seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, fixed charges for domestic consumers in the Protected category have risen to Rs600 from Rs400, while those in the non-protected category have to pay Rs1,500 as opposed to the previous charge of Rs1,000.</p>
<p>For non-protected consumers exceeding consumption of 1.5 cubic hectometres (hm³), the price has risen to Rs3,000 from Rs2,000.</p>
<p>Though the fixed charges have been increased, the price of gas itself has not risen, according to the notification. The sale prices for both Protected and Non-protected consumers remain the same. Additionally, gas prices for tandoors, commercial units, compressed natural gas and ice factories remain unchanged.</p>
<p>However, gas prices for general industries, power stations and independent power producers have risen.</p>
<p>Last month, Ogra <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912302">determined</a> about 6.6pc (Rs117 per unit) increase in prescribed natural gas prices to meet about Rs890 billion revenue requirement of the two gas companies during 2025-26.</p>
<p>In a determination sent to the federal government, Ogra worked out the average revenue requirement for Karachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) at Rs354bn for the next fiscal year and determined its prescribed price at Rs1,659 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) or about Rs104 per unit reduction from Rs1,762 per mmBtu in FY25.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921038/trump-blasts-communist-winner-of-new-york-mayoral-democratic-primary' target='_blank'><strong>Trump blasts ‘communist’ winner of New York mayoral Democratic primary</strong></a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump branded the winner of New York City’s mayoral Democratic primary a “pure communist” in remarks that aired Sunday, an epithet the progressive candidate dismissed as political theatrics.</p>
<p>Zohran Mamdani’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920134/mamdani-sweeps-democratic-primary-for-nyc-mayoral-race">shock win</a> last week against a scandal-scarred political heavyweight resonated as a thunderclap within the party, and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920579">drew the ire</a> of Trump and his collaborators, who accused Mamdani of being a radical extremist.</p>
<p>The Republican’s aggressive criticism of the self-described democratic socialist is sure to ramp up over the coming months as Trump’s party seeks to push Democrats away from the political centre and frame them as too radical to win major US elections.</p>
<p>“He’s pure communist” and a “radical leftist … lunatic,” Trump fumed on <em>Fox News</em> talk show ‘Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo’. “I think it’s very bad for New York,” added Trump, who grew up in the city and built his sprawling real estate business there.</p>
<p>“If he does get in, I’m going to be president and he is going to have to do the right thing [or] they’re not getting any money” from the federal government.</p>
<p>Trump’s White House has repeatedly threatened to curb funding for Democratic-led US cities if they oppose his policies, including cutting off money to so-called sanctuary cities, which limit their cooperation with
immigration authorities.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Mamdani also took to the talk shows on Sunday, asserting he would “absolutely” maintain New York’s status as a sanctuary city so that “New Yorkers can get out of the shadows and into the full life of the city that they belong to.”</p>
<p>Asked directly on <em>NBC’s</em> ‘Meet the Press’ whether he is a communist, Mamdani — a 33-year-old immigrant aiming to become New York’s first Muslim mayor — responded, “No, I am not.</p>
<p>“And I have already had to start to get used to the fact that the president will talk about how I look, how I sound, where I’m from, who I am, ultimately because he wants to distract from what I’m fighting for,” Mamdani said.</p>
<p>“I’m fighting for the very working people that he ran a campaign to empower, that he has since then betrayed.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>The Ugandan-born state assemblyman had trailed former governor Andrew Cuomo in polls but surged on a message of lower rents, free daycare and buses, and other populist ideas in the notoriously expensive metropolis.</p>
<p>Although registered Democrats outnumber Republicans three to one in New York, victory for Mamdani in November is not assured.</p>
<p>Current Mayor Eric Adams is a Democrat but is campaigning for re-election as an independent, while Cuomo may also run unaffiliated.</p></p>
