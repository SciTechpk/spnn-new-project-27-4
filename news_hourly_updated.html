                <h2>Trump says 5 jets were shot down in India-Pakistan conflict</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Friday that five jets were shot down during the recent India-Pakistan conflict that began after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in India-occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam, with the situation calming after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> in May.</p>
<p>Trump, who made his remarks at a dinner with some Republican US lawmakers at the White House, did not specify which side‚Äôs jets he was referring to.</p>
<p>Pakistan had said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">downed six</a> Indian planes after the latter carried out deadly attacks in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, while New Delhi had <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/india-shot-down-high-tech-jets-of-pakistan-confirms-air-marshal-bharti-938212" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed</a> it had downed ‚Äúa few planes‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSomething I‚Äôm very proud of [is that] we stopped a lot of wars. A lot of wars. And these were serious, serious wars; would have been going on,‚Äù Trump said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou had India-Pakistan that was going, and in fact, planes were being shot out of the air. Five, five, four or five, but I think five jets were shot down actually,‚Äù Trump said while talking about the India-Pakistan hostilities, without elaborating or providing further detail.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was getting worse and worse, wasn‚Äôt it? [‚Ä¶] These are two serious nuclear countries and they were hitting each other. It seems like a new form of warfare; you saw it recently, when you looked at what we did in Iran when we knocked out their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920005">nuclear capability</a>, totally knocked out,‚Äù he said, referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">US strikes</a> on Iran‚Äôs three nuclear sites.</p>

<p>Pakistan said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downed five</a> Indian planes in air-to-air combat, later stating that figure <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">as six</a>. India‚Äôs highest-ranking general said in late May that India switched tactics after suffering losses in the air on the first day of hostilities and established an advantage before a ceasefire was announced three days later.</p>
<p>As New Delhi launched deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a>, which Islamabad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">denied</a>, the Pakistan Air Force downed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">five</a> Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">strikes</a> on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>While India <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/india-shot-down-high-tech-jets-of-pakistan-confirms-air-marshal-bharti-938212" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed</a> downing jets, Islamabad has denied any losses of planes and said it hit <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910381">26 Indian targets</a> were hit after its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186#:~:text=The%20strikes%20targeted%20Nur%20Khan%20air%20base">three air bases</a> were targeted.</p>
<p>Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914608">repeatedly</a> said he prevented a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">nuclear war</a>‚Äù between Pakistan and India after Washington held talks with both sides, even <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920139">crediting</a> Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir for helping in it. India has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921534">differed</a> with Trump‚Äôs claims that it resulted from his intervention and his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911719">threats</a> to sever trade talks.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Most recently, on July 7, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923026/trumps-claim-on-averting-india-pakistan-war-gains-new-life">doubled down</a> on its narrative of Trump playing a central role in defusing tensions, despite India claiming otherwise.</p>
<p>Asked about Indian officials‚Äô repeated <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912153">denials</a> of Trump‚Äôs role, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce avoided taking a position. ‚ÄúSo many comments speak for themselves,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>Pressed further, Bruce added, half in jest: ‚ÄúEveryone will have an opinion. That‚Äôs an opinion. Some opinions are wrong. Mine rarely are, but other people‚Äôs opinions can be wrong.‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs statements stand in contrast to India‚Äôs official position, which maintains that New Delhi acted independently during the May crisis and that Washington did not mediate. Trump‚Äôs remarks support Pakistan‚Äôs view that quiet US diplomacy ‚Äî and direct intervention from the White House ‚Äî helped calm tensions.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs position has been that New Delhi and Islamabad must resolve their problems directly and with no outside involvement.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>India is an increasingly important US partner in Washington‚Äôs effort to counter China‚Äôs influence in Asia, while Pakistan is a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524">strong partner</a> in counterterrorism.</p>
<p>The April attack in Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">killed 26 men</a> and sparked heavy fighting between the nuclear-armed Asian neighbours in the latest escalation of a decades-old rivalry.</p>
<p>New Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">strongly denied</a> responsibility while calling for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral</a> investigation. Washington condemned the attack but did not directly blame Islamabad.</p></p>

                <h2>PAF aircraft win two global awards at UK airshow</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Fighter jets of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) won top awards in two categories at the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) 2025 in the United Kingdom, state-run <em>PTV</em> reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>RIAT, which runs from July 18 to 20, is one of the world‚Äôs largest military airshows, has been running for over 50 years and powers the Royal Air Force Charitable Trust, according to its <a class="link--external" href="https://www.airtattoo.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924755">PAF contingent</a> comprising ‚Äústate-of-the-art JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter aircraft and the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, landed at the Royal Air Force Base Fairford in the UK to participate in the prestigious‚Äù RIAT 2025, a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.</p>

<p>The JF-17 Block-III was awarded the ‚ÄúSpirit of the Meet Trophy‚Äù for its ‚Äústriking livery and the incredible journey from Pakistan with non-stop air-to-air refuelling,‚Äù <em>PTV</em> reported.</p>
<p>According to ISPR‚Äôs press release earlier this week, the JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighters executed successful Air-to-Air Refuelling operations en route to the UK with the support of a PAF IL-78 aerial refuelling tanker.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThese awards were given in recognition of the aircrafts‚Äô excellent flying and technical skills,‚Äù <em>PTV</em> said.</p>
<p>It added that the JF-17C Block III represents Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúadvanced defence technology‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis success has honoured Pakistan‚Äôs aviation sector on an international level.‚Äù</p>
<p><em>PTV</em> called the success at RIAT a ‚Äútestament to the recognition of the capabilities of the Pakistan Air Force‚Äù.</p>
<p>In May, when Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">downed</a> Indian jets as retaliation for late-night strikes during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/pakistan-india-tensions">Pakistan-India conflict</a>, the PAF formally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">acknowledged</a> a month later that it was the Kamra-based 15 Squadron that led the charge in shooting down them down.</p>
<p>The event is now considered one of the largest air-to-air engagements in South Asia in more than half a century.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is a palpable sense of enthusiasm across the United Kingdom following the recent Pakistan-India conflict, as aviation enthusiasts and defence observers were eagerly looking forward to the arrival of the Pakistan Air Force‚Äôs JF-17 Thunder Block-III,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe aircraft‚Äôs combat-proven capabilities and operational excellence have garnered significant global attention, making its appearance at RIAT a highly anticipated highlight in the aerospace and defence community.‚Äù</p></p>
