            <p><p>BAJAUR: Another round of negotiations between the members of Bajaur Amn Jirga and leaders of banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan took place on Sunday, wherein both sides agreed to a ceasefire until the conflict was completely resolved through talks.</p>
<p>Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, the head of the 50-member Bajaur Amn Jirga, didn’t say anything about the details of the third round of talks with TTP leaders that concluded after Maghrib prayers. However, two members of the jirga told <em>Dawn</em> on Sunday that the third round of talks was held in Lowi Mamund tehsil, following conditional <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928424">agreement</a> of TTP leaders to vacate civilian areas during Saturday’s meeting, which was one of the two key demands of Bajaur Amn Jirga.</p>
<p>Sources said that the Sunday’s talks between both sides, aimed at convincing terrorists to either return to Afghanistan or retreat to mountains if they wanted to fight against security forces, were held after high-ups met with jirga members late on Saturday night to discuss the latest developments.</p>
<p>“Officials expressed satisfaction over the outcome of Saturday’s talks between both sides in a meeting with Bajaur Amn Jirga leaders headed by Sahibzada Haroon Rashid and decided to give negotiations another chance to resolve the conflict peacefully, leading to third round of talks,” they said.</p>

<p>On Saturday night, Sahibzada Haroon Rashid in his Facebook <a class="link--external" href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1FzeLYeNMz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> also stated that the third round of talks between them and terrorists would be held on Sunday to resolve the issue through dialogue.</p>
<p>Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, the sole authorised person to inform local media about the outcome of the meeting, did not share details of talks with journalists till filing of this report as he and some other members of the jirga were busy in a meeting with senior officials to brief them on new developments.</p>
<p>However, in a social media <a class="link--external" href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/14EE6CD4hrR/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> shared just before meeting with officials, he said: “I’m satisfied with today’s meeting, which lasted for seven hours.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the residents of Thangi area of Salarzai tehsil on Sunday urged authorities not to abandon a security post in their locality, fearing that the move would put their lives in peril.</p>

<p>Addressing a jirga held at Toot Shah Chowk, local elders said that authorities had planned to abandon the security post, established several years ago in the area.</p>
<p>The participants of the jirga demanded of relevant authorities to reconsider the plan.</p>
<p>ISLAMIC LAW: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl local leaders on Sunday vowed to continue their peaceful struggle for enforcement of Islamic law in the country and for peace and socioeconomic development of the district.</p>
<p>They made the pledge while addressing an event to mark the second anniversary of the July 30, 2023, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1767493">bombing</a> at a party’s gathering near Khar that left 64 people dead and 122 others wounded, mostly JUI-F workers, according to a statement.</p>
<p>The gathering, meant to pay homage to the martyrs, was held at Madressah Jamia Rashidia in Saroo Wanoo area of Salarzai.</p>
<p>JUI-F local chapter head Maulana Abdur Rashid and other senior party leaders including Maulana Kareemullah, Maulana Fataullah, Mufti Mohammad Naeem, and Maulana Mohammad Imran were among the key speakers at the event.</p>
<p>“Despite the deadly bombing of the party’s rally on July 30, 2023, JUI-F is still standing firm on its narrative and position,” the statement quoted Maulana Rashid as saying.</p>
<p>He said that JUI-F would continue the martyrs’ mission and play an active role in promoting peace and people’s prosperity.</p>
<p>The speakers also expressed great concerns over poor law and order in the district, particularly the launch of a military operation in several areas of Lowi Mamund tehsil.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Describing the military operations as no solution to the issue of terrorism, they called for negotiated settlement of the matter.</p>
<p>The speakers urged all political figures, social and political activists, elders, religious leaders and locals to play their part in promoting peace and stability in the district.</p>
<p>The ceremony concluded with a joint prayer for the departed souls of the martyrs.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928567/shifting-climate-gives-pause-to-daredevil-alpinists' target='_blank'><strong>Shifting climate gives pause to daredevil alpinists</strong></a>
            <p><p><strong>• Glaciers visibly receding; peaks more prone to avalanches; high temps, lack of snow making rockfalls more common<br />
• Season comes to a close with climbers returning from K2, Broad Peak ‘empty handed’</strong></p>
<p>FOR mountaineers, the mighty peaks in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Karakoram range became unusually precarious this year due to changing weather patterns, which have brought with them an increase in avalanches, rockfalls and other life-threatening hazards.</p>
<p>The mountains are comparatively dry, having lost much snow cover, and hence prone to avalanches — sometimes several times a day.</p>
<p>Baqir Ali, a mountain guide with four decades of experience, said he had never experienced such conditions on the peaks in his entire career.</p>
<p>A resident of Shigar’s Askole village, Mr Ali was part of Laura Dahlmeier’s team. The German Olympian recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927619">perished</a> after being struck by a rockfall at Laila Peak (6,096m).</p>
<p>“Several days before the incident, a French expedition team had cancelled their plan to attempt to climb Laila Peak due to the unfavourable weather condit­ions at the peak,” the 56-year-old told <em>Dawn.</em></p>
<p>He said he had asked the German climber to do the same, but she continued her ascent in the alpine style — and at an altitude of 5,700m, she became the victim of falling rocks on July 28.</p>
<p>These precarious conditions made Hungary’s László Csomor abandon his expedition to Broad Peak (8,050 m) after more than a month and return to Skardu on Saturday.</p>
<p>His seven-member team had been at the base camp since June 27, hoping to summit the mountain. They, however, decided to call off the adventure, like more than two hundred climbers who had come to Pakistan to ascend its mighty peaks.</p>
<p>“This year, there was less snow at all mountains; rockfall was unusual; we would hear the sound of rockfall and snow avalanches 10 times in a day while sitting at the base camp,” László said, adding that he climbed to Camp 3 twice, but could not start the summit push due to bad weather. He blamed these conditions on less snow cover, saying that with enough snow, such threats diminish.</p>
<p>He said more than 90 climbers had been waiting at the base camp to summit K-2, while 30 mountaineers had been waiting to begin the Broad Peak adventure for the last month. Both peaks share the same base camp. Most of them have had to return with heavy hearts, as the climbing season for the Karakoram peaks nears its end.</p>
<p>László was also a witness to two accidents during his stay at the base camp – on July 11, Polish climber Waldemar Kowalewski fractured his leg in an avalanche on Broad Peak at 6,500m; while on July 19, porter Iftikhar Sadpara <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925200">lost</a> his life in a similar incident on K2’s Camp 1, located 500m above the base camp.</p>
<p>At least three people were killed and five were injured in such incidents during this season.</p>
<p><strong>New challenges</strong></p>
<p>“These conditions at the Karakoram range were new, and it was also challenging to climb the peaks because the snow was steep and unstable,” László said, adding that a decrease in snowfall made the slopes and hanging rocks prone to falls and avalanches, while crevasses had become bigger.</p>
<p>High winds also made the climb difficult. The foreign climber believed these changes were linked to climate change.</p>
<p>Mingma G, owner of Imagine Nepal and a renowned climber, also abandoned his Gasherbrum-II summit attempt due to avalanche risks. Traditionally, the climbing season for these peaks spans late June to mid-August. But this year, the risks are unusually high, forcing scores to abandon their summits.</p>
<p>“The weather at the peaks is not normal this year,” said Iqbal Qadri, a tour operator. Mr Qadri told <em>Dawn</em> that K2, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum-II and many other seven-thousanders remained unclimbed in the summer, while a few summits at Gasherbrum-I and Nanga Parbat were recorded.</p>
<p>He said some climbers were still at the K2 base camp, to try their luck. However, the season is over and this summer, none of the climbers could move past Camp 3 on K2.</p>
<p>This year, about 22 climbers, including five Pakistanis, scaled Gasherbrum-I (8,080 m) on July 20 and July 22, whereas at least 24 mountaineers, including foreigners, summited Nanga Parbat (8,126m) in the Himalayas.</p>
<p><strong>Distressing situation</strong></p>
<p>Veteran Russian climber Denis Urubko and his wife Maria Cardell summitted Nanga Parbat in alpine style while also charting a new route for ascent in July. Currently, he is in Skardu and plans to scale K2 via a new route. However, he said the situation in the mountains was distressing.</p>
<p>“Glaciers and snow on mountains are melting fast, crevasses are becoming larger, and rockfall occurrences have become routine in the GB mountains,” Mr Urubko said.</p>
<p>He said the “classical route” to summit Nanga Parbat had also become a dangerous route due to speedy snowmelt, adding that these factors had made risks in the mountains higher than usual.</p>
<p>A senior government expert blamed these conditions on changes in the snowfall patterns induced by global warming. He said the region received snow late in the year, and it could not be converted into ice before the summer and thus remained unstable. In addition to that, the heatwave in June and July exacerbated the situation, leading to an unusual number of avalanches.</p>
<p><strong>Livelihoods in danger</strong></p>
<p>As mountains become precarious for climbers, the livelihoods of those who are linked to the tourism industry have also taken a hit. Out of 400 applications received by the GB tourism department, only over 200 climbers from multiple countries arrived to attempt summits, almost 50 per cent down from the previous year.</p>
<p>Thousands of people, including transporters, shopkeepers, hotel owners, porters, mountain guides, and tour operators, depend on the industry for income. Fida Hussain, a high-altitude porter from Shigar, feared that with the reduction of adventure tourism activities, they would also be left without jobs and income.</p>
