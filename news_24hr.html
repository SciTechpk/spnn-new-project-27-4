            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914060/pakistan-unveils-first-govt-led-strategic-bitcoin-reserve' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan unveils first govt-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve</strong></a>
            <p><p>Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib has unveiled the country’s first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.</p>
<p>Saqib was recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913419">appointed</a> as Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Crypto and Blockchain, with the status of a minister of state. He has been on a tour of the United States seeking investment in Pakistan’s crypto markets.</p>
<p>He made the announcement about the reserve after delivering a keynote address before an elite audience, which included United States Vice President JD Vance, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr, at the <a class="link--external" href="https://b.tc/conference/2025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bitcoin Vegas 2025</a> in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is no longer defined by its past. It is being reborn as a forward-looking hub of digital innovation — powered by its youth, sharpened by necessity, and led by a new generation of tech statesmen,” said Saqib, in a statement issued by his office.</p>
<p>“I’m not just here as a minister,” he said. “I’m here as the voice of a generation — a generation that is online, on-chain, and unstoppable.”</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>In his keynote speech, Saqib announced the establishment of a national bitcoin wallet, “holding digital assets already in state custody — not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signalling long-term belief in decentralised finance.”</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>He also thanked Trump for his role as a peacemaker in the recent India-Pakistan conflict and for his commitment to crypto adoption.</p>
<p>He revealed that the government had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913238">allocated</a> 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity in first phase for bitcoin mining and AI data centres, opening doors to sovereign miners, tech firms, and clean energy partners around the world.</p>
<p>The statement noted Pakistan having over 40 million crypto wallets and one of the “largest and most active freelancer economies in the world”.</p>
<p>It added that Saqib was leading the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912539">creation</a> of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) — a regulatory body designed to empower builders, protect investors, and formalise digital finance frameworks for the future.</p>
<p>“Both Pakistan and bitcoin have suffered from bad PR,” Saqib declared. “But if you look past the headlines, you’ll see something else: talent, resilience, and vision.”</p>
<p>He called on global crypto builders to come and invest in Pakistan. “If you’re building something real — come build it in Pakistan. Come build wallets for the unbanked. Come tokenise land. Come scale your mission with our youth and our unstoppable grit.”</p>
<p>During his keynote, Saqib delivered a “blueprint for the future of emerging markets in Web3 that positions Pakistan as a tech-forward, youth-powered, and opportunity-rich nation ready to lead,” the statement concluded.</p>
<p>On February 25, the government had announced it was considering establishing a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897897">National Crypto Council</a> to adopt emerging digital currencies in line with global trends. In March, it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896070">appointed</a> Saqib as the chief adviser to the finance minister on the PCC and later made him the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897964#:~:text=Bilal%20Bin%20Saqib%2C%20who%20was%20recently%20appointed%20as%20chief%20adviser%20to%20the%20finance%20minister%2C%20has%20been%20made%20the%20council%E2%80%99s%20CEO.">council’s CEO</a>.</p>
<p>According to a press release, Saqib will now be responsible for developing a comprehensive, FATF-compliant regulatory framework for digital assets, launching bitcoin mining initiatives, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, finance, and land records.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Additionally, he will also facilitate “licensing and oversight of virtual asset service providers (VASPs)” and champion “investor protection and Web3 ecosystem growth” in the country.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the government has announced the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913342">allocation</a> of 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the first phase of a national initiative to power bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.</p>
<p>According to the Finance Division, the ambitious initiative was part of a broader strategy to “monetise surplus electricity, create high-tech jobs, attract billions of dollars in foreign direct investment, and generate billions of dollars for the government”.</p></p>

            <p><p>A police personnel was martyred and four citizens were injured as a result of a gunfire between the public, police and terrorists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Thursday.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, spokesperson to the regional police officer, Khanzala Quraishi, said, “The members of the peace committee, along with police personnel, were patrolling the area when they were attacked by terrorists at around 12:30am.”</p>
<p>He said that police personnel, Murtaza Jan, embraced martyrdom, while a school teacher, a police constable, and four people were injured in the attack.</p>
<p>“The incident took place within the limits of the Hoyed Police Station” he said, adding that the “terrorists fled the scene due to the quick response from the police.”</p>
<p>He continued: “The injured and the deceased were moved a hospital. The school teacher is in critical condition.”</p>
<p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed was also on a visit to theregion for reviewing the security situation, he said.</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that people were “fed up of the terrorists and retaliated  whenever they came across them”.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022, vowing to target security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies personnel.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a policeman was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908826">shot</a> dead by unidentified assailants in the limits of the Mandan police station in Bannu.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914080/foreign-students-seek-to-quit-harvard-amid-trump-crackdown' target='_blank'><strong>Foreign students seek to quit Harvard amid Trump crackdown</strong></a>
            <p><p>Harvard University has been flooded with requests from foreign students to transfer to other institutions as US President Donald Trump’s administration seeks to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913242">ban</a> it from hosting international scholars, a staff member said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Too many international students to count have inquired about the possibility of transferring to another institution,” Maureen Martin, director of immigration services, wrote in a court filing.</p>
<p>Trump has upended the United States’ reputation among foreign students, who number around one million, as he presses a campaign against US universities he sees as obstructing his “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870134/we-are-going-to-have-a-tremendous-victory-and-make-america-great-again-trump-says">Make America Great Again</a>” populist agenda.</p>
<p>He has blocked Harvard from hosting international scholars in a manoeuvre being <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912852">challenged</a> legally, targeted non-citizen campus activists for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904552">deportation</a>, and most recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913788">suspended</a> student visa processing across the board.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/3  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The president’s crackdown has prompted “profound fear, concern, and confusion” among students and staff at the elite university, which has been “inundated with questions from current international students and scholars about their status and options”, Martin wrote.</p>
<p>More than 27 per cent of Harvard’s enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data.</p>
<p>“Many international students and scholars are reporting significant <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913897/foreign-students-wary-of-us-as-trump-presses-dehumanising-campaign">emotional distress</a> that is affecting their mental health and making it difficult to focus on their studies,” Martin wrote in the filing.</p>
<p>Some were afraid to attend their graduation ceremonies this week or had cancelled travel plans for fear of being refused re-entry into the United States, she added.</p>
<p>She said that a handful of domestic students at Harvard had also “expressed serious interest” in transferring elsewhere because they did not want to attend a university with no international students.</p>
<p>A judge last week suspended the government’s move to block Harvard from enrolling and hosting foreign students after the Ivy League school sued, calling the action unconstitutional.</p>
<p>A hearing into the case was scheduled for Thursday.</p>
<p>At least 10 foreign students or scholars at Harvard had their visa applications refused immediately after the block on foreign students was announced, including students whose visa applications had already been approved, Martin wrote.</p>
<p>“My current understanding is that the visa applications that were refused or revoked following the Revocation Notice have not yet been approved or reinstated,” despite a judge suspending the move, she said.</p></p>
