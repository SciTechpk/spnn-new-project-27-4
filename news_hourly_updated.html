                <h2>India doubling down on proxy war after clear defeat by Pakistan, says COAS Munir</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir said on Thursday that India was doubling down on its ‚Äúnefarious agenda‚Äù against Pakistan through the use of proxies after facing a ‚Äúmanifest defeat‚Äù in the recent military conflict between the two countries.</p>
<p>India blamed Pakistan for the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> without evidence, triggering a military escalation. On May 6‚Äì7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">missile exchange</a>. A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">US-brokered ceasefire</a> ended the war.</p>
<p>A day earlier, Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923063/dg-ispr-brands-indian-nsa-ajit-doval-chief-architect-of-terrorism-in-pakistan">accused</a> Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval of masterminding terrorism in Pakistan, alleging Indian support for terrorist groups.</p>
<p>Echoing similar sentiments, Field Marshal Munir said, while chairing the 271st Corps Commanders‚Äô Conference (CCC) at the General Headquarters (GHQ), said today: ‚ÄúFollowing its manifest defeat in direct aggression against Pakistan, post-Pahalgam incident, India is now doubling down to further its nefarious agenda through its proxies of <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>.‚Äù</p>
<p>In July last year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349">designated</a> the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em>, while mandating all institutions to use the term <em>khariji</em> (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.</p>
<p>In May this year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525">designated</a> all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna-al-Hindu¬≠stan</em> ‚Äî a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">new phrase</a> aimed at framing India‚Äôs alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7348" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from the ISPR said the CCC participants offered prayers for the martyrs of recent terrorist attacks by ‚ÄúIndian-sponsored proxies‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTaking stock of recent successes against terrorist proxies, forum resolved that blood of our martyrs will not go waste and the safety and security of people of Pakistan remain topmost priority for the armed forces of Pakistan. Forum strongly asserted that it is imperative to take decisive and holistic actions at all levels against the Indian-backed and sponsored proxies.‚Äù</p>

</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The ISPR said the forum also noted the Indian military‚Äôs ‚Äúbaseless insinuations to offset its comprehensive defeat‚Äù, in an apparent reference to the deputy Indian army chief alleging last week that China gave Islamabad ‚Äúlive inputs‚Äù on key Indian positions during the conflict.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInvoking third parties in what is unmistakably a bilateral military confrontation reflects a disingenuous attempt at bloc politics aimed at falsely projecting India‚Äôs self-assigned role as a net security provider to accrue benefits in a region that is visibly growing disillusioned with Indian hegemonic ambitions and Hindutva-driven extremism,‚Äù the ISPR quoted Field Marshal Munir as saying on the matter.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The army brass also conducted a holistic review of the prevailing internal and external security dynamics, with particular emphasis on the recent developments in the Middle East and Iran, noting the ‚Äúgrowing propensity for ‚Äòuse of force‚Äô as a preferred policy tool‚Äù, saying it warranted ‚Äúpersistent development of self-reliant capabilities as well as national unity and resolve‚Äù.</p>
<p>The forum‚Äôs members were further briefed on the military‚Äôs ongoing drive with quick adaptation towards the ‚Äúevolving threat spectrum and changing character of war‚Äù. The army chief also appreciated the leadership of the Pakistan Navy and the Pakistan Air Force for ‚Äúfurther strengthening tri-services synergy‚Äù.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir also shared details of the country‚Äôs ‚Äúproactive and successful‚Äù diplomatic manoeuvres, including recent visits to Iran, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where he had accompanied Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúForum was also briefed on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044">historic and unique visit</a> of the COAS to US, where meetings with top-tier leadership afforded an opportunity to share first hand Pakistan‚Äôs objective perspective on bilateral, regional and extra-regional developments.‚Äù</p>
<p>The ISPR said that in his concluding remarks, the army chief expressed ‚Äúfull confidence in the operational readiness of Pakistan Army against complete threat spectrum‚Äù.</p></p>

                <h2>Police arrest 8 SBCA officials, owner in Lyari building collapse case</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least eight officials of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) were arrested on Thursday along with the owner of a building that recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050">collapsed</a> in Karachi‚Äôs Lyari, claiming <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922486/death-toll-in-lyari-building-collapse-stands-at-27-as-rescue-operation-ends-on-3rd-day">27 lives</a>.</p>
<p>The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market collapsed on Friday morning, with the rescue operations concluding on Sunday. The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, with the SBCA saying it had issued <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=SBCA%20says%20issued%20multiple%20prior%20notices%20to%20vacate%20building">multiple prior notices</a> to residents to vacate the structure since 2023.</p>
<p>South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the arrests were made today after a first information report (FIR) was registered a day ago.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNine officials and the present owner of the building were nominated in the FIR registered on a complaint of an official of the local government department. However, eight directors and deputy directors were arrested but one official was not arrested as he was sick,‚Äù he said. adding that the owner was arrested as well.</p>
<p>The provincial government had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922557">suspended</a> SBCA Director General Ishaque Khuhro and announced strict action against all those responsible for the incident on Monday. Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said a fact-finding committee had been formed to present a report on the incident, adding that the Sindh chief minister ordered the home minister to immediately register an FIR.</p>
<p>The FIR was registered at the Baghdadi Police Station on the complaint of Hamadullah, a section officer of the Sindh Local Government and Housing Town Planning Department, under Sections 34 (common intention), 217 (public servant disobeying direction of law with intent to save person from punishment or property from forfeiture), 218 (public servant framing incorrect record or writing intent to save person from punishment or property from forfeiture), 288 (negligent conduct with respect to pulling down or repairing buildings), 322 (punishment for qatl-bis-sabab), 337-Ai (whoever, by doing any act with the intention of thereby causing hurt to any person, or with the knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause hurt to any person causes shajjah-i-khafifah) and 427 (mischief causing damage amounting to Rs50) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p>
<p>The FIR said the building, spread over 527.3 square yards, was constructed in 1986. Its owner constructed the five-storey plus ground floor building in two portions, and for a considerable period, both portions (buildings) were in dilapidated condition and were unlivable. It added that one building with 20 apartments collapsed on July 4 due to the ‚Äúcriminal negligence‚Äù of the SBCA officials and the owner.</p>
<p>The FIR said the SBCA officials were aware of the dilapidated condition of the building over the years till the collapse.  It added that the officials ‚Äúcompletely failed‚Äù to perform their official duty and ‚Äúcommitted negligence and carelessness‚Äù.</p>
<p>The FIR further said that the officials ‚Äúdeliberately‚Äù did not mention in the official record that the building was dilapidated. It also added that the present owner of the building and other unknown owners also knew that it was not livable for humans. Despite this, the owners gave several flats on rent to members of the Hindu community and committed negligence.</p>
<p>The complainant said he wanted legal proceedings against the SBCA officials and owners of the building.</p></p>
