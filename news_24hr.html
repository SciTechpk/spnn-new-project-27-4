            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925613/11-suspects-arrested-in-balochistan-couples-killing-case-transferred-to-serious-crimes-wing-police' target='_blank'><strong>11 suspects arrested in Balochistan couple’s killing, case transferred to serious crimes wing: police</strong></a>
            <p><p>At least 11 suspects, including a tribal leader, have been arrested for their alleged involvement in the killing of a man and a woman in Balochistan after a video of the murder went viral on social media, with the case now handed over to the Serious Crimes Investigation Wing (SCIW), police said.</p>
<p>Superintendent of Police (SP) SCIW Syed Saboor Agha told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “Eleven people have been arrested, including a tribal leader who issued directives to shoot the couple, and all of them will appear before a judicial magistrate today.”</p>
<p>The viral video showed a group of men leading a couple out of vehicles and into a desert before gunning them down with pistols and shooting the bodies. Political figures and activists said it was an ‘honour’ killing incident. On Sunday, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PakSarfrazbugti/status/1946928844923195709" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced on X</a> that he had directed the Balochistan Police to take immediate action, following which one suspect was apprehended.</p>
<p>According to a first information report (FIR) — a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em> — registered by the Station House Officer (SHO) Naveed Akhtar at Quetta’s Hanna-Urak Police Station, he lodged the complaint after receiving the video clip that had gone viral on social media, showing a man and a woman being brutally shot and killed by armed individuals.</p>
<p>SHO Akhtar stated that he, along with his team, reached Balochistan’s Dagari, situated on the outskirts of Quetta and, upon investigation, discovered that the incident occurred three days before Eidul Azha in the area of Sanjidi in Dagari.</p>
<p>“The victims seen in the viral video have been identified as Bano Bibi and Ihsanullah,” the FIR said, naming eight suspects who allegedly shot the couple dead. The FIR also mentioned 15 other unknown suspects involved in the incident.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, SHO Naveed Akhtar said, “Owing to the nature of the murder, the case has now been transferred to the Serious Crime Investigation Wing for further investigation.”</p>
<p>Prior to being killed, the victims were allegedly taken to a tribal leader, who declared them guilty of being involved in an ‘immoral relationship’ (locally termed ‘Karo Kari’) and ordered their execution, following which they were taken to the [desert] and shot dead, the FIR said.</p>
<p>“The murder was filmed and uploaded to social media to spread fear and panic among the public,” it added.</p>
<p>According to the FIR, a case was registered against the suspects under Sections 302 (murder), 149 (unlawful assembly), 148 (rioting while armed with a deadly weapon), 147 (rioting) of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.</p>
<p>One of the main suspects — tribal leader Sardar Sherbaz Satakzai — was presented before an anti-terrorism court today with Judge Muhammad Mubeen presiding over the case.</p>
<p>The suspect was handed over to SCIW on a two-day physical remand on the judge’s order upon the police’s request.</p>
<p>Chief Justice Balochistan High Court Justice Rozi Khan Barrech took notice of the case and summoned the additional chief secretary and inspector general of police Balochistan to the court in the matter.</p>
<p>In a press release issued by BHC — seen by <em>Dawn.com</em> — it was notified that Justice Barrech “has taken notice of the news circulating on electronic, print and social media of the murder of a couple for marrying out of choice at Dagari”. The statement added that, “In this matter, the chief justice has summoned the chief secretary and IG Balochistan to court on July 22, 2025”.</p>
<p>The incident was widely condemned by politicians, civil society activists, and the public, who termed it “barbaric” and urged the government to take swift action against the perpetrators.</p>
<p>Separately, PPP MNA Shazia Marria moved an adjournment motion in the National Assembly to instead discuss the incident since it was a “matter of urgent national and human importance”.</p>
<p>“This tragic and barbaric act has shaken the conscience of the nation. Such heinous crimes constitute a grave violation of the teachings of Islam, and are in blatant disregard of the Constitution … which guarantees all citizens the right to life, dignity, due process, and equal protection under the law. Furthermore, such acts are deeply offensive to the cultural and moral values of our society, which emphasise compassion, justice and the sanctity of human life.</p>
<p>“This House must condemn this crime in the strongest possible terms. I urge the federal government to immediately engage with the provincial government of Balochistan, obtain a comprehensive and transparent report, and ensure that those responsible are identified, arrested, and prosecuted without delay.”</p>
<p>Marri also said it was “imperative” that the state be made the complainant in the FIR and subsequent legal proceedings to safeguard the integrity of the investigation, reinforce public confidence in the justice system and avoid any compromise or pressure on the victims’ families.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849480">‘honour’ killings</a> continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881836">Data</a> from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p>
<p>The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#condemnations" id="condemnations" title="Permalink"></a>Condemnations</h2>
<p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari called the suspects “beasts”, saying that they deserved no concessions. “I have faith that the criminals involved in this murder will be brought to justice soon,” he said, according to the state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/domestic/bilawal-condemns-murder-of-couple-in-balochistan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)</a>.</em>  “This murder should be a test case for the Balochistan government, as it is gender terrorism.”</p>
<p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif shared the video in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KhawajaMAsif/status/1946923637686284672" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, with a message for the people of Balochistan. Referring to the growing militancy in the province, he said: “Those who have taken up arms against the state — start by raising your voice against the unjust system that surrounds you.”</p>
<p>He continued that the ones responsible for this “oppression are your own brothers, not the travellers and labourers from other provinces”, pointing out the recent bus attack in Balochistan’s Kalat district, which left three people dead and other similar incidents in the recent past.</p>
<p>PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman also <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/sherryrehman/status/1946955545946337781" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">condemned</a> the murder in a post on X, labelling it an “unforgivable crime”.</p>
<p>“Crushing the right to marry is a violation of fundamental human rights. Killing in the name of tribal decisions is a despicable act. The cycle of brutality in the name of honour must be stopped,” she wrote.</p>
<p>“By mercilessly killing the married couple, not only have law and justice been insulted, but the authority of the provincial government has also been challenged,” Rehman added. “The chapter of oppression and barbarism under the guise of jirgas must be closed.”</p>
<p>The senator emphasised that the perpetrators must be brought to justice and that legislation to end “outdated customs” was indispensable.</p>
<p>Baloch activist Sammi Deen Baloch decried the shooting as an ‘honour’ killing, appealing to Baloch elders to “respect women’s decisions”.</p>
<p>“As a woman, this chilling incident is deeply painful and heart-wrenching for me,” she wrote on X. “Killing any woman in the name of honour is not only a heinous crime but also the worst humiliation of humanity.</p>
<p>“I appeal to Baloch and Pashtun tribal elders, influential sections of society, and intellectuals to respect women’s decisions. Today’s woman is the same woman who is educated, aware, and fully capable of making decisions about her future.”</p>
<p>She demanded that the killing be investigated transparently and comprehensively so that the suspects would be brought to justice and “no one dares to repeat such a barbaric act in the future”.</p>

            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has arrived in New York to attend high-level signature events of Pakistan’s UN Security Council (UNSC) Presidency, including a conference on Palestine, according to the Foreign Office.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921308">assumed</a> the UNSC Presidency for the month of July 2025, making it the country’s eighth term on the Security Council as a non-permanent member. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026. The presidency involves a focus on multilateralism, peaceful dispute resolution, and regional cooperation.</p>
<p>“Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar,
arrived in New York for an official visit from 21 to 28 July 2025,” the FO announced in a post on X.</p>
<p>“During the visit, he will lead high-level signature events under Pakistan’s Presidency of the UN Security Council, hold bilateral and multilateral meetings in New York and Washington, DC, and represent Pakistan at the International Conference on the two-state solution, co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and France.”</p>

<p>It added that upon his arrival, FM Dar was received by Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Asim Iftikhar, and the Ambassador of Pakistan to the United States, Rizwan Saeed Sheikh.</p>
<p>According to a July 19 <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/curtain-raiser-deputy-prime-ministerforeign-ministers-visit-to-the-united-states-to-attend-high-level-signature-events-of-pakistans-security-council-presidency" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> issued by the FO, Dar will attend a high-level conference on the “Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution”, to express Pakistan’s strong commitment and unwavering support for the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>The conference was originally planned for June but was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917074">postponed</a> due to the Iran-Israel war, which also led to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917150">rescheduling</a> of Dar’s visit. According to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/13/macron-not-expected-to-attend-un-summit-on-two-state-solution-for-palestine-and-israel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Guardian</a></em>, the moot will now be held on July 28 and 29.</p>
<p>Since October 8, Israeli strikes have killed more than 58,000 Palestinians in Gaza. Pakistan has consistently raised its voice for the people of Palestine, calling for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921570/dont-be-a-bystander-pakistan-tells-unsc">urged</a> the UNSC not to remain “a bystander” amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>
<p>Aside from the Palestine conference, Dar is also set to chair a high-level briefing of the UNSC, focused on enhancing cooperation between the UN and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).</p>
<p>“The meeting is being held as part of Pakistan’s efforts to strengthen collaboration between the OIC and the UN for maintenance of international peace and security,” the FO statement said.</p>
<p>Dar is expected to have several other bilateral engagements with his counterparts, as well as senior UN officials, during his stay. He will also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925550">meet</a> US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on July 25.</p></p>

            <p><p>At least 19 people were killed as a Bangladesh air force training aircraft crashed into a college and school campus in the capital city of Dhaka on Monday, a fire services official said.</p>
<p>More than 50 people, including children and adults, were hospitalised with burns, a doctor at the National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery told reporters.</p>
<p>The incident occurred at the Milestone School and College in Dhaka’s northern area of Uttara, officials said.</p>
<p>“Bangladesh Air Force’s F-7 BGI training aircraft crashed in Uttara. The aircraft took off at 13:06 (12:06pm PKT),” the military’s public relations department said in a statement.</p>
<p>Videos of the aftermath of the crash showed a big fire near a lawn emitting a thick plume of smoke into the sky, as crowds watched from a distance.</p>
<p>Firefighters sprayed water on the mangled remains of the plane, which appeared to have rammed into the side of a building, damaging iron grills and creating a gaping hole in the structure, <em>Reuters TV</em> visuals showed.</p>
<p>“A third-grade student was brought in dead, and three others, aged 12, 14 and 40, were admitted to the hospital,” said Bidhan Sarker, head of the burn unit at the Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, where some victims were taken.</p>
<p>According to the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/accidents-fires/news/least-19-dead-air-force-jet-crashes-milestone-college-campus-3944516" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Daily Star</a></em>, an emergency hotline (01949-043697) had been launched at the National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery following the crash.</p>
<p>Visuals also showed people screaming and crying as others tried to comfort them.</p>
<p>“When I was picking (up) my kids and went to the gate, I realised something came from behind […] I heard an explosion. When I looked back, I only saw fire and smoke,” said Masud Tarik, a teacher at the school.</p>
<p><em>The Daily Star</em> further reported that three platoons of the Bangladesh Border Guard (BGB) were deployed to Uttara to assist in law enforcement and rescue operations, according to the BGB headquarters.</p>
<p>It added that the government has declared a one-day state mourning day tomorrow following the crash. The national flag will be flown at half-mast at all government, semi-government, autonomous institutions and educational establishments, as well as at Bangladeshi missions abroad.</p>
<p>“Special prayers will be held in all religious places of worship throughout the country for the injured and deceased,” it said.</p>
<p>Muhammad Yunus, the head of Bangladesh’s interim government, said that “necessary measures” would be taken to investigate the cause of the accident and “ensure all kinds of assistance”.</p>
<p>“The loss suffered by the Air Force […] students, parents, teachers and staff, and others in this accident is irreparable,” he said.</p>
<p>The incident comes a little over a month after an Air India plane <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916728">crashed</a> on top of a medical college hostel in India’s Ahmedabad, killing 241 of the 242 people on board and 19 on the ground, marking the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.</p>
