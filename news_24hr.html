            <p><p>The death toll from the five-storey <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050">building collapse</a> in Karachi has risen to 27, with several people still missing under the rubble, officials said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Rescue teams worked overnight on Friday to pull out more bodies from the rubble of the building situated in Lyari on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market.</p>
<p>Till Saturday, 80 per cent of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922268">rescue operation</a> had been completed, according to South Deputy Commissioner (DC) Javed Nabi Khoso.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em> today at around 1:30pm, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said “it will take five to six more hours to complete the rescue operation”.</p>
<p>Khan added that several people are still missing under the rubble but he could not cite an official figure yet since rescue operations were ongoing.</p>
<p>“Five people, including three women have been injured and so far,” said a statement from Edhi Rescue Service.</p>
<p>A total of 27 bodies have been recovered so far, including nine women, 15 men, a 13-year-old child, a 10-year-old child, and a one-year-old infant. The bodies have been shifted to Civil Hospital Karachi by Edhi Ambulance.</p>
<p>Ten people who were injured have been discharged.</p>
<p>While speaking to the media today after leading the Ashura procession, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah provided details on the building collapse.</p>
<p>“Immediate rescue efforts were launched to save any survivors trapped under the rubble,” he said, adding that the bodies recovered had been handed over to the families.</p>
<p>He echoed Khan’s statement of rescue operations being expected to conclude today.</p>
<p>The chief minister assured that a detailed inquiry into the causes of the collapse would be conducted, with committees already formed to investigate the matter thoroughly.</p>
<p>He revealed that over 480 buildings in old city areas, mostly in District South, have been declared dangerous.</p>
<p>“The government plans to assist affected residents in finding alternative housing,” he said.</p>
<p>CM Murad added that the recently collapsed building was constructed only a few months ago, apparently without proper approval, and those responsible for unauthorised construction would face strict punishment.</p>
<p>He also urged  the public to verify that any building they purchase has proper approval from the Building Control Authority.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that several people resist evacuation due to poverty and lack of alternatives, often buying or renting cheaper properties without checking safety approvals and later demanding government protection.</p>
<p>While empathising with these difficulties, he stressed that sometimes strict action is necessary to ensure public safety, as demonstrated by recent enforcement measures.</p></p>

<p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid rich tribute to the sacrifice of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) and his companions, saying that Ashura gives us a message of sacrifice, truthfulness, sincere determination, and standing up for the truth.</p>
<p>In their separate messages on Yaum-i-Ashura, they urged the nation to uphold the values and principles of fortitude and courage demonstrated by the martyrs of Karbala and to exhibit perseverance in the face of trials, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>President Zardari said that Karbala is a symbol of an eternal struggle against falsehood. “This day is not only an unparalleled story of sacrifice, loyalty, and patience but also a bright lamp that shows the path of truth and righteousness in the darkness of every era.”</p>
<p>In his message, PM Shehbaz said: “Karbala teaches us that although the path of truth is difficult, it is the path that leads to the pleasure of Allah Almighty and the satisfaction of hearts and eternal prosperity.”</p>
<p>He said the message of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) is not limited to his time but is a universal message, which even today convinces us that a Muslim stands for the truth, supports the oppressed, and advocates justice in all circumstances.</p></p>

            <p><p>Olympic javelin star Neeraj Chopra headlined what was billed as India’s inaugural world-class field competition on Saturday, living up to his goal of elevating domestic talent while also walking away with another gold medal.</p>
<p>Chopra, who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1639363">won</a> gold at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and silver at the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832459">2024 Paris Games</a>, triumphed with a throw of 86.18 metres at the 12-athlete javelin Neeraj Chopra Classic event.</p>
<p>He finished ahead of former world champion Julius Yego (silver) and Sri Lanka’s Rumesh Pathirage (bronze).</p>
<p>“The biggest target of the competition was to uplift the Indian athletes alongside the international ones. We got the best javelin throwers to this competition,” Chopra told reporters after winning the competition.</p>
<p>The event drew more than 14,500 spectators — a figure that delighted Chopra, who has long championed greater public support for track and field events.</p>
<p>“We really wanted people to come and watch track and field,” said Chopra, who has single-handedly raised interest for athletics in India and has more than nine million Instagram followers.</p>
<p>“I always request people to come to the stadiums to cheer athletes as they work really hard.</p>
<p>“Track and field is one of the hardest sporting events. I request people to come and watch nationals as well… because our sport can only grow when people will come and watch us.”</p>
<p>The event featured three rounds with six attempts per participant, narrowing the field to eight after the initial round of three throws.</p>
<p>Among the five Indian competitors, three advanced to the second round, including Chopra, outperforming international athletes such as former Olympic champion Thomas Rohler and the Czech Republic’s Martin Konecny.</p>
<p>“We have been doing really well in the sport. They (Indian athletes) were quite happy to get a platform to play alongside the world champions,” the 27-year-old said.</p>
<p>“We also plan to add more events to this competition going forward, which will help the Indian athletes more.”</p>
<p>Among the Indian athletes, apart from Chopra, Asian Athletics Championships silver medallist Sachin Yadav performed well, recording his best throw of 82.33m in the third attempt.</p>
<p>“Sachin could have performed better, but he twisted his ankle in his opening throw. Overall, it was good. They will hopefully do well in the future. They are juniors and have time on their hand so will surely do better,” Chopra said.</p></p>
