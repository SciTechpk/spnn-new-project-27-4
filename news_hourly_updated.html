                <h2>PAF to showcase advanced JF-17 Thunder jets at UK airshow</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A contingent of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), featuring the advanced JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter jets and C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, arrived at the Royal Air Force Base Fairford in the United Kingdom to take part in the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) 2025, a statement from the military‚Äôs media wing said on Thursday.</p>
<p>RIAT, which will run from July 18 to 20, is one of the world‚Äôs largest military airshows, has been running for over 50 years and powers the Royal Air Force Charitable Trust, according to its <a class="link--external" href="https://www.airtattoo.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPAF‚Äôs participation in RIAT, one of the world‚Äôs largest military airshows, underscores Pakistan Air Force‚Äôs commitment to showcasing its professional excellence, operational capability and the indigenous strength of its aviation industry,‚Äù a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.</p>
<p>Adding to the operational significance of this international deployment, Pakistan Air Force‚Äôs JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighters executed successful Air-to-Air Refuelling operations en route to the UK with the support of a PAF IL-78 aerial refuelling tanker</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe intricate refuelling operation demonstrated PAF‚Äôs long-range operational capabilities and the proficiency of its air and ground crew in conducting extended operations beyond national borders.</p>
<p>‚ÄúJF-17 Block-III is an EASA Radar and Long Range BVR equipped 4.5 generation multi-role fighter aircraft which is capable of undertaking a wide variety of combat missions, bolstering airpower application in the face of contemporary challenges, thereby strengthening national security,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>In May, when Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">downed</a> 5 Indian jets as retaliation for late-night strikes during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/pakistan-india-tensions">Pakistan-India conflict</a>, the PAF formally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">acknowledged</a> a month later that it was the Kamra-based 15 Squadron that led the charge in shooting down the jets.</p>
<p>The event is now considered one of the largest air-to-air engagements in South Asia in more than half a century.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is a palpable sense of enthusiasm across the United Kingdom following the recent Pakistan-India conflict, as aviation enthusiasts and defence observers were eagerly looking forward to the arrival of the Pakistan Air Force‚Äôs JF-17 Thunder Block-III,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe aircraft‚Äôs combat-proven capabilities and operational excellence have garnered significant global attention, making its appearance at RIAT a highly anticipated highlight in the aerospace and defence community.‚Äù</p></p>
