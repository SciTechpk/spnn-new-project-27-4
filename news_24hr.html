            <p><p>• Karachi-based Sabri qawwals were supposed to perform at a wedding in Quetta<br />
• Major leading Awaran operation martyred</p>
<p>QUETTA: Just days after the deadly bus <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923411/armed-men-kidnap-and-kill-nine-passengers-in-balochistan">attack</a> in the Zhob area of Balochistan, another passenger bus came under attack that claimed three innocent lives, including two Karachi-based Sabri qawwals, and left 13 others injured on the outskirts of Kalat on Wednesday.</p>
<p>SSP Shahzad told <em>Dawn</em> that three people who lost their lives in bus firing Kalat included famous qawal Ahmed Hussain Sabri, his son Ahmed Raza Sabri, who left for Quetta along with other musicians of the group in a bus.</p>
<p>“My brother, nephew and one musician killed in the armed attack,” famous Karachi-based Qawal Majid Ali Sabri said on the phone. He said his brother, nephew and other musicians were travelling to Quetta for performance at a wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>“My close relatives and musicians are among the injured,” added Majid Sabri who along with his wife is due in the provincial capital on Thursday (today).</p>
<p>Officials said the armed assailants were lying in ambush on both sides of the Quetta-Karachi highway in Nemargh area and used automatic weapons to carry out the assault. “They first stopped the coach and then opened indiscriminate fire,” an official said while quoting eyewitness accounts.</p>
<p>The attack came on the day when a security forces killed three terrorists affiliated with India-backed proxy group “Fitna al Hindustan” in Awaran, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). It said an army officer, Major Syed Rub Nawaz Tariq, embraced martyrdom while leading the operation.</p>
<p>Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kalat Shahzad Akbar confirmed the bus shooting and said three individuals were killed on the spot, while 13 others sustained injuries. The victims were musicians from a Karachi-based band who were en route to Quetta for a performance, police said.</p>

<p>The injured were identified as Haider, Imran, Manzar, Abbas, Muhammad Saqib, Faysal, Muh­ammad Nadeem, Muha­mmad Rizwan, Musawir Abbas, Muha­m­mad Waris, Faizan, Dilshad (all from Karachi), Najeeb Ahmed (driver), and Bilal Ahmed.</p>
<p>Hospital officials said the victims had sustained multiple gunshot wounds, mostly to the head and upper part of their body. Some of the critically injured are being shifted to Quetta for advanced medical treatment, they said.</p>
<p>According to Imtiaz Lehri, who had booked the team, Majid Sabri was due in Quetta on Thursday along with his wife by air, and a hotel room was booked for them.</p>
<p>Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind confirmed the incident, casualties and location of the assault. He said, “Security forces, district administration, and rescue teams immediately reached the site. A search operation is underway, and the attackers are being pursued.”</p>
<p>He said the terrorists had planned the attack and launched it from both sides of the road. “We cannot yet confirm the number of assailants.”</p>
<p>Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti wrote on X, “Targeting innocent and defenseless civilians is an unforgivable crime.” He also blamed India-backed terrorist organisations, stating, “These groups once targeted people based on identity, but are now indiscriminately attacking civilians. This is a war against every Pakistani.” He termed the attack a direct assault on Pakistan’s unity, sovereignty, and peace and pledged that the government would eradicate such threats at all costs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Inter-Services Public relations <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7353" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Wednesday night security forces killed three terrorists affiliated with India-backed proxy group “<em>Fitna al Hindustan</em>” while an officer of Pakistan Army embraced martyrdom while leading the operation conducted in Awaran area.</p>
<p>The ISPR reported that the operation was launched based on intelligence inputs about terrorist presence in the area.</p>
<p>“During the operation, troops effectively engaged the terrorist location, killing three Indian-sponsored terrorists,” it added.</p>
<p>Tragically, Major Syed Rub Nawaz Tariq, 34, a brave officer from Muzaffarabad, embraced martyrdom while leading his troops in the operation. “Major Tariq led from the front and paid the ultimate sacrifice in the service of the nation,” the statement read.</p>
<p>It said a sanitisation operation was underway in the area to eliminate any remaining threats.</p>
<p>The ISPR added, “Security forces of Pakistan are fully committed to eradicating Indian-sponsored terrorism, and the sacrifices of our brave soldiers only strengthen our resolve.”</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924686/jui-f-loses-two-ppp-one-seat-in-kp-assembly' target='_blank'><strong>JUI-F loses two, PPP one seat in KP Assembly</strong></a>
            <p><p>PESHAWAR / ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) recent order and subsequent notifications related to reserved seats have led to partial changes in the party positions in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Asse­mbly, with the JUI-F losing two and PPP losing one seat overall.</p>
<p>While PTI-backed lawmakers maintain their tally of 92 members, opposition parties have experienced slight variations in their seat allocations. The development has not impacted the overall seat count for the opposition, but individual party positions have shifted.</p>
<p>The ECP reduced one reserved seat each for JUI-F and PPP, while one has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924448">allocated</a> to PML-N.</p>
<p>With the latest notifications, JUI-F and PML-N each hold 17 seats in the 125-member house, while PPP holds 10 seats. The Awami National Party (ANP) and PTI-Parliamentarians (PTI-P) each have three seats.</p>

<p>ECP fears delay in oath-taking may affect Senate polls; asks PHC to designate ‘oath commissioner’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fate of one of the 26 seats reserved for women is to be decided by a draw between ANP and PTI-P, while the reserved seat for non-Muslims will be determined through a similar process between JUI-F and PML-N.</p>
<p>The opposition now <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920722/opposition-will-swell-to-52-in-kp-assembly">holds</a> a total of 52 lawmakers in the KP Assembly. This shift follows the June 27 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920721/ptis-hopes-dashed-as-rivals-set-to-receive-reserved-seats">judgement</a> by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench, which declared that PTI was not entitled to reserved seats in either the National or provincial assemblies.</p>
<p>Before that verdict, the opposition parties had 27 MPAs and were unable to requisition an assembly session. However, the opposition will now be able to requisition a session once their newly elected MPAs take the oath of office.</p>
<p>Both JUI-F and PML-N now hold seven general seats, nine seats rese­rved for women and one rese­rved seat for non-Muslims each.</p>
<p>The PPP holds four general seats, five reserved seats for women and one reserved seat for non-Muslims. ANP and PTI-P each hold two general seats and one reserved seat for women.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Before the ECP’s July 15 order, which granted PML-N entitlement to reserved seats for women and non-Muslims based on seven general seats, the commission had calculated these seats based on six general seats. In the 2024 general elections, JUI-F was entitled to 10 seats reserved for women and two reserved seats for non-Muslims based on the seven general seats it won.</p>
<p>PML-N had previously been allocated eight reserved seats for women and one reserved seat for non-Muslims, while PPP had six reserved seats for women and one for non-Muslims. ANP and PTI-P each held one MPA-elect each on seats reserved for women.</p>
<p><strong>ECP approaches PHC</strong></p>
<p>The Peshawar High Court (PHC) last week annulled the original distribution of reserved seats in the KP Assembly and ordered the ECP to redistribute these seats within 10 days.</p>
<p>A two-member bench, comprising Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Dr Khurshid Iqbal, announced the reserved judgement on the petition of the PML-N against the distribution of reserved seats. In its verdict, the court declared both the ECP’s announcements regarding the allocation of reserved seats for women and minorities null and void.</p>
<p>The court had previously deemed the ECP’s Feb 22 deadline for independent candidates to join political parties unconstitutional.</p>
<p>In a desperate move, the ECP approached the PHC on Wednesday, requesting that it appoint a person to administer the oath to the notified MPAs-elect on reserved seats.</p>
<p>In a letter to the court’s registrar, the Election Commission pointed out that the Senate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922230">elections</a> in KP were days away and the electoral college was still incomplete.</p>
<p>According to the letter seen by <em>Dawn</em>, the ECP requested that the PHC chief justice, under Article 255(2) of the Constitution, may appoint a person to administer the oath to the elected members of the KP Assembly on the reserved seats before the Senate polling date (July 21).</p>
<p>The commission had previously written letters to the speaker of the KP Assembly, the governor and the chief minister, urging them to ensure the oath-taking of the members-elect; however, no progress has been made so far.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s letter emphasised that the conduct of the Senate election and the administration of oath to the returned candidates are constitutional imperatives and also a fundamental right of the members-elect to represent their constituencies.</p>
<p>The commission said that it is entrusted with the responsibility to organise and conduct elections under Articles 219(b) and 224(3) of the Constitution, and Section 107 of the Elections Act, 2017. Furthermore, Article 218(3) of the Constitution mandates the ECP to ensure that elections are conducted honestly, justly, fairly, and in accordance with the law.</p>

            <p><p>DERA ISMAIL KHAN: Two police constables were martyred when unk­n­own assailants opened fire near Shahi Gate in the Kulachi tehsil of Dera Ismail Khan district on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The deceased were identified as Head Const­able Ghulam Muhammad, from Panyala village in Dera Ismail Khan, and Constable Shehzad, from Aba Khel village in Lakki Marwat district.</p>
<p>According to a police spokesperson, the constables were travelling on a motorcycle when the incident took place. One of the constables, who had a disability, was being transported to a hospital by his colleague when they were attacked. The assailants fired upon them as they reached Shahi Gate, resulting in the death of both officers on the spot.</p>
<p>Police and other law enforcement agencies cordoned off the area after the attack and initiated a search operation. As the attackers attempted to flee, police returned fire, killing one assailant and injuring two others. A Kalashnikov rifle and ammunition were recovered from the deceased militant.</p>
<p>The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and district police continue to conduct an extensive search operation in the area. The funeral prayer for the martyred constables was held with full official honours at Ijaz Shaheed Police Lines in Dera Ismail Khan.</p>
<p>The ceremony was attended by Commissioner Dera Zafarul Islam Khattak, Regional Police Officer Syed Ashfaq Anwar, District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmad Sahibzada, several civil and military officials A police contingent presented a guard of honour, and participants laid floral wreaths on the coffins and offered prayers for the elevation of the martyrs’ ranks.</p>
<p>The bodies of the constables were sent to their native villages, where they were laid to rest with full official honours. Initial investigations suggest that the attack was an act of terrorism.</p>
<p><strong>Gas pipeline blown up</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, a gas pipeline was blown up with explosives for the fourth time in a month in the Torwah area of Lakki Marwat district late Tuesday night.</p>
<p>According to police, an IED that had been planted along the pipeline detonated with a loud explosion that was heard in the surrounding areas. The blast caused significant damage to the pipeline, which supplies gas to Punjab.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>The explosion occurred within the jurisdiction of Saddar police station. Police and bomb disposal units later arrived at the site to investigate the incident. The blast halted the supply of gas from the Bettani oil and gas field to several regions.</p>
<p>It was the fourth attack on the gas infrastructure in the district within a month. Police have noted <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921695/gas-pipeline-blown-up-in-lakki-marwat">increased</a> terrorist activity in the area and have increased security measures around the gas facilities.</p>
