                <h2>Mostly children among 13 dead in KP monsoon spell over last 48 hours: PDMA</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least 13 people died, including nine children, and three were injured over the last 48 hours in monsoon rain-related incidents across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the provincial disaster management authority (PDMA) said in a damage report on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities.</p>
<p>The monsoon death toll since the end of June <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930">surged</a> to 234, according to the National Disaster Mana¬≠gement Authority (NDMA). Heavy rains triggered flash floods in several districts of KP and Gilgit-Baltistan, damaging homes and increasing water levels in rivers and streams.</p>
<p>Over the last 48 hours, Swat has recorded the highest toll as six children and one woman died owing to flash floods and a house collapsing, while a woman and child were injured, the KP PDMA report said.</p>
<p>Three people died in Buner, which experienced heavy rain with thunder and lightning. A woman and her child died in a thunder strike, while an eight-year-old boy was swept away. ‚ÄúThe dead body has been recovered by the locals,‚Äù the PDMA said.</p>
<p>Incidents caused by heavy rains in Bajaur claimed the lives of a man and a child. The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925908#:~:text=In%20Bajaur%20tribal%20district%2C%20two%20brothers%20died%20after%20being%20swept%20away%20by%20downpour%2Dinduced%20floods%20in%20the%20Lowi%20Mamund%20tehsil.">victims</a> were brothers, aged 21 and five.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTheir mother was successfully rescued while the bodies of both brothers were recovered,‚Äù the PDMA quoted the Bajaur Deputy Commissioner‚Äôs Office as saying.</p>
<p>Per the report, a woman also died in Upper Kohistan, while a child was injured in Torghar as heavy rains caused a roof to collapse. A total of 19 houses had been damaged due to the heavy downpour, out of which two were completely destroyed and 17 sustained partial damage.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe current spell of heavy rains is likely to continue intermittently until July 25,‚Äù the report said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe PDMA has already sent a letter to all district administrations to take precautionary measures in view of the weather situation, and has directed that relief activities be intensified in affected districts to provide immediate relief to all victims,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>The authority directed that all tourists be apprised of the weather and to take precautionary measures.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe public should contact the free helpline 1700 for any untoward incident, weather situation updates and information,‚Äù the report added.</p>
<p>On Monday, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925684/cm-orders-officials-to-remain-vigilant-as-more-rains-forecast">directed</a> the district administration to remain on high alert after forecasts indicated more monsoon rains in the province.</p>
<p>He instructed all relevant departments to take precautionary measures to deal with potential risks such as floods and landslides.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829">warned</a> of a heightened risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as over 200 stranded tourists were rescued from GB‚Äôs Diamer district as heavy floods battered the region.</p>

<p>All tourists who were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20250%20tourists%20and%20passengers%20stranded%20at%20the%20Babusar%20Highway%20have%20been%20rescued%20by%20the%20Diamer%20district%20administration%2C%20volunteers%2C%20police%2C%20Rescue%201122%20and%20army%2C%20according%20to%20GB%20government%20spokesperson%20Faizullah%20Faraq.">stranded</a> on the Babusar Highway have been rescued and are currently in Chilas city, according to Gilgit-Baltistan spokesperson Faizullah Faraq.</p>
<p>He said the search operation for those who were missing is still ongoing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Karakoram Highway has been closed again at one or two points, which has left thousands of travellers stranded at various places across the highway,‚Äù Faraq said.</p>
<p>He noted that local private hotel owners, as well as the government, have arranged for free accommodation for tourists.‚Äú</p>
<p>Work is underway to restore the Silk Road up to Bisham, Faraq said.</p>
<p>He added that GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan would visit the affected area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBabusar Highway today to personally review the damage caused by flooding and see the problems faced by tourists.</p>
<p>The spokesperson also said that the chief minister will issue important orders regarding flood disasters and rehabilitation of the victims.</p></p>

            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926044/noor-mukadam-case-convict-zahir-jaffer-files-review-plea-in-sc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <h2>Noor Mukadam case: Convict Zahir Jaffer files review plea in SC</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Zahir Zakir Jaffer on Tuesday sought a review of the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912155">verdict</a> that upheld his death sentence for the gruesome <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636267">2021 murder</a> of Noor Mukadam in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir‚Äôs Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636764">tortured</a> by him before being beheaded. Zahir‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810">death sentence</a> by the trial court had already been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1741974">upheld</a> by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).</p>
<p>The 47-page review petition, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, was filed by Advocate Khawaja Haris on behalf of Zahir under <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part7.ch2.html#:~:text=Review%20of%20Judgments%20or%20Orders%20by%20the%20Supreme%20Court" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Article 188</a> of the Constitution (review of judgments or orders by SC). The state and Noor‚Äôs father, Shaukat Ali Muqadam, were made the respondents.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The petition contended that the issue of Zahir‚Äôs alleged ‚Äúunsoundness of
mind or mental capacity‚Äù that was raised before the SC in an application had not been addressed and was ‚Äúgiven short shrift‚Äù.</p>
<p>It further said that ‚Äúhype created on social media [‚Ä¶] constantly created hatred towards the petitioner throughout the investigation and the trial (and even at appeal stage)‚Äù, which breached Zahir‚Äôs right to fair trial and due process.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn [the] process of hurry, mistakes were made in the investigation and during trial,‚Äù the petition quoted a verdict from another case.</p>
<p>On the rape charges, the review plea argued that it was ‚Äúapparent from the record that there is no evidence on the record in proof of this allegation‚Äù.</p>
<p>The SC had commuted Zahir‚Äôs death sentence on the rape charge to life imprisonment, as decided by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810#:~:text=sentenced%20to%2025%20years%20of%20rigorous%20imprisonment%20along%20with%20a%20fine%20of%20Rs200%2C000%20under%20Section%20376%20(punishment%20for%20rape)%20of%20the%20PPC">trial court</a>, but did not acquit him of it. While he was acquitted of the 10-year sentence for kidnapping, a one-year term was handed down for wrongful confinement under <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part3.ch1.html#:~:text=President%27s%20power%20to%20grant%20pardon%2C%20etc." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Section 342</a> of the Pakistan Penal Code, according to the SC verdict.</p>
<p>Zahir‚Äôs review plea argued that the video recordings based on which the SC upheld the death sentence had not been proved during the trial and were not provided to any of the accused.</p>
<p>It said the apex court ruling was extensively based on video recordings stored in a digital video recorder (DVR) and on clips that the prosecution said were transferred from the DVR to a hard disk, providing the ‚Äúmost essential link in the chain of circumstances‚Äù on which the SC gave its verdict.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPortions of these so-called recordings, on the basis whereof the inference of ‚Äòlast seen‚Äô has been drawn against the petitioner, were never played during the trial, rather, only hearsay evidence thereof was led by the prosecution,‚Äù the plea stated.</p>
<p>The SC, in its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916426">detailed verdict</a>, had stressed the significance of digital evidence by declaring that footage can be admissible as primary evidence under the ‚Äúsilent witness theory‚Äù ‚Äî a rule of evidence that allows for photog¬≠r¬≠a¬≠¬≠phic video or other recorded evidence to be admitted as substantive proof of what it depicts, without the need for an eyewitness‚Äôs testimony.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Justice Muhammad Hashim Kakar, who led the three-member bench, observed that the silent witness theory of authentication had developed in almost all jurisdictions over the last 25 years to allow photos to substantively ‚Äúspeak for themselves‚Äù.</p>
<p>The SC had also noted that Zahir neglected to provide any explanation for the victim‚Äôs presence at his residence and the ensuing recovery of her body from the premises.</p>
<p>Zahir is also contemplating <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925457">filing a mercy petition</a> before President Asif Ali Zardari, with a letter by jail authorities seeking the formation of a medical board so its opinion could be included in the plea. A presidential pardon under <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part3.ch1.html#:~:text=President%27s%20power%20to%20grant%20pardon%2C%20etc." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Article 45</a> of the Constitution could provide Zahir pardon or reprieve, or remit, suspend or commute his sentence.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#sc-verdict" id="sc-verdict" title="Permalink"></a>SC verdict</h2>
<p>A three-member bench, led by Justice Kakar and including Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Ali Baqar Najafi, heard Zahir‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1747988/noor-mukadam-murder-zahir-jaffar-approaches-sc-against-ihc-verdict-upholding-death-sentence">appeal</a> against his death sentence.</p>
<p>The bench upheld Zahir‚Äôs death sentence handed by two courts previously over the murder charges under Section 302(b) (premeditated murder) of the PPC.</p>
<p>However, it converted the IHC‚Äôs decision of a second death penalty over rape charges into a life sentence. The high court had turned Zahir‚Äôs 25 years of rigorous imprisonment under Section 376 of the PPC into a death sentence.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>While the 10-year jail term for kidnapping in order to murder under Section 364 of the PPC was overturned, Zahir was handed one year of imprisonment for wrongfully confining Noor.</p>
<p>The apex court maintained the earlier orders to Zahir to pay Rs0.5 million to Noor‚Äôs legal heir.</p>
<p>The appeals of two co-accused ‚Äî watchman Mohammad Iftikhar and gardener Jan Mohammad ‚Äî against their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810#:~:text=Iftikhar%20and%20Mohammad%20Jan%2C%20meanwhile%2C%20were%20each%20sentenced%20to%2010%20years%20of%20rigorous%20imprisonment%20and%20a%20fine%20of%20Rs100%2C000">10-year sentences</a> were also taken up by the SC.</p>
<p>The watchman and gardener‚Äôs sentences were reduced, with the bench deciding their detention so far was sufficient and allowing them to be released.</p></p>
