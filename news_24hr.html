            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928400/indian-jets-walked-into-ambush-due-to-intel-failure' target='_blank'><strong>Indian jets walked into ambush due to ‘intel failure’</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Report says faulty intelligence about range of PL-15 missile gave Rafale pilots ‘false sense of security’<br />
• Pakistani officials say electronic assault on Indian communications systems reduced situational awareness</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: India’s intelligence failure was central to the hour-long air <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">battle</a> between Pakistan and India in May, which led to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909172">downing</a> of Rafale aircraft by the Pakistan Air Force’s J-10 fighters using PL-15s missiles, according to a report.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> interviews with two Indian officials and three of their Pakistani counterparts found that the performance of the Rafale wasn’t the key problem: central to its downing was an Indian intelligence failure concerning the range of the China-made PL-15 missile fired by the J-10 fighter. China and Pakistan are the only countries to operate both J-10s, known as Vigorous Dragons, and PL-15s.</p>
<p>The faulty intelligence gave the Rafale pilots a false sense of confidence that they were out of Pakistani firing distance, which they believed was only around 150km, the Indian officials said, referring to the widely cited range of PL-15’s export variant.</p>
<p>“We ambushed them,” the PAF official said, adding that Islamabad conducted an electronic warfare assault on Delhi’s systems in an attempt to confuse Indian pilots. Indian officials dispute the effectiveness of those efforts.</p>
<p>“The Indians were not expecting to be shot at,” said Justin Bronk, air warfare expert at London’s Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think-tank. “And the PL-15 is clearly very capable at long range.” The PL-15 that hit the Rafale was fired from around 200km away, according to Pakistani officials, and even farther according to Indian officials. That would make it among the longest-range air-to-air strikes recorded.</p>
<p>India’s defence and foreign ministries did not return requests for comment about the intelligence mistakes. Delhi hasn’t acknowledged a Rafale being shot down, but France’s air chief told reporters in June that he had seen evidence of the loss of that fighter and two other aircraft flown by India, including a Russian-made Sukhoi. A top Dassault executive also told French lawmakers that month that India had lost a Rafale in operations, though he didn’t have specific details.</p>
<p><strong>Account of aerial battle</strong></p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> spoke to eight Pakistani and two Indian officials to piece together an account of the aerial battle, which marked the start of four days of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">fighting</a> between the two nuclear-armed neighbours that caused alarm in Washington. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss national security matters.</p>
<p>Not only did Islamabad have the element of surprise with its missiles’ range, the Pakistani and Indian officials said, but it managed to more efficiently connect its military hardware to surveillance on the ground and in the air, providing it with a clearer picture of the battlefield. Such networks, known as “kill chains,” have become a crucial element of modern warfare.</p>
<p>Four Pakistani officials said they created a “kill chain,” or a multi-domain operation, by linking air, land and space sensors. The network included a Pakistani-developed system, Data Link 17, which connected Chinese military hardware with other equipment, including a Swedish-made surveillance plane, two Pakistani officials said.</p>
<p>The system allowed the J-10s flying closer to India to obtain radar feeds from the surveillance plane cruising further away, meaning the Chinese-made fighters could turn their radars off and fly undetected, according to experts. Pakistan’s military did not respond to requests for comment on this point.</p>
<p>Delhi is trying to set up a similar network, the Indian officials said, adding that their process was more complicated because the country sourced aircraft from a wide range of exporters.</p>
<p>Retired UK air marsahl Greg Bagwell, now a fellow at RUSI, said the episode didnt conclusively prove the superiority of either Chinese or Western air assets but it showed the importance of having the right information and using it.</p>
<p>The winner in this was the side that had the best situational awareness, said Mr Bagwell.</p>
<p><strong>Change in tactics</strong></p>
<p>After India in the early hours of May 7 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988">struck</a> targets in Pakistan that it called terrorist infrastructure, the PAF chief ordered his squadrons to switch from defence to attack.</p>
<p>Five PAF officials said India had deployed some 70 planes, which was more than they had expected and provided Islamabad’s PL-15s with a target-rich environment. India has not said how many planes were used.</p>
<p>Five Pakistani officials said an electronic assault on Indian sensors and communications systems reduced the situational awareness of the Rafale’s pilots.</p>
<p>The two Indian officials said the Rafales were not blinded during the skirmishes and that Indian satellites were not jammed. But they acknowledged that Pakistan appeared to have disrupted the Sukhoi, whose systems Delhi is now upgrading.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the episode, India’s deputy army chief Lt. Gen. Rahul Singh accused Pakistan of receiving live inputs from China during the battles, implying radar and satellite feeds.</p>
<p>He did not provide evidence and Islamabad denies the allegation.</p>
<p>Beijing’s air chief Lt Gen Wang Gang, however, visited Pakistan in July to discuss how Islamabad had used Chinese equipment to put together the “kill chain for the Rafale, two PAF officials said.</p>
<p>The Pakistani military said in a statement in July that Wang had expressed “keen interest in learning from PAF’s battle-proven experience in Multi Domain Operations.”</p>
<p>The hour-long fight, which took place in darkness, involved some 110 aircraft, experts estimate, making it the world’s largest air battle in decades. The J-10 jets shot down at least one Rafale, <em>Reuters</em> reported in May, citing the US officials.</p>
<p>Its downing surprised many in the military community and raised questions about the effectiveness of Western military hardware against untested Chinese alternatives. Shares of Dassault, which makes the Rafale, dipped after reports that the fighter had been shot down.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928403/irrigation-shortfall-feared-as-manglas-filling-slows' target='_blank'><strong>Irrigation shortfall feared as Mangla’s filling slows</strong></a>
            <p><p>• The dam is holding 4.3MAF of water against its capacity of 7.3MAF<br />
• Below average inflows in Jhelum mean water in reservoir increases only a few inches each day</p>
<p>LAHORE: Despite record <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927762/punjab-pdma-issues-high-alert-amid-rising-river-levels">rainfall</a> and flooding in rivers, experts have warned of a 25 per cent water shortage in a few months due to a significant decline in Jehlum River’s inflows.</p>
<p>The drop in inflows has also slowed the filling of the Mangla Dam, one of the country’s two biggest reservoirs.</p>
<p>Inflows in the Jhelum River on Saturday dropped to 25,200 cusecs, 47 per cent less than its recorded average. On the corresponding day last year, the inflows were 39,700 cusecs.</p>
<p>The last five-year average for the day was 47,900 cusecs and 44,200 cusecs for the last 10 years.</p>
<p>Due to lesser inflows, water in the Mangla dam was only increasing a few inches each day. According to water experts, this could result in a 25pc water shortage in the coming Rabi season.</p>
<p>From Thursday to Friday, the dam’s storage only increased from 1,200.65 feet to 1,201.20 feet, 41ft below the total capacity of 1,242 feet.</p>
<p>Currently, the dam is holding 4.3 million acre feet (MAF) of water against its total live capacity of 7.3MAF.</p>
<p>The loss of 3MAF water would translate into up to 12 to 15 per cent water shortages in the coming Rabi season.</p>
<p>Adding the permanent water loss of eight to 10pc due to the reduced capacity of the Tarbela Dam — as a result of silt accumulation — the country is expected to suffer 20 to 25pc water loss during the next Rabi season, according to experts.</p>
<p>According to the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) data, all but one river yielded less water than they did last year.</p>
<p>The data from April 1 to July 31 showed the Indus River produced 37.20MAF water, which is 31pc higher than its 10-year average and 36pc more than last year.</p>
<p>During the same period, the Kabul River yielded 8.2MAF water, 36pc less than its 10-year average and 53pc less than last year.</p>
<p>The Chenab River nearly maintained its average yield with 10.70MAF water, still 6pc less than the 10-year average but 3pc more than last year.</p>
<p>In total, the Jehlum river produced 8.7MAF water in the last four months. It was 27pc less than the last year and 28pc less than the 10-year average.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">Tensions</a> between India and Pakistan since early May have also affected water inflows in the Mangla Dam.</p>
<p>India has stopped sharing river inflows data since April when it unilaterally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274">suspended</a> the Indus Waters Treaty.</p>
<p>Irsa Spokesman Khalid Idrees Rana has said almost half a million acre feet of water had to be released from Mangla Dam to cover for the uncertainty created by India’s decision.</p>
<p>“On May 5, inflows in the Chenab river dropped from 35,000 cusecs to mere 5,000 within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Similarly, on May 31, it dipped from 45,000 to a paltry 7,000 cusecs,“ Mr Rana added.</p>
<p>Earlier, on April 5, inflows dropped from  10,000 to 4,000 cusecs.</p>
<p>To cover for these inconsistencies and ensure smooth irrigation of crops, Irsa released additional water from the Mangla Dam, Mr Rana said, adding these factors apparently slowed the reservoir’s filling.</p>
<p>“Normally, we get two to three late showers every monsoon, which helps Mangla dam filling,” he said, adding the downpour didn’t happen this year and there was no forecast for one in the near future.</p>

            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said that the regime, terrified by the prospect of the incarcerated PTI Patron-in-Chief Imran Khan’s children <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927548">returning</a> to Pakistan, resorted to blatant “lies” — a clear reflection of its weakness.</p>
<p>In a statement on Saturday, PTI CIS lashed out at the government for labelling the PTI founder’s sons as foreigners. He made it clear that they were Pakistani nationals who possessed National Identity Cards for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOPs), and therefore have every legal and constitutional right to visit Pakistan and see their father.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“The oppressive and tyrannical government was forced to lie out of fear of Imran Khan’s children coming to Pakistan, which shows how weak and cowardly they are,” Mr Waqas stated.</p>
<p>He emphasised that both were issued tracking numbers for their visa applications submitted to the Pakistan High Commission in London — with Sulaiman’s tracking ID being 88005575178 and Kasim’s 88005575782.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Asserts both are Pakistanis, shares details of visa, NICOP applications</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He said applications for both visas and NICOPs have been submitted, and while the issuance of NICOPs may take several weeks from Pakistan, visas can be granted within a matter of hours.</p>
<p>The high commissioner intimated a friend of Mr Khan’s family, who spoke to him that he needed clearance from the Ministry of Interior, the PTI leader claimed.</p>
<p>He said the boys were contacting the embassy through normal routes, and there was no response.</p>
<p>The interior ministry in an official statement claimed it had nothing to do with visa issuance. Then the government claimed, “visa applications have not been received”, he remarked.</p>
<p>The party leader also formally released details about NICOP status of Kasim and Sulaiman as issued by the government.</p>
