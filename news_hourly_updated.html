                <h2>Islamabad ATC issues bailable arrest warrant for Omar Ayub in Oct protest case</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>An Islamabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) issued a bailable arrest warrant for National Assembly Opposition Leader Omar Ayub in a case related to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1862987">protest</a> in October last year.</p>
<p>PTI protesters and the Islamabad police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1862987">clashed</a> on Oct 4, 2024, as hundreds of party activists defied security measures and road <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1862926/allies-foes-alike-urge-pti-to-postpone-protests">blockades</a> to gather at multiple locations days before the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1865567">summit</a>. Over 100 PTI supporters, along with ex-premier Imran Khan‚Äôs two sisters, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1863167/dozens-arrested-as-pti-defies-blockades-to-reach-d-chowk">taken into custody</a>.</p>
<p>ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra presided over today‚Äôs hearing of a case filed at the Shahzad Town police station.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Advocates Sardar Masroof Khan, Zahid Bashir Dar, Murtaza Toori and Mirza Asim were among the lawyers present on the PTI leaders‚Äô behalf.</p>
<p>During the hearing, Judge Sipra issued a bailable arrest warrant for Ayub and ordered that any previous bail granted to suspects who were absent today be cancelled.</p>
<p>However, the judge accepted Senator Azam Swati‚Äôs plea seeking exemption from attendance, which was filed yesterday, according to Masroof.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned till July 30.</p>
<p>In a video statement yesterday, Advocate Masroof lamented the ‚Äúspeed with which these cases are being heard‚Äù.</p>
<p>He noted that some suspects had come from faraway areas such as Azad Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Mardan, having no place to stay overnight in Islamabad to attend today‚Äôs hearing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf these trials will be bulldozed in such a manner and you won‚Äôt give them a fair trial, then it will become very difficult for you to fulfil the requirements of justice,‚Äù the lawyer said, requesting courts to punish those guilty but not convict those who were not involved.</p>

<p>Today‚Äôs development comes within days of two ATCs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925931">sentencing PTI bigwigs</a> to as many as 10 years in jail in cases related to the violent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9, 2023</a> countrywide riots.</p>
<p>A Lahore ATC handed down at least eight leaders 10-year rigorous imprisonment, while acquitting six others. A Sargodha ATC also convicted as many as 32 accused, including MNA Ahmad Chattha and Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Ahmed Khan Bhachar.</p>
<p>In May, the Islamabad police‚Äôs prosecution nominated the PTI‚Äôs top leadership ‚Äî including Ayub, Chairman Gohar Khan, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Barris¬≠ter Muhammad Ali Saif ‚Äî in another case over the October 4 protests filed at the Koral police station.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, a Lahore ATC also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922200/atc-declares-hammad-po-in-protest-case">declared</a> PTI‚Äôs Hammad Azhar and Rana Shahbaz Ahmed as proclaimed offenders in two cases related to an alleged attack on Punjab police during a simultaneous protest as party workers <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1863350">reached</a> Minar-i-Pakistan despite the government‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1863171">security measures</a>.</p>

                <h2>Retired colonel‚Äôs body found as search for daughter swept away in Rawalpindi floodwaters continues</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Rescue teams on Thursday recovered the body of a retired colonel who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/pmd-issues-glof-alert-for-gb-kp-as-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-from-diamer-amid-floods#:~:text=Two%20swept%20away%20in%20Rawalpindi%E2%80%99s%20DHA'">went missing</a> after his car was swept away by floodwaters and slipped into a drain in Rawalpindi last week, while a search for his daughter continues, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>Rescue efforts have been underway since Tuesday, when Retired Colonel Ishaq Qazi, aged approximately 62‚Äì64 years, and his 25-year-old daughter went missing after the car they were in was swept away by rainwater.</p>
<p>District Emergency Officer (DEO) Sibghatullah said, ‚ÄúThe body of Ishaq had been found near the Soan River bridge, while rescue operations are underway to look for his daughter.‚Äù</p>
<p>Earlier today, Sibghatullah had said that rescue operations had entered a third day to search for the duo, while parts of their car had been found.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRescue 1122 found the bonnet and a door of the car under the Soan River bridge,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>According to a statement by Islamabad‚Äôs Sihala police station on Tuesday, the duo were in a grey Honda vehicle and were residents of Defence Housing Authority‚Äôs Phase 5.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDue to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain,‚Äù the police statement from Tuesday said.</p>
<p>Also on Tuesday morning, two girls were among four people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925919">swept away</a> in separate incidents due to flash flooding in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>Pakistan experiences <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925461">monsoon rainfall</a> from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>Last week, Section 144 was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924761">imposed</a> across Punjab along with a state of emergency in several districts as heavy rains triggered flooding and claimed over 60 lives across the province in 24 hours.</p>

<p>On the other hand, residents of a housing society blocked Rawalpindi‚Äôs Grand Trunk Road after the rescue teams could not recover the body of a teenager who had drowned a day earlier.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, a 17-year-old boy drowned while crossing a nullah near the Metro City Housing Society. He was walking on a small passage when high-speed torrents swept him away in deep waters.</p>
<p>Two of his relatives jumped in the water to rescue him, but they told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the water was moving at high speed and the boy could not be saved.</p>
<p>Gujar Khan assistant superintendent of police and assistant commissioner also reached the spot and called the Rescue 1122 team, who were unable to retrieve the body as of the filing of this report. The residents of the area blocked the GT Road, citing the ‚Äúinaction and incapacity of Rescue 1122 in recovering the victim‚Äôs body after many hours‚Äù.</p></p>
