                <h2>Karakoram Highway reopened as rescue, aid efforts continue in flood-hit GB</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Karakoram Highway (KKH) was reopened on Saturday as aid and rescue operations continued in Gilgit-Baltistan after flash floods battered the region.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719">devastating impacts</a> of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">heat¬≠¬≠waves</a>, erratic weat¬≠her patterns and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660">glacial melting</a> have triggered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a> and intense floods across the region.</p>
<p>On Monday, floods swept through GB‚Äôs Babusar area in Diamer district and Naran, causing landslides and leaving many <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926193">stranded</a>. At least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926487">nine people</a> died and more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure were damaged as a result.</p>
<p>In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said: ‚ÄúThe Karakoram Highway is open for all types of traffic.‚Äù</p>
<p>He recalled that the main artery had been blocked due to landslides and mud flow on Friday, adding that machinery was sent to restore the road.</p>
<p>Faraq further said that rescue and search operations were underway across the region. The recent floods have caused severe destruction in the region, particularly in the Kunduz region and the Ghanche district, he noted.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúFloods in GB have destroyed many houses, water channels, communication roads, standing crops, shops and electricity poles,‚Äù the official said.</p>
<p>He added that the local government has distributed ‚Äúhundreds of tents, thousands of food packets and medicines to the affected people‚Äù across the region.</p>
<p>Speaking about the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">search operation</a> in Babusar, Faraq said, ‚ÄúThere may be 10 to 12 missing tourists at the Babusar valley as a search operation was ongoing.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Pakistan Army, GB Scouts, Rescue 1122 and local volunteers are taking part in the operation,‚Äù he said, adding that continuous landslides and increasing water flow were hampering the search.</p>
<p>Another rescue operation was underway in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/642478/trekking-to-tranquility">Fairy Meadows</a>, according to the government spokesperson.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFour stranded tourists at Fairy Meadows near Nanga Parbat basecamp, including one man and three women, were airlifted through Pakistan Army helicopters on early Friday,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan and his cabinet will also hold a press conference today regarding flood disasters and rehabilitation operations, Faraq added.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the National Disaster Management Authority <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/pmd-issues-glof-alert-for-gb-kp-as-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-from-diamer-amid-floods#:~:text=NDMA%20issues%20landslide%20alert">issued</a> a landslide alert for the northern areas of the country.

<p>The GB government had started free and special flights yesterday to evacuate stranded tourists and local people, GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmed Mirza noted.</p>
<p>In a media briefing on Friday, Mirza said 135 people, including 80 tourists, were taken from Skardu to Islamabad through a C-130 flight. ‚ÄúA special C-130 flight will start from Gilgit to Islamabad to shift stranded tourists and local passengers to Islamabad,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>He also said that the GB government made the arrangements with the NDMA and Pakistan Army to ‚Äúfacilitate safe evacuation of tourists, patients, and students who were stranded at multiple locations‚Äù.</p>
<p>A helicopter service was also launched to evacuate tourists stranded in the affected areas, he added.</p>
<p>The chief secretary further noted, ‚ÄúThe main cause of most of the incidents was melting glaciers and cloudburst.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that the cloudburst-induced <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">destructive flood</a> at Babusar valley washed away around eight kilometres of the road leading to Babusar Top, sweeping away two dozen vehicles and leaving <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/officials-say-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-amid-gb-floods-govt-issues-landslide-alert">hundreds of tourists</a> and locals stranded.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHowever, the stranded tourists at Babusar valley and Deosai areas were safely evacuated through timely efforts by locals, Rescue 1122, district administration, the Pakistan Army, Frontier Works Organisation (FWO), and local community volunteers,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Mirza stated that 12km of roads, 26 bridges, 20 vehicles, water channels, cattle sheds, shops, agricultural lands, crops, private and public properties, irrigation channels, and drinking water supply systems had been damaged in several areas of GB.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe GB government is effectively dealing with the situation,‚Äù he said, asserting the administration was providing aid to the affected places.</p></p>

            </a>
            <p><p>Health Minister Mustafa Kamal urged international stakeholders to explore partnerships in Pakistan‚Äôs rapidly evolving health landscape, highlighting the country‚Äôs ‚Äúimmense‚Äù potential for investment, state-run <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/26-07-2025/pakistan-presents-immense-opportunities-for-investment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Radio Pakistan</em></a> reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>Representing Pakistan at Boao Forum for Asia‚Äôs (BFA) Global Health Forum in Beijing yesterday, the health minister underscored that Pakistan presents ‚Äúimmense opportunities for collaboration, innovation and investment‚Äù.</p>
<p>Established in 2001, the <a class="link--external" href="https://en.ghfbfa.cn/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Boao Forum for Asia</a> (BFA) is a non-profit international organisation promoting regional cooperation in Asia. It focuses on health issues related to economic development and wellbeing.</p>
<p>The roundtable featured health ministers from all over the world, who discussed equal access to healthcare and sustainable reforms.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPakistan is ready for partnerships in global health,‚Äù Kamal said, highlighting the country‚Äôs 250 million population, nursing cooperation and digital reforms.</p>
<p>He pointed out that there were ‚Äúsignificant opportunities for global collaboration in the health sector‚Äù, according to a post on his X account.</p>
<p>The minister noted that Pakistan could play a role in mitigating a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844692">shortage</a> of nurses and paramedics through training and cooperation.</p>
<p>He invited global partners to explore investment avenues, emphasising Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to providing strong <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891490">returns</a>, streamlined regulation, and government support.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWithout health, the economy cannot progress,‚Äù Kamal said.</p>

<p>The health minister also drew attention to the new Digital System for Licensing and Registration of Medical Devices for the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap), which was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925775">launched</a> by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday.</p>
<p>At the inauguration, the premier noted that the registration of life-saving medical devices and diagnostic products in Pakistan had become a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901711">critical issue</a> earlier this year. He expressed hope that the applications for such equipment would now be decided within 20 days.</p>
<p>Last month, Kamal noted that Pakistan‚Äôs healthcare system was riddled with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919214">fundamental flaws</a> and that the solution lay not merely in building hospitals but in improving the entire environment.</p>
<p>The minister has also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924869">called attention</a> towards Pakistan‚Äôs high fertility rate, high burden of both communicable and non-communicable diseases, and need to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898284">eradicate polio</a>.</p></p>
