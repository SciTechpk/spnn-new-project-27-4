            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/credible-intel-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-info-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Credible intel shows India intends military action against Pakistan in next 24-36 hours: info minister</strong></a>
            <p><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar early on Wednesday morning said that “credible intelligence” reports indicated that India was planning to conduct a military action against Pakistan in the “next 24 to 36 hours”, adding to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">tensions</a> between the two countries in the wake of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>.</p>
<p>India, without offering any evidence, has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">political</a> and military leadership have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">strongly denied</a> any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a> into the incident.</p>
<p>The tensions between the arch-rivals have intensified in the past few days, with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforced its forces</a> and was ready for any incursion by India, while on the other side, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given his military “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>” to act on the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>In a televised <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> issued hours after Modi’s move, Tarar said: “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends to carry out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.”</p>
<p>He said Pakistan vehemently rejected “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region” and it was completely “reckless”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Pakistan has been the victim of terrorism itself and truly understands the pain of this scourge,” the minister said, adding: “We have always condemned it in all its forms and manifestations anywhere in the world.”</p>
<p>Being a responsible state, Tarar noted, Pakistan “openheartedly offered a credible, transparent and independent investigation” by a neutral commission of experts to ascertain the truth.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, rather than pursuing the path of reason, India has apparently decided to tread the dangerous path of irrationality and confrontation, which will have catastrophic consequences for the complete region and beyond,” he stressed.</p>
<p>The information minister said the “evasion of credible investigations is in itself sufficient evidence exposing India’s real motives”.</p>
<p>“Consciously making strategic decisions hostage to public sentiments, purposefully trumped up for securing political objectives, is unfortunate and deplorable,” he  added.</p>
<p>Tarar reiterated that any such military adventurism by India would be responded to assuredly and decisively.</p>
<p>“The international community must remain alive to the reality that the onus of [an] escalatory spiral and its ensuing consequences shall squarely lie with India.”</p>
<p>He reiterated the nation’s resolve to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan at all costs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as concerns over a potential breakdown of peace grew, shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907535/shares-at-psx-slump-on-heightened-pakistan-india-tensions">faced a major fall</a> in intraday trade today.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, and was one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front, said it “unequivocally” denied involvement in the attack, after an initial message that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=The%20Resistance%20Front%E2%80%99%2C%20is%20said%20to%20have%20claimed%20responsibility%20for%20the%20attack.">claimed</a> responsibility.</p>
<p>In the latest development, the Pakistan Army yesterday shot down <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907495/two-indian-drones-shot-down-near-loc">two Indian quadcopters</a> after they violated the country’s airspace along the Line of Control (LoC) in two separate areas of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), official sources said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907326/pakistan-shoots-down-indian-quadcopter-violating-airspace-near-loc-state-media">first drone</a> was brought down in the Manawar sector of Bhimber district, where it was reportedly engaged in aerial surveillance when intercepted and destroyed by Pakistani troops. The second unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down in Poonch division’s Satwal sector.</p>
<p>The downing of the drones occurred amid continued exchange of fire along the LoC in Leepa Valley since the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers#:~:text=troops%20exchanged%20fire%20overnight%20across%20the%20Line%20of%20Control%20(LoC)%20in%20Kashmir">night of April 25</a>, breaking a period of relative calm in the region. No casualties were immediately reported.</p>
<p>According to IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Indian <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907326/pakistan-shoots-down-indian-quadcopter-violating-airspace-near-loc#:~:text=Cyberattacks%20on%20ministries%E2%80%99%20websites%20%E2%80%98foiled%E2%80%99">cyberattack attempts</a> on the websites of some ministries have been foiled as well.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar said Pakistan will not strike India but reserves the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907464">right to retaliate</a>. He informed the Senate that intelligence reports suggest that India was contemplating some form of escalation.</p>

<p>The National Cyber Emergency Resp­onse Team (N-Cert) has warned media and content creators against sharing sensitive national security information.</p>
<p>Amid fears of airspace closures due to rising tensions with India, authorities yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion#:~:text=240%20million%20people.-,No%20airport%20closures,-Amid%20fears%20of">refuted rumours</a> of a possible closure of airports.</p>
<p>A senior official at Islamabad International Airport said the airport was fully functional for both domestic and international flights, while an official from the Lahore airport also confirmed that flight operations were running smoothly.</p>

<p>A week after the Pahalgam attack, Modi yesterday told the armed forces that they had the “complete <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a> to decide on the mode, targets and timing of our response to the terror attack”, a senior government source who was not authorised to speak to the media told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>The government released video images of a stern-faced Modi holding a closed-door meeting with his army and security chiefs, as well as Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.</p>
<p>Last week, Modi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284#:~:text=dangerous%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20warned.-,Modi%20vows%20to%20pursue%20attackers%20to%20%E2%80%98ends%20of%20the%20Earth%E2%80%99,-Meanwhile%2C%20in%20India">vowed to pursue</a> those who carried out the attack in the tourist hotspot of Pahalgam and those who had supported it.</p>
<p>“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” he said. “We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth”.</p>

<p>Calls have also grown from Indian politicians and others for military action against Pakistan. <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907518/disturbing-escalation">Analysts</a> say they fear bellicose statements will escalate into possible military action.</p>
<p>Amid escalating tensions, friendly countries and global powers have urged India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, advising them to solve the matter through diplomatic engagement.</p>
<p>Last night, US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce announced that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was expected to speak to the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan “as early as today or tomorrow”.</p>
<p>She said the US was reaching out to both parties regarding the Kashmir issue, and is expected to tell both sides not to escalate things any further.</p>
<p>Bruce said that Rubio was also encouraging leaders and foreign ministers from other nations to reach out over the issue.</p>
<p>Following the Pahalgam attack, US President Donald Trump had extended his “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905973/two-dozen-dead-as-tourists-targeted-in-held-kashmir#:~:text=US%20President%20Donald%20Trump%20said%20that%20India%20had%20the%20full%20support%20of%20the%20US.">full support</a>” to India. He later downplayed the regional tensions, saying the dispute would get “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906480">figured out</a>”.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home">United Nations</a> has urged the arch-rivals to show “maximum restraint”, with its chief Antonio Guterres yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar#:~:text=PM%20Shehbaz%20urges%20UN%20chief%20to%20%E2%80%98counsel%20India%E2%80%99%20to%20%E2%80%98exercise%20restraint%E2%80%99">offering</a> “his good offices to support de-escalation efforts”.</p>
<p>In his phone call with the UN chief on Tuesday, PM Shehbaz encouraged him to counsel India to “act responsibly and exercise restraint”.</p>
<p>The worst attack in recent years in occupied Kashmir was at Pulwama in 2019, when a person rammed a car packed with explosives into a security forces convoy, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1463946">killing 40</a> and wounding 35.</p>
<p>Indian fighter jets <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1466038">carried out air strikes</a> on Pakistani territory 12 days later. The next day, Pakistan Air Force undertook strikes across the LoC from Pakistani airspace.</p></p>

            <p><p>Bears took control of the trade floor as shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) declined by more than 2,000 points in intraday trade, which analysts attributed the slump to heightened tensions between the country  and neighbouring India.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index decreased by 1,717.35 points, or 1.5 per cent, to stand at 113,154.83 from the last close of 114,872.18 at 9:53am.</p>
<p>At 10:38am, the index declined by by 2,073.42 points, or 1.8pc, from the last close.</p>
<p>Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, attributed the decline to “news of likely attack in next few days”.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said, “Investors are worried about potential Indian military action against Pakistan, concerns that have intensified following the information minister’s press briefing.”</p>
<p>Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, echoed the same sentiments.</p>
<p>He said that the market was under pressure following the information minister’s “statement last night suggesting that India may take military action within the next 24–36 hours”.</p>
<p>“The market in the short term will most likely follow newsflows of Pakistan-India tensions,” he added.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">said</a> that “credible intelligence” reports indicated that India was planning to conduct a military action against Pakistan in the next 24 to 36 hours amid tensions between the two countries after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> in occupied Kashmir last week that New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">blamed</a> on Islamabad, albeit without proof.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, India gave its military “operational freedom” to respond to the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media hours after the development, Tarar said: “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends carrying out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.”</p>
<p>He said Pakistan vehemently rejected “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region”, adding that it was completely “reckless”.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Indian shares were muted as gains in heavyweight HDFC Bank helped offset pressure from tensions with Pakistan, while Bajaj Finance declined despite posting a rise in fourth-quarter profit.</p>
<p>The Nifty 50 was down 0.05pc at 24,324 and the BSE Sensex lost 0.07pc to 80,236.6 as of 10:43am.</p>
<p>Both benchmarks swung between 0.2pc gains and 0.2pc losses in early trade.</p>
<p>“For now, geopolitical tensions (with Pakistan) have overtaken (US) tariffs in investors’ minds,” said Anita Gandhi, founder and head of institutional business at Arihant Capital Markets.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi granted military chiefs freedom to respond to last week’s attack in Kashmir, <em>Reuters</em> reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Nifty volatility index has risen in five of the six sessions since the attack in Kashmir.</p>

<p>Non-bank lender Bajaj Finance fell 5.4pc, leading losses on the Nifty, despite posting a higher quarterly profit, as brokerages flagged weak pre-provision profit and higher credit costs as negatives.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907453/pakistan-seeks-action-against-london-mission-vandals' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks action against London mission vandals</strong></a>
            <p><p>LONDON: The Pakistan government has called on British authorities to take decisive legal action against individuals involved in recent violent incidents outside the Pakistan High Commission in London, including a stone-pelting attack that occurred early Sunday morning.</p>
<p>In an official statement issued on Tuesday, the Pakistan High Commission condemned the latest attack, which took place at approximately 5:18am on April 27.</p>
<p>The assailant, identified by British police as Ankit Love, reportedly hurled stones and splashed saffron paint on the outer wall of the High Commission, shattering several windows and staining the building’s nameplate. He was apprehended shortly after the incident by the Metropolitan Police.</p>
<p>The High Commission linked the act of vandalism to a larger, more aggressive protest that occurred days earlier on April 25, involving members of the Indian and British Indian community.</p>

<p>Protesters shouted anti-Pakistan and Islamophobic slogans, and clashed with law enforcers.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>“We expect that the British law enforcement agencies would prosecute Ankit, as well as the raucous protesters detained on Friday, in accordance with the relevant British laws,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Expressing concern over the escalating hostility, the statement from the mission reminded the UK government of its obligations under the Vienna Convention to protect diplomatic missions. It also reiterated its demand for enhanced security at Pakistani diplomatic posts across the UK.</p>
<p>“This is not the first incident where the High Commission of Pakistan or our Consulates in the United Kingdom have been attacked,” the statement read.</p>
<p>The Pakistan High Commission confirmed it is in contact with British police to obtain further details about Ankit Love, whose nationality has not yet been disclosed.</p>
<p>Reuters adds: Meanwhile, UK Foreign Office minister Hamish Falconer has called for calm between Indian and Pakistani communities, after lawmakers voiced concerns that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">tensions</a> over the Pahalgam attack in India-held Kashmir could spill into the diaspora.</p>
<p>“These issues have long been discussed with passion on British streets  and we call on sides, all community leaders, all involved to call for  calm at a time of tension in the region,” Hamish  Falconer told parliament.</p>
<p>Falconer appeared in parliament to answer an urgent question  on the situation, where lawmakers raised concerns about media reports of  ill-tempered protests outside India and Pakistan’s high commissions in London.</p>
<p>The British government’s long-standing position is that India and Pakistan are responsible for finding a solution to the situation in held Kashmir that takes into account the wishes of the Kashmiri people, he told parliament.</p>
