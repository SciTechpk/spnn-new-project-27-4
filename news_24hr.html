            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911576/uk-urges-all-sides-to-meet-treaty-obligations-amid-indias-suspension-of-iwt' target='_blank'><strong>UK urges ‘all sides’ to meet treaty obligations amid India’s suspension of IWT</strong></a>
            <p><p>UK’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs David Lammy on Saturday urged “all sides” to abide by their treaty obligations, referring to India’s move last month to hold the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a> (IWT) with Pakistan in abeyance unilaterally.</p>
<p>Delhi’s suspension of its participation in the 1960 IWT was part of its series of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">measures</a> against Pakistan, which it blamed, without any evidence, for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">strongly denied</a> any involvement and offered a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a> into it.</p>
<p>“We would urge all sides to meet their treaty obligations,” Lammy told <em>Reuters</em> in Islamabad at the end of his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911413/india-should-adhere-to-ceasefire-pakistan-will-respond-if-hostilities-resume-fo#:~:text=FM%20Dar%20appreciates%20UK%20role%20in%20de%2Descalation">two-day visit</a>, when asked about India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">April 23 suspension</a> of the (IWT), potentially <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911383">squeezing</a> Pakistan’s water supply.</p>
<p>The 1960 pact governs the use of the Indus River system. Pakistan has said it would consider “any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan” to be an “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">act of war</a>”.</p>
<p>Islamabad plans to launch <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907454">international legal action</a> against India over its move. The Pakistan Commission on Indus Waters earlier this month <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908458">shared</a> a detailed report with the federal government about massive violations of the IWT by New Delhi.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>During his interview with <em>Reuters</em>, Lammy also said Britain was working with the US to ensure a ceasefire between India and Pakistan endures.</p>
<p>“We will continue to work with the United States to ensure that we get an enduring ceasefire, to ensure that dialogue is happening and to work through with Pakistan and India how we can get to confidence and confidence-building measures between the two sides,” Lammy said.</p>
<p>“These are two neighbours with a long history but they are two neighbours that have barely been able to speak to one other over this past period, and we want to ensure that we do not see further escalation and that the ceasefire endures,” he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Pakistan has said Britain and other countries, in addition to the United States, played a major role in de-escalating the fighting. Diplomats and analysts say the ceasefire <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911472">remains fragile</a>.</p>
<p>Lammy also said Britain would continue to work with Pakistan on countering “terrorism”, saying that it is “a terrible blight on this country and its people, and of course on the region”.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said Washington had averted what could have been a nuclear war between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as tensions over the Pahalgam attack allegations continued to build up. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting drones</a> sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns. On May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, Trump announced that a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> had been reached between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>“The situation had escalated to the point where nuclear war could have broken out,” Trump said in an interview with US outlet <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-says-comey-knew-assassination-meaning-behind-deleted-social-media-post#:~:text=pointed%20to%20a%20recent%20ceasefire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News</a></em> on Friday.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to a question about getting both countries to step back from the brink of war, Trump called it a “bigger success than I will ever be given credit for”.</p>
<p>“Those are major nuclear powers […] and they were angry. […] It was tit-for-tat, it was getting deeper and more missiles,” he said. He added the next step would have been “the N-word”, responding in the affirmative to the host confirming he meant “nuclear”.</p>
<p>“That’s the worst thing that can happen,” Trump noted. Referring to discussions he said he had with both Pakistan and India on trade, the US president said: “I’m using trade to settle scores and make peace.”</p>
<p>Trump said that he had great conversations with Pakistan. “You know we can’t forget them because it takes two to tango.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“So proud of what we’re able to do with India and with Pakistan,” the US president said.</p>
<p>He continued that Pakistan would love to trade with the US. “They are brilliant people. They make amazing products. We don’t do much trading with them.”</p>
<p>As the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810/trumps-tariffs-stoke-global-trade-war-as-china-eu-hit-back">imposed heavy levies</a> on dozens of allies and rivals alike on April 2, Pakistan was hit by a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901838/economists-see-hurdles-and-opportunities-for-pakistan-as-us-imposes-29pc-tariff-on-country">29 per cent tariff</a> on goods it exports to the US. The government has said it is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906864">seeking ways</a> to address the existing trade imbalance between the two countries.</p>
<p>On trade with New Delhi, Trump said that India was one of the highly tariffed nations, making it almost “impossible to do business”.</p>
<p>However, India is ready to cut 100pc of its tariffs for the US, he added. “That deal will come soon,” the president said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, he had stated that India had offered a trade deal that proposed “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911203">no tariffs</a>” for American goods.</p>
<p>This interview was the third time in a week that the US president expressed his intention of deepening trade ties with Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>“We’re going to do a lot of trade with Pakistan … and India,” Trump said earlier this week, recalling that he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910565/trump-says-warned-pakistan-india-of-no-trade-if-fighting-not-halted">warned</a> both countries of “not doing any trade” if they did not stop fighting. A day after the ceasefire, he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910382#:~:text=adding%20that%20he%20also%20intended%20to%20%E2%80%9Cincrease%20trade%20substantially%20with%20both%20of%20these%20great%20nations%E2%80%9D">said</a> he was going “to increase trade substantially with both of these great nations”.</p>
<p>The US-brokered ceasefire had brought a halt to a week of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909156/nuclear-war-can-break-out-at-any-time-in-case-of-pak-india-standoff-khawaja-asif">record escalation</a> between Pakistan and India as the latter took a series of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988">unprovoked military actions</a> despite Islamabad’s call for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a> into India’s allegations over the Pahalgam attack.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Trump said after the ceasefire was struck that talks should take place in a third-country venue but no dates or location for the talks have been announced.</p>
<p>The military has confirmed that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910992">13 security personnel</a>, including members of the Pakistan Army and the Pakistan Air Force, were martyred while over 75 were injured during the confrontation with India.</p>
<p>It has also stated that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910848/40-civilians-11-personnel-martyred-in-indian-strikes">40 civilians</a> — including seven women and 15 children — lost their lives during the Indian aggression, while 121 others sustained injuries.</p></p>

            <p><p>Former foreign minister and PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi has been moved from Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat Jail to the Punjab Institute of Cardiology (PIC) on Saturday after he suffered heart pain, his lawyer said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Qureshi has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897723/amended-charges-framed-against-qureshi-others">indicted</a> in multiple cases pertaining to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279/special-report-may-9-mayhem-and-military-trials-a-year-on">May 9, 2023 riots</a> and has remained behind bars since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1771020">August 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em> today, Advocate Rana Mudassar, Qureshi’s lawyer, said his client suffered heart pain early in the morning after Fajr prayers. He underwent a medical assessment by prison doctors.</p>
<p>“He was shifted to the PIC by Rescue 1122 after his health failed to improve,” Mudassar said, adding that Qureshi was currently undergoing various tests at the hospital.</p>
<p>The PTI leader’s family had been informed about his condition, the lawyer added.</p>
<p>In a post on X today, Qureshi’s son urged the nation to pray for his speedy recovery.</p>

<p>In July 2024, the PTI vice-president was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845990">indicted</a> by a Lahore anti-terrorism court in a case registered by the Shadman police over allegedly attacking and burning the police station.</p>
<p>The same month, he was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1846704">transferred</a> from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi to Kot Lakhpat on a police request. It had stated that frequent transportation of the PTI leader from Rawalpindi to Lahore was not feasible for the authorities as well as for the jailed ex-minister.</p>
<p>In November last year, a Lahore ATC <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1873389">indicted</a> Qureshi and other senior PTI leaders in multiple cases relating to May 9 riots. The former foreign minister has pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p></p>

            <p><p>Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Saturday that US President Donald Trump speaks simultaneously about peace and threats.</p>
<p>“Which should we believe?” Pezeshkian said at a naval event in Tehran. “On the one hand, he speaks of peace and on the other, he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901324">threatens</a> with the most advanced tools of mass killing.”</p>
<p>Tehran would continue Iran-US nuclear talks but is not afraid of threats. “We are not seeking war,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump said on Friday that Iran had a US proposal about its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911291/trump-claims-n-deal-with-iran-likely-hopes-to-avoid-military-action">nuclear programme</a> and knows it needs to move quickly to resolve a decades-long dispute.</p>
<p>“More importantly, they know they have to move quickly or something bad something bad’s going to happen,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One after departing the United Arab Emirates on Friday, according to an audio recording of the remarks.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian said Iran would not “back down from our legitimate rights”.</p>
<p>“Because we refuse to bow to bullying, they say we are [a] source of instability in the region,” he said.</p>
<p>However, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi in a <a class="link--external" href="https://twitter.com/araghchi/status/1923406236457804197?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1923406236457804197%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X said Tehran had not received a US proposal. “There is no scenario in which Iran abandons its hard-earned right to [uranium] enrichment for peaceful purposes…” he said.</p>
