            <p><p>• Chauhan curious why their jets were downed<br />
• Claims conflict never came close to a nuclear war<br />
• Says ‘channels of communication’ with Islamabad were open<br />
• BJP leader says PAF shot down five Indian aircraft</p>
<p>NEW DELHI: A day after a BJP politician and staunch critic of Prime Minister Nare­ndra Modi, Subrahmanyam Swamy, claimed Pakistan had downed five Indian planes in the recent military escalation, India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914500/indian-military-confirms-fighter-jets-shot-down-by-pakistan">top military general admitted losses.</a></p>
<p>In an interview with <em>Bloomberg</em> on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue on Saturday, Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan admitted losses but dismissed Pakistan’s claims that it shot down six Indian jets, including four Rafales, as “absolutely incorrect”.</p>

<p>“What is important is that, not the jet being down, but why they were being down… Why they were down, what mistakes were made — that are important. Numbers are not important,” he said.</p>
<p>In a separate interview to <em>Reuters</em>, Gen Chauhan said the losses India suffered were in the initial stages, on May 7, when it launched Operation Sindoor.</p>
<p>“What I can say is that on May 7, in the initial stages, there were losses… What was important is why these losses occur and what we will do after that,” he said.</p>

<p>However, the chief of defence staff said the armed forces were quick to analyse the “tactical mistakes”, remedy them, and again target Pakistan on May 8 and May 10.</p>
<p>“The good part is that we are able to understand the tactical mistake which we made, remedy it, rectify it, and then implement it again after two days and flew all our jets again, targeting at long range,” <em>India Today</em> quoted Gen Chauhan as saying.</p>
<p>It may be recalled that Pakistan military says India did not fly its fighter jets again in the conflict after suffering losses on May 7.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, former law minister Swamy became the most candid Indian to admit that Pakistan Air Force had shot down five Indian planes, including French-made Rafales. Speaking in an online interview, Dr Swamy blamed the French planes as being responsible for the losses, implying that the deal the prime minister had made for them was to blame. The interview came as Mr Modi went about holding mammoth meetings in Gujarat and other states claiming victory and threatening more dire conflict with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Gen Chauhan’s remarks were the most direct by the army so far on losses suffered during the hostilities, which came as India attacked nine alleged terror camps deep inside Pakistan. It was in response to the horrific Pahalgam attack, which left at least 25 tourists dead.</p>
<p>As Pakistan retaliated by launching a wave of drone attacks targeting Indian military facilities and border towns, the armed forces struck 11 vital airbases with long-range BrahMos missiles, <em>India Today</em> reported.</p>
<p>Previously, the armed for­ces had deflected questions abo­ut Indian jets being shot down by Pakistan. Addressing a press conference, Air Mar­shal A.K. Bharti, Director Gen­e­ral of Air Operations, said “losses are a part of any combat scenario”. However, he said all Indian pilots “were back”.</p>
<p>“We are in a combat scenario and losses are a part of it. Question is, have we achieved our objective? Answer is a thumping yes. At this time, I would not like to comment on that (loss of jets) as we are still in combat and give advantage to adversary. All our pilots are back home,” he claimed.</p>
<p>The chief of defence staff also claimed that the conflict never came close to a nuclear war, while underscoring that “channels of communication” with Pakistan were always open to control the situation.</p>
<p>This flies in the face of US President Donald Trump’s repeated assertion that he avoided a potential nuclear disaster by mediating the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, the news report said.</p>
<p>“I personally feel that there is a lot of space between conduct of conventional operations and the nuclear threshold,” Gen Chauhan told <em>Bloomberg</em>.</p>
<p>During the hostilities, Indian missiles and jets were able to bypass Chinese-supplied air defence systems to target Pakistani military sites, the report said.</p>

            <p><p>Thousands of Paris Saint-Germain supporters took to the streets of the French capital on Saturday to celebrate their club’s victory in the Champions League <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914402">final</a>, but clashes with the police led to the arrest of over 500 people, while two people lost their lives amid the celebrations in separate instances.</p>
<p>As per the French interior ministry, a woman riding a scooter died after she was hit by a car in the southwest of Paris, while a 17-year-old in the southwestern town of Dax was stabbed to death during the celebrations. In total, 559 people were arrested, including 491 in Paris.</p>
<p>The majority of fans celebrated peacefully, but Paris police said scuffles broke out near the city’s Champs-Elysees avenue and PSG’s Parc des Princes stadium, where 48,000 had watched the 5-0 win against Inter Milan in Munich on big screens.</p>
<p>Most of the people detained were suspected of possessing fireworks and causing disorder, Paris police said.</p>
<p><em>AFP</em> journalists saw police use a water cannon to stop a crowd reaching the Arc de Triomphe.</p>
<p>“Troublemakers on the Champs-Elysees were looking to create incidents and repeatedly came into contact with police by throwing large fireworks and other objects,” police said in a statement.</p>
<p>In a video posted by a user on X, police can be seen dispersing the fans.</p>

<p>Outside Paris, police said a car careered into fans celebrating PSG’s win in Grenoble in southeastern France, leaving four people injured, two of them seriously.</p>
<p>All of those hurt were from the same family, police said.</p>
<p>The driver handed himself in to the police and was placed under arrest.</p>
<p>A source close to the investigation said it was believed the driver had not acted intentionally.</p>
<p>In Paris, most fans showed their joy by singing and dancing in the streets, with cars sounding their horns, after their team won the biggest prize in European club football for the first time in their history.</p>

<p>One 20-year-old PSG supporter, Clement, said: “It’s so good and so deserved! We have a song that talks about our struggles and it hasn’t always been easy.</p>
<p>“But we got our faith back this year with a team without stars. They’re 11 guys who play for each other.”</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron’s office said he would host the victorious players on Sunday to congratulate them.</p>
<p>In a separate message on <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/1928917769828913536" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">X</a>, Macron hailed a “day of glory for PSG”.</p>
<p>“Bravo, we are all proud,” he wrote. “Paris is the capital of Europe tonight.”</p>
<p>Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo hailed it as a “historic” win.</p>
<p>The PSG team will hold a victory parade on the Champs-Elysees on Sunday when tens of thousands of supporters are expected to gather to get a glimpse of their returning heroes.</p>

<p>Teenager Desire Doue scored twice to inspire Paris St Germain to their first European Cup triumph with a crushing victory over Inter Milan.</p>
<p>PSG’s young team achieved what the likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe could not do in their colours as they became only the second French side to win the trophy after Olympique de Marseille in 1993.</p>
<p>“Making history was a goal from the start of last season,” the club’s manager, Luis Enrique, said.</p>
<p>“I really felt a connection with the players and the fans, a very strong connection that we saw throughout the season. We were able to handle the tension and excitement in the best possible way.”</p>
<p>Luis Enrique, visibly emotional after the final whistle and wearing a T-shirt with a tribute to his daughter Xana who died in 2019, has turned PSG from a side of superstars into a group of humble players finally playing as a team.</p></p>

            <p><p>An explosion occurred near a house on Sunday in Darra Adam Khel, district Kohat of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing two people, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 spokesperson Jawad Afridi said the blast took place at a tube well near a house in Akhorwal village. Two people died on the spot in the explosion.</p>
<p>Rescue medical and disaster teams reached the scene after receiving information about the incident. The house was completely destroyed in the explosion, the rescue official said.</p>
<p>In another incident, an under-construction building was heavily damaged when an improvised explosive device (IED), reportedly planted by unidentified terrorists, exploded in Bannu district.</p>
<p>Muhammad Usama, spokesperson for Rescue 1122, Bannu told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the explosion occurred around at 1am today when unidentified attackers reportedly detonated an IED that severely damaged the building.</p>
<p>He said the targeted structure, located in the Kaki tehsil of Bannu district, belonged to the Rescue 1122 emergency services. However, no casualties were reported.</p>
<p>Khanzala Quraishi, spokesperson for the Bannu region police, confirmed the incident and said that a police team responded promptly and launched an investigation.</p>
