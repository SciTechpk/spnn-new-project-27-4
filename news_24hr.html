            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Saturday said Pakistan was committed to building a secure and prosperous environment in the region with the help of partner nations.</p>
<p>Over the past week, Pakistan has made efforts to expand defence cooperation with other nations. Saudi Arabia’s naval chief <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926301/pakistan-and-saudi-arabia-stress-mutual-resolve-to-strengthen-defence-cooperation">met</a> with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza in Rawalpindi on Thursday, while COAS Munir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926523/china-appreciates-pakistans-role-for-regional-peace-in-meeting-with-coas-munir-ispr">met</a> Chinese senior political and military leadership in Beijing on Friday.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7368" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Islamabad hosted the Regional Chiefs of Defence Staff Conference under the theme of ‘Strengthening Bonds, Securing Peace’ today, attended by senior military officials from the United States, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>The ISPR said COAS Munir formally welcomed the distinguished defence delegations and reaffirmed Pakistan’s steadfast commitment to peace, stability and constructive engagement across the region.</p>
<p>“In an era defined by transnational threats and complex hybrid challenges, the imperative for deeper military-to-military cooperation, strategic dialogue and mutual trust is paramount. Pakistan remains fully committed to working with partner nations to build a secure and prosperous regional environment,” Field Marshal Munir was quoted as saying by the statement.</p>
<p>The ISPR said the session’s participants also discussed regional security dynamics, the evolving security environment in central and south Asia and the necessity of joint training initiatives, counter-terrorism cooperation and coordinated humanitarian responses.</p>
<p>“This landmark multilateral engagement marked a significant stride toward advancing regional security cooperation, military diplomacy and strategic dialogue among participating nations,” the statement said.</p>

<p>According to the ISPR, the conference sought to reinforce security collaborations, enhance training initiatives and exchange the best practices in counterterrorism and other defence and security programmes.</p>
<p>The military’s media wing added that the participants collectively reaffirmed their resolve to uphold peace, respect, national sovereignty and confront common security threats such as terrorism, cybersecurity and violent extremism.</p>
<p>“Participants commended Pakistan’s leadership, hospitality, and initiative in fostering such inclusive and forward-looking defence diplomacy,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p>It further added: “This strategic convergence reflects Pakistan’s enduring commitment to a secure, interconnected and cooperative region, anchored in shared security interests and regional solidarity.”</p>
<p>Pakistan’s role in regional peace was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926499">lauded</a> by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a meeting with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday.</p>
<p>“Pakistan has always played a positive role in global and regional peace,” the Foreign Office had quoted the US secretary of state as saying while the US State Department said he expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s continued willingness to play a constructive role in mediating conversations with Iran and its commitment to preserving regional stability.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Asia Cricket Council’s (ACC) Asia Cup 2025 tournament will be held in the United Arab Emirates from September 9-28, ACC President Mohsin Naqvi announced on Saturday.</p>
<p>In a post on X, he said: “I am delighted to confirm the dates for the ACC Men’s Asia Cup 2025 in UAE. The prestigious tournament will take place from September 9th to 28th. We look forward to a spectacular display of cricket! Detailed schedule will be out soon.”</p>

<p>Naqvi later announced the schedule for the tournament on X, with India and Pakistan set to clash on September 14. In addition to India, the Green Shirts will play Oman on September 12 and the UAE on September 17.</p>

<p>Pakistan, India, the UAE and Oman will make up Group A, while Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Hong Kong will make up Group B.</p>
<p>The group stage will be followed by a super four stage, in turn followed by the final on September 28.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman’s confirmation came after the tournament was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926436/asia-cup-set-to-be-held-in-uae">already expected to be hosted</a> in the UAE.</p>
<p>The tournament, originally scheduled to be hosted by India in September, was poised to be relocated due to logistical and political challenges, though India is expected to retain hosting rights.</p>
<p>The decision followed the ACC’s Annual General Meeting (AGM), <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926256/pcb-chief-naqvi-hails-positive-acc-agm-says-asia-cup-fate-to-be-announced-soon">held</a> in Dhaka on Thursday, which was attended by all 25 member countries either physically or virtually.</p>
<p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), after initially <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926154/bcci-makes-volte-face-decides-to-attend-acc-meeting-virtually">threatening</a> to boycott the meeting due to political tensions with Bangladesh, eventually joined the proceedings virtually. BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla represented the board at the meeting.</p>

<p>The Asia Cup must conclude before India begins its Test series against the West Indies later that month.</p>
<p>In May, Pakistan and India stepped back from an all-out war after a four-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military confrontation</a> — the worst in decades — in the aftermath of the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> in India-occupied Kashmir. New Delhi blamed Pakistan for the attack without evidence, launching Operation Sindoor. Islamabad has strongly denied the accusations.</p>
<p>During the conflict, India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir had called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908921">complete halt</a> to cricketing engagements with Pakistan at any forum.</p>
<p>Last week, a cricket match between Indian and Pakistani veteran players was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925419/pak-india-cricket-veteran-match-cancelled-after-indian-players-pull-out-of-game">called off</a> after Indian players, including Shikhar Dhawan, refused to play against Pakistan, citing recent “geopolitical tensions” between the two nations.</p>
<p>With both the BCCI and PCB reportedly unwilling to play on each other’s soil, a neutral venue such as the UAE was viewed as a practical compromise, similar to the hybrid model used during the 2025 ICC events and the 2023 Asia Cup.</p>
<p>The UAE, having <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1735351">previously hosted</a> the tournament in similar circumstances, emerged as the most feasible neutral venue, particularly in light of ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan.</p></p>

            <p><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday apologised to mixed martial arts player Shahzaib Rindh for the “inordinate delay” in the government’s promised financial reward and support.</p>
<p>In September, Rindh <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859830">made history</a> when he won the Karate Combat Championship (KC-49) in Singapore, becoming the first-ever world champion from Pakistan after defeating Brazil’s Bruno Roberto De Assis in the final.</p>
<p>Following the win, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1864103/president-zardari-awards-rs100m-to-karate-champion-shahzaib-rindh">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> had presented Rindh with a cheque worth Rs100 million, the <a href="https://www.samaa.tv/2087313582-mma-fighter-shahzaib-rind-rewarded-with-job-cash-after-win-against-india">Balochistan government</a> announced Rs2m as a cash prize, while a <a class="link--external" href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2498392/sardar-yaar-muhammad-rind-announces-reward-for-karate-champion-shahzaib-rind" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">former minister</a> had also promised him 25 acres of land.</p>
<p>Tarar’s apology today comes after Rindh, in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/RindhShahzaib/status/1948070734607122889" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X on Wednesday, had slammed the government for its “fake promises” of Rs5m in cash and an additional Rs80m to support his training and upcoming matches.</p>
<p>“Our politicians are corrupt,” Rindh alleged, adding that the last time he won, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had announced rewards for him.</p>
<p>“It was all [a] lie; I never got [a] penny from them. They just take pictures, fake promises and forget shame,” he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>Last year, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had issued a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-congratulates-shahzaib-rind-on-winning-karate-combat-championship/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> congratulating Rindh and <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/pmln_org/status/1789587982296510500" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">met with him</a>. However, a report on any announcement of a reward could not be found.</p>
<p>Tarar responded to Rindh’s criticism today, apologising for the delay in the promised support.</p>
<p>“There seems to be some miscommunication. We sincerely apologise for this unjustified delay,” the minister <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/TararAttaullah/status/1948967159796744580" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on X.</p>
<p>“Sportsmen like you are our real heroes and we value your achievements. You have brought great honour to the country and made us all proud.”</p>
<p>He added: “The prime minister has taken a serious notice of this inordinate delay and rest assured, it will be sorted out immediately inshallah.</p>
<p>“The PM has further instructed that such mistakes must never happen in the future. We regret this unjustified delay and the inconvenience caused,” the minister said.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>In response, Rindh welcomed the “acknowledgement”, saying: “I truly appreciate the prime minister’s attention to this matter and his commitment to supporting athletes like myself.</p>
<p>“Representing Pakistan on the world stage is an honour, and I will always give my all for our country. Inshallah, with your support, we can continue to uplift and inspire the next generation of champions,” he added, saying he looked forward to the issue’s resolution soon.</p>

<p>In April last year, Rindh had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1829004">decried</a> the government’s lack of support, saying it was its “bad luck” that it did not support the country’s heroes after his 2-1 victory over India at Dubai’s Karate Combat 45 event.</p></p>
