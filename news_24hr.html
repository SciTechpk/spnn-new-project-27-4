            <p><p>A high-level delegation led by PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has stressed the need for dialogue with India in a series of meetings with US Congress members in Washington, state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/05-06-2025/multiparty-delegation-holds-series-of-meetings-with-us-congressmen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Pakis­tan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">launched</a> a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence there. As part of its global outreach, the team will also visit London and Brussels.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow">delegation</a> comprises former foreign ministers Bilawal, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.</p>
<p>During Wednesday’s discussions at Capitol Hill, the delegation underscored the urgency of dialogue on the Kashmir issue, noting it was an “unfinished agenda of the United Nations”.</p>
<p>It stressed the imperative of respect for international law, UN Security Council resolutions and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), <em>Radio Pakistan</em> added.</p>
<p>Bilawal emphasised that sustainable peace in South Asia hinged on dialogue, restraint and a just resolution of the Kashmir dispute, rather than “unilateralism or intimidation”.</p>
<p>He briefed members of Congress on India’s recent acts of unprovoked aggression, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910848">targeting of civilians</a>, as well as the “deeply concerning” and unilateral <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">suspension</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>.</p>
<p>Bilawal appreciated the US, particularly “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915520/pakistan-wants-trump-to-arrange-talks-with-india">President Donald Trump</a>, for his constructive role in helping <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">de-escalate tensions</a> and supporting efforts towards a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>”, according to the report.</p>
<p>The delegation reiterated Pakistan’s principled stance on regional peace, counterterrorism efforts and recent Indian aggression, reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment “to peace, responsible conduct, and rejection of baseless allegations”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, members of the Congress welcomed the Pakistani delegation, urging “both countries to demonstrate restraint and prioritise regional peace and stability”, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> stated.</p>
<p>They reiterated the US support for the people of Pakistan and its commitment to aiding the country’s economic progress.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Bilawal <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/BBhuttoZardari/status/1930387061397135549" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted on X</a> that his team met with Congressmen Jack Bergman and Tom Suozzi, who co-chair the Congressional Pakistan Caucus, along with Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar and Republican Party’s Ryan Keith Zinke.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the Pakistani delegation underscored that enduring regional peace rested on “principled dialogue, mutual restraint, and a just settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, not unilateralism and coercion”.</p>

<p>Bergman and Suozzi were among a group of lawmakers who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903968">visited Pakistan</a> in April and met with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir, along with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.</p>
<p>Bergman has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892390#:~:text=Congressman%20Jack%20Bergman%20also%20voiced%20support%20for%20the%20movement">repeatedly</a> voiced <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906059/us-congressman-bergman-reaffirms-call-for-imrans-release">support</a> for former prime minister Imran Khan, calling for his release.</p>

The PPP chairman said they discussed “Pakistan’s deep concerns over India’s increasingly belligerent posture and its refusal to engage, whether through dialogue, joint investigation, or third-party facilitation”.</p>

<p>“Shared Pakistan’s concerns over the new abnormal imposed by Mr. Modi, where every incident by nameless actors triggers unprovoked aggression, risking war between two nuclear-armed neighbours,” Bilawal said on X.</p>
<p>Bilawal further met with Republican Senator <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/BBhuttoZardari/status/1930438391453397234" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jim Banks</a> for a “candid discussion” on regional peace and security […] and appreciated the “critical peacemaker role played by President Trump in facilitating the ceasefire understanding, intended as a pathway to broader, sustained peace and dialogue”.</p>
<p>“Reiterated that there is no military solution to our challenges. Only diplomacy and dialogue can deliver lasting peace in South Asia,” the ex-foreign minister added.</p>

<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915520/pakistan-wants-trump-to-arrange-talks-with-india">said</a> the recent four-day conflict had revealed the “Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909771/dg-ispr-says-india-has-no-evidence-for-pahalgam-incident-or-alleged-attacks-in-last-48-hours">incident</a> was a false-flag operation”, and credited Trump for playing a decisive role in ensuring a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>Addressing an event at the US Embassy in Islamabad marking the 249th anniversary of American independence, the premier said Trump had shown beyond any doubt that “he is a man for peace … and beneficial business deals”.</p>
<p>He added, “President Trump is a man against escalation and a man against cold and hot war.”</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz said Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">downed</a> six Indian fighter jets in self-defence after Indian aggression on May 6-7 resulted in the deaths of 33 Pakistani civilians.</p>
<p>“We responded with restraint and patience,” he said. “Our offer for an impartial international probe into the Pahalgam incident was met with aggression instead.”</p>
<p>He said that India “should have come out with solid evidence and convinced the world about the occurrence of the incident”.</p></p>

            <p><p>A Karachi resident who was assaulted in the Defence Housing Authority earlier this week says he has forgiven the suspect and does not want to take the case to court, even as a judge rejected the suspect’s bail in a separate hearing.</p>
<p>On Monday, Karachi police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914964">arrested</a> a main suspect along with two of his employees over charges of beating a citizen named Dheeraj. The suspect, identified as Salman Farooqi, was arrested from DHA and his vehicle was impounded.</p>
<p>Farooqi, who was travelling in a luxury car, allegedly assaulted a motorcyclist accompanied by a woman on the Khayaban-i-Ittehad Road following a minor accident.</p>
<p>A judicial magistrate on Tuesday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915280/two-remanded-in-assault-case">remanded</a> Farooqi and his guard, Owais Hashmi in police custody in the case. They were produced in court today by the police following the completion of their two-day remand.</p>
<p>Today, Dheeraj appeared in court and identified the suspect.</p>
<p>“I was not aware that the court had summoned me,” he said. “The lawyer told me today, so I appeared.”</p>
<p>The judicial magistrate asked Dheeraj whether he was facing any sort of pressure.</p>
<p>“It was my fault, my bike hit his car,” Dheeraj told the court.</p>
<p>“I do not want to file a case. I forgive the suspect,” he said, adding  “Whatever the court decides, I will have no objection.”</p>
<p>Dheeraj filed a no objection certificate (NOC). However, the court noted that the affidavit appeared to have been submitted under undue influence or coercion.</p>
<p>Public Prosecutor Irfana Qadri told the court that a case had been registered against the suspect for threatening and humiliating a woman, identified as Dheeraj’s sister Kalpana.</p>
<p>“These are non-bailable charges,” Qadri said. The court reserved its verdict after the lawyers’ arguments.</p>
<p>In a separate hearing, however, Additional District and Sessions Judge Abdul Zahoor Chandio rejected the bail application filed by Farooqi and Hashmi.</p>
<p>A case had been registered against the suspects at the Gizri police station on the complaint of an eyewitness citizen.</p></p>

            <p><p>Muslim pilgrims prayed atop Mount Arafat on Thursday during the high point of the annual Haj pilgrimage, as Saudi officials called on participants to refrain from being outside during the hottest hours of the day.</p>
<p>Thousands of pilgrims began to gather before dawn around the hill and the surrounding plain where Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is believed to have given his last sermon.</p>
<p>While some arrived early to take advantage of the relatively cool morning, carrying colourful umbrellas, many pilgrims will remain for hours of prayers and Holy Quran recitals until the evening in the most arduous portion of Haj.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>After sunset, they will head to Muzdalifah, halfway between Arafat and the sprawling tent city of Mina, where they will gather pebbles so they can perform the symbolic “stoning of the devil”.</p>
<p>“This is something that I used to see every year on the TV screen during Haj and I always thought: ‘I wish I could be here’,” said 33-year-old Ali from Pakistan, one of 1.5 million pilgrims who had arrived in Saudi Arabia for the pilgrimage.</p>
<p>“I’ve been trying to get here… for the past 3 years,” he added as he gazed at the mount. “I feel very blessed.”</p>
<p>Hundreds of pilgrims dressed in white dotted the mount itself, with many more at its foot praying or taking pictures.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Saudi authorities called on pilgrims to stay inside their tents between 10am and 4pm (12pm and 6pm PKT) and on Thursday, when the desert sun is at its harshest.</p>
<p>Fans spraying mist and providing cool air were dispersed at the foot of the mount.</p>

<p>Temperatures this year have already exceeded 40 degrees Celsius as one of the world’s largest annual religious gatherings, bringing together devotees from around the globe, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915010">kicked off</a> earlier this week.</p>
<p>Officials have beefed up heat mitigation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915198/saudi-readies-for-worst-case-scenario-in-sweltering-haj">efforts</a>, aiming to avoid a repeat of last year’s Haj, which saw 1,301 pilgrims <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1840835">die</a> as temperatures reached 51.8C.</p>
<p>“I came here early to [avoid] the sun and later I will pray inside my tent,” said 54-year-old Adel Ismail, from Syria.</p>
<p>To make this year’s pilgrimage safer, authorities have expanded infrastructure, deployed thousands of extra personnel and relied on an arsenal of high-tech tools to help better manage crowds.</p>
<p>Authorities have mobilised more than 40 government agencies and 250,000 officials, doubling their efforts against heat-related illness following the lethal heatwave of 2024.</p>
<p>Shaded areas have been expanded by 50,000 square metres, thousands more medics will be on standby, and more than 400 cooling units will be deployed, the Haj minister has told <em>AFP.</em></p>

<p>Through tears of joy, Iman Abdel Khaleq said she had wanted to perform Haj for 10 years and was overwhelmed with emotion as she arrived at Arafat.</p>
<p>“It’s a big dream for me that I had almost given up hope of realising,” the woman in her fifties told <em>AFP</em> from the foot of the mount.</p>
<p>Authorities said a majority of the deaths in 2024 were among unregistered pilgrims who lacked access to amenities like air-conditioned tents and buses.</p>
<p>This year, they have also cracked down on unregistered pilgrims looking to sneak into Makkah, relying on frequent raids, drone surveillance and a barrage of text alerts.</p>
<p>Haj permits are allocated to countries on a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870331">quota</a> basis and distributed to individuals by a lottery.</p>
<p>But even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs prompt many to attempt Haj without a permit, even though they risk arrest and deportation if caught.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia earns billions of dollars a year from Haj, and Umrah, which is undertaken at other times of the year.</p></p>
