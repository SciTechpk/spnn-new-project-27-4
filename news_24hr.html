            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910733/11-soldiers-martyred-78-wounded-while-defending-pakistan-in-indian-attack-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>11 soldiers martyred, 78 wounded while defending Pakistan in Indian attack: ISPR</strong></a>
            <p><p>At least 11 soldiers were martyred and 78 wounded while defending Pakistan against India’s “unprovoked and reprehensible dastardly attacks” during the recent escalation between the neighbours, said the military’s media wing in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan under the banner of Operation Sindoor, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>On Saturday, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">announced</a> that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), 40 civilians — including seven women and 15 children — lost their lives in the Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.</p>
<p>The martyrs from the Pakistan Army include Naik Abdul Rehman, Lance Naik Dilawar Khan, Lance Naik Ikramullah, Naik Waqar Khalid, Sepoy Muhammad Adeel Akbar and Sepoy Nisar, as per the statement.</p>
<p>The martyrs from the Pakistan Air Force include Squadron Leader Usman Yousuf, Chief Technician Aurangzeb, Senior Technician Najeeb, Corporal Technician Farooq, and Senior Technician Mubashir.</p>
<p>“Pakistan Armed Forces mounted a resolute response under the banner of Marka-i-Haq, delivering precise and notch-up retributive strikes through Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”, stated the ISPR in its statement.</p>
<p>“Their noble sacrifice of martyrs is an enduring symbol of courage, devotion, and unwavering patriotism — etched forever in the nation’s memory,” the statement said. “Let there be no ambiguity: any attempt to challenge Pakistan’s sovereignty or territorial integrity, ever again, shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response.”</p>
<p>Paying tribute to the martyred civilians and military personnel, the ISPR offered heartfelt prayers for the recovery of the injured.</p>
<p>“Let there be no ambiguity: any attempt to challenge Pakistan’s sovereignty or territorial integrity, ever again, shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response,” the statement read while reaffirming that the nation “remains resolute in the face of aggression.”</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz Sharif has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910450/nation-celebrates-befitting-response-to-aggression">announced</a> that Youm-e-Marka-i-Haq will be observed every year on May 10 on the “magnificent success” of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. Friday, May 16, 2025, will be observed as a day to pay tribute to the armed forces for achieving magnificent success on the defence front and to bow before God in gratitude, he added.</p></p>

            <p><p>Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Tuesday announced that the remaining eight matches of the HBL Pakistan Super League (PSL) — postponed due to the conflict with India — would resume from May 17, with the final scheduled for May 25.</p>
<p>The PSL was first <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909572">moved</a> to the UAE and subsequently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909898">postponed</a> after an Indian drone crashed close to the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium last week.</p>
<p>In a post on X today, Naqvi stated that the league will pick up from where it left. “Let the aura take over as we unite and celebrate the spirit of cricket,” he wrote.</p>

<p>Earlier, it was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910621/psl-resumption-hinges-on-foreign-players-return">reported</a> that the six PSL franchises have reached out to players, who were flown from the country on a charter flight over the weekend as the cross-border skirmishes with India intensified last week, to return after a ceasefire agreement was reached.</p>
<p>“The franchises are in negotiations with their foreign players regarding the tentative dates of May 17 to 25 with Raw­a­lpindi proposed to be the ve­nue for the remaining matc­hes,” sour­ces told <em>Dawn</em> on Monday.</p>
<p>“As soon as the franchises confirm the availability of the foreign players, the PCB will announce the schedule of the remaining matches after getting the approval from chairman Mohsin Naqvi,” sources added.</p>
<p>With no international cricket during the proposed window, the PCB remains hopeful that the foreign players will return.</p>
<p>However, reports suggested that Australian players might not be open to the idea of returning to Pakistan or India, which also saw its T20 tournament — the Indian Premier League — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909693/ipl-cricket-tournament-suspended-over-india-pakistan-tensions-indian-media">suspended</a> due to the escalating hostilities.</p>
<p>While most Australian players in both countries left for home, former Australia batter Ricky Ponting — now coach of IPL side Punjab Kings — deboarded his flight home following the ceasefire agreement.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has announced the election for the vacant general seat from Punjab in Senate on May 29.</p>
<p>The seat fell vacant following the demise of Senator Professor Sajid Mir on May 3, 2025, <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>According to a notification by the provincial election commissioner, the nomination papers may be filed on May 14 and 15 for the election that will be held at the Punjab Assembly. The names of the nominated candidates will be published on May 16.</p>
<p>The scrutiny of the nomination papers will be held on May 17 while appeals against their acceptance or rejection will be filed on May 20. The appeals will be disposed of on May 22.</p>
<p>The revised list of candidates will be published on May 23, while the candidature may be withdrawn by May 24. The polling will be held at the Punjab Assembly chambers between 9am to 4pm.</p>
<p>The nomination papers may be received from the Punjab ECP office on 10-Court Street in Lahore during the office hours.</p>
<p>Notable religious and political leader Senator Prof Sajid Mir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908184/pml-n-senator-sajid-mir-passes-away-at-86-after-heart-attack">passed away</a> at the age of 86 after a heart attack. Mir, the head of Jamiat Ahle Hadith Pakistan, belonged to a suburban area of Punjab’s Sialkot.</p>
<p>Mir was elected as a PML-N senator in 2021, which was his fifth time contesting the Senate election on the party’s ticket. He had also served as a senator from March 2009 to March 2015.</p>
<p>On May 6, PPP’s Syed Waqar Mehdi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908829">won</a> the by-election held for the vacant general seat of the Senate from the province of Sindh in Karachi.</p>
<p>The ruling PPP and the opposition MQM-P had nominated Waqar Mehdi and Nighat Mirza, respectively. The PTI did not field any candidate and announced boycotting the polling process as well.</p>
<p>In the by-election held at the Sindh Assembly, Mehdi secured 111 votes, while MQM-P’s Nighat Mirza received 36, and two were rejected, said the returning officer, Provincial Election Commissioner Sindh Ejaz Anwar Chauhan. A total of 149 votes were cast during the scheduled polling time.</p>
<p>The general Senate seat fell vacant after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902949/senior-ppp-leader-senator-taj-haider-passes-away-after-battling-cancer">death</a> of PPP’s Senator Taj Haider on April 8 in Karachi. He was elected a senator on a PPP ticket from a Senate general seat in Sindh in March 2021 for a period of six years.</p></p>
