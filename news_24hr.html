            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924185/one-dead-3-injured-as-heavy-rain-lashes-hyderabad' target='_blank'><strong>One dead, 3 injured as heavy rain lashes Hyderabad</strong></a>
            <p><p>A man was killed and three others were injured when the roof of a shop collapsed in Hyderabad’s Timber Market area as heavy rain caused urban flooding and brought civic life to a halt in the city on Monday, according to officials.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1852031#:~:text=Monsoon%20rains%20across%20the%20region%20from%20June%20to%20September%20offer%20respite%20from%20the%20summer%20heat%20and%20are%20crucial%20to%20replenishing%20water%20supplies.%20They%20are%20also%20vital%20for%20agriculture%2C%20and%20therefore%20the%20livelihoods%20of%20millions%20of%20farmers%20and%20food%20security%20for%20South%20Asia%E2%80%99s%20nearly%20two%20billion%20people.">fall across</a> the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. They are also vital for agriculture, and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security for South Asia’s nearly two billion people.</p>
<p>Market Police Station House Officer Munir Abbasi told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “A person from Moro died and three others were injured when the roof of a shop collapsed in the Timber Market area.”</p>
<p>A dust storm preceded rain in the city, Latifabad and Qasimabad. The Met Office recorded the speed of rainfall at 42 nautical miles per hour with 94 millimetres of rainfall in the city, while 56mm was recorded in Latifabad. However, the waterlogging situation remained equally bad in both areas, regardless of the different volumes of rainfall being recorded.</p>
<p>The inundation of major roads was worsened for the Hyderabad Water and Sewerage Corporation (HW&amp;SC) due to a massive power breakdown.</p>
<p>Rainfall began at around 4:20pm and continued till 6pm with moderate to high speed. People were seen wading through knee-deep rainwater on roads and streets in different areas while civic and district administration officials seemed to be struggling to cope with the situation.</p>
<p>District administration and civic bodies representatives were visiting various pumping stations to deal with the situation and ensure drainage of rainwater from the rain-affected areas, including the market’s roads and localities.</p>
<p>Met Office spokesperson Anjum Nazir Zaighum said that the rain was torrential in nature. There is a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924137/at-least-6-die-as-heavy-rains-continue-to-wreak-havoc-across-kp#:~:text=Heavy%20rain%20predicted%20till%20July%2017%20countrywide%3A%20PMD">forecast</a> of rain across Sindh for the next couple of days as well.</p>
<p>Accumulation of rainwater led to traffic gridlock on main roads, including the Hyderabad-Latifabad flyover, and the underpass connecting the city with Latifabad remained completely closed due to stagnant rainwater there.</p>
<p>Shah Makki Road remained flooded as well. Thus, most vehicular traffic was seen on the Latifabad flyover. A long queue of vehicles could be seen up to Cantonment graveyard road.</p>
<p>The city remained without power as the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) reported damage to its infrastructure. According to a statement from Hesco’s spokesman, four grid stations of the 132kV transmission system of the power utility were badly hit as towers connected with them fell due to rainfall.</p>
<p>It said the grid stations were connected with a 220kV circuit and that out of 152 feeders, only 12 were unaffected by the rain, while the remaining 140 tripped. The spokesman said that 54 were later re-energised, and staff were inspecting others to bring them online again.</p>
<p>A huge tree fell on the transmission line at Fatima Jinnah Road, affecting the power supply. Major pumping stations of HW&amp;SC, including Tulsi Das, which were dependent on Hesco’s system, lost power.</p>
<p>Hyderabad Mayor Kashif Shoro blamed Hesco’s power failure for the delay in the drainage of rainwater, adding that only 30 per cent of sewerage facilities were now energised, but 70pc remained offline.</p>
<p>“I hope all entire rainwater will be drained out by tonight,” he said. He added that some pumping stations had received electricity, but faults were again reported, due to which they were shut down for repair. He said that Tulsi Das, Aga Khan, Poly and LD1 pumping stations were major facilities that deal with the drainage of rainwater.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#sindh-cm-takes-immediate-action-on-flooding" id="sindh-cm-takes-immediate-action-on-flooding" title="Permalink"></a>Sindh CM takes immediate action on flooding</h2>
<p>Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah closely monitored the situation in Hyderabad following heavy rains that caused flooding in several areas, according to a press release from the CM’s Office.</p>
<p>He contacted the mayor to receive a detailed briefing on drainage efforts and directed urgent measures to expedite water removal. Due to power outages caused by Hesco feeder trips, pumping stations were temporarily shut down, hindering drainage operations.</p>
<p>The chief minister instructed Energy Minister Nasir Shah to coordinate with Hesco to restore electricity to the pumping stations immediately.</p>
<p>CM Murad emphasised the importance of restoring all major roads to ease public difficulties and called for all relevant departments, including district administrations, municipal bodies, the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board, traffic police and rescue services, to work in close coordination.</p>
<p>He stressed that public safety remained the government’s top priority and warned that any negligence would not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Additional precautionary steps were ordered, including keeping dewatering pumps and staff on alert in low-lying areas, placing warning boards near electrical hazards, maintaining 24-hour control rooms and ensuring timely public information through media channels.</p>
<p>The chief minister also appealed to citizens to avoid unnecessary travel during the rains and cooperate with authorities to mitigate risks.</p>
<p>“Sindh’s government continues to take all possible measures to minimise disruption caused by the monsoon rains and safeguard the lives and property of its residents,” the press release said.</p></p>

            <p><p>PTI leader Sayed Zulfikar Bukhari, a former aide to ex-premier Imran Khan, is set to offer testimony on “political repression” in Pakistan before the United States Congress’ Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, it emerged on Monday.</p>
<p>According to its <a class="link--external" href="https://humanrightscommission.house.gov/about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>, the bipartisan commission was established in 2008 and is charged with promoting, defending and advocating for international human rights as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant human rights instruments.</p>
<p>The commission’s <a class="link--external" href="https://humanrightscommission.house.gov/events/hearings/pakistan-ongoing-political-repression" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hearing notice</a> states that the session will take place on Tuesday (tomorrow) at 3:30pm (12:30am PKT on Wednesday) and will “examine the government of Pakistan’s persecution of opposition political figures and journalists, and its actions to control media communications and prevent free and fair elections in Pakistan”. The session is open to the public and the media.</p>
<p>“Many date the current phase of repression in Pakistan to 2022, when, with the involvement of the Pakistan military, popular Prime Minister Imran Khan was ousted, and soon after, arrested, convicted of corruption and imprisoned,” the notice read.</p>
<p>“Parliamentary elections in February 2024 were, according to the US State Department, marked by ‘undue restrictions on freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly’, as well as ‘electoral violence, and restrictions on the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms’,” it added.</p>

<p>The commission provided a list of witnesses who would provide testimony during Tuesday’s hearing. Besides Bukhari, the list includes Amnesty International’s Advocacy Director for Europe and Central Asia, Ben Linden; Perseus Strategies Managing Director Jared Genser; and Afghanistan Impact Network founder Sadiq Amini.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=414866" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> from the commission’s co-chairman, Republican Congressman Christopher Smith, who will chair the session, said the meeting would “discuss the government of Pakistan’s ongoing political repression, the US response, and offer recommendations for Congress”.</p>
<p>Bukhari announced that he would be testifying before the commission in a post on X dated July 9, expressing gratitude to the commission’s co-chairs, Democratic Congressman James McGovern and Smith, for the opportunity to testify.</p>
<p>“I will be highlighting the arbitrary detention of Imran Khan, his wife, and other political prisoners, as well as the erosion of democracy, the undermining of the rule of law, and escalating crackdowns on freedom of expression in Pakistan,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Genser replied to Bukhari’s post, writing, “I am honoured and grateful to be able to testify alongside you before the [Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission] on Pakistan, human rights and the situation of Imran Khan and all political prisoners being held by the current regime.”</p>

<p>Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831/legal-woes-deepen-as-imran-and-bushra-convicted-in-ps190m-al-qadir-trust-case">£190 million corruption case</a> and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9, 2023, protests.</p>
<p>In May, Freedom Network’s annual <em>Freedom of Expression and Media Freedom Report</em> for 2025 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907652">said</a> Pakistan’s media is standing at a crossroads amid an existential threat and increased restrictive environment, deteriorating safety and job security, significant challenges to professional integrity of media and its practitioners.</p>
<p>Titled ‘Free speech and public interest journalism under siege’, the report finds that the existential crisis was triggered by amendments to Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) in January 2025 that now “makes it easier” for authorities to arrest, fine and imprison journalists and dissidents — both offline and online — besides other challenges.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), the country’s leading human rights watchdog, has also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921746">expressed deep concern</a> over the steadily shrinking space for human rights advocacy in the country.</p>
<p>In a statement issued earlier this month, the HRCP said it had faced a series of arbitrary, illegal, and unjustified actions over the past few months, which have impeded the organisation’s ability to carry out its mandate.</p></p>

            <p><p>At least six people have died, including four children, while one person was injured over the last 24 hours in rain-related incidents as heavy downpours continue to lash parts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said on Monday.</p>
<p>Last week, PDMA alerted the district administrations across KP to the possibility of floods due to a new <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923519">spell</a> of torrential rains from July 11 to 17. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have wreaked havoc in the province in June and are set to continue.</p>
<p>Pakistan experiences Monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>In Bajaur, a woman died after the boundary wall of her house collapsed due to heavy rain and gusty winds, according to the PDMA report, while in Khyber district, two children were swept away in a flash flood after heavy rains.</p>
<p>Per the report, Rescue 1122 officials found the body of one of the children, adding that efforts were underway to find the other missing child. Another child — who was injured after being struck by lightning  — was taken to the hospital and is now in a stable condition.</p>
<p>In Kohat, a man died after the roof of his house caved in, while two children. aged seven and 12,  died as a result of a wall collapse in Malakand.</p>
