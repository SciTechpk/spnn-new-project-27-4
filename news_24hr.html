            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915162/bilawal-presses-un-to-push-india-for-comprehensive-dialogue-to-address-issues-achieve-peace' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal presses UN to push India for comprehensive dialogue to address issues, achieve peace</strong></a>
            <p><p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Tuesday urged the United Nations and the International community to push India towards a comprehensive dialogue with Pakistan, where the two countries could address their outstanding issues and achieve peace in the wake of their recent military <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909135/india-shifted-entire-blame-of-pahalgam-attack-on-pakistan-without-evidence-pm">conflict</a> in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>Bilawal was addressing a press conference at the UN Headquarters in New York on recent regional developments after the military conflict.</p>
<p>The address came amid the visit of a high-level team — consisting of three former foreign ministers, two former foreign sec­­retaries, two former ambassadors to the US, and a serving federal minister —  for consultations at the United Nations. The team arrived in New York on Sunday.</p>
<p>Ex-FMs Bilawal, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; and Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua are members of the delegation.</p>
<p>Bilawal said Pakistan’s position was to hold a “comprehensive dialogue” with India that would include the issue of terrorism as well. Bilawal said Pakistan was the country where the “single largest number of terrorist attacks” occurred and was also the country with the single largest number of victims of terrorism.</p>
<p>Bilawal said the Pakistani delegation was concluding its visit to New York and the UN and had appealed to the international community to assist the country in its pursuit of peace. “Just as the international community played its role in encouraging India to agree to a ceasefire, it should also encourage to engage in a comprehensive dialogue with Pakistan so that we can address our issues and achieve peace,” he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Bilawal said he wanted to use the opportunity to share Pakistan’s perspective on the recent military conflict with India in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, as well as the way forward.</p>
<p>Reiterating the “illegal strikes” launched by India as part of its ‘Operation Sindoor’ “in violation of the UN Charter, international law”, Bilawal said the attacks had targeted civilian infrastructure, places of worship, energy infrastructure and innocent women and children.</p>
<p>He said India had used the April 22 terrorist attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam as a premise for the strikes.</p>
<p>“We expressed our sympathy with the victims of terrorism and Pakistan has consistently and unequivocally condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” he said, adding that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had immediately expressed Pakistan’s willingness to India and the global community to be part of any impartial international investigation.</p>
<p>“We did so because we were confident our hands were clean and we had nothing to do with this terrorist attack. The Indian government refused Pakistan’s offer and chose instead to conduct their illegal strikes.</p>
<p>“Pakistan only ever acted in self-defence, we never initiated any violence against India,” Bilawal said, adding that the Pakistani military had responded with precision the night of the first Indian attack and “only targeted and downed six planes because we believed those were the ones to release their load on Pakistan”.</p>
<p>He said India subsequently launched missile strikes into Pakistan in the next two days and the latter “responded in kind”. “Due to the intervention of the international community, and I’d like here to particularly mention the role of US President Donald Trump and his team led by Secretary of State [Marco] Rubio, we did manage to achieve a ceasefire,” Bilawal added.</p>
<p>He said the above was a “welcome first step” but was “only a first step”. “I must emphasise that the global community today is less safe post this ceasefire and conflict than we were before simply because the threshold for full-blown military conflict between two nuclear-armed states has come down, it has not gone up,” the former FM added.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen during the course of this conflict how quickly the escalation ladder between our two countries rose and the concern is that the next time there is such an incident, there may not be time for the international community to intervene before things get alot worse. That is why it is absolutely important for Pakistan and the international community to continue to pursue dialogue and diplomacy as the only viable path to peace.”</p>
<p>“The military and political leadership of Pakistan and the country are not the caricature that India would like to paint of us,” he said, adding that politicians had fought terrorists on the frontline and paid a heavy cost while the military had confronted them on the battlefield and earned their honours and promotions.</p>
<p>He also pointed out that the Financial Action Task Force — the international watchdog against money laundering and financing of terrorism — had endorsed Pakistan’s taking measures to combat terror financing.</p>
<p>“It’s become too easy for wannabe hegemons to use the wolf whistle of terrorism to justify illegal actions and violent actions in Muslim countries and communities,” Bilawal said, adding that terrorism could not be confronted by India while using it as a political tool to demonise Muslims within, in occupied Kashmir and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Despite that, he said Pakistan would still like to cooperate with India in combatting terrorism and the fate of the region’s people could not be left in the hands of non-state actors and terrorists for them to decide that two nuclear-armed powers go to war.</p>
<p>“This is the new normal or abnormal that the Indian government is trying to impose on the region that if there is a terrorist attack anywhere in India or occupied Kashmir, it means war with Pakistan.”</p>
<p>Bilawal said a reciprocal attitude would mean war with India and such a situation was untenable, adding that nuclear-armed countries could not go without dispute resolution mechanisms.</p>
<p>He said there should be a mechanism in which Pakistan and India could bring any complaints to a mutually agreed forum where both worked together to identify, track and deliver justice to terrorists.</p>
<p>“In addition to this, there is a root cause [which] in this case in occupied Kashmir is the unresolved agenda of Kashmir before the UN Security Council” and the promises made by the international community and India to Kashmiris.</p>
<p>“If we continue to ignore this issue and allow that wound to fester, there will forever be a bone of contention between India and Pakistan.”</p>
<p>In addition, he said the most recent front opened by India was the weaponisation of water, adding that the violation of the Indus Waters Treaty must be condemned across the board and the precedent must not be allowed to be set.</p>
<p>He said the threat to cut Pakistan’s water supply was a violation of the UN Charter and any action on it would be seen as an act of war by Pakistan.</p>
<p>The PPP chairman pointed out that India positioned itself as a net security provider, and yet “India’s actions have shown as a result of this conflict that they’re a source of insecurity, not a source of security for the region.</p>
<p>“The true net security provider for our region and beyond will be peace between India and Pakistan.”</p>

<p>Earlier, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914959">team</a> met officials from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) officials to brief them on Pakistan’s stance.</p>
<p>Bilawal, while addressing the OIC Permanent Representatives, “categorically rejected India’s attempt to link Pakistan to the Pahalgam incident without any credible investigation or evidence”, according to a press release by Pakistan’s Mission to the UN.</p>
<p>He highlighted that the blame was “used as a pretext for unlawful military actions, including cross-border strikes, which targeted civilians and civilian infrastructure”.</p>
<p>During his meeting with the OIC envoys, PPP chairman expressed concern at India’s move to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, which Pakistan considered “a blatant act of weaponising water and a violation of international and treaty obligations”.</p>
<p>“He [Bilawal] made it plainly clear that we cannot allow this to become a new normal,” the statement read.</p>
<p>It continued that the PPP chairman stressed that “due to India’s belligerent aggression, the world has become a less safe place, with real and present implications for peace and security in South Asia”.</p>
<p>The former foreign minister went on to thank the OIC for its efforts and role aimed at mediation to de-escalate tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, highlighting that the “only path to peace is dialogue, engagement and diplomacy”.</p>
<p>“He [Bilawal] reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to peace, restraint, and diplomacy, and called for the restoration of the Indus Waters Treaty, full respect for the ceasefire, and the resumption of a comprehensive dialogue with India, with the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute at its core,” the statement read.</p>

<p>Addressing a representative jirga in Peshawar, he said the committee would deliberate on all demands and issues raised by the KP chief minister.</p>
<p>He added that the committee would sit together with tribal elders and the KP governor and chief minister to formulate recommendations in this regard, further saying that the federal government would give serious attention to the recommendations to benefit the province’s valiant people.</p>

<p>Shehbaz affirmed the immense sacrifices rendered by the people of KP in the fight against terrorism and said the federal government would stand by the province until the complete eradication of the menace.</p>
<p>The prime minister said that KP had received Rs700 billion since 2010 under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award as its one per cent share allocated for anti-terrorism efforts.</p>
<p>These funds were released to strengthen the provincial police force, develop the Counter-Terrorism Department and enhance the capacity of law enforcement agencies, he added.</p>
<p>“The decision to allocate 1pc of the NFC Award for KP, agreed by all provinces, was just and appropriate decision, as KP has remained the frontline province in the war against terrorism,” he said.</p>
<p>Highlighting the province’s unwavering commitment and support to Pakistan, the prime minister said that KP’s people had voted in favour of the country during the referendum and had stood by the armed forces through all challenges.</p>
<p>“The sacrifices of KP’s people who laid down their lives and sustained injuries for the defence of Pakistan are deeply revered and will be remembered in golden words,” he added.</p>

<p>Referring to the Army Public School attack on December 16, 2014, the prime minister paid tribute to the students and teachers who lost their lives in the brutal incident.</p>

<p>Speaking on recent security developments, PM Shehbaz said Pakistan had given a strong response to last month’s unprovoked Indian aggression under the leadership of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.</p>
<p>He reiterated that Pakistan’s decisive retaliation had frustrated India’s nefarious plans, adding that “India will never forget this decisive response of Pakistan.”</p>
<p>The prime minister further shared that during recent visits to Turkiye, Iran, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan, leaders of these countries expressed joy over Pakistan’s “historic victory” against India.</p>

<p>He said that Indian Prime Minister Modi was left “frustrated and in a state of panic” after the defeat.</p>
<p>Reaffirming Pakistan’s rights under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, the prime minister asserted that India could not deprive Pakistan of its rightful share of water and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-after-26-tourists-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-attack">suspend</a> the treaty unilaterally.</p>
<p>He emphasised the need to expand existing water storage capacity and accelerate work on major dam projects, including Diamer Bhasha and Dasu dams.</p>
<p>Calling for national unity in the face of external threats, PM Shehbaz appreciated the people of KP for offering special prayers for the country’s success against India.</p>
<p>The jirga was attended by KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, COAS Munir, federal and provincial ministers, senators, parliamentarians, the Peshawar corps commander and the provincial chief secretary and police chief.</p></p>

            <p><p>Police on Tuesday launched raids to arrest eight suspects who allegedly abducted a couple in Hafizabad and subjected them to physical and sexual assault.</p>
<p>The first information report (FIR) was filed by the husband today at the Kasoki Police Station under Sections 148 (Rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (Unlawful assembly), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354-A (assault or use of criminal force to woman and stripping her of her clothes ), 355 (causing hurt by dangerous means), 365 (kidnapping), 375-A (rape), 382 (theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint to commit the theft), 496A (enticing away a woman) and 506B (criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p>
<p>The FIR said the incident occurred on April 25 around 7pm when the complainant and his wife were on a motorcycle when they stopped for a bit. As the wife got off the motorcycle, a man came towards them who verbally abused and hit her, it stated.</p>
<p>A group of armed men later arrived and took the couple to a secluded place near a graveyard. The FIR detailed how the couple were subjected to physical violence, sexual assault, and robbery.</p>
<p>The complainant said in the FIR, “We were both tied up and they made me lie down on the ground,” adding that his wife was “gang-raped despite me repeatedly pleading with the suspects to stop”.</p>
<p>The suspects took away two mobile phones, two tola of gold and Rs2,500 in cash, the FIR added.</p>
<p>It further said, “The suspects forced the couple to have sexual intercourse at gunpoint,” adding that they filmed it and blackmailed the victims.</p>
<p>The FIR also said, “We delayed reporting the incident because the suspects had threatened us, saying that if we took legal action or got a medical examination done, they would kill us,” adding that the suspects had uploaded the footage of the assault on the internet.</p>
<p>The husband requested a case to be registered against the culprits for abduction, rape, sexual assault and robbery, saying that the suspects be arrested and punished at the earliest, naming four of the total eight suspects.</p>
<p>Hafizabad District Police Officer Atif Nazeer told <em>Dawn.com</em> that a case was filed against the suspects, who will be arrested within 24 to 48 hours.</p>
<p>“The suspects were being identified using video footage and police raids are currently underway,” he said. “The couple has undergone a medical examination, and investigations into other legal aspects are in process.”</p>
<p>Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1761373">death penalty</a> or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899694/two-arrested-for-kidnap-gang-rape-of-minor-girl-in-bahawalnagar">prevail</a> in the country.</p>
<p>In March, Punjab police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900045">arrested</a> three suspects for allegedly gang-raping a woman in Lahore, according to a statement by the police.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Earlier this year, the provincial government planned to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893706">increase</a> the number of Special Sexual Offences Investigation Units (SSOIUs) across the province to investigate scheduled offences under the Anti-Rape (Investigation &amp; Trial) Act of 2021 and offer better services to women.</p>
<p>Around 150 more units would be added Punjab-wide to probe the scheduled offences in this regard.</p>
<p>Since a large number of cases were being reported and registered, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz instructed Home Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal to enhance the number of units and appoint designated trained officers to help out women complainants.</p></p>
