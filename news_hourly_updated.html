            <p><p>US President Donald Trump said US air strikes on Sunday ‚Äútotally obliterated‚Äù Iran‚Äôs main nuclear sites, as Washington joined Israel‚Äôs war with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.</p>
<p>Condemning the US attacks as a violation of international law, Iran <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/IRIMFA_EN/status/1936675016365515052" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> it was ‚Äúresolved to defend Iran‚Äôs territory, sovereignty, security and people by all force‚Äù.</p>

<li>US strikes Iran‚Äôs Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites</li>
<li>Iran warns of ‚Äòeverlasting consequences‚Äô, says US betrayed diplomacy</li>
<li>Pakistan condemns attacks, voices support for Tehran‚Äôs right to defend</li>
<li>Democrats criticise decision ‚Äòwithout Congress approval‚Äô</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>The US president had stepped up his rhetoric against Iran since Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">first struck</a> Iran on June 13, repeating his insistence that it could never have a nuclear weapon. Tehran has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a> the claim, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p>
<p>Israel had launched wide-scale air strikes against Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences, killing top <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">commanders</a>, scientists and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918702">hundreds</a> others. Both countries have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918048/iran-israel-trade-fresh-air-attacks-as-trump-weighs-us-involvement">traded</a> wave after wave of devastating strikes since then.</p>
<p>In a televised address to the nation from the White House earlier today, Trump warned that the United States would go after more targets if Iran did not make peace quickly.</p>

<p>The intervention by a US president who had vowed to avoid another ‚Äúforever war‚Äù in the region threatens to dramatically widen the conflict, with Iran having said it would retaliate if Washington got involved.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success,‚Äù said Trump, adding that they targeted the crucial underground nuclear enrichment plant of Fordo along with facilities at Natanz and Isfahan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIran‚Äôs key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace,‚Äù said Trump.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump on the strikes, saying that ‚Äúthe awesome and righteous might of the United States will change history‚Äù.</p>

<p>Trump spoke to Netanyahu after the attacks, while the US also gave Israel a ‚Äúheads up‚Äù before the strikes, a senior White House official told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Not long after, sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and explosions were heard from Jerusalem as Iranian state TV announced a fresh salvo of missiles launched.</p>
<p>Tehran said there were ‚Äúno signs of contamination‚Äù after the US attacks and Saudi regulators said ‚Äúno radioactive effects were detected‚Äù in the Gulf region.</p>

<p>Trump told <em>Fox News</em>‚Äô Sean Hannity show that <a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/israel-iran-conflict-june-21-2025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">five to six</a> ‚Äúbunker-buster‚Äù bombs were dropped on the deep-underground Fordow facility, while 30 Tomahawk missiles were fired against other nuclear sites.</p>
<p>US B-2 bombers were involved in the strikes, a US official told <em>Reuters</em>, speaking on condition of anonymity. Earlier today, there were reports that <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-b-2-bombers-bunker-busters-alternatives-2025-06-18/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">US B-2 bombers</a> ‚Äî which carry so-called ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918152/read-why-israel-wants-us-bunker-busters-to-hit-irans-fordow-nuclear-site">bunker buster</a>‚Äù bombs ‚Äî were headed out of the US.</p>
<p>Tehran had threatened reprisals on US forces in the Middle East if Trump attacked.</p>

<p>It said the US actions ‚Äî ‚Äúcarried out in collusion with the genocidal Israeli regime‚Äî once again laid bare the depth of depravity that governs American foreign policy and revealed the extent of hostility harboured by the US ruling establishment against the peace-seeking and independence-loving people of Iran‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe world must not forget that it was the United States that, in the midst of a diplomatic process, betrayed diplomacy by supporting the genocidal and lawbreaking Israeli regime to impose a war of aggression on the Iranian nation,‚Äù the ministry said.</p>

<p>Iran called for an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to condemn this ‚Äúcriminal act of aggression‚Äù.</p>
<p>It also urged the UN‚Äôs International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which it accused of ‚Äúevident bias in favour of warmongering parties‚Äù, to ‚Äúcarry out its legal responsibility‚Äù as Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities were under the agency‚Äôs safeguards and monitoring.</p>
<p>It highlighted that the US attacks violated the UN Charter and UNSC‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/en/content/2231/background" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Resolution 2231</a> from 2015 on Iran‚Äôs nuclear issue, also terming it a ‚Äúdevastating blow‚Äù to the global non-proliferation system.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSilence in the face of such blatant aggression would plunge the world into an unprecedented level of danger and chaos,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>Pakistan also condemned the US attacks, saying it was ‚Äúgravely concerned at the possible further escalation of tensions in the region‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe unprecedented escalation of tension and violence, owing to ongoing aggression against Iran, is deeply disturbing. Any further escalation of tensions will have severely damaging implications for the region and beyond,‚Äù it warned.</p>
<p>It stressed that ‚Äúrecourse to dialogue, diplomacy, in line with the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, remains the only viable pathway to resolve the crises in the region‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe emphasise the imperative need to respect civilian lives and properties and immediately bring the conflict to end. All parties must adhere to international law, particularly International Humanitarian Law,‚Äù the statement asserted.</p>

<p>But the Republican‚Äôs decision to strike Iran came far sooner.</p>
<p>Flanked by Vice President JD Vance, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump said that future attacks would be ‚Äúfar greater‚Äù unless Iran reached a diplomatic solution.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRemember, there are many targets left,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Trump, however, made no mention of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917243">regime change</a>, despite having warned last week that Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was an ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917651">easy target</a>‚Äù.</p>
<p>The US contacted Iran diplomatically yesterday to say the strikes are all the US plans and it does not aim for regime change, <em>CBS News</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-launches-strikes-iranian-nuclear-facilities-trump-says/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20reached%20out%20to%20Iran%20diplomatically%20Saturday%20to%20say%20the%20strikes%20are%20all%20the%20U.S.%20plans%20and%20that%20regime%20change%20efforts%20are%20not%20planned%2C%20the%20sources%20said" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>

<p>Iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons and says its programme is for civilian purposes only. The IAEA last week Tehran was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914610">in breach</a> of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years.</p>
<p>However, a US intelligence assessment found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was ‚Äúyears away from producing one‚Äù, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917691/us-assessment-finds-iran-years-away-from-nuclear-weapon-refutes-israeli-claims">report</a> from <em>CNN</em> released on Tuesday said.</p>
<p>Israel, which is not a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs President Masoud Pezeshkian had warned yesterday of a ‚Äúmore devastating‚Äù retaliation should Israel‚Äôs nine-day bombing campaign continue. He said Tehran‚Äôs right to pursue a civilian nuclear programme ‚Äúcannot be taken away ‚Ä¶ by threats or war‚Äù.</p>
<p>Pictures posted by the White House showed Trump in a red ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù cap meeting with top national security officials in the Situation Room, shortly before the strikes were announced.</p>

<p>After the address, Trump warned Iran against ‚Äúany retaliation‚Äù.</p>
<p>However, Iran‚Äôs Revolutionary Guard announced earlier today that ‚Äúsuicide drones‚Äù had been launched against ‚Äústrategic targets‚Äù across Israel.</p>
<p>Iran and other armed groups have previously attacked US military bases in the region, including in Iraq.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs Houthi allies in Yemen had yesterday threatened to resume their attacks on US vessels in the Red Sea if Washington joined the war.</p>

<p>The US military strikes on Iran also threaten to cause political tensions at home for Trump.</p>

<p>However, the issue has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918298/prospect-of-iran-strike-exposes-divisions-in-trumps-maga-base">opened a split</a> in Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù movement, with many key Republican supporters calling on Trump to avoid embroiling the United States in another foreign war.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs first <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1295226">2016 election victory</a> in particular came on the back of his promises to get America out of its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Republican <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1936564082477531596" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> said, ‚ÄúThere would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pointing out that Israel was a nuclear-armed nation, she wrote on X: ‚ÄúThis is not our fight.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúEvery time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war,‚Äù Greene said.</p>

<p>Democrats also assailed him, with several accusing him of bypassing Congress to launch a new war.</p>
<p><a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/HouseIntelDems/status/1936589543794426109" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jim Himes</a>, a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, highlighted that Trump‚Äôs decision ‚Äúwithout Congressional approval is a clear violation of the Constitution‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe also don‚Äôt know if this will lead to further escalation in the region and attacks against our forces, events that could easily pull us even deeper into a war in the Middle East,‚Äù he said in a statement.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHe has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations. It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment,‚Äù she asserted.</p>

                <h2>India arrests two for ‚Äòharbouring Pahalgam attackers‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>India‚Äôs counter-terrorism agency said on Sunday it has arrested two men in Indian-Occupied Kashmir for allegedly harbouring gunmen behind a deadly attack on civilians that sparked a days-long conflict between the two countries.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs National Investigation Agency (NIA) claimed the two suspects were from the Pahalgam area, where gunmen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">killed</a> 26 people two months ago.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe two men had provided food, shelter and logistical support to the terrorists, who had‚Ä¶ selectively killed the tourists on the basis of their religious identity,‚Äù a statement by NIA said.</p>
<p>The agency identified the two men as Parvaiz Ahmad Jothar and Bashir Ahmad Jothar, claiming the duo ‚Äúhave disclosed the identities of the three armed terrorists involved in the attack‚Äù.</p>
<p>New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912791">accused</a> Pakistan of backing the attack without making public any evidence ‚Äî an allegation that Islamabad denies.</p>
<p>The April 22 killings <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/pakistan-india-tensions">triggered</a> a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures by the nuclear-armed countries and led to intense exchanges of missile, drone and artillery fire. The four-day conflict left more than 70 people dead on both sides.</p></p>
