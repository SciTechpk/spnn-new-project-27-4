            <p><p>Three children were among five dead, while several others were injured when a bus carrying students was targeted in a blast in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district on Wednesday morning, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.</p>
<p>“In yet another cowardly and ghastly attack planned and orchestrated by terrorist state of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">India</a> and executed by its proxies in Balochistan, innocent school-going children’s bus was targeted today in Khuzdar,” a statement by the ISPR read.</p>
<p>“As per the initial reports, three innocent children and two adults have embraced martyrdom and multiple children have sustained injuries,” the press release added.</p>
<p>“After having miserably failed in the battlefield, through these most heinous and cowardly such like acts, Indian proxies have been unleashed to spread terror and unrest in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>“Indian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians,” the statement said.</p>
<p>It noted that India had “failed” in Pakistan’s Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent conflict, and its [proxies] were “being hunted [down] by military and law enforcement agencies”.</p>
<p>“Use of terrorism as a state policy by [the] Indian political government is abhorrent and reflective of their low morality and disregard of <em>[sic]</em> basic human norms,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p>“Planners, abettors and executors of this cowardly Indian sponsored attack will be hunted down and brought to justice and [the] heinous face of India will be exposed in front of the entire world,” the military vowed.</p>
<p>Pakistan Armed Forces, with the support of the brave Pakistani nation, stand “united to uproot Indian sponsored terrorism from Pakistan in all its manifestations”, the ISPR said.</p>
<p>Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">accused India</a> of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan.</p>
<p>He had detailed the arrest of a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India as “irr­e­futable evidence” of state-sponsored terrorism directed by Ind­ian military personnel.</p>
<p>On Monday, the ISPR said <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005/3-terrorists-of-indian-proxy-blf-killed-in-balochistan-engagements-ispr">12 terrorists</a> of “Indian proxy” outfits were killed by security forces in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Deputy Commissioner Yasir Iqbal Dashti had told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the blast occurred when the school bus was near the <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/o5j2xJxqzLLkz6mbA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Khuzdar Zero Point</a>.</p>
<p>The bodies and the injured were taken to the Khuzdar CMH, from where the seriously injured would be referred to medical facilities in Quetta and Karachi, the DC said.</p>
<p>Police, the Frontier Corps (FC) and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel have reached the site of the incident to collect evidence for an investigation.</p>
<p>While a probe was underway, the DC said preliminary findings indicated that the attack was a suicide blast.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack on the Khuzdar school bus, describing it as a cowardly act.</p>
<p>“The attack on innocent children in a school bus by terrorists working under Indian patronage is a clear proof of their hostility towards education in Balochistan,” he said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvnews/urdunewsdetail/6772" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>Expressing deep sorrow over the death of the children, PM Shehbaz said that the terrorists have “crossed all limits of barbarity”, vowing to bring them to their end.</p>
<p>“The sympathies of the entire nation, including mine, are with the families of these innocent children, who were victims of the brutality of terrorists.”</p>
<p>He directed the security forces to bring the perpetrators to justice, and showed support for the armed forces’ resolve to eradicate terrorism from the country.</p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari termed the attack as a “heinous and inhumane crime.” He vowed to expose this “Indian-backed terrorism” at an international level.</p>
<p>“These terrorists do not want to see Balochistan developed,” he said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvnews/urdunewsdetail/6775" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind denounced the attack as the “hideous face of Indian state-sponsored terrorism”, as well as a “cowardly and inhumane act”.</p>
<p>In a statement, Rind echoed the ISPR’s stance, saying that India was “creating instability in Balochistan to hide its failures”. He called India’s “state-sponsored terrorism a threat to world peace.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi strongly condemned the “explosion inside the bus near Khuzdar Zero Point”.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MOIofficialGoP/status/1925053540763902171" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, he expressed deep sorrow and grief over the death of four children, and extended his condolences to their families.</p>
<p>“The beasts who target innocent children do not deserve any leniency. The enemy demonstrated barbarity by attacking innocent children,” Naqvi asserted.</p>
<p>“The attack on the school bus is a heinous conspiracy of the enemy to create instability in the country. With the unity of the nation, we will foil every conspiracy,” the interior minister vowed.</p>
<p>Naqvi also prayed for the speedy recovery of the wounded.</p>

<p>Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti vowed that they will not only expose every terrorist operating in the province,  but also “eradicate them completely”.</p>
<p>“Following the success of Operation [Bunyanum Marsoos] and India’s disgraceful defeat, they have now resorted to cowardly and shameful tactics,” he wrote on X.</p>

<p>Later while talking to the media, Bugti said they had solid information that Ajit Doval, the Indian national security adviser, was planning something in Balochistan but did not expect him to target children.</p>
<p>“We had intelligence regarding this but to target innocent children, this is [India’s cowardice.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and agreed to extend the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>On Monday, Deputy PM Dar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911977">arrived</a> in China’s capital of Beijing on a three-day official visit at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Yi amid regional tensions. The trilateral forum was established in 2017, with earlier meetings held in Beijing and the Afghan capital.</p>
<p>China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/dar-appreciates-china-for-backing-pakistans-sovereignty">said</a> on Tuesday that it supports Pakistan in defending “national sovereignty and territorial integrity”, after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910060/us-president-trump-says-india-pakistan-have-agreed-to-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> ended four days of fighting with India over a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.</p>

<p>“They agreed to deepen Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation and extend the CPEC to Afghanistan,” the FO added.</p>
<p>The three foreign ministers reaffirmed trilateral cooperation as a vital platform to promote regional security and economic connectivity, the statement continued.</p>
<p>“It was agreed that the 6th Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Meeting will be held in Kabul at an early, mutually convenient date,” according to the FO.</p>
<p>The foreign ministers discussed enhancing diplomatic engagement, strengthening communications, and taking practical steps to boost trade, infrastructure, and development as key drivers of shared prosperity.</p>
<p>The ministers underscored their shared commitment to countering terrorism and fostering stability and development in the region.</p>

            <p><p>PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Wednesday cautioned that a nuclear war between India and Pakistan will have devastating consequences for the entire region and beyond.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has decided to send a high-level diplomatic <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911791">delegation</a> to important world capitals to expose Indian propaganda“ in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India.</p>
<p>Bilawal has been entrusted to lead the delegation, comprising of Senator Sherry Rehman, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Hina Rabbani Khar, Faisal Sabzwari, Tehmina Janjua, and Jalil Abbas Jilani.</p>
<p>The former foreign minister was <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MediaCellPPP/status/1925077807404863646" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speaking</a> to media after receiving initial briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before he leads a high-level diplomatic delegation to world capitals to brief foreign leaders on India’s aggression and efforts to destabilise regional peace.</p>
<p>Bilawal said they received initial briefing at the Foreign Office on the ceasefire, Kashmir, terrorism and the “attack” on the Indus Waters Treaty.</p>
<p>He said these briefings will be held for next few days and then as per the prime minister’s directive, they will visit different countries to present Pakistan’s stance that is based on peace.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan desired peace in the region that can be achieved by addressing the flashpoints whether it was the Kashmir dispute or terrorism.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is one of the biggest victims of terrorism,” he noted.</p>
<p>Bilawal cautioned that the “new normal” which India is seeking is not in its favour either.</p>
<p>“We have seen how after a terrorist attack, both countries can come close to a nuclear war,” he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The foreign foreign minister said there is need to hold dialogue and finding solutions to the issue of terrorism. He said the people of both countries sought peace which is not possible until the three main issues – Kashmir, terrorism, and water – are resolved.</p>
<p>He expressed grave concerns on India’s weaponisation of water and highlighted the need for Pakistan to inform the world about it.</p>
<p>He said that they will inform foreign governments and people that a conflict between two nuclear countries will have severe consequences beyond the region.</p>
<p>He also appreciated the efforts of the prime minister during the conflict, saying Pakistan demonstrated a ‘reasonable and rational role’ after India’s baseless accusations.</p>
<p>“Pakistan was not the aggressor, we defended ourselves,” adding the world is welcoming our stance as we stood with the truth, while India built a narrative on lies and falsehoods.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911617/pm-tasks-bilawal-with-presenting-pakistans-case-for-peace-on-global-arena">Bilawal,</a> in a recent post on X, announced that he was appointed by the prime minister to “lead a delegation to present Pakistan’s case for peace on the international stage”.</p>
<p>“I am honoured to accept this responsibility and remain committed to serving Pakistan in these challenging times,” he wrote.</p>
<p>In a similar development, the Indian government also announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, later this month to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.</p></p>
