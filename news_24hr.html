            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/dar-appreciates-china-for-backing-pakistans-sovereignty' target='_blank'><strong>Dar appreciates China for backing Pakistan’s sovereignty</strong></a>
            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has appreciated China’s for firmly supporting Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, according to said a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1924668430944502134" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by the Foreign Office on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The foreign minister met with the Minister of International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Liu Jianchao, in Beijing, where he is on a visit to discuss regional stability following the recent escalation between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>According to the statement, both leaders agreed to deepen linkages between the political parties of Pakistan and the CPC. Liu reiterated that as “All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partner” and “ironclad friend”, China would continue to prioritise its relations with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Dar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911977/dar-arrives-in-china-on-3-day-official-visit-to-discuss-regional-situation">arrived</a> in China’s capital of Beijing yesterday on a three-day official visit on the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi amid regional tensions, state-owned <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>The visit comes as tensions remain high in the region following the ceasefire between Pakistan and India after a tense military standoff over the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> in Occupied Kashmir — which India blamed on Pakistan without evidence.</p>
<p>On May 6–7, Indian air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir killed civilians, prompting Islamabad to shoot down <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909794/watch-paf-shares-locations-of-5-downed-indian-fighter-jets">five Indian jets</a>. After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">drone interceptions</a> and airbase strikes, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">US intervention</a> on May 10 led to a ceasefire. India has maintained its aggressive stance, while Pakistan has warned against further escalation and offered dialogue.</p>
<p>During the visit, Dar is set to hold in-depth discussions with his Chinese counterpart on the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability.</p>
<p>The two sides will also review the entire spectrum of Pakistan-China bilateral relations and exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest.</p>
<p>Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is also expected to be in Beijing and participate in the talks to disc­uss regional peace and security.</p>
<p>Prior to his departure, Dar told the media that China was a major trading partner of Pakistan and that both countries enjoyed an iron-clad close relationship, <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>Dar said that his meetings with the Chinese leadership would mark discussions on political, local, regional and global issues, besides the recent tensions between Pakistan and India.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912153/indian-foreign-secretary-says-no-us-mediation-in-ceasefire-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Indian foreign secretary says no US mediation in ceasefire with Pakistan</strong></a>
            <p><p>India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri has said that the United States had no role in mediating the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> between New Delhi and Islamabad, according to Indian media reports on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Misri’s statement comes despite US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911576/us-averted-likely-pak-india-nuclear-war-says-trump#:~:text=US%20averted%20likely%20Pak%2DIndia%20nuclear%20war%3A%20Trump">taking credit</a> multiple <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910565/trump-says-warned-pakistan-india-of-no-trade-if-fighting-not-halted">times</a> for his administration’s role in the truce, which Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">thanked</a> him for.</p>
<p>New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating last month’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">strongly denied</a> the allegations and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>. As the situation turned into a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military confrontation</a> between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>During a meeting yesterday of the parliamentary committee on external affairs, led by Congress lawmaker Shashi Tharoor, Misri claimed that the offer for a ceasefire came from Pakistan and that no other country was involved in the negotiations, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-n-signal-pak-wasn-t-tipped-off-misri-to-panel-101747680035793.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hindustan Times</a></em> reported, citing a “senior lawmaker”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Asked by parliamentarians about Trump’s statements that Washington had helped India and Pakistan “settle” the “problem”, the report quoted Misri as saying: “New Delhi had routine talks with the US but there was no mediation.”</p>
<p>According to the report, this was Misri’s first appearance before the 31-member parliamentary panel. The meeting went on for more than three hours as members asked the foreign secretary numerous questions.</p>
<p>India’s <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.ptinews.com/story/national/india-and-pakistan-conflict-was-always-in-conventional-domain-misri-to-parliamentary-panel/2569079" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Press of Trust India</a></em>, citing sources, also stated that Misri “reiterated the government’s stand that the decision to stop military actions was taken at a bilateral level”, indicating no third-party role.</p>
<p>During the parliamentary panel’s moot, Misri was questioned about why the Indian government was giving Trump the centre stage and not refuting the US president’s claims on mediating the ceasefire.</p>
<p>However, Misri “did not give any answer” to the questions, <em>Hindustan Times</em> reported, quoting the lawmaker, whose name it did not specify.</p>
<p>“Trump publicly claimed at least seven times that he facilitated the ceasefire. Why was India silent?” <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/no-us-role-ceasefire-nuclear-signalling-pakistan-foreign-secretary-vikram-misri-tells-parliament-panel-2727150-2025-05-19" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">India Today</a></em> quoted an unnamed member of the panel as asking.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Another asked him why India “allowed Trump to repeatedly seize the narrative”, referring to the US president’s statements on the truce.</p>
<p>“The sense the MPs got was that India neither involved the US in the discussions with Pakistan nor was India involved in the US’s decision to announce it,” <em>India Today</em> stated.</p>
<p><em><a class="link--external" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-restoration-of-normalcy-with-pakistan-in-near-future-foreign-secretary-vikram-misri/articleshow/121279714.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Times of India</a></em> similarly reported that Misri reportedly said Trump made his remarks on the ceasefire on social media and not through any official channel, where India could have put its point across.</p>
<p>During the in-camera session, the foreign secretary also ruled out the “restoration of normalcy with Pakistan in [the] near future”.</p>

<p>Misri also said that the recent military confrontation with Pakistan was “entirely in the conventional domain and involved no ‘nuclear signalling’ from the other side”, the <em>Hindustan Times</em> added.</p>

<p>While Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned of an “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906661">all-out war</a>” prior to the conflict, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said last week that a nuclear war was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910847">never an option</a> for the government.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Misri was also “pressed about the number of Indian aircraft lost during the hostilities”, referring to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911307/indias-false-pride-stands-shattered-says-pm#:~:text=downing%20not%20five%20but%20six%20fighter%20planes%2C%20including%20three%20Rafale%20jets">six</a> fighters <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downed</a> by the Pakistan Air Force, <em>India Today</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/no-us-role-ceasefire-nuclear-signalling-pakistan-foreign-secretary-vikram-misri-tells-parliament-panel-2727150-2025-05-19#:~:text=Pressed%20about%20the%20number%20of%20Indian%20aircraft%20lost%20during%20the%20hostilities%2C%20the%20Foreign%20Secretary%20declined%20to%20comment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>

            <p><p>The lawyer of Zahir Jaffer, the man challenging his death sentence over the 2021 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636267">murder</a> of Noor Mukadam in the Supreme Court, wrapped up his arguments on Tuesday in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1747988/noor-mukadam-murder-zahir-jaffar-approaches-sc-against-ihc-verdict-upholding-death-sentence">appeal</a> against his client’s punishment.</p>
<p>Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636764">tortured</a> before being beheaded. Zahir’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810">death sentence</a> by the trial court was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1741974">upheld</a> by the Islamabad High Court (IHC), which had also turned his jail term over rape charges into a second death penalty.</p>
<p>Justice Hashim Kakar is leading a three-member bench, which includes Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Ali Baqar Najafi.</p>
<p>Barrister Salman Safdar appeared as Zahir’s counsel while Advocate Shah Khawar was present on behalf of Noor’s father, retired diplomat Shaukat Mukadam. Safdar concluded his arguments today, while Khawar began his.</p>
<p>The bench then announced that the proceedings would resume later in the afternoon.</p>
<p>During yesterday’s hearing, the accused’s lawyer contended that no medical board was formed to assess his client’s mental state. Justice Kakar had observed, “A daughter was mercilessly murdered.”</p>
<p>The bench has indicated that a decision on Zahir’s appeal would be made soon.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/3  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The appeals of the convicted co-accused in the case were to be taken up as well. An appeal by Shaukat against the acquittal of Zahir’s father, Zakir Jaffer, is also among the pleas to be heard.</p>
<p>In October last year, Noor’s father had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867225">urged the SC</a> to take up the murder case pending for more than one and a half years in the top court.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#case-history" id="case-history" title="Permalink"></a>Case history</h2>
<p>Noor, 27, was found <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636267">murdered</a> at a residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4 on July 20, 2021. An FIR was registered later the same day against Zahir Jaffer, who was arrested at the site of the murder.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>In February 2022, a district and sessions judge <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810">sentenced Jaffer to death</a> for the murder and handed him 25 years of rigorous imprisonment, finding him guilty of rape. His household staff, Mohammad Iftikhar and Jan Mohammad — co-accused in the case — were each sentenced to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>Zahir’s parents, leading businessman Zakir Jaffer and Asmat Adamji, had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1651981">indicted</a> by an Islamabad district and sessions court in October 2021 but were later <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1676810">acquitted</a> by the court.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1640810/noor-mukadam-murder-therapyworks-owner-5-employees-remanded-in-day-long-physical-custody">Six officials</a> of Therapy Works, whose employees had visited the site of the murder before police, were also among those indicted by the lower court but were later freed of the charges along with the parents. According to the challan, the parents and the therapy workers tried to conceal the crime and attempted to destroy the evidence.</p>

<p>In March 2023, the IHC, dismissing the Zahir’s <a class="link--external" href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2348054/zahir-jaffer-moves-ihc-challenging-death-sentence-in-noor-case" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appeal</a>, not only <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1741974">upheld the death sentence</a> but also converted his 25-year jail term into another death penalty. The IHC had also rejected the pleas of the main suspect’s staff challenging their conviction.</p>
<p>The next month, Zahir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1747988/noor-mukadam-murder-zahir-jaffar-approaches-sc-against-ihc-verdict-upholding-death-sentence">approached the SC</a> against the IHC verdict, insisting that his conviction resulted from “erroneous appreciation” of the case evidence and the high court and trial court could not identify the “fundamental flaws” in the FIR.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#brutal-murder" id="brutal-murder" title="Permalink"></a>Brutal murder</h2>
<p>After an FIR was registered in the case and Zahir was arrested, his parents and household staff were also taken into custody by police on July 24, 2021 over allegations of “hiding evidence and being complicit in the crime”. They were made a part of the investigation based on the statement of Noor’s father but were later acquitted.</p>
<p>In his complaint, Shaukat had stated that he had gone to Rawalpindi on July 19 to buy a goat for Eidul Azha, while his wife had gone out to pick up clothes from her tailor. When he had returned home in the evening, the couple found their daughter Noor absent from their house in Islamabad.</p>
<p>They had found her cellphone number switched off and started a search for her. Sometime later, Noor had called her parents to inform them that she was travelling to Lahore with some friends and would return in a day or two, according to the FIR.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The complainant said he had later received a call from Zahir, whose family were their acquaintances. Zahir had informed Shaukat that Noor was not with him, the FIR said.</p>
<p>At around 10pm on July 20, the victim’s father had received a call from Kohsar police station, informing him that Noor had been murdered.</p>
<p>Police had subsequently taken the complainant to Zahir’s house in Sector F-7/4 where he discovered that his “daughter has been brutally murdered with a sharp-edged weapon and beheaded”, according to the FIR.</p>
<p>Shaukat, who identified his daughter’s body, had sought the maximum punishment under the law against Zahir for allegedly murdering his daughter.</p>
<p>Police later said that Zahir had confessed to killing Noor, while his DNA test and fingerprints also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1640762">showed his involvement</a> in the murder.</p>
