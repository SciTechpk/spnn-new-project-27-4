            <p><p>The federal government on Tuesday welcomed a Sargodha Anti-Terrorism Court’s (ATC) sentencing of Leader of Opposition in Punjab Assembly (PA) Malik Ahmed Khan Bhachar to 10 years in prison over a case related to the nationwide riots on May 9, 2023, hailing it as a positive step.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, military installations and state-owned buildings were vandalised as PTI supporters protested the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">arrest</a> of ex-premier Imran Khan — who was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1752306">released</a> later but has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a> in various <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885852">cases</a> since August 2023. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including the party’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1774736">top leadership</a>, were arrested.</p>

<p>Addressing a press conference today in Islamabad, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said: “Today, the Sargodha ATC issued an order and we welcome it … I think it is a very positive step as justice has been upheld.”</p>
<p>He said the verdict “fulfils all requirements of justice” and followed due process since the entire trial proceedings were carried out legally. “The decision announced is in accordance with the law and the Constitution,” Malik said.</p>
<p>The state minister said Bhachar, PTI MNA Ahmed Chattha and former MNA Bilal Ejaz were sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment each in a case related to the riots.</p>
<p>“When you take the law into your own hand, whether you’re an MNA or MPA or opposition leader … the [status] doesn’t matter, as the law is equal for everyone and will come into force.”</p>
<p>Malik hoped that other May 9-related cases would be decided soon as well.</p>
<p>Assailing the PTI, he alleged that the riots were “carefully curated” via “planning” to precisely attack over 200 locations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bachar said in a post on X that he would not abandon his support of Imran.</p>

<p>PTI MNA Asad Qaiser condemned the sentences, alleging that “neither was any transparent or legal procedure followed in the case, nor was any credible witness presented. The demands of justice were grossly violated.”</p>
<p>He said in a post on X that the party would challenge the “biased decision” in the high court.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Terming the decision “outright injustice”, the party’s South Punjab wing said, “The truth is that the establishment’s role in this entire process is evident to all, and nothing called justice remains.</p>
<p>“These punishments are not only vengeful actions but also an insult to the country’s democracy, judiciary, and people, and now the people will no longer stay silent!” the statement read.</p>

<p>Today’s conviction follows a recent tussle between the PML-N’s Punjab government and the PTI, after PA Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920792">suspended</a> 26 opposition MPAs and sought their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1923447">disqualification</a> for their “unparliamentary conduct”.</p>
<p>However, days ago, in a significant step towards de-escalation of political tensions, Ahmad formally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925367">rejected</a> the disqualification petitions following <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924877/punjab-assembly-talks-progress-but-pti-stands-firm-on-suspensions">negotiations</a> between the government and the opposition.</p>
<p>A notification by the assembly secretariat today said the 26 PTI lawmakers stood restored as MPAs.</p>
<p>The notification, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, said that the earlier order to suspend the provincial assembly members was withdrawn. The order listed the names of the 26 PTI MPAs.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday warned of a heightened risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as over 200 stranded tourists were rescued from GB’s Diamer district as heavy floods battered the region.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge have become more visible in GB as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudburst-induced</a> floods wreaked havoc across the region. The flood-related death toll in the region rose to five today, after four lost their lives and 15 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719">went missing</a> yesterday in Diamer’s Babusar area.</p>
<p>In its alert, the PMD warned that the prevailing weather conditions increased the risk of Glofs, flash floods and landslides in vulnerable glaciated regions of GB and KP.</p>

            <p><p>Security forces have killed four more terrorists during a sanitisation operation in Balochistan’s Kalat district, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7361" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that a deliberate sanitisation operation was conducted in the district’s surrounding areas on Monday following a successful intelligence-based operation on Saturday in which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925436/4-terrorists-killed-in-balochistans-kalat-operation-ispr">four terrorists</a> belonging to the Indian proxy, <em>Fitna al-Hindustan</em>, were killed.</p>
<p>“During the conduct of the operation, four more terrorists of <em>Fitna al-Hindustan</em> were hunted down and successfully neutralised.</p>
<p>“Terrorist hideout was also busted and a large quantity of weapons, ammunition and explosives was recovered,” the ISPR said of the sanitisation operation.</p>
<p>It added that security forces remained determined to “thwart attempts by Indian proxies at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan”.</p>
<p>In May, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525#:~:text=The%20government%20has%20designated%20all%20terrorist%20organisations%20in%20Balochistan%20as%20Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan,%20state%20media%20PTV%20News%20reported.">designated</a> all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna al-Hindu­stan</em> — a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">new phrase</a> aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif commended the security forces for eliminating the eight terrorists, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>The president said that the security forces took out the enemies of the country with a display of bravery and professional capacity, adding that the nation was standing with its brave forces in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p>“The terrorists want to sabotage the peace and stability in the country, which can never be allowed as the nation is united and the scourge of terrorism will be defeated at all costs,” he said.</p>
<p>The president also reiterated the resolve that the security forces would continue their operations till complete eradication of terrorism.</p>

<p>Similarly, PM Shehbaz reaffirmed that the nefarious designs of terrorists, who were inflicting harm upon the lives and properties of innocent civilians, would be foiled.</p>
<p>“The elements of <em>Fitna al-Hindustan</em>, who are enemies of the country’s solidarity, will be rooted out,” he said in a statement from the PM Office.</p>
<p>The prime minister further said that the government and security forces were committed to the complete elimination of terrorism from the country.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to the security forces and praised their professionalism.</p>
<p>“Security forces, through timely action, thwarted the nefarious intentions of Indian-sponsored terrorists.
The nation views the operations of the security forces to eliminate India’s terrorist elements with appreciation.</p>
<p>“The exemplary end of Indian-sponsored terrorists is a clear message that there will be no place for this menace to hide in Pakistan. We will eliminate every single terrorist of the Indian menace from Pakistan,” he said.</p>

<p>The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912830">attacks</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there has been an increase in the frequency of attacks against security forces in Balochistan in recent times. Last week, three people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924597">killed</a> and seven others were injured as a passenger bus was fired upon in Kalat.</p>
<p>In April, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">accused</a> India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by Ind­ian military personnel.</p></p>
