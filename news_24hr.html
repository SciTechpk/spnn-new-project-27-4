            <p><p>One person survived as over 200 people were killed when an Air India plane bound for London with 242 people on board crashed minutes after taking off from the western city of Ahmedabad on Thursday, authorities said, in the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.</p>
<p>The plane came down in a residential area, crashing onto a medical college hostel outside the airport during lunch hour. It was headed for Gatwick Airport, south of the British capital.</p>
<p>City police chief GS Malik told <em>Reuters</em> that 204 bodies had been recovered from the crash site. There were no reports of survivors being found, and the <em>Indian Express</em> newspaper <a class="link--external" href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ahmedabad-plane-crash-live-updates-air-india-flight-boeing-london-passengers-death-casualties-rescue-2739697-2025-06-12" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> all 242 on board had perished, citing police.</p>
<p>The majority of the people on board are feared dead, a top official in the Directorate General of Civil Aviation <a class="link--external" href="https://theprint.in/india/ahmedabad-air-india-plane-crash-many-feared-dead-bodies-being-retrieved/2655314/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>The Print</em>. Malik similarly <a class="link--external" href="https://apnews.com/live/air-india-plane-crash-ai171-ahmedabad-london#00000197-63f5-d617-a597-7ffdd4f60000" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the same to the <em>Associated Press</em>, saying: “It appears there are no survivors.”</p>
<p>He later <a class="link--external" href="https://aninews.in/news/national/general-news/one-survivor-found-in-air-india-plane-crash-ahmedabad-police20250612193315/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> Indian news agency <em>ANI</em> that there was one survivor who was under treatment.</p>
<p>Malik said the bodies recovered could include both passengers and people killed on the ground.
Relatives had been asked to give DNA samples to identify the dead, state health secretary Dhananjay Dwivedi said.</p>
<p>“The building on which it has crashed is a doctors’ hostel … we have cleared almost 70 per cent to 80pc of the area and will clear the rest soon,” a senior police officer told reporters.</p>
<p>Air India said the Boeing 787-8 aircraft was carrying 242 passengers and crew members, adding that the injured were being taken to the nearest hospitals.</p>

<p>The fatal crash tarnishes the Dreamliner jet’s safety record and could muddy Boeing’s efforts to rebuild trust related to safety and ramp up production under new Chief Executive Officer Kelly Orthberg.</p>
<p>Shares of Spirit AeroSystems, a key supplier, and GE Aerospace, which makes engines for the jet, also fell about 4pc each.</p>
<p>Boeing’s shares were down about 8pc at $196.75 in premarket trading.</p>
<p>“It’s a knee-jerk reaction [to the incident] and there’s revised fears of the problems that plagued Boeing aircraft and Boeing itself in recent years,” said Chris Beauchamp, analyst at IG Group.</p>

<p>In one of the worst aviation disasters in India, two passenger planes collided mid-air near New Delhi in 1996, with the loss of all 349 on board both flights.</p>
<p>Decades earlier, an Air India Boeing 747 flying from Montreal to London in June 1985 crashed into the sea off Ireland with 329 people on board and leaving no survivors.</p>
<p>India’s airline industry has boomed in recent years, International Air Transport Association (IATA) Director General Willie Walsh last month calling growth “nothing short of phenomenal”.</p>
<p>The growth of its economy has made India and its 1.4 billion people the world’s fourth-largest air market — domestic and international — with IATA projecting it will become the third biggest within the decade.</p>
<p>Air India ordered 100 more Airbus planes last year after a giant contract in 2023 for 470 aircraft — 250 Airbus and 220 Boeing.</p>

            <p><p>Pakistan was bottom-ranked among 148 countries in the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Gender Gap Report 2025 — with 56.7 per cent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1760949">gender parity</a> — the highest since 2006, it emerged on Thursday.</p>
<p>The annual report benchmarked the current state and evolution of gender parity across four key dimensions: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment.</p>
<p>In the latest <a class="link--external" href="https://reports.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>, Pakistan has been ranked below Sudan, (57pc, 147th), Chad (57.1pc, 146th), Iran (58.3pc,145th), Guinea (59.5pc, 144th), Democratic Republic of the Congo (60.1pc, 143rd), Niger (61.3pc,142nd), Algeria (61.4pc, 141st), and Mali (61.7pc, 140th).</p>
<p>Occupying the bottom rank of the index, Pakistan saw its overall parity score decline from last year’s edition, from 57pc to 56.7pc, the report said. Overall Pakistan has closed +2.3 of its gender gap since 2006.</p>
<p>However, this year’s results were a second consecutive drop from the economy’s best score of 57.7pc, achieved in 2023. Pakistan’s parity in economic participation and opportunity has declined by 1.3 percentage points, the report said.</p>
<p>While economic representation indicators have remained unchanged, income disparity in Pakistan has slightly increased since the last edition (0.02 points), as has perceived wage inequality (4 percentage points).</p>
<p>The sole sub-index advance registered by Pakistan in this year’s edition was “Educational Attainment”, bumping educational parity upwards by 1.5 percentage points to reach 85.1pc.</p>
<p>The shift was partly driven by an increase in female literacy rates (from 46.5pc to 48.5pc). However, parity has also risen because male enrolment shares have dropped in tertiary education, increasing the relative balance between men and women but lowering educational reach overall.</p>
<p>The report said Pakistan’s economy had seen political parity drop from 12.2pc in 2024 to 11pc in 2025.</p>
<p>While parity in parliament increased by 1.2 percentage points, women’s ministerial representation dropped from 5.9pc in 2024 to zero in 2025 and with it the overall sub-index score, the report added.</p>
<p>Pakistan was listed among countries including Azerbaijan, Hungary, Saudi Arabia, and Vanuatu that have all-male ministerial cabinets.</p>
<p>Commenting on the 2025 edition of the report, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, Saadia Zahidi, said the report “arrives at a decisive moment, with the world in flux as technological breakthroughs, geopolitical conflict and economic uncertainty are creating unprecedented challenges as well as bringing new opportunities.</p>
<p>“Amid such change, gender parity is both a principle and a strategy,’’ she said, adding that “economies that tap into the full spectrum of their talent and human capital are best positioned to navigate an era of transformation and accelerate productivity and prosperity.”</p>
<p>Zahidi said most economies were not fully leveraging this pathway for growth.</p>

<p>The report found that there was still a combined global average gender gap of over 30pc across four areas: economic participation and opportunity, political empowerment, educational attainment and health and survival, she added.</p>
<p>The global gender gap score in 2025 for all 148 economies included in this edition of the index stands at 68.8pc. The global gender gap closed by 0.3 percentage points in 2025, from 68.4pc in 2024 to 68.8pct in 2025.</p>
<p>Based on the collective speed of progress of those 100 economies, it will take 123 years to reach full parity globally, the report said.</p>
<p>The 2025 Global Gender Gap Index shows that no economy has yet achieved full gender parity. Iceland (92.6pc) continues to lead the Global Gender Gap Index, holding the top position for 16 consecutive years, and remains the only economy to have closed more than 90pc of its gender gap since 2022.</p>
<p>Each of the top 10 ranked economies have closed at least 80pc of their gender gaps, the only economies to do so. Globally, gender parity has increased by 4.8 percentage points since 2006.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916729/president-pm-call-for-joint-efforts-from-employers-parents-to-end-child-labour-exploitation' target='_blank'><strong>President, PM call for joint efforts from employers, parents to end child labour, exploitation</strong></a>
            <p><p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday urged parents and employers to make joint efforts to eliminate child labour, as the country observed World Day Against Child Labour.</p>
<p>Over 12.5 million children in Pakistan are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1264451">involved</a> in child labour, according to the Child Rights Movement (CRM) National Secretariat. One in four households in Pakistan employed a child for domestic work, often in hazardous conditions, as per the International Labour Organisation (ILO). According to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1808631/govt-survey-finds-111-per-cent-of-kp-children-working">provincial survey</a>, working children accounted for 11.1 per cent of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s child population.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the President’s House, President Zardari, in his message, called for efforts to protect children from exploitation, expressing hope for a future where children could “learn, play, and grow in a safe and dignified environment”.</p>
<p>Stressing the need for collective action by governments, the president urged employers to “strictly follow child labour laws and ensure that their workplaces are free from exploitation.”</p>
<p>He also called on parents and guardians to prioritise their children’s education over “short-term gains”.</p>
<p>“I urge schools and teachers to identify children at risk of dropping out and keep them in classrooms,” he was quoted as saying in his message.</p>
<p>Detailing Pakistan’s efforts towards ending child labour, he added: “Pakistan has enacted the National Commission on Rights of Child Act (2017), the ICT Child Protection Act (2018), the Juvenile Justice System Act (2018), the Employment of Children’s Act (1991), and the Domestic Workers Act (2002).”</p>
<p>“Pakistan has also established effective mechanisms and service units for the prevention of child exploitation, child labour, and providing care and rehabilitation to the affected children.</p>
<p>“Pakistan, as a signatory to various international conventions aimed at eliminating child labour, is fully committed to ending the exploitation of children.”</p>
<p>He called on the media to raise awareness on the matter of child labour and appealed to philanthropists to “support vulnerable families so that no child is forced into Labour due to poverty.”</p>
<p>He further urged the international community to “pay urgent attention to the children in Gaza”.</p>
<p>“Thousands of innocent children in these areas have been displaced, injured, or orphaned due to violence and aggression by the occupation forces,” he stated.</p>
<p>Noting that children in such vulnerable states were at a heightened risk of being pushed into child labour, he emphasised the need for “immediate global support, protection, and justice.”</p>
<p>“Together, we can dismantle the systems that exploit children and create a Pakistan and a world where every child is free to dream, learn, and build a brighter future.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz, while reaffirming the government’s commitment to ending child labour, highlighted the role of “the federal and provincial governments, the private sector, educational institutions, media, and civil society” in preventing child labour, the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-reaffirms-commitment-to-end-child-labour-ensure-brighter-future-for-every-child/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>“Children subjected to child labour not only face sexual and psychological abuse but they are also deprived of their fundamental right to education. They are robbed of their childhood,” he said.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also noted that children from “developing countries are the most affected by the scourge of child labour.”</p>
<p>“Pakistan stands shoulder to shoulder with the global community in its fight against child labour,” he added.</p>
<p>He said that this year’s theme, “Progress is clear, but there’s more to do: let’s speed up efforts!” highlights that while progress has been made, much more remains to be done.</p>
<p>“On this occasion, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and UNICEF are launching the 2025 Global Estimates and Trends Report on Child Labour, which will help assess the effectiveness of the steps taken so far,” the PM’s statement read.</p>
<p>Reiterating Pakistan’s commitment to ILO conventions on child labour, he noted that Article 11 of the Constitution of Pakistan prohibits all forms of forced labour and child labour.</p>
<p>Appealing to all stakeholders to help the government in its effort to promote education, he pointed out the Danish School system as an initiative by the government to provide access to quality education to underprivileged children.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s last Child Labour Survey, conducted in 1996, determined that agriculture involved the greatest proportion of children engaged in child labour (66pc), followed by manufacturing (11pc), hotels and restaurants (9pc), domestic work, social and personal services (8pc), transport (4pc) and construction (2pc), as per an ILO <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ilo.org/sites/default/files/wcmsp5/groups/public/@asia/@ro-bangkok/@ilo-islamabad/documents/publication/wcms_851153.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report.</a></p>
<p>Every year on June 12, the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ilo.org/topics/child-labour/campaign-and-advocacy-child-labour/world-day-against-child-labour" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ILO</a>, along with its constituents and partners around the world, commemorates the World Day Against Child Labour. This year’s theme reflects both the progress achieved and the urgency to intensify action to meet global targets.</p>
<p>The 2025 World Day focuses on a key milestone: the release of the 2025 global estimates and trends of child labour. This ILO and UNICEF joint report will provide a comprehensive overview of where we stand in our global commitments to eliminate child labour.</p>
<p>Although the detailed data are not yet available, the estimates and trends identified will guide policy debates and calls for renewed commitment and investment.</p></p>

            <p><p>Florence in Italy could hit 39C as hot weather sweeps continent, while parts of South Africa brace for snow</p><p>The severe thunderstorms that have been lashing parts of Europe over recent days are expected to give way to high temperatures this week. Several regions could climb to 10C (50F) above seasonal norms, with Italy braced for the full force of the heat. Florence in Tuscany is forecast to soar to a sweltering 39C on Thursday and across the weekend.</p><p>Germany, France and Belgium will also face hot weather from Wednesday, with widespread highs at least 9C above the June average. Many other parts of Europe are forecast to experience temperatures 5-7C above normal. This is the result of a high-pressure system creating a heat dome over the region, whereby sinking air compresses and warms as it descends, trapping heat near the surface.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/09/weather-tracker-storms-summer-heat-europe-south-africa">Continue reading...</a></p>
