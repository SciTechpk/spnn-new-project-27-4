                <h2>CJP Afridi questions LHC‚Äôs ‚Äòfinal observations‚Äô in Imran‚Äôs May 9 bail cases</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi on Tuesday raised questions over some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919908">observations</a> made by the Lahore High Court (LHC) on former premier Imran Khan‚Äôs bail pleas in eight May 9 cases.</p>
<p>In November 2024, a Lahore anti-terrorism court had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875254">denied</a> Imran bail in the cases related to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9, 2023 riots</a>, including an attack on the house of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1752201">Lahore corps commander</a>.</p>
<p>The incarcerated PTI leader‚Äôs plea challenging that was also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921953">rejected</a> by the LHC on June 24. Subsequently, days later, Imran <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926834">moved</a> the Supreme Court against the high court‚Äôs decision.</p>
<p>A three-member bench led by CJP Afridi, which also included Justices Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, resumed hearing the bail pleas today.</p>
<p>Barrister Salman Safdar appeared on behalf of Imran, while Punjab Special Prosecutor Zulfiqar Naqvi was representing the state.</p>
<p>During the hearing, CJP Afridi took note of some ‚Äúfindings‚Äù issued by the LHC in its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921953">detailed verdict</a> of dismissing Imran‚Äôs bail pleas.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúCan final observations be given in a case for bail?‚Äù the chief justice questioned rhetorically.</p>
<p>Based on the same principle, he said, ‚ÄúFor now, we will not touch upon whether the findings in this case are right or not. We will not go into the legal matters at the moment.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf we touch upon the legal findings, then the case for either [party] can be affected,‚Äù CJP Afridi explained.</p>
<p>He directed the counsels of both respondents to assist the court with legal questions and complete their preparations by the next hearing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Supreme Court will not issue any such findings that may affect the case,‚Äù the top judge reiterated.</p>
<p>At one point, Safdar requested the court to allow him to speak at the rostrum but CJP Afridi denied that plea.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the bench issued notices to the Punjab government and adjourned the hearing till August 19.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com:443/feeds/home#engineered-and-fabricated-evidence" id="engineered-and-fabricated-evidence" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòEngineered and fabricated evidence‚Äô</h2>
<p>A two-member bench of the SC had taken up Imran‚Äôs bail pleas on June 29, but adjourned the hearing without issuing notices as Safdar could not appear.</p>
<p>Imran‚Äôs appeal, filed through Safdar, claimed that the PTI founder has been accused of conspiring and abetting violence on May 9.</p>
<p>However, at the time of the alleged offence, Imran was in the custody of the National Accountability Bureau. Therefore, his involvement in violence was ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù, the petition argued.</p>
<p>On LHC‚Äôs rejection of the bail pleas, the fresh appeal claimed that the court relied on ‚Äúengineered and fabricated evidence‚Äù which included ‚Äústale, discredited and delayed statements of police officials‚Äù.</p>
<p>In its detailed verdict, the two-member LHC bench comprising Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi and Tariq Mahmood Bajwa observed that the prosecution had evidence that reflected Imran‚Äôs role in the violence that broke out on May 9 following his arrest.</p>
<p>The bench reproduced the statements of two police officials and prosecution witnesses, who claimed to have secretly attended PTI‚Äôs meetings wherein Imran allegedly gave instructions to other leaders to attack military installations in case of his imminent arrest from the Islamabad High Court (IHC).</p>
<p>The meetings were allegedly held at a rest area of Chakri, Rawalpindi, on May 4 and at Imran‚Äôs Zaman Park residence in Lahore on May 7-9, 2023.</p></p>

                <h2>Pakistan welcomes US designation of BLA, Majeed Brigade as foreign terrorist organisations</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan on Tuesday welcomed the US‚Äô <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930224/us-state-department-designates-bla-majeed-brigade-as-foreign-terrorist-organisations">decision</a> to designate the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and Majeed Brigade to its Foreign Terrorist Organisation list, according to a Foreign Office (FO) press release.</p>
<p>The US State Department made the announcement yesterday, stating that the designations demonstrated the US President Donald Trump‚Äôs commitment to counter-terrorism.</p>
<p>In today‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/pakistan-welcomes-us-designation-of-baloch-liberation-army-bla-and-majeed-brigade-as-foreign-terrorist-organisations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>, the FO emphasised that Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349">proscribed</a> the Majeed Brigade ‚Äî BLA‚Äôs suicide squad ‚Äî as a terrorist entity since July 18, 2024.  The BLA itself was proscribed in 2006, according to the National Counter-Terrorism Authority‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://nacta.gov.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/proscribed-organizations-06-oct-2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">list of proscribed organisations</a>.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBLA/Majeed Brigade is involved in multiple terrorist attacks in Pakistan, including the heinous <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897237/rescue-operation-for-hostages-underway-after-terrorists-attack-jaffar-express-in-balochistan">Jaffer Express</a> terrorist incident and the Khuzdar bus attack that resulted in the loss of precious lives,‚Äù the release said.</p>
<p>At least 26 hostages lost their lives in the Jaffar Express attack in March, for which the BLA <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901013/jaffar-express-departs-from-quetta-after-17-day-hiatus#:~:text=claimed%20by%20Balochistan%20Liberation%20Army%20terrorists%2C">claimed responsibility</a>. In the Khuzdar bus attack, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913363">10 people</a> ‚Äî including two students ‚Äî lost their lives during a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912542/pm-vows-strong-action-against-perpetrators-after-school-bus-blast-in-khuzdar">suicide attack</a> on a school bus in May.</p>
<p>The group was also behind the 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1863586">attack</a> near the Karachi airport, which killed three people, including two Chinese nationals, as well as the Gwadar Port Authority Complex <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1822759">attack</a>, which claimed the lives of eight soldiers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan remains a steadfast bulwark against terrorism. Our sacrifices have secured critical counter-terrorism successes, not only for the country, but for regional stability and global security.‚Äù</p>
<p>It added that the country remained unwavering in its resolve to protect its citizens and eliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. ‚ÄúPakistan remains committed to cooperating with the international community to overcome this common challenge.‚Äù</p>
<p>Islamabad had previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925093/pakistan-seeks-listing-of-majeed-brigade-as-terror-group">requested</a> that the Majeed Brigade be listed as an international terrorist organisation. In 2019, the State Department <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1491717">labelled</a> the BLA as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT), making it a crime for anyone in the US to assist the militants, but did not designate the Majeed Brigade at that time.</p>
<p><a class="link--external" href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FTO designations</a> are made by the Secretary of State, following section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and ‚Äúare an effective means of curtailing support for terrorist activities and pressuring groups to get out of the terrorism business‚Äù.</p>
<p>SDGT designations, meanwhile, target individuals and groups under <a class="link--external" href="https://www.state.gov/executive-order-13224/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Executive Order 13224</a>, even if they are not part of a formally recognised organisation.</p></p>
