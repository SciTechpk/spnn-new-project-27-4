                <h2>Funerals held in absentia for missing tourists in GB‚Äôs Babusar after 14 days of search efforts</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A search operation for tourists who went missing after rain-induced floods in Gilgit-Baltistan‚Äôs (GB) Babusar area concluded on Monday after 14 days, while their funeral prayers were held in absentia.</p>
<p>Pakistan has been grappling with severe flooding caused by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">glacial lake outburst floods</a> (Glofs) and intense monsoon rains since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919360">June</a>. These extreme weather events have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930">resulted</a> in several deaths and injuries across the country, with the GB region among the hardest hit.</p>
<p>After deadly floods <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> across GB‚Äôs Babusar area on July 21, the deaths of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=Seven%20deaths%20were%20reported%20from%20Babusar">seven people</a> had been confirmed but 12 remained missing. Besides the missing, the region‚Äôs death toll <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20so%20far%2C%2010%20fatalities%20and%20four%20injuries%20have%20been%20reported">stands at 10</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Firaq said, ‚ÄúThe funeral prayers of the missing persons were offered in absentia in Babusar.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that the search operation on Babusar Highway, which had continued for 14 days, has now ended. ‚ÄúAll vehicles have been removed from the debris, but no trace of the missing persons could be found,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚Äú[The] hopes of the missing persons being rescued in the flood-hit area have been dashed,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Last week, the GB government had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927377/gb-govt-promises-to-compensate-flood-affected-people-says-rehabilitation-work-underway">intensified</a> the search operations on Babusar Highway.</p>
<p>Diamer police, GB Scouts, Pakistan Army personnel, Rescue 1122 and local volunteers took part in the search efforts. Drone camps, modern equipment, sniffer dogs, technical mechanisms, heavy machinery and human resources were used for the operation.</p>

<p>Separately, five members of a family trapped because of a flood four days ago in GB‚Äôs Ghizer district have been rescued and taken to a safe place, Ghizer‚Äôs Rescue 1122 said today.</p>

<p>According to Ghizer Rescue 1122‚Äôs media coordinator, Shakraiz, a lightning strike washed away the road connecting the flood-hit area on the evening of July 31, causing five members of a family to be stranded on the other side of a river in Gopus Khatam village.</p>
<p>‚ÄúToday, the team rescued all the members and moved them to a safe place by boat,‚Äù Shakraiz told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFood was also delivered to other affected families during the operation. Sixty-two houses, water supply and electricity systems, along with health and education centres, were severely affected by the flood in the Ishkoman and Gopus valleys of Ghizer.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to local political leader Zafar Muhammad Shadamkhel, lightning struck at eleven places simultaneously, causing severe damage to houses, buildings, schools, roads and power plants. He added that 600 people have been deprived of drinking water.</p>
<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927955">cloudburst-induced floods</a> in Ghizer and Hunza districts caused significant damage to the irrigation channel in Ghalapan village in upper Hunza‚Äôs Gojal, which provides water for over 50,000 forest trees, according to residents.</p>
<p>The next day, a glacier burst in GB‚Äôs Bagrot Valley had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928021">resulted</a> in the death of one person, while his father was injured, according to the regional government‚Äôs spokesperson.</p></p>

            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928691/pakistan-issues-another-tender-to-buy-01m-tonnes-of-sugar-traders-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <h2>Pakistan issues another tender to buy 0.1m tonnes of sugar, traders say</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) has issued a new international tender to purchase 100,000 tonnes of white refined sugar, European traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>The quantity is double the earlier procurement target of 50,000 tonnes. The deadline for submission of price offers is August 11.</p>
<p>The announcement is believed to indicate that Pakistan will make no purchase in its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926639/tcp-doubles-tender-size-amid-sugar-price-surge">previous tender</a> for 100,000 tonnes of sugar on July 31, traders said.</p>
<p>On July 8, Pakistan‚Äôs government had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923204/trading-corporation-of-pakistan-to-import-035m-tonnes-of-sugar">approved plans</a> to import 500,000 tonnes of sugar to help maintain price stability. Market analysts said that retail sugar prices in the country have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923873">risen sharply</a> since January.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/3  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Traders said three companies had participated in the July 31 tender, with the lowest price offer assessed at $539.00 a tonne cost and freight included (c&amp;f).</p>
<p>Pakistan reportedly received <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925968">no offers</a> in a previous tender to buy 50,000 tonnes of sugar on July 22, with traders saying the requirement to load shipments from August 1-15 was too short notice for realistic offers.</p>
<p>The new tender seeks small/fine and medium grade sugar from worldwide origins, excluding India and Israel, packed in bags transported either in ocean shipping containers or breakbulk.</p>
<p>Shipment of breakbulk supplies is sought from September 1-15 for 50,000 tonnes and September 10-25 for 50,000 tonnes. For 50,000 tonnes of sugar in ocean shipping containers, shipment can also be made between September 1 and 20.</p>
<p>Shipments should be organised to achieve the arrival of all the sugar in Pakistan by October 20.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, traders remain puzzled by the government‚Äôs sugar trade policy.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/3  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>During FY25, Pakistan exported 765,734 tonnes of sugar, generating $411 million in foreign exchange, with an average per tonne price of $537. By contrast, only 33,101 tonnes were exported in FY24, earning just $21m.</p>
<p>Despite the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1864661">export</a> surge earlier this year, domestic consumers are now grappling with rising prices.</p>
<p>Last week, the government decided to enforce <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927244">strict monitoring</a> of sugar stocks and deploy officials at each sugar mill to oversee inventory levels and ensure uninterrupted supply in line with commitments made by the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA).</p></p>
