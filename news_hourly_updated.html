<p>‚ÄúDeputy Prime Minister [and] Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar, today signed, on behalf of Pakistan, the convention on the establishment of the International Organisation for Mediation in Hong Kong,‚Äù the statement by the FO read.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Dar appreciated the Chinese leadership for its wisdom in developing and consistently leading efforts in establishing the IOMed and fostering a global community with a shared future, the statement added.</p>
<p>He added that the creation of IOMed underscores the indispensability and significance of multilateralism as the centrepiece for international peace, stability, and development.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIOMeD also offers new opportunities and fresh hopes to build a more inclusive, more just and more equitable world. As one of the founding members of IOMed, Pakistan would continue to be an active voice in this noble mission,‚Äù the statement quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>The deputy PM underlined Pakistan‚Äôs strong commitment to the promotion of peace and security as well as development. He elaborated on the critical importance of advancing and preserving multilateralism through faithful adherence to the principles of the UN Charter, full implementation of UN Security Council resolutions, as well as international law.</p>
<p>He also drew attention to India‚Äôs violation of international law through its acts of aggression against Pakistan and its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914001/fo-slams-modis-censure-of-iwt">unlawful holding in abeyance</a> of the Indus Waters Treaty. He also highlighted the occupation of Jammu and Kashmir and the occupied Palestinian Territories as drivers of conflict to regional peace and security.</p>
<p>Dar called for the resolution of the longstanding Jammu and Kashmir dispute under the UN Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>The idea for the establishment of the IOMed was one of the key outcomes of the 2nd Belt and Road Forum held in Beijing in April 2019. China initiated discussions for the establishment of IOMed in 2021, and invited Pakistan to join negotiations as one of its founding members, the statement added.</p>
<p>The organisation is open to all countries; is based on respect for the sovereignty, core interests and legitimate concerns of every country; aims to promote dialogue and trust between parties concerned based on equality; and desires inclusion of various legal systems, and their mediators, the FO said.</p>

                <h2>May 9 riots: ATC sentences MNA Abdul Latif, 4 PTI members to 27 years in prison</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Islamabad on Friday sentenced PTI members, including Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Abdul Latif, to 27 years of imprisonment for attacking a police station during the violent May 9 riots.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1752003">PTI supporters</a>, protesting the party founder Imran Khan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">arrest</a>, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">attacking</a> the Lahore corps commander‚Äôs residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.</p>
<p>ATC Special Court-II judge Tahir Abbas Sipra handed down the punishment under different sections of the Pakistan Penal Code after finding the accused guilty of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1858445">attacking</a> the Ramna police station during the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>The accused were sentenced to a total of 27 years in prison along with a fine worth Rs327,000. The sentences shall run concurrently, the judge said.</p>
<p>MNA Abdul Latif, who was elected from NA-1 Chitral, was not present in the court when the verdict was announced. The lawmaker will be disqualified for five years after the conviction.</p>
<p>The judge told the accused that 20 witnesses, including magistrates and recorded their testimonies against them, noting that protests should be held peacefully and participants should never take the law into their own hands.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou are accused of attacking the Ramna Police Station in Islamabad. If you attack your own police stations, the country will no longer be livable,‚Äù the judge remarked.</p>
<p>A case had been registered against the accused in Ramna police station under various sections for offences including burning a motorcycle and attacking police personnel.</p>
<p>Following the verdict, the police took the four accused present in the court, namely Mira Khan, Muhammad Akram, Shahzeb, and Sohail Khan, into custody. The court also issued arrest warrants for other PTI supporters accused of involvement in the riots but were absent from the court.</p>
<p>The sentences ranged from ten years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs200,000 for terrorism provisions under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, five years in prison and a fine of Rs50,000 for the murderous attack on policemen under Section Section 324 (attempted murder) of the PPC.</p>
<p>Additionally, the accused were sentenced to four years in prison and fined Rs40,000 for burning a motorcycle under Section 426 (punishment for mischief); and a separate sentence of four years in prison and a fine of Rs40,000 under Section 440 (mischief committed after preparation made for causing death or hurt) for vandalising a police station.</p>
<p>A sentence of three-month imprisonment was imposed for interfering in the work of the police under Section 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), one month for violating Section 144 (joining unlawful assembly armed with a deadly weapon), and two years for committing a crime in a group under Section 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in prosecution of common object).</p>
<p>Prosecutor Raja Naveed conducted the testimony and cross-examination against the accused.</p>
<p>In December 2024, <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7126" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">military courts</a> had sentenced 85 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their involvement in violent attacks on military installations during the riots on May 9.</p>
<p>The military‚Äôs media wing said in a statement that the trials of those accused of the May 9 riots under military custody had been ‚Äúconcluded under the relevant laws‚Äù, and the ‚Äúconvicts retained the right to appeal and other legal recourses, as guaranteed by the Constitution and law‚Äù.</p>
<p>Imran‚Äôs nephew <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1770793">Hassan Khan Niazi</a>, who was handed into military custody in August 2023, was among the two people sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment.</p>
<p>The military‚Äôs press wing later announced that 19 civilians convicted for their involvement in the riots were granted <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1882621">pardon</a>. It said the mercy petitions of 19 convicts were accepted on ‚Äúhumanitarian grounds‚Äù.</p></p>
