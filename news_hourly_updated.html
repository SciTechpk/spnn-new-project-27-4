                <h2>6 killed, 12 injured as bus overturns in Sindh‚Äôs Thatta: rescue service</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least six people were killed and 12 others were injured when a bus overturned and fell into a ditch near Makli in Sindh‚Äôs Thatta district on Sunday morning, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>According to the Edhi rescue service, the bus overturned near the Thatta Bypass, following which a rescue team reached the site of the incident and transported the injured to a hospital.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe bodies of the six victims were initially taken to a mortuary in Orangi Town,‚Äù the service said in a statement, adding that they were later transported to Edhi‚Äôs morgue in Karachi‚Äôs Sohrab Goth.</p>
<p>The bus was carrying a group of picnickers from Karachi to Keenjhar Lake when it overturned while taking a sharp turn, killing six passengers and injuring dozens others, state-owned <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLocal authorities and rescue teams were quick to respond, reaching the crash site within minutes. The injured were rushed to Karachi hospitals, with several reported to be in critical condition,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>In another incident, at least one person was killed and several others, including women and children, were critically injured when a passenger bus overturned on the Gambat National Highway in Sindh‚Äôs Khairpur district.</p>
<p>According to <em>APP</em>, the incident took place while the bus was en route from Karachi to Swabi. Rescue teams, along with local police, reached the incident site and rushed the injured to nearby hospitals for medical aid.</p>

<p>Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah expressed deep sorrow over the loss of lives in the bus accidents, according to a statement issued by his spokesperson Abdul Rashid Channa.</p>
<p>Expressing sympathy with the Makli incident victims, he issued directives to the Thatta deputy commissioner (DC) to ensure the provision of immediate medical assistance to the injured. The chief minister further told him to immediately contact their families and fully cooperate.</p>
<p>Expressing sorrow over the Khairpur coach accident, CM Murad issued similar instructions to the Khairpur DC to ensure medical treatment of the wounded. He urged people to drive carefully to protect precious lives.</p>
<p>Accidents are common on highways and motorways across Pakistan, caused by reckless driving, speeding, driver fatigue, and poor vehicle maintenance. Poor road conditions contribute to mishaps, while weak enforcement of traffic laws allows violations to go unchecked, worsening the situation.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, four people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924364">lost</a> their lives and another six were injured ‚Äî all from the same family ‚Äî after their speeding car crashed into a wall next to a drain on Hawkes‚Äô Bay Road in Karachi‚Äôs Mauripur area.</p>
<p>South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said the family was returning from the Hawke‚Äôs Bay beach, and the accident most likely happened as a result of speeding.</p>
<p>In an incident on July 15, a collision between a trailer and a truck left one dead and three injured near Karachi‚Äôs New Sabzi Mandi on the Super Highway.</p>
<p>On June 19, a speeding dumper truck overturned on a 4x4 vehicle on Rashid Minhas Road, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918288">killing</a> a woman and an accompanying five-year-old girl.</p>
<p>On June 11, a young man was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916541">killed</a> and his wife injured in an accident after an unknown vehicle hit their bike on the Super Highway. The same day, two boys were killed after a water tanker hit them near Abdullah College in North Nazimabad.</p></p>

                <h2>FC personnel martyred as unknown gunmen open fire at checkpoint in GB‚Äôs Diamer: police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A Federal Constabulary soldier was killed when unidentified gunmen opened fire at a forest checkpoint along the Karakoram Highway in Gilgit-Baltistan‚Äôs Diamer district, police said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Diamer Farrukh Rasheed said in a statement, ‚ÄúThe deceased has been identified as Muhammad Gul Sher from Dera Ismail Khan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe motive behind the attack is not yet known, and the police are investigating the case. The suspects fled with the gun of the deceased.‚Äù</p>
<p>Senior Superintendent of Police Abdul Hameed told <em>Dawn.com</em>, ‚ÄúUnknown assailants opened fire at the checkpoint while the deceased was on duty and his colleagues were asleep.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that police teams were raiding nearby areas to look for the suspects. In his statement, he speculated that the case appeared to be related to terrorism, ruling out personal enmity or a timber smuggling attempt.</p>
<p>The forest checkpoint was situated at the Thore Road, primarily to inspect vehicles for wood smuggling via the road, which connects the KKH with forest areas in the district.</p>
<p>GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan condemned the attack, saying, ‚ÄúFiring by terrorists on state personnel is an unacceptable act.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to a statement, he directed the police to bring the perpetrators to justice and sought a report on the incident from the home department.</p>
<p>GB government spokesman Faizullah Faraq said in a separate statement that funeral prayers for the martyred soldier were offered at the Police Lines in Chilas, and preparations were underway to send the body to his hometown.</p>
<p>In 2023, at least nine people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1794671/nine-killed-as-bus-comes-under-gun-attack-in-chilas">lost</a> their lives and 21 passengers received injuries after an Islamabad-bound bus came under fire in a terrorist attack near Chilas in Diamer district of Gilgit-Baltistan.</p></p>
