                <h2>G7 urges Iran de-escalation as Trump makes hasty summit exit</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>G7 leaders on Monday called for ‚Äúde-escalation‚Äù in the Middle East, starting with the Israel-Iran conflict, as US President Donald Trump hastily left the group‚Äôs summit.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe urge that the resolution of the Iranian crisis leads to a broader de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza,‚Äù said the joint statement released by Canada.</p>
<p>The statement said that Israel ‚Äúhas a right to defend itself‚Äù and stressed ‚Äúthe importance of the protection of civilians,‚Äù as the growing attacks kill civilians on both sides.</p>
<p>The leaders of the club of industrial democracies ‚Äî Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States ‚Äî stated their conviction that Iran ‚Äúcan never have a nuclear weapon.‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump told reporters before his decision was announced to leave early: ‚ÄúAs soon as I leave here, we‚Äôre going to be doing something.‚Äù</p>
<p>He has repeatedly declined to say if the United States would participate in Israeli military action, although he has said Washington was not involved in initial strikes and the White House said that US forces remained in a defensive posture.</p>
<p>Earlier, he urged civilians to evacuate Tehran ‚Äúimmediately‚Äù amid rising <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917457/iran-state-tv-resumes-programming-after-israeli-attack-on-tehran-trump-reiterates-negotiations">tensions</a> between Israel and Iran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIran should have signed the ‚Äòdeal‚Äô I told them to sign. What a shame, and waste of human life. Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I said it over and over again!</p>
<p>‚ÄúEveryone should immediately evacuate Tehran!‚Äù he said on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>Separately, French President Emmanuel Macron called for strikes against civilians in Iran and Israel to end, as he warned against forcing regime change in Tehran, <em>AFP</em> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf the United States can achieve a ceasefire, that‚Äôs a very good thing,‚Äù Macron told reporters at a G7 summit in Canada, just as the White House announced President Donald Trump would leave the event early due to the escalating crisis in the Middle East. <em>Fox News</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-requests-nsc-be-prepared-he-returns-early-g7-summit-fox-news-reports-2025-06-17/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> he would convene his National Security Council.</p>
<p>Macron called on both Israel and Iran to ‚Äúend‚Äù strikes against civilians and warned that aiming to overthrow Tehran‚Äôs clerical state would be a ‚Äústrategic error.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll who have thought that by bombing from the outside you can save a country in spite of itself have always been mistaken,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>After months of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917469/fact-check-trump-netanyahu-viral-comments-about-pakistan-on-iran-israel-clash-are-fake">attacking</a> Gaza ‚Äî flattening homes, targeting hospitals and aid workers, and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912795">starving</a> a besieged population ‚Äî Israel expanded its assault across borders, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">launching</a> wide-scale air strikes against Iran last week. Israeli officials have claimed the strikes are part of a broader operation codenamed ‚ÄòRising Lion‚Äô to deter Tehran‚Äôs nuclear ambitions.</p>

<p>Tensions have escalated since Friday, with more than 224 Iranians killed and over 1000 injured, most of them civilians. Israel says 24 people have been killed, mostly civilians.</p>
<p>Iran is a party to the NPT, whereas Israel, which is not a party to the NPT, is the only country in the Middle East widely believed to have nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Israel possesses around 90 nuclear warheads, <a class="link--external" href="https://armscontrolcenter.org/countries/israel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to the US-based Centre for Nuclear Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. There are multiple United Nations (UN) resolutions concerning Israel‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, including UN General Assembly Resolution 41/93, which urged Tel Aviv to renounce its weapons and place its facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards.</p>
<p>Iranian media soon reported explosions and heavy air defence fire in Tehran early on Tuesday. Air defences were also activated in Natanz, home to key nuclear installations 320km (200 miles) away, the <em>Asriran</em> news website reported. A White House aide said it was not true that the US was attacking Iran.</p>
<p>In Israel, air raid sirens wailed in Tel Aviv after midnight, and an explosion was heard as Iranian missiles targeted the country again.</p>
<p>According to <em>AFP</em>, Israel‚Äôs army warned early on Tuesday that it had detected new missiles launched from Iran, but swiftly dropped an alert and said people no longer needed to take cover.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is now permitted to leave protected spaces in northern Israel,‚Äù the Israeli army said on Telegram.</p>
<p>Sources told <em>Reuters</em> that Tehran had asked Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia to urge Trump to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to an immediate ceasefire. In return, Iran would show flexibility in nuclear negotiations, according to two Iranian and three regional sources.</p>
<p>US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told <em>Fox News</em> on Tuesday that President Donald Trump was still aiming for a nuclear deal with Iran even as hostilities have escalated between Israel and Tehran, while a White House aide said separately that Washington was not attacking Iran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Hegseth said on <em>Fox News‚Äô</em> ‚ÄúJesse Watters Primetime‚Äù show when asked if Trump was still aiming for a nuclear deal with Iran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are postured defensively in the region to be strong in pursuit of a peace deal. And we certainly hope that‚Äôs what happens here,‚Äù Hegseth said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf President Trump is genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential,‚Äù Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on X. ‚ÄúIsrael must halt its aggression, and absent a total cessation of military aggression against us, our responses will continue.‚Äù</p>

<p>Netanyahu told reporters on Monday that Israel was committed to eliminating threats posed by Iran‚Äôs nuclear and ballistic missile programs, adding, ‚ÄúIf this can be achieved in another way‚Äîfine. But we gave it a 60-day chance.‚Äù</p>

<p>The leaders of 20 nations called for the urgent necessity of establishing a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and other Weapons of Mass Destruction, which should apply to all States in the region without exception in line with relevant international resolutions. There is also an urgent need for all countries of the Middle East to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), they emphasised.</p>
<p>The foreign ministers highlighted the paramount importance of refraining from targeting nuclear facilities that were under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, in accordance with relevant IAEA resolutions and United Nations Security Council decisions, as such acts constituted a violation of international law and international humanitarian law, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#chinese-urged-to-leave-israel" id="chinese-urged-to-leave-israel" title="Permalink"></a>Chinese urged to leave Israel</h2>
<p>With security concerns growing and Israeli airspace closed because of the war, the Chinese embassy in Israel urged Chinese citizens to leave the country via land border crossings as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Iran-Israel air war ‚Äî the biggest battle ever between the two longtime enemies ‚Äî escalated on Monday with Israel targeting Iran‚Äôs state broadcaster and uranium enrichment facilities.</p>
<p>Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the <em>BBC</em> that the Natanz plant sustained extensive damage, likely destroying 15,000 centrifuges, while Iran‚Äôs Fordow plant remained largely intact.</p>
<p>Talks between the United States and Iran, hosted by Oman, had been scheduled for June 15 but were scrapped, with Tehran saying it could not negotiate while under attack.</p>
<p>Israel launched its air war with a surprise attack that has killed nearly the entire top echelon of Iran‚Äôs military commanders and its leading nuclear scientists. It says it now has control of Iranian airspace and intends to escalate the campaign in coming days.</p>
<p>Trump has consistently said the Israeli assault could end quickly if Iran agreed to US demands that it accept strict curbs to its nuclear programme.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs I‚Äôve been saying, I think a deal will be signed, or something will happen, but a deal will be signed, and I think Iran is foolish not to sign,‚Äù Trump told reporters on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in Canada on Monday.</p>
<p>A US official said Trump would not sign a draft statement from G7 leaders calling for a de-escalation of the conflict. The draft statement says Iran must never have a nuclear weapon and that Israel has the right to defend itself.</p>
<p>On Monday, Iran state TV resumed live coverage after Israel‚Äôs attack on the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) building.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Zionist regime, the enemy of the Iranian nation, minutes ago conducted a military operation against the Islamic Republic of Iran news network‚Äù, part of IRIB, said Hassan Abedini, a senior official at the broadcasting service. ‚ÄúThe regime (Israel) was unaware of the fact that the voice of the Islamic revolution and the great Iran will not be silenced with a military operation.‚Äù</p>
<p>The blast occurred as the presenter was live on TV, lambasting Israel before she was seen leaving the live broadcast, Iranian media reported, sharing a video of the incident. The attack was confirmed by the Israeli defence minister as well.</p>
<p>The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) strongly condemned Israel‚Äôs strike on an Iranian state broadcaster and called for an end to the ‚Äúbloodshed‚Äù, <a class="link--external" href="https://aje.io/p8ugy8?update=3779783" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Al Jazeera</em></a> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCPJ is appalled by Israel‚Äôs bombing of Iran‚Äôs state TV channel while live on air,‚Äù CPJ Regional Director for the Middle East Sara Qudah said. ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äôs killing, with impunity, of almost 200 journalists in Gaza has emboldened it to target media elsewhere in the region. This bloodshed must end now.‚Äù</p>
<p>Earlier, Israel‚Äôs Haifa-based Bazan Group said all refinery facilities have been shut down after a power station used to produce steam and electricity were significantly damaged in an attack by Iran, according to a regulatory filing on Monday.</p>
<p>The group said the Iranian attack resulted in the death of three company employees.</p>
<p>The refinery is located in Haifa Bay, according to Israeli media.</p>

            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917564/budget-2025-26-guardrails-sought-to-stop-misuse-of-fbr-arrest-powers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <h2>Budget 2025-26: Guardrails sought to stop misuse of FBR arrest powers</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The government is reevaluating the powers granted to Fed¬≠eral Board of Revenue (FBR) officers to arrest suspected tax evaders and add¬≠ing guardrails to prev¬≠ent arbitrary detentions after concerns expressed by businesspeople and lawmakers over the blanket authority and its potential misuse.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday formed a committee to reexamine the matter and recommend stringent safeguards to prevent the misuse of powers by tax officers.</p>
<p>FBR Chairman Mah¬≠mood Langrial told <em>Dawn</em> that the provisions could be revised to mandate the permission of multiple senior officers before any arrest.</p>
<p>In the Finance Bill introduced last week, the government proposed amendments to the Sales Tax Act, 1990, to allow FBR officers to investigate tax fraud and make arrests.</p>
<p>As per the proposed amendments, assistant or deputy commissioners could arrest tax defaulters after seeking approval from the commissioner.</p>
<p>The proposed Section 37AA reads: ‚ÄúThe officer of Inland Revenue, during the investigation, having reason to believe on the basis of evidence that actions of any person may have caused or attempted to cause tax fraud or any other offence warranting prosecution under this Act, may cause arrest of such person with prior approval of the Commissioner.‚Äù</p>
<p>The provision made the business community apprehensive about the potential abuse of power.</p>
<p>Pakistan Business Council CEO Ehsan Malik, in a letter to Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, said the powers were ‚Äúdraconian‚Äù and ‚Äúwill most likely be misused to harass‚Äù taxpayers.</p>
<p>But FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial told Dawn that the authority to arrest would remain intact.</p>
<p>However, the committee headed by the finance minister will examine various options to introduce additional safeguards to prevent potential misuse of the power.</p>
<p>According to Mr Langrial, existing laws empower low-ranking officers to lodge FIRs against tax defaulters.</p>
<p>He noted that the proposed amendments mandate prior approval from the income tax commissioner before an arrest.</p>
<p>Further safeguards be¬≠ing considered include a provision for approval from three senior officers inst¬≠ead of just the commissioner.</p>
<p>According to the FBR chairman, this provision would significantly reduce the potential for misuse of powers. Moreover, the officers would be empowered to arrest individuals for a limited set of violations and not for every offence of fraud, Mr Langrial explained.</p>
<p>He added the powers could be exercised in three circumstances: when a tax defaulter fails to appear before authorities thrice, when there is a risk of evidence being tampered with, or when there is a possibility that the suspect may flee the country.</p>
<p><strong>PM‚Äôs directives</strong></p>
<p>An official announcement issued by the Prime Minister Secretariat said PM Shehbaz formed the committee following a meeting to review the FBR‚Äôs performance.</p>
<p>According to the state-run news agency, APP, the prime minister took notice of media reports and warned the proposed powers must not be used to harass the business community or taxpayers.</p>
<p>Mr Langrial informed the prime minister that the authority to arrest tax defaulters has been embedded in taxation law since the 1990s.</p>
<p>However, in light of rec¬≠ent rulings by superior courts, amendments are being introduced to further streamline the process.</p>
<p>The prime minister ordered officials to devise an effective external review system regarding the arrest matter and arrests should only be made in cases where the quantum of fraud was ‚Äúexceptionally high‚Äù.</p>
<p>The premier said provisions for protection against misuse of these laws should be made part of the Finance Act. He called for consultations with all coalition parties on this issue.</p>
<p><strong>NA committee</strong></p>
<p>On Monday, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue also raised alarm over the proposed amendments.</p>
<p>The meeting, chaired by MNA Naveed Qamar, was also attended by Finance Minister Aurangzeb, who assured members that the matter would be reviewed in line with the prime minister‚Äôs directives.</p>
<p>The finance minister informed the committee that Senator Farooq H. Naik had proposed amendments aimed at safeguarding against the misuse of powers. He described Mr Naik‚Äôs suggestions as highly appropriate.</p>
<p>The prime minister has been briefed on the matter and the committee will be updated on any progress in this matter, Mr Aurangzeb said.</p>
