            <p><p>The bodies of nine bus passengers who were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923411/armed-men-kidnap-and-kill-nine-passengers-in-balochistan">kidnapped and killed</a> in Balochistan‚Äôs Sardhaka area last night were recovered and transported to their hometowns in Punjab on Friday morning, officials said.</p>
<p>On Thursday night, at least nine passengers travelling on two Punjab-bound coaches were abducted and killed by unidentified armed men in the Sur-Dakai area, situated on the border between Balochistan‚Äôs Zhob and Loralai districts, Assistant Comm¬≠issioner Naveed Alam said a day ago.</p>
<p>Provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind also confirmed the incident and said that <em>Fitna-al-Hindu¬≠stan</em>  ‚Äî a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">term</a> the government uses for terrorist organisations in Balo¬≠chistan ‚Äî had carried out attacks at three different places ‚Äî Kakat, Mastung, and Sur-Dakai.</p>
<p>The Balochistan Liberation Front, a banned outfit, later claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group said it had killed the nine individuals after blocking the highway between Musakhail-Makhtar and Khajuri.</p>
<p>Alam told <em>Dawn.com</em> on Friday that the bodies of all nine passengers were handed over to a political agent in the Sakhi Sarwar district of Dera Ghazi Khan to be handed over to their families.</p>
<p>He said that seven of the passengers had been identified but two could not be identified due to a lack of documents.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe terrorists must have taken the passengers‚Äô identification documents with them,‚Äù AC Alam said.</p>
<p>Of the seven passengers identified, two were residents of Lodhran, while one passenger each were residents of Dera Ghazi Khan, Gujrat, Attock, Khanewal and Gujranwala.</p>

<p>The country‚Äôs top leaders strongly condemned the incident and vowed action against the perpetrators ‚Äúat all costs‚Äù.</p>
<p>In a statement today, President Asif Ali Zardari said: ‚ÄúThis barbarity is part of <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>‚Äôs evil conspiracy to spill blood in Pakistan,‚Äù state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed commitment to ‚Äúclear the land of <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> and its facilitators at all costs‚Äù.</p>
<p>Similarly, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in a statement issued by his office: ‚ÄúWe will deal with terrorists with full force. The blood of innocent people will be avenged.‚Äù</p>
<p>The premier added that the killing of unarmed civilians was a blatant act of terrorism by <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith resolve, unity, and strength, we will confront the scourge of terrorism and uproot it completely,‚Äù the prime minister said.</p>
<p>Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also strongly condemned the incident, calling it ‚Äúblatant terrorism‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe killing of innocent civilians based on Pakistani identity is an unforgivable crime,‚Äù Bugti said, vowing that the response would be ‚Äúsevere‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe terrorists have proven that they are not human beings, but cowardly beasts,‚Äù he said, adding that the state ‚Äúwould not even let these murderers hide underground.‚Äù</p>
<p>The chief minister added: ‚ÄúAll networks of terrorists who are the sponsors of <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> will be destroyed.‚Äù</p>
<p>Noting that this was a ‚Äústate war‚Äù, he vowed decisive action.</p>
<p>CM Bugti further vowed to crush ‚Äúevery plan of terrorism‚Äù with strength, determination and unity. ‚ÄúBalochistan will become a graveyard for enemies.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MOIofficialGoP/status/1943412958844829757" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on X late last night, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident, saying: ‚ÄúWe will chase and eliminate Indian-sponsored terrorists who target innocent passengers.‚Äù</p>

<p>According to sources, two passenger coaches en route to Punjab were intercepted in the Sur-Dakai area near the N-70 highway, close to Dab ‚Äî a place along the Loralai-Zhob border. A group of armed men had blocked the road and stopped the two vehicles.</p>
<p>The armed assailants boarded the coaches, checked the identity cards of passengers and forced 10 persons off the vehicles at gunpoint.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey dragged out 10 passengers ‚Äî seven from one coach and three from the other ‚Äî and took them away (to an unknown place),‚Äù a surviving passenger told Levies. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what they did to them, but I heard gunfire as we were leaving.‚Äù</p>
<p>After abducting the nine passengers, the assailants allowed both coaches to leave the area.</p>
<p>Security forces suspended traffic on the highway and began a large-scale search operation to locate the perpetrators.</p>
<p>According to sources, the attackers checked the national identity cards of all passengers and specifically targeted individuals with Punjab addresses. They also opened fire on the coaches during the abduction to prevent any escape.</p>

<p>One of the surviving passengers, Sabir Toor, told <em>Geo News</em> that he and 10 members of his family were on their way to Lodhran from Quetta for their father‚Äôs funeral when the attack occurred.</p>
<p>The gunmen offloaded his two brothers, Usman and Jabir, from the bus in front of women and children of the family and killed them. ‚ÄúI cannot describe this hour of grief ‚Äî we have three funerals in the family now.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI urge security forces to get rid of these miscreants,‚Äù he said, adding that he and his brothers had been working in Quetta for the past 30 years and had no relations to any political party.</p>
<p>In May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna-al-Hindu¬≠stan</em>.</p>
<p>Balochistan has witnessed a spate of attacks targeting those hailing from Punjab. In two separate incidents in April 2024, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1827193">nine people</a> were killed after being forced off a bus near Noshki, while <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1830243">two labourers</a> from Punjab were shot in Kech.</p>
<p>In February, seven Punjab-bound passengers were offloaded from a bus and shot dead in Barkhan district. The incident came days after 12 were killed in a blast targeting a bus carrying coal miners in Harnai.</p>
<p>In May last year, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832433">seven barbers</a> from Punjab were shot dead near Gwadar, while August saw <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854830">23 travellers</a> offloaded from trucks and buses and shot in the Musakhail district.</p></p>

                <h2>Roof collapse injures 6 as heavy rains cause flooding in KP‚Äôs Charsadda</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Six members of a family, including four children, were injured after the roof of a mud house collapsed due to heavy rains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Charsadda district in the early hours of Friday, a rescue official said.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122, Charsadda‚Äôs District Emergency Officer Jawad Ali told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the incident occurred in the Omarzai area, where the roof of a house collapsed, adding that his team responded promptly and recovered the injured from the debris.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe injured were transported to the district headquarters hospital in Charsadda for medical assistance,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe Rescue 1122 team had also provided first aid to the injured on the spot and in the ambulances; they seemed out of danger.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the DEO Ali, four of the injured were guests from Karachi. Of the four children, aged five to nine, three suffered multiple injuries, while the fourth suffered a forehead wound.</p>
<p>The DEO appealed to the public to take precautionary measures during the monsoon season.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ali and Charsadda Deputy Commissioner Azmat Wazir both said in statements that the water level in the Pali Dam surged due to heavy rains on the night of July 10 and 11, causing a flooding situation in the Jundi River.</p>
<p>They added that Rescue 1122, civil defence, revenue and administration teams had been alerted and were in the field to monitor the situation.</p>

<p>‚ÄúRescue 1122 Charsadda took timely action on the flood situation in the Jundi river,‚Äù the DEO said, adding that he personally supervised the operations.</p>
<p>He said six ambulances, a disaster vehicle, a water rescue vehicle, and a total of 90 rescue personnel participated in the operations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA total of 105 people were rescued and taken to safe places in the affected areas‚Äù, Ali said, adding that four people were rescued from Sherpao Kanyur and 10 people were taken to a safe place from Omarzai. Similarly, 76 people were taken to shelter homes from Gedar Kaly.</p>
<p>The deputy commissioner urged the public to avoid visiting the riverside this season, as has already been banned, to avoid any mishap.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1852031#:~:text=Monsoon%20rains%20across%20the%20region%20from%20June%20to%20September%20offer%20respite%20from%20the%20summer%20heat%20and%20are%20crucial%20to%20replenishing%20water%20supplies.%20They%20are%20also%20vital%20for%20agriculture%2C%20and%20therefore%20the%20livelihoods%20of%20millions%20of%20farmers%20and%20food%20security%20for%20South%20Asia%E2%80%99s%20nearly%20two%20billion%20people.">fall across</a> the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat. They are crucial to replenishing water supplies and agriculture, and therefore, the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security. However, they also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923467/kp-pdma-alerts-districts-as-new-rain-spell-begins-today">alerted</a> the district administrations across the province to the possibility of floods due to a new spell of torrential rains from July 11 to 17.</p>
<p>On Sunday, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922498">six people</a> lost their lives while one person was injured amid flash floods and heavy rain across Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the PDMAs of both provinces. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920723">wreaked havoc</a> in the province in June and are set to continue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, due to a significant rise in temperature, accelerating snow and glacier melt have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922323">triggered</a> flash floods and landslides in various areas of KP and Gilgit-Baltistan. Two boys <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922856/two-drown-in-kp-as-flash-floods-hit-province-gb">drowned</a> in the Indus River in the Torghar district and Jabba nullah of KP‚Äôs Mansehra on Tuesday.</p></p>
