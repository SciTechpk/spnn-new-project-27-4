<p>Addressing a joint press conference with Iranian President Masood Pezeshkian, PM Shehbaz said that the two countries’ delegations had a “very productive and useful meeting … which covered all areas of our mutual interests and cooperation”.</p>
<p>“There was total agreement that our two brotherly and neighbourly countries must enhance our cooperation in the field of trade, investments, commerce, in fact, every walk of life,” he said.</p>
<p>The prime minister said that he thanked Pezeshkian for his support during the military conflict with India and emphasised that both nations have deep-rooted cultural ties and historical relations, adding that they decided to turn these relations into a “very productive cooperation in various fields of life”.</p>
<p>“My dear brother, I dearly appreciate your sense of concern and brotherly feelings for the people of Pakistan and your ardent desire that this crisis comes to a grinding halt before it, God forbid, escalates,” Shehbaz said, addressing the Iranian president.</p>

<p>The PM also lauded Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi for visiting Pakistan during the military escalation, calling him an “outstanding diplomat” and stating that they had a “heart to heart discussion”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan came out of this conflict victorious … through our brave actions by our outstanding armed forces,” Shehbaz said.</p>
<p>“We wanted peace, we want peace and we will work for peace in the region through talks on the table and resolve our outstanding issues, including the Kashmir problem, according to the resolutions passed by the [United Nations] Security Council … and even by Indian Lok Sabha (parliament) back in 1954,” he added, speaking about when then-prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru committed to a plebiscite in the disputed territory.</p>
<p>“We are ready to talk, for the sake of peace on water issues with our neighbour,” he continued. “We are ready to talk to promote trade and also, counter-terrorism if they’re serious.</p>
<p>“But if they choose to remain aggressors, then we shall defend our territory … like we have done a few days ago,” he added. “But if they accept my offer of peace, then we will show that we really want peace, seriously and sincerely.”</p>
<p>According to <em>PTV News</em>, the PM touched down at Tehran’s Mehrabad Airport on Monday afternoon, where he was received by Iranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni, Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moqadam, Pakistani Ambassador to Iran Mudassar Tipu, and senior diplomatic officials.</p>

                <h2>ATC once again orders PTI’s Imran to take polygraph, photogrammetry test</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Lahore on Monday ordered that PTI founder and former premier Imran Khan undergo police polygraph and photogrammetry tests after his refusal.</p>
<p>The ATC allowed the police to conduct the polygraph (lie detection) and photogrammetric (facial and voice analysis) test on May 14, however, the ex-premier refused to undergo them.</p>
<p>Last week, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912687/imran-avoiding-polygraph-test-to-evade-truth-azma">assailed</a> the PTI founder for refusing the tests, saying that he either made excuses such as being asleep or eating or claimed that his lawyers were unavailable. She remarked that it appeared he had still not come to terms with being a convict serving court sentences in jail, and stressed that “he needed to understand he was in Adiala Jail, not at his Bani Gala residence.”</p>
<p>During today’s hearing, the police submitted a report to the judge about Imran’s refusal to take the test, arguing that the investigation could not be completed without the results.</p>
<p>Legal Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Javed Ahmed said, “The PTI founder has refused to conduct the polygraphic and photogrammatic test. He has refused to take the written test twice … [and] the oral test three times.</p>
<p>“We have to perform the polygraph and photogrammetry tests for the purpose of our investigation,” he stated.</p>
<p>The DSP told the court that police would cooperate with Imran, but stressed that he needed to cooperate with investigating officers, too.</p>
<p>“Justice will be seen,” he added.</p>
<p>The court ordered that the PTI founder take the tests and demanded that the results be submitted by June 9.</p>
<p>Imran, 71, has been imprisoned at the Adiala Jail for almost a year upon his conviction in four cases — two Toshakhana references, the cipher case, and the Iddat case, in which his wife, Bushra Bibi, is also jailed.</p>
<p>Imran’s sentences in the Toshakhana references were suspended while he was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1837519">acquitted</a> by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in the cipher case in June. An Islamabad district and sessions court had also recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845567">accepted the appeals</a> filed by Imran and his spouse against their conviction in the Iddat case.</p>
<p>Various courts have also acquitted him in several other cases filed against him since the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1752254">events of May 9, 2023</a> — the day when his first arrest had caused riots across the country, following which the state launched a crackdown against him and his party.</p></p>
