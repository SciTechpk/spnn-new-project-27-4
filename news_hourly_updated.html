                <h2>PM Shehbaz sets up committee, vows to resolve all issues concerning KP</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday vowed to resolve all the issues afflicting Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and set up a committee for the task, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/03-06-2025/pm-vows-to-resolve-all-issues-concerning-khyber-pakhtunkhwa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Addressing a representative jirga in Peshawar, he said the committee would deliberate on all demands and issues raised by the KP chief minister.</p>
<p>He added that the committee would sit together with tribal elders and the KP governor and chief minister to formulate recommendations in this regard, further saying that the federal government would give serious attention to the recommendations to benefit the province‚Äôs valiant people.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Shehbaz affirmed the immense sacrifices rendered by the people of KP in the fight against terrorism and said the federal government would stand by the province until the complete eradication of the menace.</p>
<p>The prime minister said that KP had received Rs700 billion since 2010 under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award as its one per cent share allocated for anti-terrorism efforts.</p>
<p>These funds were released to strengthen the provincial police force, develop the Counter-Terrorism Department and enhance the capacity of law enforcement agencies, he added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe decision to allocate 1pc of the NFC Award for KP, agreed by all provinces, was just and appropriate decision, as KP has remained the frontline province in the war against terrorism,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Highlighting the province‚Äôs unwavering commitment and support to Pakistan, the prime minister said that KP‚Äôs people had voted in favour of the country during the referendum and had stood by the armed forces through all challenges.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe sacrifices of KP‚Äôs people who laid down their lives and sustained injuries for the defence of Pakistan are deeply revered and will be remembered in golden words,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>Referring to the Army Public School attack on December 16, 2014, the prime minister paid tribute to the students and teachers who lost their lives in the brutal incident.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Speaking on recent security developments, PM Shehbaz said Pakistan had given a strong response to last month‚Äôs unprovoked Indian aggression under the leadership of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.</p>
<p>He reiterated that Pakistan‚Äôs decisive retaliation had frustrated India‚Äôs nefarious plans, adding that ‚ÄúIndia will never forget this decisive response of Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>The prime minister further shared that during recent visits to Turkiye, Iran, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan, leaders of these countries expressed joy over Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúhistoric victory‚Äù against India.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He said that Indian Prime Minister Modi was left ‚Äúfrustrated and in a state of panic‚Äù after the defeat.</p>
<p>Reaffirming Pakistan‚Äôs rights under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, the prime minister asserted that India could not deprive Pakistan of its rightful share of water and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-after-26-tourists-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-attack">suspend</a> the treaty unilaterally.</p>
<p>He emphasised the need to expand existing water storage capacity and accelerate work on major dam projects, including Diamer Bhasha and Dasu dams.</p>
<p>Calling for national unity in the face of external threats, PM Shehbaz appreciated the people of KP for offering special prayers for the country‚Äôs success against India.</p>
<p>The jirga was attended by KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, COAS Munir, federal and provincial ministers, senators, parliamentarians, the Peshawar corps commander and the provincial chief secretary and police chief.</p></p>

                <h2>CM Murad notes faint tremors ‚Äògood thing‚Äô as seismic activity continues in Karachi</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Tuesday said low-intensity tremors helped prevent major earthquakes as he attempted to allay <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915165/sindh-ig-says-78-of-213-escaped-prisoners-from-karachis-malir-jail-recaptured">panic</a> caused by the recent seismic activity that continued for the third day in Karachi.</p>
<p>The metropolis continued to witness faint tremors today, taking the tally since Sunday to 20, according to data provided by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD). Experts have previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say">pointed out</a> that such minor seismic activities ‚Äúpreempt‚Äù high-intensity earthquakes by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have also studied engineering [‚Ä¶] these (low-scale tremors) are a good thing. The earth is releasing its energy,‚Äù CM Shah said, responding to reporters‚Äô queries about yesterday‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915165/sindh-ig-says-78-of-213-escaped-prisoners-from-karachis-malir-jail-recaptured">jail break incident</a> in Karachi.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He explained that if the earth releases its seismic energy altogether, it could result in a major earthquake. ‚ÄúBut if it releases in bits, then it is better ‚Äî nothing is actually better ‚Äî but saves us from a big disaster,‚Äù Murad added.</p>
<p>The most recent tremor occurred at 11:52am and measured 2.0 on the Richter scale, with its <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/WKp4SfRW8Va3WHG36" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">epicentre</a> located 23 kilometres east of Malir, according to the PMD‚Äôs data.</p>
<p>Since Sunday ‚Äî when the series of minor quakes <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914834/karachi-experiences-36-magnitude-quake-with-quaidabad-as-epicentre">began</a> ‚Äî the total of tremors recorded near <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/tWkP5ThpLy3m5iDY6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Malir</a> is nine, five near the Defence Housing Authority, three near <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/f3E8rzVKFY8BwcbR6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quaidabad</a>, along with one each near <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/9jxYCPXSRymYrGTa7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gadap Town</a>, <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rocRpWYWyMR7GGUd9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Korangi</a> and <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/2Us67F7ygbKS7aAT9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DHA City</a> on the outskirts of Karachi.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914834/karachi-experiences-36-magnitude-quake-with-quaidabad-as-epicentre">3.6-magnitude jolt</a> from Sunday evening was the most significant, while the lowest measured was of 2.0 magnitude from today morning.</p>
<p>Karachi Chief Meteorologist Amir Hyder Laghari <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915067">pointed out</a> yesterday that there was a historical fault line which has become activated, causing frequent earthquakes in the city.</p>
<p>He said the fault is releasing its seismic energy, and when it‚Äôs spent, the tremors‚Äô magnitude will reduce. Laghari added he expected the small-scale jolts to end within a week.</p>
<p>Murad‚Äôs remarks today echoed opinions voiced by Laghari and other experts, who have said that the chances of a major quake in Karachi are low.</p>
<p>Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates ‚Äî the Arabian, Eurasian and Indian ‚Äî <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say#:~:text=Tectonic%20positioning">according to</a> geological engineer Muhammad Rehan, creating five seismic zones within the country.</p>
<p>Dr Imran Ahmed Khan of Karachi University‚Äôs Department of Geography said an imbalance between the Indian, Eurasian and Arabian plates may be causing the tremors in the city. He added that the quakes will likely stop when a balance between the plates has been achieved.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Dr Adnan Khan, associate professor at the KU‚Äôs Department of Geology, noted that a huge earthquake was unlikely in Karachi as the city was situated far from active plate boundaries.</p>
<p>‚ÄúKarachi lies on what‚Äôs called a ‚Äòpassive margin‚Äô, so the chances of a big earthquake happening there are low. Small earthquakes do happen sometimes, usually between 3 and 4 on the Richter scale, but they are not dangerous,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Dr Imran explained that the Indian tectonic plate is moving upward by about 4 to 5 centimetres every year in the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Eurasian plate is pushing against it. As these two plates press against each other, they build up pressure, and when the pressure becomes too much, it rebounds and is released as energy, causing earthquakes.</p>
<p>The country had witnessed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say">around 20</a> low-intensity earthquakes in the first half of February ‚Äî an average of more than one tremor each day.</p>
<p>In April, jolts were felt in parts of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905258">Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab</a> ‚Äî including Peshawar, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore ‚Äî <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903840">twice</a> that month.</p></p>
