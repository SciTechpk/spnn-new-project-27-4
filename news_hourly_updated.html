            <p><p>Iran‚Äôs President Masoud Pezeshkian landed in Islamabad on Saturday for a two-day visit, eyeing to reaffirm his commitment to elevate annual bilateral trade with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan has recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924349/dar-slams-israel-us-attacks-against-fellow-sco-member-iran-as-unacceptable">expressed solidarity</a> and a desire for cooperation with Iran, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927716/closer-pak-iran-cooperation-vital-to-securing-shared-interests-say-experts">experts say</a> is vital to securing shared interests in a shifting geopolitical environment.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian is paying a two-day official visit to Pakistan over the weekend, making it his first trip to Islamabad in his current role, the Foreign Office <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928047/iranian-president-to-visit-pakistan-on-saturday-fo">said</a>. Ahead of his trip, Pakistan yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919380/the-history-of-us-iran-tensions">pledged</a> to help defuse <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919380/the-history-of-us-iran-tensions">tensions</a> between Iran and the United States.</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz had met with Pezeshkian during his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913442/ready-to-talk-with-india-pm-shehbaz-says-during-meeting-with-iranian-president-in-tehran">visit to Iran</a> in late May, which was part of his regional tour to friendly countries aimed at expre¬≠ssing gratitude for their support during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">conflict with India</a>.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian is the second Iranian president to visit Pakistan in as many years. Late Ebrahim Raisi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1828957">visited</a> the country in April last year, just a month before he died in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1834463">helicopter crash</a>.</p>
<p>According to Iran‚Äôs state media <em><a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85903178/Pezeshkian-Iran-aims-to-expand-trade-with-Pakistan-to-10-billion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IRNA</a></em>, before departing for Pakistan, Pezeshkian emphasised the plan to elevate their annual trade exchanges to $10 billion. The two countries had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1829136">agreed</a> in April last year to boost trade over the next five years.</p>
<p>The president termed the trade relations between Tehran and Islamabad as ‚Äúgood‚Äù and identified boosting trade with Pakistan via land, air and sea as priorities for this trip, the report added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThrough Pakistan, Iran can connect to the Silk Road linking China and Pakistan, and the route can then extend through Iran to Europe,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Emphasising that security and border issues were of great importance to both Iran and Pakistan, he stressed that regional security must be achieved through cooperation, according to <em>IRNA</em>.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Pezeshkian noted that the two neighbours have ‚Äúenjoyed good, friendly, and deep-rooted relations‚Äù since Pakistan‚Äôs independence. ‚ÄúThe two countries cooperate in economic, scientific, cultural, and border areas, and a deep bond exists between the people of both sides,‚Äù he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian highlighted that during the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919798/ceasefire-brokered-with-iran-after-washington-request-for-liaison-qatars-pm-says">Israel-Iran war</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">United States‚Äô strikes</a> against its nuclear facilities, ‚ÄúPakistan was among the countries that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924349/dar-slams-israel-us-attacks-against-fellow-sco-member-iran-as-unacceptable">strongly condemned</a> this aggression and declared its readiness to provide any necessary support for Iran‚Äôs territorial integrity, as well as for the government and people of Iran‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to <em>IRNA</em>, the president also noted that ‚Äúthe enemy plans to create division among Muslims, but Iran will thwart the enemies‚Äô plots‚Äù, adding that Tehran aims to maintain unity and solidarity between Iran and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian had left for Pakistan earlier today, accompanied by a high-level delegation.</p>

                <h2>Karachi Police book 8 suspects under terror, murder charges for gunning down senior lawyer</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Darakshan Police on Saturday registered a case against eight nominated suspects under terrorism and murder charges for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928052/senior-lawyer-gunned-down-in-karachis-dha-police">killing</a> senior lawyer Khawaja Shamsul Islam and critically injuring his young son inside a mosque in Karachi‚Äôs Defence Housing Authority a day prior.</p>
<p>South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza had told <em>Dawn.com</em> on Friday that the firing took place after prayers at a mosque in DHA Phase 6. ‚ÄúAs advocate Khawaja Shamsul Islam and his son [Khawaja Daniyal, 25] were about to leave the mosque, a lone gunman apparently resorted to firing on them and fled,‚Äù the DIG had said.</p>
<p>The Darakshan Police registered a first information report (FIR) today upon the complaint of the victim‚Äôs brother and under Section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment), 302 (premeditated murder) and 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy brother Khawaja Shamsul Islam, along with his two young sons and two guards had gone to offer Friday prayers and attend funeral prayers at the Quran Academy mosque located on Khayaban-i-Rahat, Phase 6,‚Äù the FIR read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe was picking up his slippers at the staircase of the mosque when [the suspect] fired two shots at around 2:30pm. As a result, one bullet hit my brother and another hit his son. The suspect managed to escape while taking advantage of the rush.‚Äù</p>
<p>The complainant added that the victim‚Äôs younger son was unharmed in the incident and took his injured father to a private hospital in Clifton, while unidentified persons took the injured son to another private hospital in the same locale.</p>
<p>‚ÄúKhawaja Shamsul Islam expired during treatment while his son was admitted with critical injuries,‚Äù the FIR added.</p>
<p>The complainant alleged that the primary suspect, along with 15-20 accomplices, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1872404">attacked</a> the lawyer last November, in which he was shot twice and tortured. The case was registered with Clifton police under terror and other charges.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNow, the suspect, his two brothers and five other suspects attacked together ‚Ä¶ resulting in the death of the lawyer and serious injuries to his son,‚Äù the complainant stated, adding that the incident also triggered fear and chaos among the general public.</p>
<p>The complainant said he wanted legal proceedings against the nominated suspects over terrorism, murder charges and criminal conspiracy.</p>
<p>DIG Raza also told <em>Dawn.com</em>, ‚ÄúThe prime suspect has confessed to the crime in a recorded video message.‚Äù</p>
<p>On Friday, the DIG constituted a special team under the supervision of the South senior superintendent of police to arrest the suspects who murdered the advocate and injured his son.</p>
<p>He had added that the prime suspect was the son of a police constable deployed for Islam‚Äôs security in the past, as witnesses heard him saying that he had taken ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù for the murder of his father.</p>
<p>In a statement issued yesterday, the Karachi Bar Association condemned the murder of Islam and announced that its members would not appear before any court today to express solidarity with the slain senior lawyer.</p></p>
