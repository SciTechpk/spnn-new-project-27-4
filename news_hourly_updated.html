                <h2>Israel hits Iran nuclear facilities, missile factories as Tehran vows revenge</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Israel launched widescale strikes against Iran on Friday, saying it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders and that this was start of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.</p>
<p>Iranian media and witnesses <a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85860885/Israel-strikes-Tehran-and-other-cities" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> explosions including at the country‚Äôs main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, while Israel declared a state of emergency in anticipation of retaliatory missile and drone strikes.</p>
<p>Israel‚Äôs military said Iran launched about 100 drones toward Israel on Friday and that it was making an effort to shoot them down.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIran launched approximately 100 UAVs towards Israeli territory, which we are working to intercept,‚Äù military spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin told journalists. He added that Israel‚Äôs strikes on Iran involved 200 fighter jets striking about 100 targets across Iran.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs elite Revolutionary Guards corps said its top commander, Hossein Salami, was <a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85860936/IRGC-s-Chief-Commander-Maj-Gen-Hossein-Salami-assassinated" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">killed</a> and state media reported the unit‚Äôs headquarters in Tehran had been hit.</p>
<p>Several children had been killed in a strike on a residential area in the capital, it said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are at a decisive moment in Israel‚Äôs history,‚Äù Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a recorded video message.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMoments ago Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel‚Äôs very survival. This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.‚Äù</p>

<p>Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a statement that Israel had ‚Äúunleashed its wicked and bloody‚Äù hand in a crime against Iran and that it would receive ‚Äúa bitter fate for itself‚Äù.</p>
<p>An Israeli military official said Israel was striking ‚Äúdozens‚Äù of nuclear and military targets including the facility at Natanz in central Iran. The official said Iran had enough material to make 15 nuclear bombs within days.</p>
<p>The United States said it had no part in the operation, which raises the risk of a fresh escalation in tensions in the Middle East, a major oil producing region.</p>
<p>Alongside extensive air strikes, Israel‚Äôs Mossad spy agency led a series of covert sabotage operations inside Iran, <em>Axios</em> reported, citing a senior Israeli official. These operations were aimed at damaging Irans strategic missile sites and its air defence capabilities.</p>
<p>Iranian state media reported that at least two nuclear scientists, Fereydoun Abbasi and Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, were killed in Israeli strikes in Tehran.</p>
<p>Tel Aviv‚Äôs Ben Gurion Airport was closed until further notice, and Israel‚Äôs air defence units stood at high alert for possible retaliatory strikes from Iran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFollowing the pre-emptive strike by the State of Israel against Iran, a missile and UAV (drone) attack against the State of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate time frame,‚Äù Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.</p>
<p>Israeli military Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir said tens of thousands of soldiers had been called up and ‚Äúprepared across all borders‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are amidst a historic campaign unlike any other. This is a critical operation to prevent an existential threat, by an enemy who is intent on destroying us,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Israeli Minister Gideon Saar was holding ‚Äúmarathon of calls‚Äù with counterparts around the world regarding Israel‚Äôs attack on Iran, the foreign ministry said in a statement.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#us-not-involved" id="us-not-involved" title="Permalink"></a>US ‚Äònot involved‚Äô</h2>
<p>US President Donald Trump said that Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb and that the US was hoping to get back to the negotiating table, in an interview with <em>Fox News</em> after the start of the Israeli air strikes on Iran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will see,‚Äù <em>Fox News</em> reporter Jennifer Griffin quoted Trump as saying in a post on X.</p>
<p>Trump would convene a meeting of the National Security Council on Friday morning, the White House said. He had said on Thursday an Israeli strike on Iran ‚Äúcould very well happen‚Äù but reiterated his hopes for a peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>The US military is planning for the full range of contingencies in the Middle East, including the possibility that it might have to help evacuate American civilians, a US official told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs armed forces spokesperson said Israel and its chief ally the United States would pay a ‚Äúheavy price‚Äù for the attack, accusing Washington of providing support for the operation.</p>
<p>While the US tried to distance itself from Israel‚Äôs military operation, an Israeli
official told public broadcaster Kan that Israel had coordinated with Washington on Iran.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States was not involved in the strikes and Tel Aviv had acted unilaterally for self-defence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,‚Äù Rubio said in a statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>The State Department issued an advisory saying that all US government employees in Israel and their family members should ‚Äúshelter in place until further notice‚Äù.</p>
<p>The attacks triggered sharp falls in stock prices in Asian trade on Friday, led by a selloff in US futures, while oil prices jumped as investors scurried to safe havens such as gold and the Swiss franc.</p>
<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned any military escalation in the Middle East, said deputy UN spokesperson Farhan Haq.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Secretary-General asks both sides to show maximum restraint, avoiding at all costs a descent into deeper conflict, a situation that the region can hardly afford,‚Äù Haq said.</p>

<p>A US official said those talks were still scheduled to proceed despite the Israeli attack.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said on Friday that it was forced to act based on new intelligence information showing that Iran was ‚Äúapproaching the point of no return‚Äù in the development of a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn recent months, this program has accelerated significantly, bringing the regime significantly closer to obtaining a nuclear weapon,‚Äù it said in a statement, without disclosing the purported evidence.</p>
<p>A source familiar with US intelligence reports said there had been no recent change in the US intelligence assessment that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and that Khamenei had not authorised the restarting of the nuclear weapons programme that was shuttered in 2003.</p></p>

<p>AHMEDABAD: More than 200 people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916728/1-survivor-over-200-killed-as-air-india-plane-crashes-after-take-off-in-ahmedabad">killed</a> when an Air India plane bound for London with 242 people on board crashed shortly after takeoff, authorities said on Thursday, in what is said to be the world‚Äôs worst aviation disaster in a decade.</p>
<p>Only one person is known to have survived, as the plane came down in a residential area, crashing onto a medical college hostel just outside the airport at lunchtime.</p>
<p>The passengers included 169 Indian nationals, 53 British, seven Portuguese, and a Canadian. Two pilots and 10 cabin crew were also aboard, according to <em>AFP</em>.</p>

<p>According to air traffic control at Ahmedabad Airport, Air India‚Äôs flight 171 ‚Äî bound for London Gatwick airport ‚Äî departed at 1:39 pm local time (0809 GMT) from runway 23. It gave a Mayday call, signalling an emergency, but thereafter there was no response from the aircraft.</p>
<p>Footage of the crash showed the plane taking off over a residential area and then disappearing from view, before a huge ball of fire and smoke is seen rising into the sky from beyond the houses.</p>
<p>Another video circulating on social media showed an aircraft rapidly losing altitude ‚Äî with its nose up ‚Äî before it hit a building and exploded into an orange ball of fire.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs <em>CNN News-18</em> said the plane crashed on top of the dining area of state-run B.J. Medical College hostel, killing many medical students as well.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄòSole survivor‚Äô</strong></p>
<p>City police chief G.S. Malik told <em>Reuters</em> that 204 bodies had been recovered from the crash site. Vidhi Chaudhary, another senior police officer, said they had found one survivor, who was in seat 11A.</p>
<p>Indian media identified the fortunate man as UK resident Ramesh Viswashkumar.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThirty seconds after takeoff, there was a loud noise and then the plane crashed,‚Äù the 40-year-old told the <em>Hindustan Times.</em></p>

<p>‚ÄúIt all happened so quickly,‚Äù he told the paper from his hospital bed.</p>
<p>Police chief Malik said the bodies recovered could include both passengers and people killed on the ground.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen I got up, there were bodies all around me. I was scared. I stood up and ran. There were pieces of the plane all around me,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSomeone grabbed hold of me and put me in an ambulance and brought me to the hospital.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that his brother Ajay was seated in a different row on the plane. ‚ÄúHe was travelling with me and I cant find him anymore. Please help me find him, he said.</p>
<p>According to the <em>BBC</em>, Vishwash has a wife and child and has lived in the UK for many years. His relatives, who had gathered at the family home in Leicester, said they were awaiting more information.</p>
<p>Federal minister C.R. Patil said the dead included Vijay Rupani, a former chief minister of Gujarat state.</p>
<p>The Indian aviation minister‚Äôs office said PM Narendra Modi, whose home state is Gujarat, had told it to ensure all support was extended to the rescue efforts.</p>
<p>Ahmedabad Airport, which suspended all flight operations after the crash, said it was operational again but with limited flights. The airport is operated by India‚Äôs Adani Group conglomerate.</p>
<p>The last fatal plane crash in India, the world‚Äôs third largest aviation market and its fastest growing, was in 2020 and involved Air India Express, the airline‚Äôs low-cost arm.</p>
<p>Tata will provide Rs10 million ($117,000) to the families of each of the dead, cover all medical expenses of those injured and help rebuild the hostel of the medical college, chairman N. Chandrasekaran said.</p>
<p><strong>First Dreamliner crash</strong></p>
<p>Aviation tracking site <em>Flightradar24</em> said the plane was a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, one of the most modern passenger aircraft in service.</p>
