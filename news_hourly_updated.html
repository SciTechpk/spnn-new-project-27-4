                <h2>Section 144 announced across Punjab from Muharram 1-10</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Punjab government has imposed Section 144 across the province from Muharram 1 to 10 to ensure peace and religious harmony.</p>
<p><a class="link--external" href="https://punjabpolice.gov.pk/faqs#:~:text=What%20is%20section%20144%20and%20what%20does%20it%20imply?,-Top&amp;text=Section%20144%20of%20the%20Code,a%20specific%20period%20of%20time." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Section 144</a> is a legal provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period.</p>
<p>A Punjab Home Department order issued on Friday, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, stated that the section was imposed to prevent ‚Äúdisruption of public peace and instability‚Äù, along with ensuring the public‚Äôs ‚Äúsafety and security of lives and property‚Äù.</p>
<p>The notification cited ‚Äúpotential threat to the public peace and tranquillity, religious harmony, and general law and order situation in the province from miscreants, violent extremists, and antisocial elements‚Äù.</p>
<p>For the first 10 days of Muharram, which is likely to begin on <a class="link--external" href="https://hamariweb.com/islam/islamic-calendar.aspx#google_vignette" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">June 27 or 28</a> in Pakistan, the government has prohibited ‚Äúinnovations of Muharram processions [and] <em>majalis</em>‚Äù.</p>
<p>It has also banned carrying any article that may be used as a weapon of offence ‚Äî including bamboo sticks (batons), knives, daggers and spears ‚Äî as well as combustible material at public places without a competent authority‚Äôs permission.</p>
<p>There will also be a complete ban on slogans and gestures ‚Äúthat may incite public sentiments, or directly or indirectly hit the belief of any sect, community or group‚Äù.</p>
<p>Dissemination of information or making ‚Äúabusive or derogatory remarks through any information system or device‚Äù that provoke or are likely to provoke interfaith, sectarian or racial hatred will be prohibited as well.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Spectators will be barred from the rooftops of buildings on the routes and in front of shops located along the routes during processions, the order added. It further banned the construction of <em>morchas</em> (firing bays) on rooftops of such buildings and the collection of stones, bricks, bottles or garbage along the procession routes.</p>
<p>On Muharram 9 and 10, pillion riding will also be prohibited except for senior citizens, women and law enforcement personnel, the order added.</p>

<p>The Punjab home department has started <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917053">taking measures</a>, including deployment of armed forces where required, to ensure peace in the province during Muharram.</p>
<p>It has sought each district‚Äôs need for army and Rangers troops, along with requirements for mobile jamming, with specific location and duration. It has also stated that a ban on loudspeakers should be fully enforced under the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1156305">Punjab Sound Systems (Regulation) Act 2015</a> during Muharram.</p>
<p>Deputy commissioners have been asked to discuss and develop contingency plans, update lists of firebrand orators to be gagged or banned, and prevent misuse of loudspeakers during the month.</p>
<p>The DCs have also been informed about the guidelines for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918568/home-dept-issues-sops-for-sabeels-during-muharram">setting up <em>sabeels</em></a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918538/army-rangers-to-help-police-maintain-peace-during-muharram">Rawalpindi</a>, five companies of the Pakistan Army and six companies of Rangers will be deployed to help the administration and police maintain law and order.</p>
<p>The district administration has banned the entry of 169 religious leaders and <em>zakireen</em> in the district and also issued gagging orders for 89 clerics during Muharram. As many as 184 people have been placed in the Fourth Schedule.</p>
<p>Section 144 was also imposed during Muharram in Punjab <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844201">last year</a>, with the Pakistan Army and Rangers being <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844623">deployed</a> across the country after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1843992">requests</a> from all provincial governments.</p>
<p>While the Punjab government had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1843876">requested</a> the interior ministry to shut down social media apps from Muharram 6 to 11 in a bid to avoid sectarian violence, the ministry had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844147">deferred</a> the decision. However, Facebook was reportedly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1846386">restricted</a> across Pakistan on Muharram 10, Yaum-i-Ashura.</p>
<p>In the past, militants have targeted Muharram processions several times, including a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1767347">bomb blast</a> that killed more than 40 people attending the main Ashura procession on Karachi‚Äôs MA Jinnah Road in December 2009.</p></p>

                <h2>Govt to recommend Trump for Nobel Peace Prize for ‚Äòdecisive diplomatic intervention‚Äô in Pak-India crisis</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Pakistani government has decided to formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his ‚Äúdecisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership‚Äù during the recent India-Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">crisis</a>.</p>
<p>The move by Pakistan was another indication of improved bilateral ties with the US.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/GovtofPakistan/status/1936159807326900577?t=_SkHHZ9STzyca0C7Nrq5_g&amp;s=19" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> shared on X, the government said the international community had ‚Äúbore witness to unprovoked and unlawful Indian aggression, which constituted a grave violation of Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity, resulting in the tragic loss of innocent lives, including women, children, and the elderly‚Äù.</p>

<p>Following the Indian aggression, Pakistan ‚Äúlaunched Operation Bunyanum Marsoos  ‚Äî a measured, resolute, and precise military response‚Äù, the post read.</p>
<p>It noted that the response was executed to exercise the country‚Äôs ‚Äúfundamental right to self-defence‚Äù and ‚Äúcarefully to re-establish deterrence‚Äù, defending its ‚Äúterritorial integrity while consciously avoiding civilian harm‚Äù.</p>
<p>The post further read that ‚Äúat a moment of heightened regional turbulence‚Äù, Trump ‚Äúdemonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi‚Äù.</p>
<p>It continued that the US president ‚Äúde-escalated a rapidly deteriorating situation, ultimately securing a ceasefire and averting a broader conflict between the two nuclear states that would have had catastrophic consequences for millions of people in the region and beyond‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis intervention stands as a testament to his [Trump‚Äôs] role as a genuine peacemaker and his commitment to conflict resolution through dialogue,‚Äù it added.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The government also acknowledged President Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúsincere <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910785/fo-reiterates-support-for-trump-offer-to-resolve-kashmir-issue">offers</a>‚Äù to help resolve the longstanding dispute of Jammu and Kashmir between India and Pakistan ‚Äî an issue that lies at the heart of regional instability.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDurable peace in South Asia would remain elusive until the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Jammu and Kashmir,‚Äù it observed.</p>
<p>The government noted that President Trump‚Äôs leadership during the 2025 Pakistan-India crisis ‚Äúmanifestly showcases the continuation of his legacy of pragmatic diplomacy and effective peace-building‚Äù.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the post read that Pakistan remains hopeful that Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúearnest efforts‚Äù will continue to contribute towards regional and global stability,  particularly in the context of ongoing crises in the Middle East, including the humanitarian <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918018">tragedy</a> unfolding in Gaza and the deteriorating <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917457/iran-state-tv-resumes-programming-after-israeli-attack-on-tehran-trump-reiterates-negotiations?_gl=1*1r5z0it*_ga*QUtLaWptVVNieFVlMFppeHc2Rl9TcWk0SW5zbHpRaGZVMjdfQnhWb3N6SHZvZHE5NjE3Mm5SQjRucVBhOUhCVQ..*_ga_C521GRS8DF*MTc1MDQ1NzIzMC40OC4xLjE3NTA0NTc5ODAuMC4wLjA.">escalation</a> involving Iran.</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly said that the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours agreed to a ceasefire after talks mediated by the US, and that the hostilities ended after he urged the countries to focus on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911719">trade</a> instead of war.</p>
<p>However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917877/modi-maintains-there-was-no-us-mediation-in-ceasefire-with-pakistan">maintained</a> in a recent conversation with Trump that the ceasefire was achieved through talks between the two countries‚Äô militaries and not US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912153">mediation</a>.</p>

<p>Shortly later, in a <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114717932061341718" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on his Truth Social platform, Trump complained that he had been overlooked by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for his mediating role in conflicts between India and Pakistan, as well as Serbia and Kosovo.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI won‚Äôt get a Nobel Peace Prize for this, I won‚Äôt get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the war between India and Pakistan, I won‚Äôt get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the war between Serbia and Kosovo, I won‚Äôt get a Nobel Peace Prize for keeping peace between Egypt and Ethiopia,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Trump campaigned for office as a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20what%20I%20want%20to%20be%3A%20a%20peacemaker%20and%20unifier.">peacemaker</a>‚Äù who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end wars in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging five months into his presidency.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>Trump‚Äôs claims for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910973">Abraham Accords</a> being able to ‚Äúunify the Middle East‚Äù have yet to be realised, with war breaking out between Israel and Iran, and no end in sight to the relentless bombardment by US ally Israel in Gaza.</p>
<p>Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize nominations from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years.</p>
<p>He has made no secret of his irritation at missing out on the prestigious award, bringing it up as recently as February during an Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Former US president Barack Obama <a href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home">won the prize</a> soon after taking office in 2009, and Trump complained during his 2024 election campaign that his Democratic predecessor was not worthy of the honour.</p>
