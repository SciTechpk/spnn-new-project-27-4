            <p><p>Nine passengers died and 30 others were injured after the bus they were travelling on fell into a ditch near Balkassar Interchange in Punjab’s Chakwal district on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson of Chakwal Rescue 1122, the bus was heading to Lahore from Islamabad when one of its tyres burst near the Balkassar Interchange on the Islamabad-Lahore Motorway (M2).</p>
<p>The driver lost control of the bus, causing the vehicle to fall into a ditch and overturn.</p>
<p>“Nine people died in the accident and 30 were injured,” Dr Saeed Akhter, chief executive officer of the Chakwal District Health Authority (DHA), said in a statement.</p>
<p>It added that Chakwal Deputy Commissioner Sarah Hayat and Assistant Commissioner Zeeshan Sharif also visited the injured at the District Healthquarters (DHQ) Hospital.</p>
<p>DC Hayat, who was briefed on the accident’s details, directed that all possible medical facilities be provided to the wounded.</p>
<p>Eight passengers died on the spot, while one succumbed to her injuries at the hospital, according to an earlier police statement. The bus driver was among the deceased.</p>

<p>According to the Rescue 1122 statement, there were over 40 passengers on the bus.</p>
<p>As per the list issued by the rescue service, an eight-month and a one-year-old infant were among four children who lost their lives. The eldest person among the deceased was 45 years old, while the injured were aged between 16 and 55 years.</p>
<p>Two sisters aged 14 and two years were among the dead, while their mother was injured. A woman from Philippines, identified as Emy Dela Cruz and married in Lahore, was also among the wounded.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 had dispatched six rescue vehicles to the crash site, while personnel of National Highways and Motorway Police, the Chakwal police and a team of the Frontier Works Organisation also reached the incident site.</p>
<p>Some of the injured were rushed to Kallar Kahar Tehsil Headquarters Hospital, while others and the bodies were taken to the Chakwal DHQ Hospital.</p>
<p>Dr Mukhtar Sarwar Niazi, medical superintendent at the DHQ Hospital, told <em>Dawn.com</em> earlier today that four out of 12 injured persons brought there were “critically injured” and were being referred to Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>Chakwal District Police Officer Ahmed Mohiuddin took notice of the incident and sent a team comprising senior police officials. “The site has been cordoned off and police are acting as per law”, a spokesperson of Chakwal Police said.</p>
<p>Chakwal Rescue and Safety Officer Shaukat Ali said: “Our rescue teams responded with professional expertise, providing immediate medical aid to the injured and transporting the deceased to the hospital.”</p>
<p>He urged the public to ensure complete vehicle fitness checks — especially tyre, brake and steering system inspections — before embarking on long journeys to prevent such tragic incidents.</p>
<p>Fatal road accidents on highways <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906089">occur frequently</a> in Pakistan, mainly due to overspeeding, hazardous overtaking and disregard for traffic rules.</p>

            <p><p>The death toll from floods in Gilgit-Baltistan reached 10 as rescue and search operations continued across the region and stranded tourists were moved to safer locations, officials said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudburst-induced</a> floods wreaked havoc across the region. The flood-related <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829">death toll</a> in the region rose to five on Tuesday, after four lost their lives and 15 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719">went missing</a> on Monday.</p>
<p>The body of an unidentified woman was recovered from the Indus River in Minar, Chilas, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said in a statement on Sunday.</p>
<p>“The body could be that of one of the tourists swept away at the Babusar Highway,” he said.</p>
<p>At least three tourists were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">killed</a>, four others were injured and 15 went missing after floods triggered by heavy rain swept through GB’s Babusar area in Diamer district on Monday.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926705/karakoram-highway-reopened-as-rescue-aid-efforts-continue-in-flood-hit-gb#:~:text=Speaking%20about%20the%20search%20operation%20in%20Babusar%2C%20Faraq%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CThere%20may%20be%2010%20to%2012%20missing%20tourists%20at%20the%20Babusar%20valley%20as%20a%20search%20operation%20was%20ongoing.%E2%80%9D">speaking</a> about the search operation yesterday, Faraq had said there may be 10 to 12 missing tourists at Babusar valley as a search operation continued.</p>
<p>In today’s statement, Faraq said flood-related incidents in the region have claimed 10 lives. Seven <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20so%20far%2C%2010%20fatalities%20and%20four%20injuries%20have%20been%20reported.%20Seven%20deaths%20were%20reported%20from%20Babusar%2C%20two%20from%20Thore%20Valley%20(Dia%C2%ADmer)%20and%20another%20from%20Astore%20district.">deaths</a> were reported from Babusar, two from Thore Valley (Dia­mer) and another from Astore district.</p>
<p>“Search operations are underway on Babusar Highway by personnel of the Pakistani Army, district administration and other institutions,” he said, adding that rescue and relief operations were also underway in Ghanche, Ghizer and Gilgit.</p>
<p>Most tourists trapped in Ferry Meadows have been rescued and moved to a safe place, Faraq said, adding that the Silk Road had been restored for all types of traffic.</p>
<p>“At least Rs20 billion worth of damage has been caused by flooding in Gilgit-Baltistan,” he said.</p>
<p>“The province runs on grants and aid; it will be difficult redressal for the provincial government alone.</p>
<p>“The federal government should announce a separate reasonable grant for the relief of flood disasters.”</p>
<p>A day earlier, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan appe­aled to the federal government for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab">Rs7bn in emergency funds</a> to deal with climate-induced disasters that approximately “caused damages exceeding Rs20bn across the region.”</p>
<p>He said unprecedented floods had impacted seven districts, with Diamer being the worst affected. “People in GB are facing daily flood events. At least one flood occurs every day,” he said.</p>
<p>The chief minister said that 300 homes were destroyed, 200 were partially damaged, 40 water channels in 30 villages were swept away and 15 kilometres of roads, bridges, agricultural land, crops and public and private infrastructure were severely damaged.</p>
<p>He noted that only Rs1bn was allocated in the GB budget for emergencies and that the local government is also burdened with Rs3bn in liabilities from past disaster rehabilitation efforts.</p></p>

            <p><p>Israel declared a “tactical pause” in fighting in parts of Gaza on Sunday and said it would allow the UN and aid agencies to open secure land routes to tackle a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926644/quarter-of-gaza-hasnt-eaten-for-days-wfp">deepening hunger crisis</a>.</p>
<p>Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza on March 2 after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895179">ceasefire talks</a> broke down. In late May, it began allowing a small trickle of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914097">aid</a> to resume, amid warnings of a wave of starvation.</p>
<p>Yesterday alone, over 50 more Palestinians had been killed in Israeli strikes and shootings, some as they waited near aid distribution centres, the Palestinian civil defence agency said.</p>
<p>The pause in fighting would be limited to areas where the military says Israeli troops are not currently operating — Al-Mawasi, Deir el-Balah and Gaza City — and last from 10am (12pm PKT) until 8pm every day.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>The military also claimed it had begun air-dropping food into the territory and rejected allegations it was using starvation as a weapon against Palestinian civilians.</p>
<p>In a statement, the army said it coordinated its decisions with the UN and international organisations to “increase the scale of humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip”.</p>
<p>There was no immediate official response from the UN or non-governmental aid agencies operating in Gaza, and privately sceptical humanitarian sources said they were waiting to see the results on the ground of the Israeli announcement.</p>
<p>The Israeli statement added that “designated secure routes” had been opened across all of Gaza to enable the safe passage of UN and humanitarian aid organisation convoys delivering and distributing food and medicine.</p>
<p>The Israeli military insisted these operations, alongside its ongoing campaign against Palestinian armed groups, should disprove “the false claim of deliberate starvation in the Gaza Strip”.</p>
<p>Before Israel announced the airborne delivery of seven pallets of food, the United Arab Emirates had said it would restart aid drops and Britain said it would work with partners, including Jordan, to assist them.</p>
<p>“We ask God and our Arab brothers to work harder to reach a ceasefire before we all die,” Gaza resident Hossam Sobh told <em>AFP</em>, adding that he had feared death as he recovered a bag of flour under the nose of an Israeli tank.</p>

<p>The humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territory has gravely deteriorated in recent days, with more than 100 NGOs warning this week that “mass starvation” was spreading in Gaza.</p>
<p>On Telegram, the Israeli military announced it “carried out an airdrop of humanitarian aid as part of the ongoing efforts to allow and facilitate the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip”.</p>
<p>Humanitarian chiefs are deeply sceptical that air drops can deliver enough food safely to tackle the deepening hunger crisis facing Gaza’s more than two million inhabitants.</p>
<p>But British Prime Minister Keir Starmer backed the idea, vowing to work with Jordan to restart air drops. The United Arab Emirates said it would resume air drops “immediately”.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#starving-civilians" id="starving-civilians" title="Permalink"></a>‘Starving civilians’</h2>
<p>A number of Western and Arab governments carried out <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1818770/us-makes-its-first-gaza-aid-airdrop">air drops</a> in Gaza in 2024, when aid deliveries by land also faced Israeli restrictions, but many in the humanitarian community consider them ineffective.</p>
<p>“Air drops will not reverse the deepening starvation,” said Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.</p>
<p>“They are expensive, inefficient and can even kill starving civilians.”</p>

<p>Israel’s military insists it does not limit the number of trucks going into Gaza, and alleges that UN agencies and relief groups are not collecting aid once it is inside the territory.</p>
<p>But humanitarian organisations accuse the army of imposing excessive restrictions, while tightly controlling road access within Gaza.</p>
<p>A separate aid operation is under way through the controversial Israeli- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which has faced fierce international criticism after Israeli fire killed nearly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923326">800 aid seekers</a> near distribution points since May 27.</p>

<p>Much of Gaza now lies in ruins after 15 months of fighting, which erupted on October 7, 2023 when thousands of Hamas-led gunmen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1779807">attacked</a> Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip, resulting in the deaths of 1,219 people, according to Israeli tallies, and abducting 251 hostages into Gaza.</p>
<p>The Israeli campaign in response has killed at least 59,733 Palestinians and destroyed much of the housing and infrastructure in the enclave, including the hospital system. The death toll is feared to be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884398">much higher</a> due to thousands still <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-death-toll-how-many-palestinians-has-israels-campaign-killed-2024-07-25/#:~:text=IS%20THE%20GAZA%20DEATH%20TOLL%20COMPREHENSIVE%3F" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">missing</a> under the rubble.</p></p>
