                <h2>Fuel prices set for fresh hike amid global trends</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Prices of petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) are expected to increase by Rs5.25 and Rs6.50 per litre, respectively, for the upcoming fortnight starting July 16, owing to a rise in global oil prices and import premiums.</p>
<p>According to informed sources, the ex-depot price of petrol is projected to rise by about 2pc to Rs272.04 per litre, while HSD is likely to see a 2.5pc increase to approximately Rs279.48 per litre. The final prices will be announced after government approval.</p>
<p>Currently, petrol is priced at Rs266.79 per litre following a Rs8.36 per litre <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917324">hike</a> on June 30. Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws, and private vehicles, petrol has a direct impact on the budgets of middle- and lower-income households.</p>
<p>Diesel, which fuels heavy transport, agricultural machinery, and trains, stands at Rs272.98 per litre after a Rs10.39 hike earlier this month. Its price is considered highly inflationary, influencing the cost of food and other essential goods. Transporters have already begun adjusting fares in anticipation of the expected increase.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Petrol and diesel rates may rise by Rs5.25 and Rs6.50 per litre</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast, the prices of kerosene and light diesel oil are projected to decline by Rs3.80 and Rs2.25 per litre, respectively.</p>
<p>Despite zero general sales tax (GST) on petroleum products, the government is currently collecting close to Rs98 per litre in total levies on both petrol and diesel. This includes a petroleum development levy (PDL) of Rs78.02 on petrol and Rs77.01 on diesel and HOBC, along with a Rs2.25 per litre climate support levy (CSL). Additionally, a customs duty of Rs20-21 per litre is levied on both fuels, whether imported or locally refined.</p>
<p>Oil marketing companies and dealers are earning around Rs17 per litre as combined distribution and retail margins.</p>
<p>Petrol and diesel remain the primary drivers of fuel consumption, with monthly sales between 700,000 and 800,000 tonnes, compared to just 10,000 tonnes of kerosene.</p>
<p>In FY24, the government collected Rs1.161tr through the petroleum levy and aims to increase this by 27pc to Rs1.470tr in FY25. Despite zero GST, petroleum products continue to serve as a significant source of revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Oil falls 1pc</strong></p>
<p>According to a <em>Reuters</em> report, oil prices edged lower on Monday, as investors weighed new threats from US President Donald Trump for sanctions on buyers of Russian oil that may affect global supplies, while still worried about Trump’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901770">tariffs.</a></p>
<p>Brent crude futures fell 79 cents, or 1.12pc, to $69.57 a barrel by 1:04 pm EDT (1704 GMT). US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down $1.07, also 1.56pc, to $67.38.</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924158">announced</a> new weapons for Ukraine and threatened to hit buyers of Russian exports with sanctions unless Russia agrees to a peace deal in 50 days.</p>
<p>Oil prices rallied early, on expectations that Washington would impose steeper sanctions. But prices retreated as traders weighed the 50-day deadline.</p>
<p>“The market took it as a negative because there seemed to be a lot of time to negotiate,” said Phil Flynn, senior analyst with Price Futures Group.</p>

                <h2>US top court allows Trump to resume Education Department dismantling</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A divided United States supreme court gave US President Donald Trump the green light on Monday to resume dismantling the Education Department.</p>
<p>The conservative-dominated court, in an unsigned order, lifted a stay that had been placed by a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897782">federal district judge</a> on mass layoffs at the department.</p>
<p>The three liberal justices on the nine-member panel dissented.</p>
<p>Trump pledged during his White House campaign to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870463">eliminate the Education Department</a>, which was created by an act of Congress in 1979, and he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899315">moved</a> in March to slash its workforce by nearly half.</p>
<p>Trump instructed Education Secretary <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1873654">Linda McMahon</a> to “put herself out of a job”.</p>

</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Around 20 states joined teachers’ unions in challenging the move in court, arguing that the Republican president was violating the principle of separation of powers by encroaching on Congress’s prerogatives.</p>
<p>In May, District Judge Myong Joun <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899534">ordered</a> the reinstatement of hundreds of fired Education Department employees.</p>
<p>The supreme court lifted the judge’s order without explanation, just days after another ruling that cleared the way for Trump to carry out mass firings of federal workers in other government departments.</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a dissent joined by justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, said in the Education ruling that “only Congress has the power to abolish the Department”.</p>
<p>“The majority is either willfully blind to the implications of its ruling or naïve, but either way the threat to our Constitution’s separation of powers is grave,” Sotomayor said.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the federal government has had a limited role in education in the US, with only about 13 per cent of funding for primary and secondary schools coming from federal coffers, the rest being funded by states and local communities.</p>
<p>But federal funding is invaluable for low-income schools and students with special needs. And the federal government has been essential in enforcing key civil rights protections for students.</p>

<p>After returning to the White House <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886576">in January</a>, Trump directed federal agencies to prepare sweeping workforce reduction plans as part of wider efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — previously headed by Elon Musk — to downsize the government.</p>
<p>Trump has moved to fire tens of thousands of government employees and slash programmes — targeting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1888253">diversity initiatives</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899315">abolishing</a> the Education Department, the US humanitarian aid agency <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889724">USAID</a> and others.</p></p>
