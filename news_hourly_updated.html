                <h2>‘You cannot snatch even a drop from Pakistan,’ PM Shehbaz warns India on restricting water flow</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday warned India against any designs on the Indus River, saying that it could not snatch “even one drop” of water belonging to Pakistan amid tensions over the share of hydel resources in the region.</p>
<p>India in April held the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">abeyance</a> following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">termed</a> any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907454">considering</a> court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920611/pakistan-hails-hague-courts-supplemental-award-in-indus-waters-case-says-india-cant-sideline-arbitration-process">supplemental award</a> by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague in June held that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. India, in response, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920611/pakistan-hails-hague-courts-supplemental-award-in-indus-waters-case-says-india-cant-sideline-arbitration-process#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIndia%20has%20never,the%20ministry%20maintained.">did not recognise</a> the court or its decisions. A day ago, the PCA issued an “Award on Issues of General Interpretation of the IWT” in the Indus Waters case, stating that India must <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930219">generally “let flow” the waters</a> of the western rivers for Pakistan’s “unrestricted use”.</p>
<p>Addressing a ceremony in Islamabad today, the prime minister said: “I want to tell the enemy today that if you threaten to hold our water, then keep this in mind that you cannot snatch even one drop from Pakistan.”</p>
<p>The prime minister warned that if India attempted such an act, “you will be again taught such a lesson that you will be left holding your ears.”</p>
<p>“Our air force shot down six of their jets, among which four of them were Rafales,” PM Shehbaz added.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The prime minister’s warning comes a day after former foreign minister and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari termed the IWT’s suspension an attack on the Indus Valley civilisation and said the nation would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930241/pakistan-wont-back-down-if-india-forces-war-declares-bilawal">not back down</a> if New Delhi forced it into war.</p>
<p>“If war is waged, then from the land of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai we will send a message to the Modi government that we do not retreat, we do not bow down, and if you dare think about launching an attack on the Indus River, then the people of every province of Pakistan will be ready to confront you,” he had said.</p>
<p>Similarly, while on a weekend visit to the United States, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930030/coas-says-india-wont-be-allowed-to-choke-indus-river">reportedly warned</a> that Pakistan would never allow India to choke the Indus River and would defend its water rights at all costs, even if the forces would have to destroy any controversial dam that India sought to build on it.</p>
<p>“We will wait for India to build a dam, and when they do so, we will destroy it,” he reportedly told members of the Pakistani-American community in Tampa, Florida. “The Indus River is not the Indians’ family property. We have no shortage of resources to undo the Indian designs to stop the river.”</p>

<p>The prime minister also conveyed his wishes for Independence Day to the representatives of the Christian, Hindu, Sikh and Parsi communities present at the event.</p>
<p>“The brothers and sisters of the minority communities also played an integral role in the movement for Pakistan,” he said, adding that not only did they play a role in the founding of the country, but also played a role in its development of the country.</p>
<p>Speaking on the May conflict between Pakistan and India, the prime minister said: “The way we smashed the enemy in this conflict, they will remember it for a lifetime.”</p>
<p>He called upon the youth to play a role in the development of Pakistan and announced that 100,000 laptops would be distributed amongst the high achievers all over the country.</p></p>

                <h2>FM Dar to visit Dhaka on Aug 23 amid rapid advance in Pak-Bangladesh relations</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is set to visit Dhaka on August 23 amid a rapid advance and warming in bilateral relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The two countries were once one nation but split following a bloody civil war, which saw the territory previously referred to as ‘East Pakistan’ seceding to form the independent nation of Bangladesh. In the years since the split between Pakistan and Bangladesh, Dhaka’s leaders — especially the ousted regime of Sheikh Hasina — stayed firmly in the Indian camp, preferring to maintain close ties with New Delhi and keeping Islamabad at arm’s length.</p>
<p>However, ever since a popular uprising that saw Hasina’s government toppled in August of last year, with the deposed premier fleeing to her old ally India, there has been a thaw in ties between the two capitals, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.</p>
<p>Dar was previously due to visit Bangladesh in April. Questioned today (Tuesday) by <em>Dawn.com</em> about reports of his visit to Bangladesh on Aug 23, he confirmed: “Yes”.</p>
<p>Bangladesh’s leading news agency <em>Dhaka Tribune</em> had <a class="link--external" href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/388157/pakistan-deputy-pm-due-in-bangladesh-august-23" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> the same last week, adding that Dar was due on Aug 23 to “discuss ways to strengthen coordination with Bangladesh”.</p>
<p>The report had said that FM Dar would have a meeting with Bangladesh Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain on Aug 24, in addition to his other engagements.</p>
<p>Last month, Paki­stan and Bangladesh <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926160/pakistan-bd-agree-on-visa-free-entry-for-officials">agreed to grant visa-free entry</a> to holders of diplomatic and official passports from the other side.</p>
<p>The deal in principle, marking a breakthrough in bila­teral relations between the two states, was reached during a meeting between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Bangladesh’s Home Minister Jahangir Alam Chowdhury.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904939/pakistan-bangladesh-reignite-ties-after-15-year-hiatus">visited Dhaka</a> in April for Foreign Office Consultations after a 15-year break in diplomatic engagement with Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held a telephone conversation with Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus in March where the two leaders reaffirmed their shared desire to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901494">further strengthen bilateral relations</a>.</p>
<p>In February, both countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894244">started</a> direct government-to-government trade after decades of troubled relations with imports of 50,000 tonnes of rice.</p>
<p>In January, the militaries of Pakistan and Bangladesh had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885175/pakistan-bangladesh-underscore-enduring-partnership-for-resillience-against-external-influences">stressed the need</a> for the “enduring partnership” between the two countries to “remain resilient against external influences”.</p>
<p>Direct private trade between the countries restarted in November 2024 when a container ship sailed from Karachi to Chittagong. It was the first cargo ship in decades to sail directly between the countries.</p>
<p>In the years since the split between Pakistan and Bangladesh, Dhaka’s leaders — especially the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245">ousted regime</a> of Sheikh Hasina — stayed firmly in the Indian camp, preferring to maintain close ties with New Delhi and keeping Islamabad at arm’s length.</p>
<p>However, ever since a popular uprising that saw Hasina’s government toppled in August of last year, with the deposed premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1856408">fleeing</a> to her old ally India, there has been a thaw in ties between the two capitals, with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1894028/countrys-trade-with-bangladesh-surpasses-1bn-report">trade</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878467">bilateral relations</a> seeing a marked improvement.</p>
<p>During a meeting with PM Shehbaz on the sidelines of the D-8 summit of developing nations in Cairo in December, Yunus had expressed the desire to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879886">resolve outstanding grievances</a> from Dhaka’s 1971 separation from Islamabad.</p>
<p>“The issues have kept coming again and again. Let’s settle those issues for us to move forward,” the <em>AFP</em> news agency had quoted Yunus as telling PM Shehbaz, according to a statement from the former’s office.</p></p>
