            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met with China’s President Xi Jinping on Tuesday as he represented Pakistan in a joint call of the foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) member states.</p>
<p>The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. The group’s foreign ministers meet as a precursor to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1864831">annual summit</a> of its leaders, which will be hosted <a class="link--external" href="https://www.chinadailyasia.com/hk/article/615887" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by China</a> this autumn in Tianjin.</p>
<p>In a post on X today, Dar <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MIshaqDar50/status/1945012596056187239" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>  he was “delighted” to meet with Xi at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing before the SCO meeting and conveyed the “warm greetings of the leadership, government and people of Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“As iron-clad brothers and all-weather strategic cooperative partners, we remain committed to deepening Pak-China enduring friendship and advancing shared regional goals,” he posted on X.</p>

<p>“Always good to exchange views for strengthening regional understanding and cooperation in such a challenging time,” he <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MIshaqDar50/status/1944996187607646493" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X about his meeting with his Iran, Uzbekistan and Belarus counterparts.</p>

            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) continued its upward trajectory on Tuesday to cross the 137,000 barrier in intra-day trading, amid continued investor optimism and improved economic outlook.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,237.03 points, or 0.91 per cent, to stand at 137,739.56 points at 11:39am, from the previous close of 136,502.53 points.</p>
<p>The market opened on a positive note, rising by 1,205.1 points, or 0.88pc, from yesterday’s close to reach 137,707.63 points at 9:45am. It then dropped to 136,498.16 points at 10:15am before regaining its bullish momentum. The total volume of shares is 152m valued at Rs11.87bn.</p>
<p>The PSX has continued its upward trend from last week, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924253/psx-settles-above-136500-points-a-new-record">crossing</a> the 136,500 level on Monday due to value-hunting by investors and optimism over strong corporate earnings.</p>
<p>The rally was supported by active participation from local mutual funds and institutional investors.</p>

<p>Workers’ remittances rose to a historic $3.4bn in June, up 8pc year-on-year, taking full-year FY25 inflows to a record $38.3bn — a 27pc increase over the previous year.

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923868/equities-surge-past-134000-points-in-record-breaking-week">previous week</a> saw the stock market continue its record-breaking <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920553">bullish run</a>, crossing the 134,000-point threshold amid strong macroeconomic fundamentals and persistent buying by local mutual funds.</p>

            <p><p>India’s Fauja Singh, believed to be the world’s oldest distance runner, has died in a road accident aged 114, his biographer said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Singh, an Indian-born British national, nicknamed the “Turbaned Tornado”, died after being hit by a vehicle in Punjab state’s Jalandhar district on Monday.</p>
<p>“My Turbaned Tornado is no more,” Fauja’s biographer Khushwant Singh <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/Singhkhushwant/status/1944789373276258782" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X.</p>

<p>Singh did not have a birth certificate but his family said he was born on April 1, 1911.</p>
<p>He ran full marathons (42 kilometres) till the age of 100.</p>
<p>His last race was a 10km event at the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/788536/101-year-old-runner-shines-at-last-race">2013 Hong Kong Marathon</a> when 101, where he finished in one hour, 32 minutes and 28 seconds.</p>
<p>He became an international sensation after taking up distance running at the ripe old age of 89, after the death of his wife and one of his sons, inspired by seeing marathons on television.</p>
<p>Although widely regarded as the world’s oldest marathon runner, he was not certified by Guinness World Records as he could not prove his age, saying that birth certificates did not exist when he was born under British colonial rule in 1911.</p>
<p>Singh was a torchbearer for the Olympics at <a class="link--external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060102015817/http://www.athens2004.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Athens 2004</a> and <a class="link--external" href="https://www.olympics.com/en/olympic-games/london-2012" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">London 2012</a>, and appeared in advertisements with sports stars such as David Beckham and Muhammad Ali.</p>
<p>His strength and vitality were credited to a routine of farm walks and a diet including Indian sweet “laddu” packed with dry fruits and home-churned curd.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/narendramodi/status/1944962205734085051" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paid tribute</a> to Singh on social media.</p>
<p>“Fauja Singh was extraordinary because of his unique persona and the manner in which he inspired the youth of India on a very important topic of fitness,” said Modi on X.</p>
