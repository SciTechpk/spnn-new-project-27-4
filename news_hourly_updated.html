                <h2>SC constitutional bench goes live for first time, resumes hearing review pleas on reserved seats</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A constitutional bench (CB) of the Supreme Court on Monday live-streamed its proceedings for the first time as it resumed hearing a set of review pleas against the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621">top court’s ruling</a> that had declared the PTI eligible for reserved seats.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In its July 12, 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">short order</a>, eight out of 13 judges ruled that 39 out of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621#:~:text=the%20verdict%20stated.-,List%20of%2080%20MNAs,-The%20verdict%20listed">list of 80 MNAs</a> were and are the returned candidates of the PTI, setting it to emerge as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845532">single largest party</a> in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>However, the ruling had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1868333">not been implemented</a> by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860119">National Assembly</a>, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had raised some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859716">objections</a>. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1846084">PML-N</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847508/ppp-takes-cue-from-pml-n-files-review-petition-on-sc-reserved-seats-verdict">PPP</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850678#:~:text=ECP%20files%20review%20plea">ECP</a>.</p>
<p>An 11-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin Khan resumed the hearing today after Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had dismissed the review petitions on the first day of hearings.</p>
<p>The proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s <a class="link--external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4xouK5PK9k" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Senior counsel Makh­do­­om Ali Khan appeared on behalf of PML-N and PPP women candidates affected by the July 2024 ruling.</p>
<p>Initially, a full-strength 13-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin took up the review pleas on May 6. However, Justices Ayesha and Abbasi declared the applications as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908809/two-judges-object-as-sc-accepts-review-pleas-on-reserved-seats-for-hearing">inadmissible</a> and were not part of the subsequent proceedings, with the CB head judge noting they had stepped back voluntarily.</p>
<p>Justice Ayesha had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909890/justice-ayesha-malik-piqued-by-failure-to-upload-dissenting-order">formally complained</a> to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi about her dissenting order not being uploaded to the SC’s website.</p>

<p>In her <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909890/justice-ayesha-malik-piqued-by-failure-to-upload-dissenting-order#:~:text=Justice%20Malik%20while%20rejecting%20the%20review%20petitions%20observed%20that%20the%20ECP%20and%20other%20petitioners%20could%20not%20reargue%20the%20case%20under%20the%20review%20jurisdiction">judgement</a>, she had criticised the ECP for not implementing the earlier order, observing that it would “not only undermine the authority of the Supreme Court but also erode the foundational values of democracy itself”.</p>
<p>The Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), which allied with the PTI during the 2024 elections and was a party in the reserved seats case, had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911722/sic-seeks-fresh-bench-for-reserved-seats-case-review">requested</a> the bench to put off the hearing until challenges to the 26th Amendment were decided and to include judges who had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908809/two-judges-object-as-sc-accepts-review-pleas-on-reserved-seats-for-hearing#:~:text=are%20not%20part%20of%20the%20CB">heard the original case</a>.</p>

<p>In its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621">detailed verdict</a> on the reserved seats case, which was authored by senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, the SC had observed that the ECP’s numerous “unlawful acts and omissions” had “caused confusion and prejudice to PTI, its candidates and the electorate who voted for PTI”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>It had also castigated the ECP for failing to fulfil its “role as a guarantor institution and impartial steward” of electoral processes.</p>
<p>On September 14, 2024 — the day the government was supposed to lay the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859132">26th Amendment</a> in both Houses of the parliament but could not — the Supreme Court, through a clarification, had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1858957">reprimanded the ECP</a> for not implementing its July 12 ruling in the reserved seats case.</p>
<p>Later on October 18, in yet <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866044">another clarification</a>, Justice Shah reiterated that the effect of an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850580/law-to-sap-pti-strength-bulldozed-through-parliament">amendment</a> made in the Elections Act 2017 in August last year could not undo the reserved seats case verdict.</p>

<p>The bill, titled “Elections (Second Amendment) Act, 2024”, was seen as aimed at <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850590">circumventing</a> the apex court’s verdict on the reserved seats case by barring independent lawmakers from joining a political party after a stipulated period.</p>
<p>A six-judge CB of the apex court was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875874/sc-to-take-up-pti-plea-against-tweaks-to-elections-act-on-dec-4th">set to take up</a> the PTI’s petition challenging those tweaks to the election laws in December 2024.

                <h2>Shares at PSX trim 800 points in intraday trade</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Bears continued their stampede on Monday at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) as shares declined by more than 800 points in intraday trade.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index declined by 886.10, or 0.74 per cent, to stand at 118,216.57 from the last close of 119,102.67 at 1:13pm.</p>
<p>Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, attributed the decline to “delay in budget announcement”, in additional to “lack of clarity” on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditions “related to budget pushing investors to trim their exposure”.</p>
<p>Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, said, “The market is consolidating ahead of the budget, with pressure on the oil sector following media reports of disagreements with the IMF over the circular debt resolution plan and the onset of rollover week.”</p>
<p>“We expect a rerating to the upside once there is clarity on key budgetary measures,” he added.</p>
<p>The government has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912931/budget-put-off-to-june-10-as-talks-with-imf-continue">delayed</a> unveiling the federal budget from June 2 to June 10 due to inconclusive discussions with the IMF on taxation and fiscal measures.</p>
<p>Informed sources said the visiting IMF staff mission had multiple rounds of discussion, including a wrap-up session with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb.</p>
<p>On Friday, the stock market had come under renewed selling pressure, forcing the index to close the outgoing in the red as jittery investors trimmed their positions amid fears of an unfriendly IMF-driven federal budget.</p>
<p>Contrary to the preceding week, when the benchmark KSE 100 index recovered a staggering 12,474 points thanks to a US-brokered ceasefire between two nuclear-armed neighbors, the PSX faltered due to lacklustre conditions as investors preferred to remain on the sidelines before the announcement of the budget 2025-26.</p>
