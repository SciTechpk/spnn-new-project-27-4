                <h2>Govt has decided to enhance water storage capacity due to India‚Äôs actions: PM Shehbaz</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday said that the government has decided to enhance the country‚Äôs water storage capacity, given India‚Äôs designs to weaponise water.</p>
<p>India in April held the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">abeyance</a> following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam that killed 26 ‚Äî an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence.  The treaty allocates the Indus Basin‚Äôs six rivers between the two countries: India gets the eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas, Sutlej), while Pakistan receives nearly 80 per cent of the water from the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab).</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">termed</a> any attempt to suspend its water share an ‚Äúact of war‚Äù, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.  The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in Hague also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921230">ruled</a> India cannot unilaterally suspend or hold the IWT in abeyance.</p>
<p>During a visit to the National Emergencies Operations Centre today, the prime minister referred to the PCA‚Äôs order, emphasising that India had no authority to suspend the IWT unilaterally.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut the enemy has certain evil designs against Pakistan and wants to take steps against the waters treaty. For that, the government has decided that we will build our water storage.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said the government would build a ‚Äúnon-controversial water storage capacity‚Äù by utilising resources such as the Diamer Bhasha dam and others.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said there was a clear clause in the 1991 water accord between the provinces to build on water capacity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will build this capacity with our own resources in the next few years. There is a critical role of the National Disaster Management Authority in this.‚Äù</p>

<p>The prime minister directed that weather warnings and calamity threats should be regularly issued through phone messages in collaboration with the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority.</p>
<p>The prime minister recounted the disastrous impacts of the catastrophic floods in 2022. He said that Pakistan was unfortunately among the countries on the world map which could be hit by natural disasters such as cloudbursts, even though it had hardly any contribution to the greenhouse effect.</p>
<p>During the year 2022, Pakistan had suffered more than any country in the world, he noted. More than 1,700 lives were lost, vast stretches of farmland were washed away, homes and infrastructure were damaged, and the national exchequer suffered losses of Rs30 billion, according to government estimates.</p>
<p>The prime minister further said that glacial melting due to heat waves also demanded the highest level of preparedness.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat happened in Swat in which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920723/17-killed-as-rains-wreak-havoc-across-kp">precious lives were lost</a>, engulfed the entire nation in a pall of gloom,‚Äù he said and stressed that the stakeholders in the matter should take an honest review of the incident, directing for a formulation of a comprehensive mechanism in collaboration with the provinces to prevent such occurrences in the future.</p>
<p>The prime minister also ordered a report in this regard.</p>
<p>He opined that in the aftermath of the floods of 2022, the relevant ministers negotiated the grants and public-private partnerships for building resilient infrastructure in the country.</p>
<p>The prime minister appreciated the National Emergencies Operations Centre and expressed hope that the relevant authorities would fully utilise the resilient platform for the progress of the country‚Äôs economy and social sectors.</p>
<p>He also assured the government‚Äôs complete support in strengthening the institute and its capacity building.</p>
<p>The prime minister hoped that the facility would be connected with the provinces and could convey real-time information with interventions such as an early warning system.</p>
<p>During his visit, he was given a briefing by NDMA Chairman Lieutenant General Inam Haider Malik over the current monsoon season, the flood situation and the precautionary measures taken in this regard.</p></p>

                <h2>ECP fails to reach decision  on reserved seats</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Official says meeting remained ‚Äòinconclusive‚Äô as law wing was ‚Äòunprepared‚Äô<br />
‚Ä¢ Commission adjourns disqualification case against Omar Ayub</p>

<p>ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday failed to reach a decision over the distribution of reserved seats after the Supreme Court‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920721/ptis-hopes-dashed-as-rivals-set-to-receive-reserved-seats">verdict</a>, sources told <em>Dawn</em>.</p>

<p>A senior official of ECP said the commission‚Äôs meeting remained inconclusive as the law wing was unprepared. He added some applications on this matter filed by PML-N, JUI-F and other individuals were still pending.</p>

<p>The official dispelled reports that the meeting could not reach a decision in the absence of the judgement‚Äôs copy.</p>

<p>The ECP received the copy on Saturday, a day after the Constitutional Bench dismissed petitions filed by PTI, declaring the party ineligible for reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies.</p>

<p>He said the Commission would meet again on Wednesday (today)and hoped a decision would be taken on the issue.</p>

<p>In a 7-3 majority ruling, the Constitutional Bench, on Friday, overturned the Supreme Court‚Äôs July 12, 2024, judgement in the reserved seats case, effectively taking away reserved seats from the PTI and handing them to their rival parties in the national and provincial legislatures.</p>

<p>The decision overturned the majority judgement by eight judges, which had declared the PTI eligible for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the assemblies.</p>

<figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  ">
				<div class="media__item  "><img alt="" src="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921060/how-the-sc-constitutional-bench-handed-two-thirds-majority-to-an-unelected-unity-regime" /></div>
				
			</figure>
<p>			</p>

<p>The bench restored the March 25, 2024, order of the Peshawar High Court which had deprived the Sunni Ittehad Council, the party joined by PTI-backed independents after the Feb 8, 2024 polls, of reserved seats.</p>

<p>The Constitutional Bench‚Äôs decision effectively meant the PTI was no longer a parliamentary party.</p>

<p>Therefore, the 77 reserved seats of the national and provincial assemblies will be allocated among the parliamentary parties present in the respective assemblies, since they cannot be kept vacant.</p>

<p>In light of the decision, the distribution of 22 reserved seats of NA would be: 15 for PML-N, four for PPP and three for JUI-F, according to legal experts.</p>

<p>After this process, the ruling coalition will ach¬≠ieve a two-thirds majority; in a house of 336, the mag¬≠ic number required to at¬≠¬≠tain a two-thirds majority is 224.</p>

<p><strong>Disqualification case</strong></p>

<p>Separately, the ECP has adjourned the hearing of disqualification reference against PTI leader Omar Ayub till July 15 after a court order to halt the proceedings.</p>

<p>A three-member bench of the ECP, headed by member from Sindh Nisar Ahmed Durrani, heard the reference on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr Khan‚Äôs lawyers submitted a stay order against the proceedings issued by the Peshawar High Court.</p>

<p>The ECP member from KP, retired Justice Ikram¬≠ul¬≠lah, noted the high court has not specified a new date in the order. The bench directed the commission‚Äôs legal team to seek clarification from the PHC. It emphasised the re¬≠¬≠¬≠ference forwarded by the National Assembly spea¬≠¬≠ker against Mr Khan must be decided within 90 days.</p>

<p>Omar Ayub was also asked to submit a response in the assets declaration case filed over alleged discrepancies in his nomination papers and data provided to the RO.</p>

<p>The NA speaker forwar¬≠ded the disqualification case on the plea filed by ex-MNA Babar Nawaz, who lost to Mr Khan in the 2024 election from Haripur‚Äôs NA-18 constituency.</p>
