<p>Punjab Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) Director General Tayyab Farid said that ‚Äúrivers have overflowed due to heavy rains in Rawalpindi, Chakwal and surrounding areas‚Äù, leading to a flood situation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCitizens have been advised to avoid unnecessary travel, stay away from power lines and open manholes,‚Äù the Wasa DG said in a statement.</p>

<p>However, it added that the wet spell was likely to subside in the next 48 hours.</p>
<p>In a post on X, the PMD said the heavy monsoon rains triggered a ‚Äúsignificant surge‚Äù in water levels at the <a class="link--external" href="https://ndmc.pmd.gov.pk/new/dam-reservoirs.php?dam=tarbela" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tarbela</a>, <a class="link--external" href="https://ndmc.pmd.gov.pk/new/dam-reservoirs.php?dam=mangla" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mangla</a>, <a class="link--external" href="https://ndmc.pmd.gov.pk/new/dam-reservoirs.php?dam=khanpur" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Khanpur</a>, <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Simly</a> and <a class="link--external" href="https://ndmc.pmd.gov.pk/new/dam-reservoirs.php?dam=rawal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rawal</a> reservoirs.</p>

<p>Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>According to the National Disaster Management Authority‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndma.gov.pk/sitrepm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>, monsoon rains since June 26 have killed 178 people across the country and injured 491 people.</p>
<p>The majority of casualties were recorded in Punjab, the country‚Äôs most populous province, with 103 deaths and 385 injuries. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 38 fatalities, Sindh 20, Balochistan 16 and one death in Azad Kashmir.</p>
<p>Over 57 per cent of nationwide deaths were caused by ‚Äúhouse-collapse‚Äù incidents. Monsoon rains so far have damaged 610 houses and led to the deaths of 126 livestock.</p>

            </a>
            <p><p>Two people died and three others were injured when the roof of a six-storey building collapsed in the Khada Market area of Karachi‚Äôs Lyari, rescue and police officials said.</p>
<p>The incident occurred almost two weeks after a five-storey building <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050">collapsed</a> earlier this month in Lyari‚Äôs Lea Market, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922486/death-toll-in-lyari-building-collapse-stands-at-27-as-rescue-operation-ends-on-3rd-day">killing</a> 27 people. This incident raised serious concerns about building safety, prompting authorities to evacuate other dilapidated <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924493/new-survey-ordered-amid-doubts-over-sindhs-dangerous-buildings-list">buildings</a> in the city.</p>
<p>Regarding the incident today, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>, ‚ÄúTwo women have died in the accident, while more than two others are reported to have been injured.‚Äù</p>
<p>Providing details of the incident, he said: ‚ÄúThe building was dilapidated. Some labourers were working on the roof of the sixth floor when it collapsed.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that the rescue operation has been completed.</p>
<p>Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIGP) South, Asad Raza, confirmed that the two people were killed and three others were injured in the incident.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe top floor of the six-storey building ‚Äî named Ghani Mansion, situated next to Bilal Masjid Peshawari Hotel ‚Äî collapsed on the lower fifth floor,‚Äù he told <em>Dawn.com.</em></p>
<p>He said three injured people and the bodies of the deceased, including two women, were taken to Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe deceased women were sisters. Their daughters are among the injured and are being given medical assistance,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Lyari building earlier this month, Sindh Local Government minister Saeed Ghani had addressed an emergency press conference, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924493/new-survey-ordered-amid-doubts-over-sindhs-dangerous-buildings-list">revealing</a> that 588 buildings across the city had been declared hazardous ‚Äî 456 of them located in District South, including 107 in Lyari alone.</p>
<p>The Sindh government had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922557/sindh-govt-suspends-sbca-dg-over-lyari-building-collapse-minister">suspended</a> the director-general of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) for approving the building‚Äôs construction. The provincial government has formed a committee on hazardous and dilapidated buildings to ensure transparency.</p>
<p>A day earlier, it was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924655">revealed</a> that as many as 44 dilapidated buildings, including 10 declared protected heritage in the city‚Äôs South district, have been vacated for demolition in the aftermath of the Lyari building tragedy.</p>
<p>A meeting, chaired by Commissioner Syed Hasan Naqvi, was told that so far, 44 dilapidated buildings had been vacated in the South and East districts for the safety of the residents.</p>
<p>In total, out of 588 buildings declared dilapidated by the SBCA, 68 buildings have been declared ‚Äúhighly dilapidated‚Äù by the city administration and will be vacated and demolished in the first phase.</p></p>
