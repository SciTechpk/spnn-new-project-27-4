                <h2>Pakistan, Azerbaijan vow to grow ties through investment</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev renewed their pledge to diversify the strategic partnership through investment in mutually beneficial avenues, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/27-05-2025/pakistan-azerbaijan-vow-to-diversify-strategic-partnership-through-investment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The development came as the premier met with President Aliyev after landing in Azerbaijan‚Äôs Lachin District earlier today as he continued his four-nation tour to appreciate their support for Pakistan during the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military confrontation</a> with India.</p>
<p>Starting his expedition on May 25, the premier has already paid a visit to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913346/pm-shehbaz-in-turkiye-to-elevate-strategic-partnership">Turkiye</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913442/ready-to-talk-with-india-pm-shehbaz-says-during-meeting-with-iranian-president-in-tehran">Iran</a>, with Tajikistan his final stop of the trip ending on May 30.</p>
<p>In their meeting today, PM Shehbaz and Aliyev reviewed the ‚Äúfull spectrum of bilateral relations and expressed satisfaction over the upward trajectory of political, economic, defence, and cultural cooperation‚Äù between their countries, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> stated.</p>
<p>The prime minister thanked Aliyev‚Äôs country for its steadfast support during the recent Pakistan-India confrontation and ‚Äúacknowledged the public expressions of solidarity from both the leadership and the people of brotherly Azerbaijan‚Äù. Earlier this month, Aliyev had congratulated Shehbaz upon Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911194/azerbaijan-hails-pakistans-remarkable-success-during-recent-military-strife-with-india-pmo">remarkable success</a>‚Äù, according to the PM Office.</p>
<p>He noted that the people of Azerbaijan ‚Äúcelebrated the success of Pakistan in Marka-i-Haq against India‚Äù, referring to the Pakistan armed forces‚Äô response to Indian aggression.</p>

                <h2>22 injured in alleged quadcopter attack in South Waziristan: hospital</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Seven minors were among 22 people injured in an alleged quadcopter strike in the Wana tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs South Waziristan district, according to a hospital list.</p>
<p>An incident report issued by the district headquarters hospital (DHQ) in Wana mentioned a ‚Äúdrone attack‚Äù at 8pm, which injured 22 people aged between 13 and 60 years.</p>
<p>The condition of a 13-year-old and a man was listed as ‚Äúserious‚Äù, and they were referred to ‚Äútertiary care‚Äù. Seven, including three aged 15, 18 and 19 years, had ‚Äúmajor‚Äù injuries. The rest of the 13 had ‚Äúminor‚Äù injuries, of which two were discharged.</p>
<p>PTI-affiliated <a class="link--external" href="https://www.na.gov.pk/en/profile.php?uid=1657" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MNA Zubair Khan Wazir</a> echoed the hospital‚Äôs tally and told <em>Dawn.com</em>, ‚ÄúThe young men were playing volleyball when the quadcopter fired shells on them.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that people in the area were ‚Äúscared and restricted to their homes after the attack‚Äù.</p>
<p>Wazir, in a post on Facebook, strongly condemned the ‚Äúdrone attack in which innocent citizens were targeted‚Äù. He demanded that the federal government and the relevant institutions ‚Äúimmediately investigate the incident, provide justice to the affected families, and take immediate and effective steps to prevent such attacks in the future‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTargeting common people under the guise of an attack on a Taliban post is extremely regrettable, shameful and unacceptable,‚Äù Wazir claimed, terming the incident a ‚Äúpart of a heinous conspiracy to sabotage regional peace‚Äù.</p>
<p>The incident comes within a fortnight after a suspected quadcopter munitions drop claimed the lives of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912113">four children</a> and injured five others in North Waziristan District‚Äôs Mir Ali tehsil. The military clarified that security forces were ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912393/security-forces-falsely-implicated-in-north-waziristan-incident-ispr">falsely implicated</a>‚Äù in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
