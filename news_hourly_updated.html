                <h2>Government plans curbs, incentives to push cashless economy</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>• Finance minister vows to shift tax burden away from salaried class, other documented sectors<br />
• Meets commercial banks, regulators, industry bodies to gather input for budget<br />
• Stakeholders agree incentives must make digital payments more appealing than cash<br />
• Ceramic tile manufacturers say import dependence cut from 74pc to 4pc<br />
• New digital financing model being developed to support small-scale farmers</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: As part of pre-budget consultations with stakeholders, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday promised to shift the tax burden away from the salaried class and documented sector to others through digitisation, and hinted at major steps towards the compulsory use of digital payments to maximise a cashless economy and increase documented transactions.</p>
<p>A Ministry of Finance team, led by the minister, had a series of meetings with commercial banks, development financial institutions, regulators and industrial representatives, including ceramics manufacturers and steel producers, to discuss policy measures for inclusion in the next year’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913573">federal budget</a>.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Some of the proposals finalised during these meetings are believed to be strategic in nature to capture most of the undocumented economy through digitisation, including additional tax measures on cash transactions, incentives on digital payments and outrightly blocking cash payments in certain critical sectors to be identified by the Federal Board of Revenue with the support of Karandaaz, the Pakistan Revenue Automation Limited and the banking sector.</p>
<p>One of the meetings on accelerating Pakistan’s transition to a digital and less cash-dependent economy finalised a host of measures for inclusion in the federal budget to expand access to digital financial services, encourage the use of digital transactions, and reduce reliance on cash in everyday economic activity.</p>
<p>The meeting decided to fine-tune measures for the budget given the fact that digital payment options were widely available and accessible across various sectors, including retail, services and public sector transactions.</p>
<p>The participants supported steps that would encourage broad-based interoperability, leveraging Raast instant payments system in particular, leading to improved consumer choice in using digital payments platforms, according to a statement.</p>
<p>The meeting agreed that creating a more level playing field between cash and digital transactions was essential, and that incentive structures should be rebalanced to make digital payments more attractive and cost-effective for both consumers and businesses.</p>
<p>The importance of imp­r­oving cost structures related to digital transaction infrastructure, including merchant acquisition and service provision, was taken as a priority to enable wider outreach, especially for small merchants and underserved communities.</p>
<p>The finance minister believed that moving towards a cashless economy was not simply a policy aspiration, but a practical necessity for long-term fiscal resilience, competitiveness and inclusive growth.</p>
<p>“Digitalisation is the foundation of a modern financial system. We must move with urgency and coordination to create a payments environment that is inclusive, interoperable, and focused on ease of use for every Pakistani citizen,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Engagements with industry</strong></p>
<p>In a meeting with a delegation of the All Pakistan Ceramic Tiles Manufacturers Association (APCTMA) and Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers (PALSA), Mr Aurangzeb said the government was committed to shifting the tax burden away from the already compliant formal sector and the salaried class towards segments of the economy that have so far remained undocumented or under-taxed.</p>
<p>The prime minister is personally leading high-level meetings to drive forward reforms that enhance transparency, documentation and economic equity across all, he said, adding that broadening the tax base is essential to achieving fiscal balance and promoting fairness in the economy. The ceramic tiles manufacturers reported the manufacturing capacity at about 560,000 square metres per day, backed by over Rs100 billion in investments, nearly 60 per cent of which is foreign direct investment from China. They said the industry has reduced import dependency from 74pc to just 4pc and now relies almost entirely on local raw materials and labour.</p>
<p>The minister also assured the delegation that reforms in the energy sector were a top policy priority and envisaged a series of measures aimed at improving affordability, ensuring reliability, and moving towards a more efficient and targeted energy pricing structure.</p>
<p>He also pledged to simplify regulatory procedures, reduce compliance burden, and create a stable and predictable policy environment to attract further investment.</p>
<p><strong>Credit access for small farmers</strong></p>
<p>The finance minister also chaired a meeting of the Task Force on National Initiative to Unlock Un-Collateralised Credit for Small Farmers Through Tech-Driven Solutions. He reviewed the recommendations for the National Subsistence Farmers Support Initiative, aimed at unlocking uncollateralised financing for small-scale farmers through innovative, technology-based solutions and enhanced access to credit.</p>
<p>The proposed scheme would employ an end-to-end digital process to ensure transparency, efficiency, and a seamless customer experience.</p>
<p>Designed as a federal programme with nationwide coverage, the initiative aims to align provincial and national efforts to boost agricultural productivity, enhance food security, and contribute meaningfully to GDP growth through inclusive agri-development.</p>
<p>A revised scorecard was presented by the task force with a greater emphasis on agronomic factors — raising the weightage of agronomy from 40pc to 60pc — while maintaining a 40pc weight on financial indicators, thereby rebalancing priorities to better reflect the realities of smallholder farming.</p>
<p>The prototype scheme, developed by the Ministry of Finance’s Task Force on Access to Finance, calls for a multi-bank and microfinance institution (MFI) delivery model implemented through a unified methodology, ensuring wide outreach and operational standardisation across financial institutions.</p>
<p>It was decided to make the entire process time-bound and action-oriented to achieve lasting impact and then replicate a parallel, tech-supported model for the dairy and livestock segment, as most smallholder farmers maintain herds but faced difficulties in securing financing for livestock acquisition, maintenance, and dairy product marketing.</p>
<p>The delegation of Large Steel Producers raised critical challenges facing the steel industry, including high energy costs, regulatory inconsistencies, and the need for a stable policy environment to ensure long-term investment and growth. They also highlighted the impact of taxation policies on formal businesses and sought government support to level the playing field.</p>
<p>The finance minister promised to resolve these challenges and reiterated that every sector must play its role in stabilising and growing the economy.</p>
<p>“We cannot allow the burden to fall solely on the formal sector and the salaried class,” he was quoted as saying, adding that the government was pursuing a broad-based strategy to expand the tax base, reduce reliance on over-taxed segments and bring the undocumented economy into the fold.</p>

            <p><p>• Three die in Azad Kashmir due to ‘cloud-burst’; two each killed in KP, Punjab<br />
• Babusar Top receives heavy snow; authorities say extreme conditions likely to persist through May 31</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Seven people were killed and over two dozen others sustained injuries on Tuesday as severe rain and windstorms swept through parts of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as well as Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).</p>
<p>This is the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913072">second time</a> in a week that a storm of such intensity wreaked havoc in many parts of the country, damaging crops, properties, and other  infrastructure. At least 19 people were killed and over 90 others  injured as powerful windstorms and heavy rains had battered many areas in Islamabad, Punjab and KP on Saturday.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, two people were killed and around 20 injured after a thunderstorm swept through various parts of Punjab. The storm, accompanied by heavy rainfall, strong winds, and hail, caused widespread destruction.</p>
<p>According to Rescue 1122, a passenger van overturned due to rain and dust storm on Ghazi-Lawrencepur Road near Ghazi Interchange in Attock, which resulted in the death of one passenger and left five others injured.</p>
<p>Separately, four children aged between nine and 12 years were injured when the wall of their house collapsed during the windstorm in Rehmo village of Attock district.  Also, a 25-year-old woman received multiple injuries when the roof of her house collapsed in the same area. An 11-year-old girl was critically injured when the wall of her house in Saghirabad area of Attock collapsed.</p>
<p>According to the Rescue 1122’s provincial headquarters, a man was killed after lightning struck him in Mianwali’s Kalabagh.</p>
<p>The district experienced multiple emergencies including a wall collapse that left one person injured at the Makkharwal police station and a falling solar panel that inju­red another resident.</p>
<p>In Gujran­wala, a young girl fell from roof due to powerful gusts.</p>
<p>In Taunsa Sharif, a woman was injured when the wall of her house collapsed.</p>
<p>Three people, including two children, were inj­ured in Rawalpindi as gusty winds battered the garrison city in the afternoon.</p>
<p>According to the PDMA, these ext­r­eme conditions are likely to persist through May 31, with upper and central Punjab districts inc­luding Rawalpindi, Lahore, Gujranwala and Faisalabad, facing the highest risk.</p>
<p><strong>Two killed in KP</strong></p>
<p>In Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, two people lost their lives and another 10 sustained injuries in rain-related incidents.</p>
<p>Rains lashed many areas of the province, leaving several people injured.</p>
<p>A child died while four others were injured in a roof collapse incident in Swabi. Another person died and three members of the same family were injured in a lightning strike in Shangla district. In the Mattani area of the provincial capital, three persons were injured when the roof of their house collapsed, while another one was injured in another rain-related incident in the Badershi area of Nowshera district.</p>
<p>The upper parts of the Hazara division on Tuesday received heavy downpour and snowfall, blocking the Karakoram Highway to all sorts of traffic at two locations in the Lower Kohistan.</p>
<p>“The floodwater carrying heavy rocks and stones from nearby mountains blocked the Karakoram Highway at two points in our district,” Mohammad Duraj, an official from Rescue 1122, Lower Kohistan, told reporters. Babusar Top, the highest point in the Kaghan Valley, received heavy snowfall, significantly dropping temperatures across the district.</p>
<p>KP’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) in a statement issued here said that the spell will continue till May 30. It said the rain caused widespread damage to the crops.</p>
<p>PDMA said wheat, vegetables and fruit crops were badly damaged in Mardan and its surrounding areas due to the hailstorm. Besides, rains also disrupted the power supply across the province as 113 of Peshawar Electric Supply Company tripped due to rain and thunderstorm.</p>
<p><strong>Three killed in AJK</strong></p>
<p>In Kashmir, three women lost their lives and a man went missing while several properties were damaged after a “cloudburst-induced flood” wreaked havoc in a suburban area of Muzaffarabad on Tuesday afternoon, officials said.</p>
<p>Saeed Qureshi, a senior director at the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), told <em>Dawn</em> that the “cloudburst” triggered a flood in a water channel in Balgran village, located around 35 kilometres from Muzaffarabad on the right bank of the Neelum River, at about 4pm.</p>
<p>Among the victims were Zaiwar Jan, 75, and her daughter Shireen Bibi, 35, who died when the raging current swept into their house and filled it with mud.</p>
<p>Station House Officer (SHO) of Panjgran Iftikhar Awan, who spoke to Dawn from the affected village, said the mother’s body was recovered immediately, while the daughter’s body was later pulled from the debris.</p>
<p>In another severely affected house nearby, rescuers found 35-year-old Gori Bibi critically injured and unconscious. She was rushed to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Patikka, where she succumbed to her injuries later in the evening.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Gori Bibi’s father, 65-year-old Jalal Deen, was reported missing.</p>
<p>“We have been trying to locate him, but to no avail,” said SHO Awan.</p>
<p>Videos shared by residents showed muddy water gushing through the ground floor of the village’s main mosque, which was built almost along the course of the water channel, where water flow is usually minimal. According to SHO Awan, the flood, which lasted for about half an hour, completely destroyed the mosque.</p>
<p>Mr Qureshi from the SDMA said initial assessments indicated partial damage to 20–25 houses and the mosque. However, SHO Awan feared that the figure could be higher. “At the moment, our priority is to assess the human losses. Material damages will be evaluated in daylight on Wednesday,” he said.</p>
<p>Separately, in Islamabad, the district administration decided to move billboards out of the city after a hoarding fixed at the National Press Club collapsed due to a windstorm that had also uprooted several trees.</p>
