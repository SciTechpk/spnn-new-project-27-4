                <h2>Arshad Nadeem retains javelin supremacy with gold at Asian Athletics Championship</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Olympic champion Arshad Nadeem threw a massive 86.40m  to win gold in the men‚Äôs javelin final at the Asian Athletics Championship in Gumi, South Korea.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs Sachin Yadav took the silver with a 85.16m and Japan‚Äôs Yuta Sakiyama took home bronze with an 83.75m throw.</p>
<p>After leading the field in the first few throw‚Äôs, Sri Lanka‚Äôs Rumesh Tharanga Pathirage was bumped off the podium to finish fourth with an 83.27m throw.</p>
<p>Nadeem threw a 75.64m and 76.80m on his first and second attempts respectively, while Yasir threw 70.53m and 75.39m.</p>
<p>All eyes were on Nadeem as he stepped up to the field for his first throw ranked last in the throwing order. ‚ÄòDil Dil Pakistan‚Äô was blaring in the stadium as the crowd anticipated a massive throw from the javelin superstar, who is competing internationally for the first time since last year‚Äôs Paris Olympics.</p>
<p>In Yesterday‚Äôs heats, Nadeem threw an impressive 86.34m throw on his first and only attempt to cruise into today‚Äôs final. Yasir had thrown a 76.07m in the heats.</p>
<p>After he punched his ticket to the final, Nadeem took to Instagram to say: ‚ÄúAs always I would need your support and prayers.‚Äù</p>
<p>In August last year, Nadeem <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850946">set</a> a new Olympic record and won a gold medal in the men‚Äôs javelin final in Paris with a 92.97m throw.</p>
<p>Nadeem will soon be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912524">going</a> to England to prepare for September‚Äôs World Athletics Championships.</p>

                <h2>Indian military confirms fighter jets shot down by Pakistan</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>India‚Äôs Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan confirmed on Saturday that his country‚Äôs fighter jets were shot down by Pakistan during the four-day conflict earlier in the month.</p>
<p>Indian fighter jets were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">shot down</a> by the Pakistan Air Force on the night of May 6 and May 7 in response to the Indian Air Force‚Äôs late-night missile strikes at six Pakistani sites, including Subhan Mosque in Bahawalpur‚Äôs Ahmedpur East, Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad, Abbas Mosque in Kotli, Umalkura Mosque in Muridke, the village of Kotki Lohara in Sialkot district, and Shakargarh.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911307">took down</a> six Indian jets, including three advanced French Rafale planes. According to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911123"><em>Dawn</em> report</a>, the recent clash between India and Pakistan marks a significant development in the regional air power constellation. Three Rafales, one Su-30MKI, one Mirage 2000 and one MiG-29 were downed within a 40-minute span. Not one Pakistani jet crossed the border or engaged in close combat.</p>

<p>While speaking to <em>Bloomberg TV</em> at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, General Chahuan said, ‚ÄúI think what is important is not the jets being downed but why the jets were shot down.‚Äù</p>
<p>In response to a query by the show‚Äôs host,
he confirmed that Indian fighter jets were shot down during the recent escalation between the two countries.</p>
<p>He emphasised that the reasons why the Indian jets were shot down and what the Indian forces did after that were more important.</p>
<p>General Chauhan also claimed that the four-day conflict never came close to the point of nuclear war.</p>
<p>American and French officials also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909560">confirmed</a> that Pakistan shot down an Indian jet using fighter aircraft it acquired from China, <em>CNN</em> and <em>Reuters</em> reported earlier in the month.</p>
<p>CNN cited a senior US official saying, as per their assessment, Pakistani forces shot down the jet during India‚Äôs air strikes inside Pakistan.</p>
<p>A high-ranking French intelligence official also told <em>CNN</em> that one Rafale fighter jet operated by the Indian Air Force was downed by Pakistan.</p>

<p>Earlier in the month, American newspaper <em>The Washington Post</em> also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910110">verified visual evidence</a> that at least two French-made Indian fighter aircraft were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force.</p>
<p>The paper based its findings on analyses by former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician Trevor Ball, Etienne Marcuz, an associate fellow at the Foundation for Strategic Research and an anonymous French air power expert.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn a review of more than a dozen images and videos posted online in the aftermath of the strikes, <em>The Post</em> verified debris consistent with at least two French-made fighter jets flown by the Indian Air Force ‚Äî a Rafale and a Mirage 2000,‚Äù <em>The Post</em> reported.</p></p>
