            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908601/sbp-cuts-interest-rate-by-100bps-to-11pc' target='_blank'><strong>SBP cuts interest rate by 100bps to 11pc</strong></a>
            <p><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) cut the policy rate on Monday to 11 per cent, amid trade and industry sectors advocating for a significant cut.</p>
<p>The central bank’s policy rate, after being slashed by 1,000bps from 22pc since June 2024 in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1888017">six intervals</a>, previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897015">stood at 12pc</a>.</p>
<p>April inflation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908067/inflation-hits-all-time-low-of-03pc">stood</a> at a low of 0.3pc, largely due to a high base a year ago. The reduction is also primarily attributed to lower prices of key food staples such as wheat and its derivatives, onions, potatoes and certain pulses, as well as a cut in electricity and fuel charges. These items carry significant weight in the inflation basket — the Consumer Price Index (CPI) — meaning minor price changes can heavily influence the overall rate.</p>
<p>According to a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.sbp.org.pk/press/2025/Pr-05-May-2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a> issued by the SBP today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the interest rate, noting that inflation in April turned out to be lower than expected, mainly due to a drop in prices of perishable food items and electricity and fuel charges.</p>
<p>According to the statement, core inflation declined in April, primarily reflecting favourable base-effect amid moderate demand conditions.</p>
<p>“Overall, the MPC assessed that the inflation outlook has improved further relative to the previous assessment,” the statement said.</p>
<p>The committee viewed that the heightened global uncertainty surrounding trade tariffs and geopolitical developments could pose challenges for the economy.</p>
<p>“In this backdrop, the MPC emphasised the importance of maintaining a measured monetary policy stance,” it said.</p>
<p>The committee also noted key developments since the last meeting.</p>
<p>It said that the provisional real GDP growth for Q2-FY25 was reported at 1.7 per cent year-on-year whereas Q1 growth was revised up to 1.3pc from 0.9pc.</p>
<p>“Second, the current account recorded a sizable surplus of $1.2 billion in March, mainly due to record-high workers’ remittances,” it said.</p>
<p>It said that the surplus and SBP’s foreign exchange purchases partially cushioned the impact of large ongoing debt repayments on the SBP’s foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>It also said that recent surveys suggested further improvement in both consumer and business sentiments, adding that shortfall in tax collection has continued to widen.</p>
<p>“Global uncertainty, particularly around tariffs, has led the IMF to sharply downgrade its 2025 and 2026 growth projections for both advanced and emerging economies,” the statement said, adding that the tariff uncertainty also triggered heightened financial market volatility and a sharp decline in global oil prices.</p>
<p>“Considering the evolving developments and risks, the MPC viewed that the real policy rate remains adequately positive to stabilise inflation in the target range of 5pc to 7pc, while ensuring that the economy grows on a sustainable basis,” it said.</p>
<p>Separately, the statement said that headline inflation, continuing its downtrend, fell to 0.3pc y/y in April, driven primarily by food and energy prices.</p>
<p>“A sharp decline in wheat and allied product prices, moderation in global commodity prices and downward adjustment in electricity tariffs were the major drivers of this ease in food and energy prices,” the statement said.</p>
<p>“These factors also contributed to the moderation in inflation expectations of consumers,” it said.</p>
<p>Moreover, core inflation, after remaining sticky at around 9pc over the past few months, declined to 8.0pc y/y in April, it added.</p>
<p>The statement said that going forward, the committee anticipated inflation to gradually inch up in the coming months and stabilise within the target range of 5pc to 7pc.</p>
<p>“This outlook is, however, subject to both upside and downside risks emanating from volatility in wheat and other food prices, timing and magnitude of energy price adjustments, potential global supply-chain disruptions and uncertain commodity price outlook.”</p>
<p>Earlier, it noted that despite a long-term decline in inflation and real interest rates above 11pc, opinions on the central bank’s likely decision on the policy rate were divided, with trade and industry sectors advocating for a significant cut.</p>
<p>Researchers had conducted polls to gauge market sentiment, but the 0.3pc inflation in April has caused division among those who were confident there would be no change in the interest rate.</p>
<p>However, many experts <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908316">believed</a> the SBP would cut the rate by 50bps. Some had also found reasons for a likely status quo as they feel the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">war-like situation</a> between India and Pakistan has created uncertainty that may escalate prices.</p>
<p>This situation may force the central bank to adopt a cautious approach in the face of sudden shocks of higher inflation.</p>
<p>The SBP’s MPC met today to set the key interest rate for the next two months. In March, the central bank delivered a surprise by leaving its policy rate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897015">unchanged</a> in the last review, disappointing the business community.</p></p>

            <p><p>Global rating agency Moody’s on Monday said that escalating tensions between India and Pakistan would weigh on Pakistan’s economic growth.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> on April 22 in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe.</a></p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/india-gives-army-operational-freedom-to-respond-to-pahalgam-attack">granting</a> “operational freedom” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the military warning of a “swift” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, diplomatic channels have remained <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907930/us-hopes-that-indias-response-to-pahalgam-attack-doesnt-lead-to-broader-regional-conflict-vance">engaged</a> to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.moodys.com/researchandratings/region/asia-pacific/pakistan/042004" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">note</a>, the rating agency stated: “Sustained escalation in tensions with India would likely weigh on Pakistan’s growth and hamper the government’s ongoing fiscal consolidation, setting back Pakistan’s progress in achieving macroeconomic stability.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>On Pakistan’s economic trajectory, it said that its macroeconomic indicators had been improving, with growth gradually rising, inflationary pressure easing and foreign exchange reserves increasing amid “continued progress” in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.</p>
<p>However, the agency noted that “a persistent increase in tensions could also impair Pakistan’s access to external financing and pressure its foreign exchange reserves, which remain well below what is required to meet its external debt payment needs for the next few years”.</p>
<p>“India and Pakistan’s diplomatic relations have deteriorated,” the agency said, recalling Information Minister Attaullah Tarar’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">statement</a> that Pakistan expected a military action by India.</p>
<p>Notably, the agency warned that India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">suspension</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">1960 Indus Waters Treaty</a> could “severely reduce Pakistan’s water supply”.</p>
<p>In comparison, Moody’s said that the macroeconomic conditions in India would remain stable, propelled by “moderating but still high levels of growth amid strong public investment and healthy private consumption”.</p>
<p>“In a scenario of sustained escalation in localised tensions, we do not expect major disruptions to India’s economic activity because it has minimal economic relations with Pakistan,” it said, adding that the country accounted for less than 0.5 per cent of India’s total exports in 2024.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>However, it did stress that higher <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1888023">defence spending</a> could impact on India’s “fiscal strength and slow its fiscal consolidation”.</p>
<p>“Our geopolitical risk assessment for Pakistan and India accounts for persistent tensions, which have, at times, led to limited military responses,” it said.</p>
<p>It predicted that flare-ups “will occur periodically” as they have throughout the neighbouring countries’ post-independence history. However, they will not lead to an “outright, broad-based military conflict”, it added.</p></p>

            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday said that a recent attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam was an attempt to “divert attention” from India’s internal challenges and its cross-border terrorism.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack%20were%20brought%20out">cross-border linkages</a>” of the att­a­­­c­kers.

<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> as it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an incursion and India’s premier granting “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war">military</a> warning of a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907785/any-military-misadventure-by-india-will-be-met-with-swift-resolute-notch-up-response-coas">swift</a>” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907930/us-hopes-that-indias-response-to-pahalgam-attack-doesnt-lead-to-broader-regional-conflict-vance">diplomatic channels</a> have remained engaged to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>Addressing the Regional Dialogue 2025 in Islamabad today, organised by the Institute of Regional Studies, Dar said Pakistan believed the Pahalgam attack was part of an effort to “divert attention” from India’s internal challenges, adding that it could be “self-choreographed”.</p>
<p>“We believe that what has happened is to divert attention — I am talking of Pahalgam — from India’s internal challenges, state-sponsored terrorism, the ongoing human rights violations in the Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir, and to gain narrow domestic political objectives,” Dar said.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget that there are some by-elections coming in the next few months in India,” he added, referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907658">upcoming polls in Bihar</a> in October.</p>
<p>“This brinkmanship carries consequences that extend far beyond India’s borders,” the deputy PM warned, calling India’s actions “unilateral, politically-motivated and highly provocative”.</p>
<p>He noted: “There appears to be a calculated and premeditated attempt to escalate regional tensions, following a familiar pattern — level allegations against Pakistan without evidence, use inflammatory rhetoric, incite war hysteria and use this as a pretext for aggression and unilateral actions.”</p>
<p>In a reference to the Indian government, Dar stressed that regional and international peace and security could not be “sacrificed at the altar of narrow electoral gains”.</p>
<p>“This is a dangerous political game and gamble, putting at stake the lives of millions in the region,” the foreign minister highlighted. However, he also reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace: “We will support all efforts towards de-escalation.”</p>
<p>“Analysts say this could be another ploy. It might have been self-choreographed,” echoing Pakistani leaders’ previous statements of the Pahalgam attack being a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906207">false flag operation</a>”.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>“How can an FIR (first information report) be registered in 10 minutes at a police station where you need at least 45 minutes to reach? […] Come on. Nobody’s a fool,” Dar quipped.</p>
<p>“International dignitaries are talking [to] both sides. Few of them — great friends — suggested to me, ‘Can you try and help the perpetrators be caught?’ I said ‘come on, do you know the distance where it happened and where’s the Line of Control? 230 kilometres.”</p>
<p>“I cannot find the word abeyance in any international treaties’ dictionary. The word suspension is there,” Dar said, referring to India’s unilateral <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">suspension</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>.</p>

<p>Both leaders also agreed that complex issues could be “resolved through diplomacy and negotiations”.</p>
<p>“They appreciated each other’s constructive diplomatic efforts, which demonstrate their shared commitment to peace and stability in the region,” the FO said.

<p>On Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907760">thanked China’s envoy</a> for endorsing his offer to conduct a neutral probe into the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>Last week, China had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907094/china-urges-india-pakistan-to-exercise-restraint-after-pahalgam-attack">urged</a> both India and Pakistan to “exercise restraint” as the two countries reportedly exchanged fire at the Line of Control (LoC).</p>
<p>As Pakistan continues diplomatic engagement with various countries to brief them on the ongoing situation, PM Shehbaz yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908460#:~:text=Prime%20Minister%20Shehbaz%20Sharif%20talked%20to%20his%20Malaysian%20counterpart%2C%20while%20Foreign%20Minister%20Ishaq%20Dar%20spoke%20to%20the%20Malaysian%20as%20well%20as%20Russian%20foreign%20ministers">spoke</a> to his Malaysian counterpart, while Dar spoke to the foreign ministers of Malaysia and Russia.</p>

<p>Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar visited the LoC in Azad Jammu and Kashmir with local and foreign media and dismissed India’s allegations of “terrorist hideouts” there, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/05-05-2025/info-minister-visits-loc-along-with-local-foreign-media" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The visit facilitated by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting was aimed at exposing the “false and baseless Indian propaganda”, the report said, pointing out that media representatives were taken to specific locations that India had allegedly “labelled as terrorist hideouts”.</p>

<p>“By witnessing the ground situation, hearing from the local population, and observing the environment firsthand, the media got the opportunity to assess the truth behind India’s claims,” <em>Radio Pakistan</em> noted.</p>
<p>Among the group of international journalists was <em>CNN</em>’s International Diplomatic Editor <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/NicRobertsonCNN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nic Robertson</a>.</p>
<p>According to <em>Radio Pakistan</em>, Robertson visited a village where Muhammad Farooq and Muhammad Deen were killed in a “fake encounter by the Indian army”.</p>
<p>The <em>CNN</em> editor interviewed both men’s bereaved families, who appealed for justice through international media, the report said.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Tarar said: “India is now claiming the presence of training camps in Bela Noor Shah, which is near Pir Chinasi, and that they were used in the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>“This area is 26 kilometres away from the LoC and the purpose of coming here is to show that Indian propaganda is false, fake, and concocted,” he added.</p>

<p>“India’s narrative has failed miserably, and the international media has not picked it up. There are contradictions in India’s response and they are not able to provide evidence,” the minister said.</p>
<p>He asserted: “There are no terrorist camps here. There are beautiful mountains and people [only].”</p>
<p>“Don’t resort to any misadventure,” Tarar warned, adding that Pakistan would give a befitting response to any Indian aggression and would go to any extent to defend its sovereignty.</p>
<p>Echoing Deputy PM Dar’s statements, Tarar said India uses propaganda to “hide its internal failures”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Pakistan Army responded to unprovoked firing by the Indian army along the Line of Control (LoC) overnight, state broadcaster <em><a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvworld/newsdetail/5439" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PTV News</a></em> reported.</p>

<p>According to security sources, Indian troops resorted to unprovoked firing on multiple Pakistani military posts in Nakyal, Khuiratta, Sharda, Kel, Neelum and Haji Pir sectors along the LoC.</p>
<p>The action was responded to in a befitting manner by the Pakistan Army, <em>PTV News</em> added. It quoted security sources as saying that the armed forces were “fully alert”.</p>

<p>Acting on a global level, Islamabad has decided to seek an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908460">immediate session</a> of the United Nations Security Council to apprise world powers about the recent tensions with India.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Foreign Office said FM Dar has issued directions to Pakistan’s permanent representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar, to take immediate steps for the UNSC session.</p>
<p>“This important diplomatic move is part of Pakistan’s efforts to present true facts before the international community,” the statement said, adding that Pakistan decided to formally brief the UNSC on the latest situation in the region, as well as India’s aggressive steps and provocative statements.</p>
<p>It said Pakistan would specifically highlight the suspension of the IWT by India.</p>
<p>The instructions came two days after Ambassador Iftikhar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908062">said</a> Pakistan was closely following the situation stemming from India’s aggressive moves in the wake of the Pahalgam attack and would seek a UNSC meeting at an appropriate time.</p></p>
