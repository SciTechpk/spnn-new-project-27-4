            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925193/trump-says-5-jets-were-shot-down-in-india-pakistan-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says 5 jets were shot down in India-Pakistan conflict</strong></a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Friday that five jets were shot down during the recent India-Pakistan conflict that began after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, with the situation calming after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> in May.</p>
<p>Trump, who made his remarks at a dinner with some Republican US lawmakers at the White House, did not specify which side’s jets he was referring to.</p>
<p>Pakistan had said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">downed six</a> Indian planes after the latter carried out deadly attacks in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, while New Delhi had <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/india-shot-down-high-tech-jets-of-pakistan-confirms-air-marshal-bharti-938212" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed</a> it had downed “a few planes”.</p>
<p>“Something I’m very proud of [is that] we stopped a lot of wars. A lot of wars. And these were serious, serious wars; would have been going on,” Trump said.</p>
<p>“You had India-Pakistan that was going, and in fact, planes were being shot out of the air. Five, five, four or five, but I think five jets were shot down actually,” Trump said while talking about the India-Pakistan hostilities, without elaborating or providing further detail.</p>
<p>“It was getting worse and worse, wasn’t it? […] These are two serious nuclear countries and they were hitting each other. It seems like a new form of warfare; you saw it recently, when you looked at what we did in Iran when we knocked out their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920005">nuclear capability</a>, totally knocked out,” he said, referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">US strikes</a> on Iran’s three nuclear sites.</p>

<p>Pakistan said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downed five</a> Indian planes in air-to-air combat, later stating that figure <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">as six</a>. India’s highest-ranking general said in late May that India switched tactics after suffering losses in the air on the first day of hostilities and established an advantage before a ceasefire was announced three days later.</p>
<p>As New Delhi launched deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a>, which Islamabad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361">denied</a>, the Pakistan Air Force downed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">five</a> Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>While India <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/india-shot-down-high-tech-jets-of-pakistan-confirms-air-marshal-bharti-938212" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed</a> downing jets, Islamabad has denied any losses of planes and said it hit <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910381">26 Indian targets</a> were hit after its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186#:~:text=The%20strikes%20targeted%20Nur%20Khan%20air%20base">three air bases</a> were targeted.</p>
<p>Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914608">repeatedly</a> said he prevented a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">nuclear war</a>” between Pakistan and India after Washington held talks with both sides, even <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920139">crediting</a> Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir for helping in it. India has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921534">differed</a> with Trump’s claims that it resulted from his intervention and his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911719">threats</a> to sever trade talks.</p>

<p>Most recently, on July 7, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923026/trumps-claim-on-averting-india-pakistan-war-gains-new-life">doubled down</a> on its narrative of Trump playing a central role in defusing tensions, despite India claiming otherwise.</p>
<p>Asked about Indian officials’ repeated <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912153">denials</a> of Trump’s role, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce avoided taking a position. “So many comments speak for themselves,” she said.</p>
<p>Pressed further, Bruce added, half in jest: “Everyone will have an opinion. That’s an opinion. Some opinions are wrong. Mine rarely are, but other people’s opinions can be wrong.”</p>
<p>Trump’s statements stand in contrast to India’s official position, which maintains that New Delhi acted independently during the May crisis and that Washington did not mediate. Trump’s remarks support Pakistan’s view that quiet US diplomacy — and direct intervention from the White House — helped calm tensions.</p>
<p>India’s position has been that New Delhi and Islamabad must resolve their problems directly and with no outside involvement.</p>

<p>India is an increasingly important US partner in Washington’s effort to counter China’s influence in Asia, while Pakistan is a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524">strong partner</a> in counterterrorism.</p>
<p>The April attack in Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">killed 26 men</a> and sparked heavy fighting between the nuclear-armed Asian neighbours in the latest escalation of a decades-old rivalry.</p>
<p>New Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">strongly denied</a> responsibility while calling for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral</a> investigation. Washington condemned the attack but did not directly blame Islamabad.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925210/aurangzeb-eyes-game-changer-investment-discussions-with-us' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb eyes ‘game-changer’ investment discussions with US</strong></a>
            <p><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has said the government aims to follow the ongoing trade talks with the United States by discussing investment, terming it a potential “game-changer” for economic ties between the two countries.</p>
<p>He made the remarks after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925024">meeting</a> with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer on Friday as part of a critical round of trade talks aimed at securing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901838">tariff relief</a> and expanding bilateral economic cooperation.</p>
<p>“One thing we discussed was that we have to move beyond the immediate trade imperative, which is obviously very critical, but besides that, for the Pakistan-US relationship to be brought to the next level and bring in a real step change, [there is] an investment imperative that will hopefully emerge,” Aurangzeb said in a video statement.</p>
<p>“Areas [for investment] have already been identified,” the minister said, mentioning <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902898">minerals and mining</a>, artificial intelligence, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912373">digital infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915365">cryptocurrency</a>.</p>
<p>“We feel this will be a real game-changer, God-willing, in terms of the economic relationship between Pakistan and the United States.”</p>

<p>Aurangzeb added that both sides committed to begin their talks with trade and follow them through “very quickly with investment discussions between the two countries and real execution of the investment upside that is available, so that it becomes a win-win” for Pakistan and the US.</p>
<p>The minister termed his dialogue with Lutnick and Greer “very constructive”. Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh and Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul, who were present during the meeting, accompanied Aurangzeb in the video statement.</p>
<p>“Positive progress over the last few weeks and months was reviewed. Equally importantly, we focused on the slightly outstanding aspects,” the finance czar said, adding there was a clear commitment from both sides to “get closure” on those items.</p>
<p>The minister highlighted that as the US was Pakistan’s largest trading partner, it was quite critical to move forward in the “same spirit” in which the recent discussions had taken place.</p>
<p>“In the next few days, we hope that the coming leadership-level announcements will reflect all the hard work and efforts that have been put in both by Pakistan and the US side,” Aurangzeb said.</p>
<p>Pakistan aims to finalise a long-term reciprocal tariff agreement that would prevent the re-imposition of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901838">29 per cent tariff</a> on Pakistani exports — primarily textiles and agricultural products. While Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922611/trump-dispatches-letters-outlining-new-tariffs-on-foreign-nations">announced</a> tariffs for some countries, talks with others are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923479">ongoing</a> ahead of his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922652/trump-announces-up-to-40pc-tariffs-on-several-nations#:~:text=%E2%80%94%20postponing%20their%20imposition%20to%20August%201.">extended</a> August 1 deadline.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922229/pakistan-us-reach-accord-on-trade-and-tariffs">reached</a> an initial understanding on a deal that could shape the future of the country’s key export sectors. A formal announcement on any deal is expected only after the US concludes similar ongoing negotiations with other trade partners.</p>
<p>A source close to the US administration has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925087#:~:text=The%20president%20wants%20concrete%20deliverables%20before%20the%20August%2015%20deadline">mentioned</a> a further deadline: “The president wants concrete deliverables before the August 15 deadline. Countries that stall may find themselves on the wrong end of a tariff wall.”</p>
<p>A senior Pakistani official involved in the negotiations said: “We’re not here for aid. We’re here for serious negotiations and a possible deal. It’s about mutual benefit now — trade, not dependence.”</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, influential US-based businessmen with stakes in cryptocurrency and rare earth mineral ventures have quietly supported Pakistan’s efforts to gain greater access to American markets.</p>
<p>In April, the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906732">partnered with</a> World Liberty Financial (WLF), a decentralised finance platform backed by US President Donald Trump. Earlier that month, a US delegation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903248">expressed</a> Washington’s strategic interest in the country’s mineral sector.</p></p>

            <p><p>Fighter jets of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) won top awards in two categories at the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) 2025 in the United Kingdom, state-run <em>PTV</em> reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>RIAT, which runs from July 18 to 20, is one of the world’s largest military airshows, has been running for over 50 years and powers the Royal Air Force Charitable Trust, according to its <a class="link--external" href="https://www.airtattoo.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924755">PAF contingent</a> comprising “state-of-the-art JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter aircraft and the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, landed at the Royal Air Force Base Fairford in the UK to participate in the prestigious” RIAT 2025, a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.</p>

<p>The JF-17 Block-III was awarded the “Spirit of the Meet Trophy” for its “striking livery and the incredible journey from Pakistan with non-stop air-to-air refuelling,” <em>PTV</em> reported.</p>
<p>According to ISPR’s press release earlier this week, the JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighters executed successful Air-to-Air Refuelling operations en route to the UK with the support of a PAF IL-78 aerial refuelling tanker.</p>

<p>“These awards were given in recognition of the aircrafts’ excellent flying and technical skills,” <em>PTV</em> said.</p>
<p>It added that the JF-17C Block III represents Pakistan’s “advanced defence technology”.</p>
<p>“This success has honoured Pakistan’s aviation sector on an international level.”</p>
<p><em>PTV</em> called the success at RIAT a “testament to the recognition of the capabilities of the Pakistan Air Force”.</p>
<p>In May, when Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">downed</a> Indian jets as retaliation for late-night strikes during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/pakistan-india-tensions">Pakistan-India conflict</a>, the PAF formally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">acknowledged</a> a month later that it was the Kamra-based 15 Squadron that led the charge in shooting down them down.</p>
<p>The event is now considered one of the largest air-to-air engagements in South Asia in more than half a century.</p>
<p>“There is a palpable sense of enthusiasm across the United Kingdom following the recent Pakistan-India conflict, as aviation enthusiasts and defence observers were eagerly looking forward to the arrival of the Pakistan Air Force’s JF-17 Thunder Block-III,” the statement said.</p>
<p>“The aircraft’s combat-proven capabilities and operational excellence have garnered significant global attention, making its appearance at RIAT a highly anticipated highlight in the aerospace and defence community.”</p></p>
