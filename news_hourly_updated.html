                <h2>1 dead, 10 injured in Quetta blast targeting convoy of PPP MPA Ali Madad Jattak</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>One person was killed and 10 others injured when a blast struck the convoy of PPP MPA Ali Madad Jattak in Quetta on Wednesday, but the lawmaker was unharmed.</p>
<p>Sariab Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Asif Ghafoor told <em>Dawn.com</em>: ‚ÄúThe convoy of PPP MP Ali Madad Jatak was attacked with hand grenades and fired upon on Sariab Road in Quetta. The incident took place near Munir Mengal Chowk. Ali Madad Jatak was unharmed in the attack, but his vehicle was partially damaged.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said five people were injured in the incident, who were immediately moved to Bolan Medical Complex Hospital and Civil Hospital.</p>
<p>Ghafoor said a heavy contingent of police reached the spot and cordoned off the area to launch an investigation that was under way.</p>
<p>He said Jatak was heading towards a meeting place along with his convoy to attend a victory rally.</p>
<p>However, a statement issued by the Balochistan Health Department said 11 injured were brought to the Civil Hospital Accident and Trauma Centre.</p>
<p>It added that after being provided initial medical aid, the injured were shifted to the trauma centre for further treatment, while one person died during treatment.</p>
<p>Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti condemned the attack, saying that attacks on public leadership were attacks on the province‚Äôs peace.</p>
<p>Bugti said that such cowardly acts could not shake the nation‚Äôs collective willpower, adding that strict and fruitful action would be taken against those hostile to peace.</p>
<p>He said that the elements disrupting peace would be exposed, and the people and elected representatives deserved complete protection.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe elements hostile to the state will be made an example of.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Balochistan government also condemned the attack and sought a report.</p>
<p>Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind said the attack was a cowardly act, adding that attacks on elected representatives were tantamount to an attack on the democratic system.</p>
<p>He said the attackers would be brought to justice.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe suppression of elements active against law and order is inevitable. The government is using all resources to protect the people and representatives, such actions cannot weaken our resolve,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari strongly condemned the attack.</p>
<p>He termed the attempted attack a ‚Äúcowardly and brazen act of terrorism‚Äù, affirming that such desperate attempts would not shake the party‚Äôs resolve.</p>
<p>Bilawal expressed hope that the terrorists involved in targeting the convoy would soon be brought to justice. He also prayed for the swift recovery of those injured in the incident and stressed that the best possible medical treatment must be ensured for them.</p>

                <h2>Islamabad court orders jail authorities to allow Imran‚Äôs contact with sons, check-up by personal physician</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A special court in Islamabad on Tuesday instructed the Adiala Jail authorities to allow PTI founder Imran Khan to hold a telephone conversation with his sons abroad and also be allowed a medical checkup by his personal physician.</p>
<p>Last month, Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjum¬≠and  <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904570">approved two petitions</a> filed on behalf of Imran related to the requests. The court had sought a response from Adiala authorities to provide the facilities.</p>
<p>Today, the judge heard a request by the prison authorities against the court order and dismissed it</p>
<p>A report to the judge from the jail superintendent on Monday had called for the court‚Äôs orders on January 10 and February 3 to be reviewed and set aside due to ‚Äúbeing inconsistent and contrary to the basic rights and principle of recognition of the inherent dignity and equal inalienable rights of inmates‚Äù, arguing that extending the two facilities to Imran would be against the spirit of the Constitution, as well as Pakistan Prison Rules.</p>
<p>A court order issued today, available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, said the judgements passed on Jan 10 and 28 and Feb 3 were passed after taking into account all relevant factors and could not be received without any solid reason and thus, the jail superintendent‚Äôs request was turned down.</p>
<p>The order instructed the superintendent to ‚Äústrictly follow‚Äù the three orders in ‚Äúletter and spirit‚Äù. The hearing was adjourned to next Wednesday.</p>
<p>A day prior, Imran‚Äôs sons ‚Äî Suleman Khan (28) and Qasim Khan (26) ‚Äî had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910789/in-rare-interview-imrans-sons-call-attention-to-their-fathers-incarceration">called</a> attention to their father‚Äôs incarceration. The two, in a rare public appearance, had appealed for his release, claiming that their phone calls were set up with their father at odd times with limited duration, adding that the failure to miss the calls ‚Äúmeant going a long time before they could talk to him again.‚Äù</p>
<p>They had further claimed they spoke to Imran only once every two or three months.</p>
<p>Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831/legal-woes-deepen-as-imran-and-bushra-convicted-in-ps190m-al-qadir-trust-case">¬£190 million corruption case</a> and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9, 2023, protests.</p></p>
