            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907535/psx-slumps-over-3500-points-as-pakistan-expects-indian-action' target='_blank'><strong>PSX slumps over 3,500 points as Pakistan expects Indian action</strong></a>
            <p><p>Bears took control of the trade floor as shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) plunged by more than 3,500 points  — a development that analysts attributed to investor anxiety over potential Indian military action against the country.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index decreased by 1,717.35 points, or 1.5 per cent, to stand at 113,154.83 from the last close of 114,872.18 at 9:53am.</p>
<p>At 10:38am, the index declined by 2,073.42 points, or 1.8pc, from the last close.</p>
<p>By 1:50pm, more selling pressure ensued at the stock market as the KSE-100 index plunged by 3,255.42 points, or 2.83pc, from the last close.</p>
<p>Finally, the index closed at 111,326.57, down by 3,545.61 or 3.09pc, from the last close of 114,872.18.</p>
<p>Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, attributed the decline to “news of likely attack in next few days”.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said, “Investors are worried about potential Indian military action against Pakistan, concerns that have intensified following the information minister’s press briefing.”</p>
<p>Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, echoed the same sentiments.</p>
<p>He said that the market was under pressure following the information minister’s “statement last night suggesting that India may take military action within the next 24–36 hours”.</p>
<p>“The market in the short term will most likely follow newsflows of Pakistan-India tensions,” he added.</p>
<p>Sana Tawfik, head of research at Arif Habib Limited, also credited the slump primarily on geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">said</a> that “credible intelligence” reports indicated that India was planning to conduct a military action against Pakistan in the next 24 to 36 hours amid tensions between the two countries after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> in occupied Kashmir last week that New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">blamed</a> on Islamabad, albeit without proof.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, India gave its military “operational freedom” to respond to the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media hours after the development, Tarar said: “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends carrying out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.”</p>
<p>He said Pakistan vehemently rejected “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region”, adding that it was completely “reckless”.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the KSE-100 index had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907349/shares-at-psx-climb-800-points-after-imf-announcement">bounced</a> back on the trading floor after the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907317/imf-board-to-meet-on-may-9-to-discuss-pakistans-programmes">confirmed</a> that the Fund’s Executive Board will meet on May 9 to discuss the country’s staff-level agreement for a new $1.3 billion arrangement under a climate resilience loan programme, along with the first review of Pakistan’s ongoing $7bn bailout programme.</p>

<p>Pakistan’s international bonds dropped more than 1 cent after the information minister’s statement.</p>
<p>The 2036 bond suffered the biggest decline, falling 1.3 cents to be bid at 71.85 cents in the dollar, Tradeweb data showed, though bid-ask spreads of around 1 cent pointed to limited liquidity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Indian shares were muted as gains in heavyweight HDFC Bank helped offset pressure from tensions with Pakistan, while Bajaj Finance declined despite posting a rise in fourth-quarter profit.</p>
<p>The Nifty 50 was down 0.05pc at 24,324 and the BSE Sensex lost 0.07pc to 80,236.6 as of 10:43am.</p>
<p>Both benchmarks swung between 0.2pc gains and 0.2pc losses in early trade.</p>
<p>“For now, geopolitical tensions (with Pakistan) have overtaken (US) tariffs in investors’ minds,” said Anita Gandhi, founder and head of institutional business at Arihant Capital Markets.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">granted</a> military chiefs freedom to respond to last week’s attack in Pahalgam, <em>Reuters</em> reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Nifty volatility index has risen in five of the six sessions since the attack.</p>
<p>Six of the 13 major sectors declined on Wednesday, while the small- and mid-caps fell 0.6pc and 0.1pc, respectively.</p>
<p>Non-bank lender Bajaj Finance fell 5.4pc, leading losses on the Nifty, despite posting a higher quarterly profit, as brokerages flagged weak pre-provision profit and higher credit costs as negatives.</p>

            <p><p>Indian fighter jets patrolling above occupied Kashmir were forced to flee after the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) scrambled its jets, state media <a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvnews/urdunewsdetail/5442" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on Wednesday, adding to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">tensions</a> between the two countries in the wake of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>.</p>
<p>India, without offering any evidence, has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">political</a> and military leadership have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">strongly denied</a> any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a> into the incident.</p>
<p>The tensions between the arch-rivals have intensified in the past few days, with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforced its forces</a> and was ready for any incursion by India, while on the other side, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given his military “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>” to act on the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p><em><a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvnews/urdunewsdetail/5442" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PTV News</a></em> and <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/30-04-2025/paf-forced-four-indian-fighter-jets-to-flee-following-presence-detected-in-occupied-jammu-kashmir" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em>, citing security sources, said that four Rafale fighter jets of the Indian Air Force (IAF) were spotted conducting “patrolling overnight” in occupied Kashmir without crossing the Line of Control.</p>
<p>“PAF jets promptly detected the presence of these Indian warplanes,” <em>Radio Pakistan</em> added.</p>
<p>“As a result of PAF’s diligent action, the Indian Rafale jets panicked and were forced to flee,” <em>PTV News</em> reported. The security sources also reaffirmed that the armed forces were “fully prepared and vigilant to give a befitting response to any aggression from India”.</p>
<p>The government and the military have yet to provide details on the incident.</p>
<p>The development comes after Information Minister Attaullah Tarar earlier today said “credible intelligence” reports indicated that India was planning to conduct a military action against Pakistan in the “next 24 to 36 hours”.</p>
<p>In a televised <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> issued shortly after 2am, Tarar said: “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends to carry out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, and was one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front, said it “unequivocally” denied involvement in the attack, after an initial message that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=The%20Resistance%20Front%E2%80%99%2C%20is%20said%20to%20have%20claimed%20responsibility%20for%20the%20attack.">claimed</a> responsibility.</p>
<p>Tarar said Pakistan vehemently rejected “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region” and it was completely “reckless”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Pakistan has been the victim of terrorism itself and truly understands the pain of this scourge,” the minister said, adding: “We have always condemned it in all its forms and manifestations anywhere in the world.”</p>
<p>Being a responsible state, Tarar noted, Pakistan “openheartedly offered a credible, transparent and independent investigation” by a neutral commission of experts to ascertain the truth.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, rather than pursuing the path of reason, India has apparently decided to tread the dangerous path of irrationality and confrontation, which will have catastrophic consequences for the complete region and beyond,” he stressed.</p>
<p>The information minister said the “evasion of credible investigations is in itself sufficient evidence exposing India’s real motives”.</p>
<p>“Consciously making strategic decisions hostage to public sentiments, purposefully trumped up for securing political objectives, is unfortunate and deplorable,” he added.</p>
<p>Tarar reiterated that any such military adventurism by India would be responded to assuredly and decisively.</p>
<p>“The international community must remain alive to the reality that the onus of [an] escalatory spiral and its ensuing consequences shall squarely lie with India.”</p>
<p>He reiterated the nation’s resolve to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan at all costs.</p>
<p>Deputy PM Ishaq Dar has said Pakistan will not strike India but reserves the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907464">right to retaliate</a>. He informed the Senate yesterday that intelligence reports suggest that India was contemplating some form of escalation.</p>

<p>Today’s incident also comes after the Pakistan Army yesterday shot down <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907495/two-indian-drones-shot-down-near-loc">two Indian quadcopters</a> after they violated the country’s airspace along the Line of Control (LoC) in two separate areas of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, official sources said.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907326/pakistan-shoots-down-indian-quadcopter-violating-airspace-near-loc-state-media">first drone</a> was brought down in the Manawar sector of Bhimber district, where it was reportedly engaged in aerial surveillance when intercepted and destroyed by Pakistani troops. The second unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down in Poonch division’s Satwal sector.</p>

<p>The downing of the drones occurred amid continued exchange of fire along the LoC in Leepa Valley since the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers#:~:text=troops%20exchanged%20fire%20overnight%20across%20the%20Line%20of%20Control%20(LoC)%20in%20Kashmir">night of April 25</a>, breaking a period of relative calm in the region. No casualties were immediately reported.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as concerns over a potential breakdown of peace grew, shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907535/shares-at-psx-slump-on-heightened-pakistan-india-tensions">faced a major fall</a> in intraday trade today.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, state broadcaster <em>PTV</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvnews/urdunewsdetail/5467" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that the Pakistan Army responded to overnight unprovoked Indian firing on the LoC in AJK.</p>

<p>“According to security sources, on the night of April 29 and 30, India violated the ceasefire on the LoC. India opened unprovoked fire in the Kayani and Mandal sectors of the LoC,” <em>PTV</em> reported.</p>
<p>India used small arms in the unprovoked firing incident, the state broadcaster added.</p>
<p>“Security sources have confirmed that the Pakistan Army has responded forcefully and given a befitting reply to the Indian Army. The enemy has been silenced with an effective response,” the report said.</p>
<p>The state broadcaster cited reports of the destruction of several Indian bunkers due to the effective response of the Pakistan Army, adding, “Security sources have said that India’s Chakpatra post has been destroyed”.</p>
<p>“Earlier, India had also evacuated the border areas of occupied Kashmir while a crackdown against Muslims is underway,” PTV said, adding that the Pakistan Army was always ready to defend the integrity of the country.</p>

<p>However, two Airblue flights destined between Skardu and Islamabad operated as per their schedule, the sources added.</p>
<p>The PIA official noted that the air route between Gilgit-Baltistan and other cities passes “near Indian territories”. When the passengers reached the airports, they were told that the flights had been cancelled due to security concerns.</p>

<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ImranKhanPTI/status/1917257395530784969" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> posted on Imran’s X account, which is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859070#:~:text=but%20nobody%20knows%20who%20has%20been%20given%20access%20to%20manage%20the%20%E2%80%98X%E2%80%99%20handle%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20PTI%20leader%20said">handled</a> by a PTI member, quoted the ex-premier as telling his lawyers yesterday: “Peace is our priority but it should not be mistaken as cowardice.”</p>
<p>Recalling the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1536224">2019 Pulwama-Balakot incidents</a> during his tenure, Imran said, “We offered to extend all-out cooperation to India but India failed to produce any concrete evidence.</p>
<p>“[…] Instead of introspection and investigation, Modi <em>sarkar</em> is again placing the blame on Pakistan,” the former prime minister added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>He urged India to act responsibly instead of messing with a region already known as a “nuclear flashpoint”.</p>
<p>“I have always emphasised the importance of the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination, as guaranteed by United Nations resolutions,” Imran stressed.</p>
<p>“Needless to say, to win the war against an external enemy, the nation must first be united. It is high time to put a halt to all actions that are further polarising the nation,” he said, adding that the “state’s excessive focus on political victimisation at this critical time is deepening internal divisions”.</p>
<p>“Ironically, Narendra Modi’s aggression has united the people of Pakistan in one voice against Indian hostility,” the ex-premier noted.</p>

<p>A week after the Pahalgam attack, Modi yesterday told the armed forces that they had the “complete <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a> to decide on the mode, targets and timing of our response to the terror attack”, a senior government source who was not authorised to speak to the media told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>The government released video images of a stern-faced Modi holding a closed-door meeting with his army and security chiefs, as well as Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.</p>
<p>India’s cabinet committee on security (CCS) — consisting of Modi and his interior, defence, home and finance ministers — is scheduled to meet later today, a government source told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>This would be the second such meeting of the CCS since the attack on April 22. In its first meeting, the committee had decided to take a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">series of measures</a> against Pakistan, including the suspension of the Indus Water Treaty.</p>
<p>Last week, Modi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284#:~:text=dangerous%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20warned.-,Modi%20vows%20to%20pursue%20attackers%20to%20%E2%80%98ends%20of%20the%20Earth%E2%80%99,-Meanwhile%2C%20in%20India">vowed to pursue</a> those who carried out the attack in the tourist hotspot of Pahalgam and those who had supported it.</p>
<p>“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” he said. “We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth”.</p>

<p>Calls have also grown from Indian politicians and others for military action against Pakistan. <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907518/disturbing-escalation">Analysts</a> say they fear bellicose statements will escalate into possible military action.</p>
<p>Amid escalating tensions, friendly countries and global powers have urged India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, advising them to solve the matter through diplomatic engagement.</p>
<p>Last night, US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce announced that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was expected to speak to the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan “as early as today or tomorrow”.</p>
<p>She said the US was reaching out to both parties regarding the Kashmir issue, and is expected to tell both sides not to escalate things any further.</p>
<p>Bruce said that Rubio was also encouraging leaders and foreign ministers from other nations to reach out over the issue.</p>
<p>Following the Pahalgam attack, US President Donald Trump had extended his “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905973/two-dozen-dead-as-tourists-targeted-in-held-kashmir#:~:text=US%20President%20Donald%20Trump%20said%20that%20India%20had%20the%20full%20support%20of%20the%20US.">full support</a>” to India. He later downplayed the regional tensions, saying the dispute would get “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906480">figured out</a>”.</p>

<p>Iran has already <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">offered to mediate</a>, and Saudi Arabia has said Riyadh was trying to “prevent an escalation”.

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906480/un-urges-pakistan-india-to-show-maximum-restraint-after-pahalgam-attack">United Nations</a> has urged the arch-rivals to show “maximum restraint”, with its chief Antonio Guterres yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar#:~:text=PM%20Shehbaz%20urges%20UN%20chief%20to%20%E2%80%98counsel%20India%E2%80%99%20to%20%E2%80%98exercise%20restraint%E2%80%99">offering</a> “his good offices to support de-escalation efforts”.</p>
<p>In his phone call with the UN chief on Tuesday, PM Shehbaz encouraged him to counsel India to “act responsibly and exercise restraint”.</p>
<p>The worst attack in recent years in occupied Kashmir was at Pulwama in 2019, when a person rammed a car packed with explosives into a security forces convoy, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1463946">killing 40</a> and wounding 35.</p>
<p>Indian fighter jets <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1466038">carried out air strikes</a> on Pakistani territory 12 days later. The next day, the PAF undertook strikes across the LoC from Pakistani airspace.</p>

            <p><p>Four people, including the driver, were killed and several others were injured on Wednesday when a tractor-trolley fell into a deep gorge in the Ghanche district of Gilgit-Baltistan, officials said.</p>
<p>According to police spokesperson Ghulam Muhammad, the incident occurred in the morning near the Gulshan Kabir area of Ghanche district when labourers working on a construction project were travelling on the tractor-trolley.</p>
<p>The driver lost control of the vehicle and it fell some 150-200 feet into a deep gorge. As a result, four people, including the driver were killed, while 16 labourers were injured.</p>
<p>However, Ghanche district Rescue 1122 Media Coordinator Zulfiqar Ali said the number of injured was 12.</p>
<p>The injured were administered first aid at a nearby dispensary, and later shifted to a hospital on the recommendation of the medical staff, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>He added that the cause of the incident is being investigated and more details will be shared soon.</p></p>
