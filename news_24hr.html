            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921423/jcp-nominates-chief-justices-of-high-courts' target='_blank'><strong>JCP nominates chief justices of high courts</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) on Tuesday appointed the chief justices to the four high courts, a statement issued by the Supreme Court said.</p>
<p>Per the statement, the JCP held four consecutive meetings to make a decision related to the appointments and, by a majority of its total membership in each meeting, opted to allow the acting chief justices to continue serving the top roles.</p>
<p>Letters were subsequently issued to the prime minister’s principal secretary, informing the government about the nominations and requesting the forwarding of the same to the president for their appointment.</p>
<p>The letters said that Justice Sarfraz Dogar was nominated as the new chief justice of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), Justice Rozi Khan Barrech as the chief justice for the Balochistan High Court (BHC), Justice Syed Muhammad Attique Shah for the Peshawar High Court, and Justice Junaid Ghaffar for the Sindh High Court (SHC).</p>
<p>Pre­sident Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921132/president-names-justice-dogar-top-judge-at-ihc">already formally decla­red</a> Justice Dogar the “senior-most judge” of the IHC, following the issuance of a revised seniority list by the Ministry of Law and Justice.</p>
<p>The development followed a ruling by the Supreme Court on June 19, upholding the constitutionality of transferring three judges from other provincial high courts and referring the matter of seniority determination to the president.</p>
<p>On Friday, five IHC judges had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920890">challenged</a> the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the transfer of three judges — Justice Dogar from the LHC, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro from the SHC, and Justice Muhammad Asif from the BHC.</p>
<p>President Zardari had also declared that the status of the transfer of all three judges would be permanent.</p></p>

            <p><p>Security forces eliminated two “India-backed” terrorists after an attack on government offices in Balochistan’s Mastung district that killed a teenager and injured seven others on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Terrorists in Balochistan, previously engaged in a low-level insurgency, have recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896269">intensified</a> their attacks. The banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) emerged as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1882568">key perpetrator</a> of terrorist violence in Pakistan in 2024.</p>
<p>“Two terrorists were killed while another three were injured in an intense fire exchange between the security forces and the terrorists,” Balochistan spokesperson Shahid Rind said in a statement.</p>

<p>“<em>Fitna al Hindustan</em> attacked the tehsil office, government offices and a bank. A 16-year-old boy died while seven individuals were injured by the terrorists’ firing,” the statement read.</p>
<p>The term “<em><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357#:~:text=state%2Dsponsored%20proxies%20of%20India%20(Fitna%20al%20Hindustan)">Fitna al Hindu­stan</a></em>” is a new phrase coined by Pakistan’s military, aimed at framing India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">alleged role</a> in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>
<p>“The Frontier Constabulary, Counter-Terrorism Department and Levies immediately cordoned off the area, crushing the terrorists,” Rind asserted. An intense fire exchange occurred after the security forces “encircled” the terrorists, he added.</p>
<p>Mastung Deputy Commissioner Athar Abbas Raja also confirmed the attack to <em>Dawn.com</em>, adding, “Heavy firing and blasts [were] heard in the small town at around 11am.”</p>

<p>Action against the perpetrators was ongoing while an “organised” clearance operation was also underway at the site of the incident, according to the government statement.</p>
<p>It added that search efforts to trace the facilitators of the attackers had also been initiated. The operation to “protect citizens and arrest terrorists” was based on intelligence input, Rind said.</p>
<p>“The immediate response by the security forces was effective in preventing further loss of lives,” the government official highlighted.</p>

<p>Militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in the country last month, according to data <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914847/militant-attacks-increased-to-85-in-may-pakistan-institute-for-conflict-and-security-studies">released</a> by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, which recorded 85 attacks in May compared to 81 in April.</p>
<p>In one of the recent major attacks, a school bus in Balochistan’s Khuzdar was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357">targeted</a> on May 21, leaving eight children among <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913363">10 dead</a>.</p>
<p>In April, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904388">three policemen</a> were martyred and at least 16 others were injured as a blast targeted a vehicle of the Balochistan Constabulary on Mastung’s Dasht Road.</p>
<p>Last month, security forces killed two “Indian sponsored terrorists” in Balochistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921014/2-terrorists-killed-2-arrested-in-balochistans-duki-district-ispr">Duki district</a> and another two in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915835">Kachhi</a>.</p>

<p>On June 18, a man and a woman were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918035">shot dead</a> when unknown gunmen opened fire at them in the Surgaz area, a locality on the outskirts of Mastung town. Another woman and a child sitting in the car were injured in the firing.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>The country ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>

            <p><p>Pakistan has called for the internal reform of the UN’s counterterrorism architecture with a balanced and rights-based global framework.</p>
<p>The country was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915422">appointed</a> as the vice chair of the UN Security Council’s (UNSC) Counter-Terrorism Committee on June 4. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the appointment <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915643">reaffirmed</a> the international community’s trust in the country’s counterterrorism credentials.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PakistanUN_NY/status/1939911512409186399" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> issued today by the Permanent Mission of Pakistan to the UN said that speaking at the UN headquarters a day earlier, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad said that the counterterrorism architecture should be capable of addressing Prolonged conflicts, while eliminating injustice, oppression and violations of international law under the pretext of counterterrorism, and ending conditions conducive to terrorism.</p>
<p>“We must also clearly distinguish between terrorism and the legitimate struggle against foreign occupation and the right to self-determination,” he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>“The UNOCT must also integrate respect for human rights and [the] rule of law to prevent abuse of counterterrorism actions by member states. The more we shy away from addressing these issues, the more prolonged our counterterrorism efforts will be.”</p>
<p>He further said that successful counterterrorism action requires concerted efforts, which were present in the framework of international law.</p>
<p>“He urged the international community to combat all forms of terrorism and take collective action without double standards or discrimination, prevent its exploitation for politically motivated agendas and shift public opinion away from the real challenges that we face today,” the press release read.</p>

<p>Ambassador Asim also called for adequate changes to the sanctions regimes to incorporate new and emerging threats and an end to the stigmatisation of Islam and Muslims, it added.</p>
<p>“While noting a surge in the emergence of right-wing, extremist and fascist movements in several countries, which are leading to terrorist violence, he (Asim) said that we see a strong inclination to see non-Muslim acts of terrorism as just violent crime,” it said.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s UN envoy highlighted that counterterrorism remained “one of the most important pillars to address threats to international peace and security”, saying that Pakistan has remained a principal victim of terrorism, with more than 80,000 lives lost and billions of dollars of losses to its economy in the war on terrorism.</p>
<p>He said that terrorism transcends boundaries and its evolution into new and emerging forms was being facilitated by modern ICTs in an increasingly globalised world, stressing the need for “effective and meaningful” counterterrorism efforts based on “consensually agreed-upon principles driven primarily by member states”.</p>
<p>“Ambassador Asim expressed Pakistan’s concern with the entry of norms, soft laws and ‘non-binding guiding principles’ into the global counterterrorism discourse by either the Security Council through its 1373 CTC and/or expert reports, which do not enjoy consensus of the wider membership,” the press release added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He proposed the establishment of a “subsidiary body as an intergovernmental framework” under the General Assembly to oversee its universal consideration.</p>
<p>The UN Ambassador said that integrating the work of global compact entities such as Interpol and UN agencies with national law enforcement agencies can significantly enhance information and intelligence sharing relating to the movement of terrorists and terror financing.</p>
<p>“We must merge some of the UN entities or restrict their mandates to streamline UNOCT’s work. There are far too many agencies doing similar work, leading to duplication, including capacity building initiatives,” he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The UNSC Counter-Terrorism Committee was established by UNSC resolution 1373 (2001), adopted unanimously on September 28, 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.</p>
<p>The committee, comprising all 15 UNSC members, is tasked with monitoring implementation of the above resolution, which requested countries to implement several measures intended to enhance their legal and institutional ability to counter terrorist activities at home, in their regions and around the world.</p>
<p>Pakistan was also appointed head of the UNSC committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011), which oversees the implementation of the sanctions measures on the Afghan Taliban.</p></p>
