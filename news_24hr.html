            <p><p>One person survived as over 200 people were killed when an Air India plane bound for London with 242 people on board crashed minutes after taking off from the western city of Ahmedabad on Thursday, authorities said, in the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.</p>
<p>The plane came down in a residential area, crashing onto a medical college hostel outside the airport during lunch hour. It was headed for Gatwick Airport, south of the British capital.</p>
<p>City police chief GS Malik told <em>Reuters</em> that 204 bodies had been recovered from the crash site. There were no reports of survivors being found, and the <em>Indian Express</em> newspaper <a class="link--external" href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ahmedabad-plane-crash-live-updates-air-india-flight-boeing-london-passengers-death-casualties-rescue-2739697-2025-06-12" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> all 242 on board had perished, citing police.</p>
<p>The majority of the people on board are feared dead, a top official in the Directorate General of Civil Aviation <a class="link--external" href="https://theprint.in/india/ahmedabad-air-india-plane-crash-many-feared-dead-bodies-being-retrieved/2655314/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>The Print</em>.

<p>Malik said the bodies recovered could include both passengers and people killed on the ground.
Relatives had been asked to give DNA samples to identify the dead, state health secretary Dhananjay Dwivedi said.</p>
<p>“The building on which it has crashed is a doctors’ hostel … we have cleared almost 70 per cent to 80pc of the area and will clear the rest soon,” a senior police officer told reporters.</p>

            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump on Thursday once again offered to arbitrate the Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India, echoing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916481/trump-willing-to-work-on-kashmir-issue-confirms-us-state-dept">comments</a> made by the US State Department a day prior.</p>
<p>Trump had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910785/fo-reiterates-support-for-trump-offer-to-resolve-kashmir-issue">offered</a> to work on the Kashmir issue after he brokered a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914608">ceasefire</a> between the two nuclear powers following their most intense <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military confrontation</a> in decades. In a message lauding the countries’ leaders for achieving peace, he remarked, “I will work with both of you to see if, after a ‘thousand years’, a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir.”</p>
<p>Responding to a question on the steps the US plans to take in the wake of Trump’s offer, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce noted, “[Trump] has been the only one to bring certain people to the table to have conversations that nobody thought was possible,” remaining hopeful that the Kashmir issue can also get resolved.</p>
<p>Fielding questions after a bill-signing ceremony on Thursday, the US president said that he “stopped a war” between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>“Eventually they were gonna go nuclear … and I stopped it, I called each leader … and I spoke to them and talked about trade,” Trump said. “I said, ‘You’re not trading with us if you go to war … if you’re going to start throwing nuclear weapons around.</p>
<p>“They were both unbelievable. They understood it exactly, they stopped. I stopped that war with phone calls and trade,” Trump added.</p>
<p>He further said that India is negotiating a trade deal in Washington, and a Pakistani delegation would arrive “I think next week”.</p>
<p>In response to another question, Trump said, “We’re going to get them together. I told them, India and Pakistan … they have a longtime rivalry over Kashmir. I told them ‘I can solve anything.’</p>
<p>“I will be your arbitrator. I will be your arbitrator. I can solve anything.”</p>

<p>Pakistan and India have been at odds since the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> in occupied Kashmir, which saw the killing of 26 tourists. New Delhi, without any evidence, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">blamed</a> Islamabad for the attack, while the latter strongly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">denied</a> the claims and offered a neutral probe.

<p>Earlier this month, Pakis­tan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">launched</a> a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent conflict with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence there.

            <p><p>Pakistan was bottom-ranked among 148 countries in the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Gender Gap Report 2025 — with 56.7 per cent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1760949">gender parity</a> — the highest since 2006, it emerged on Thursday.</p>
<p>The annual report benchmarked the current state and evolution of gender parity across four key dimensions: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment.</p>
<p>In the latest <a class="link--external" href="https://reports.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>, Pakistan has been ranked below Sudan, (57pc, 147th), Chad (57.1pc, 146th), Iran (58.3pc,145th), Guinea (59.5pc, 144th), Democratic Republic of the Congo (60.1pc, 143rd), Niger (61.3pc,142nd), Algeria (61.4pc, 141st), and Mali (61.7pc, 140th).</p>
<p>Occupying the bottom rank of the index, Pakistan saw its overall parity score decline from last year’s edition, from 57pc to 56.7pc, the report said. Overall Pakistan has closed +2.3 of its gender gap since 2006.</p>
<p>However, this year’s results were a second consecutive drop from the economy’s best score of 57.7pc, achieved in 2023. Pakistan’s parity in economic participation and opportunity has declined by 1.3 percentage points, the report said.</p>
<p>While economic representation indicators have remained unchanged, income disparity in Pakistan has slightly increased since the last edition (0.02 points), as has perceived wage inequality (4 percentage points).</p>
<p>The sole sub-index advance registered by Pakistan in this year’s edition was “Educational Attainment”, bumping educational parity upwards by 1.5 percentage points to reach 85.1pc.</p>
<p>The shift was partly driven by an increase in female literacy rates (from 46.5pc to 48.5pc). However, parity has also risen because male enrolment shares have dropped in tertiary education, increasing the relative balance between men and women but lowering educational reach overall.</p>
<p>The report said Pakistan’s economy had seen political parity drop from 12.2pc in 2024 to 11pc in 2025.</p>
<p>While parity in parliament increased by 1.2 percentage points, women’s ministerial representation dropped from 5.9pc in 2024 to zero in 2025 and with it the overall sub-index score, the report added.</p>
<p>Pakistan was listed among countries including Azerbaijan, Hungary, Saudi Arabia, and Vanuatu that have all-male ministerial cabinets.</p>
<p>Commenting on the 2025 edition of the report, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, Saadia Zahidi, said the report “arrives at a decisive moment, with the world in flux as technological breakthroughs, geopolitical conflict and economic uncertainty are creating unprecedented challenges as well as bringing new opportunities.</p>
<p>“Amid such change, gender parity is both a principle and a strategy,’’ she said, adding that “economies that tap into the full spectrum of their talent and human capital are best positioned to navigate an era of transformation and accelerate productivity and prosperity.”</p>
<p>Zahidi said most economies were not fully leveraging this pathway for growth.</p>

<p>The report found that there was still a combined global average gender gap of over 30pc across four areas: economic participation and opportunity, political empowerment, educational attainment and health and survival, she added.</p>
<p>The global gender gap score in 2025 for all 148 economies included in this edition of the index stands at 68.8pc. The global gender gap closed by 0.3 percentage points in 2025, from 68.4pc in 2024 to 68.8pct in 2025.</p>
<p>Based on the collective speed of progress of those 100 economies, it will take 123 years to reach full parity globally, the report said.</p>
<p>The 2025 Global Gender Gap Index shows that no economy has yet achieved full gender parity. Iceland (92.6pc) continues to lead the Global Gender Gap Index, holding the top position for 16 consecutive years, and remains the only economy to have closed more than 90pc of its gender gap since 2022.</p>
<p>Each of the top 10 ranked economies have closed at least 80pc of their gender gaps, the only economies to do so. Globally, gender parity has increased by 4.8 percentage points since 2006.</p></p>

            <p><p>Florence in Italy could hit 39C as hot weather sweeps continent, while parts of South Africa brace for snow</p><p>The severe thunderstorms that have been lashing parts of Europe over recent days are expected to give way to high temperatures this week. Several regions could climb to 10C (50F) above seasonal norms, with Italy braced for the full force of the heat. Florence in Tuscany is forecast to soar to a sweltering 39C on Thursday and across the weekend.</p><p>Germany, France and Belgium will also face hot weather from Wednesday, with widespread highs at least 9C above the June average. Many other parts of Europe are forecast to experience temperatures 5-7C above normal. This is the result of a high-pressure system creating a heat dome over the region, whereby sinking air compresses and warms as it descends, trapping heat near the surface.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/09/weather-tracker-storms-summer-heat-europe-south-africa">Continue reading...</a></p>
