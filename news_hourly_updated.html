                <h2>SBP cuts interest rate by 100bps to 11pc</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) cut the policy rate on Monday to 11 per cent, amid trade and industry sectors advocating for a significant cut.</p>
<p>The central bank‚Äôs policy rate, after being slashed by 1,000bps from 22pc since June 2024 in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1888017">six intervals</a>, previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897015">stood at 12pc</a>.</p>
<p>April inflation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908067/inflation-hits-all-time-low-of-03pc">stood</a> at a low of 0.3pc, largely due to a high base a year ago. The reduction is also primarily attributed to lower prices of key food staples such as wheat and its derivatives, onions, potatoes and certain pulses, as well as a cut in electricity and fuel charges. These items carry significant weight in the inflation basket ‚Äî the Consumer Price Index (CPI) ‚Äî meaning minor price changes can heavily influence the overall rate.</p>
<p>According to a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.sbp.org.pk/press/2025/Pr-05-May-2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notification</a> issued by the SBP today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the interest rate, noting that inflation in April turned out to be lower than expected, mainly due to a drop in prices of perishable food items and electricity and fuel charges.</p>
<p>According to the statement, core inflation declined in April, primarily reflecting favourable base-effect amid moderate demand conditions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOverall, the MPC assessed that the inflation outlook has improved further relative to the previous assessment,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>The committee viewed that the heightened global uncertainty surrounding trade tariffs and geopolitical developments could pose challenges for the economy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn this backdrop, the MPC emphasised the importance of maintaining a measured monetary policy stance,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>The committee also noted key developments since the last meeting.</p>
<p>It said that the provisional real GDP growth for Q2-FY25 was reported at 1.7 per cent year-on-year whereas Q1 growth was revised up to 1.3pc from 0.9pc.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecond, the current account recorded a sizable surplus of $1.2 billion in March, mainly due to record-high workers‚Äô remittances,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>It said that the surplus and SBP‚Äôs foreign exchange purchases partially cushioned the impact of large ongoing debt repayments on the SBP‚Äôs foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>It also said that recent surveys suggested further improvement in both consumer and business sentiments, adding that shortfall in tax collection has continued to widen.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGlobal uncertainty, particularly around tariffs, has led the IMF to sharply downgrade its 2025 and 2026 growth projections for both advanced and emerging economies,‚Äù the statement said, adding that the tariff uncertainty also triggered heightened financial market volatility and a sharp decline in global oil prices.</p>
<p>‚ÄúConsidering the evolving developments and risks, the MPC viewed that the real policy rate remains adequately positive to stabilise inflation in the target range of 5pc to 7pc, while ensuring that the economy grows on a sustainable basis,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>Separately, the statement said that headline inflation, continuing its downtrend, fell to 0.3pc y/y in April, driven primarily by food and energy prices.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA sharp decline in wheat and allied product prices, moderation in global commodity prices and downward adjustment in electricity tariffs were the major drivers of this ease in food and energy prices,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese factors also contributed to the moderation in inflation expectations of consumers,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>Moreover, core inflation, after remaining sticky at around 9pc over the past few months, declined to 8.0pc y/y in April, it added.</p>
<p>The statement said that going forward, the committee anticipated inflation to gradually inch up in the coming months and stabilise within the target range of 5pc to 7pc.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis outlook is, however, subject to both upside and downside risks emanating from volatility in wheat and other food prices, timing and magnitude of energy price adjustments, potential global supply-chain disruptions and uncertain commodity price outlook.‚Äù</p>
<p>Earlier, it noted that despite a long-term decline in inflation and real interest rates above 11pc, opinions on the central bank‚Äôs likely decision on the policy rate were divided, with trade and industry sectors advocating for a significant cut.</p>
<p>Researchers had conducted polls to gauge market sentiment, but the 0.3pc inflation in April has caused division among those who were confident there would be no change in the interest rate.</p>
<p>However, many experts <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908316">believed</a> the SBP would cut the rate by 50bps. Some had also found reasons for a likely status quo as they feel the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">war-like situation</a> between India and Pakistan has created uncertainty that may escalate prices.</p>
<p>This situation may force the central bank to adopt a cautious approach in the face of sudden shocks of higher inflation.</p>
<p>The SBP‚Äôs MPC met today to set the key interest rate for the next two months. In March, the central bank delivered a surprise by leaving its policy rate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897015">unchanged</a> in the last review, disappointing the business community.</p></p>

                <h2>Pahalgam attack attempt to divert attention from India‚Äôs cross-border terrorism: Dar</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday said that a recent attack in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam was an attempt to ‚Äúdivert attention‚Äù from India‚Äôs internal challenges and its cross-border terrorism.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India, without investigation or evidence, implied ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack%20were%20brought%20out">cross-border linkages</a>‚Äù of the att¬≠a¬≠¬≠¬≠c¬≠kers. Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">firmly</a> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315/pahalgam-attack-fm-dar-throws-down-gauntlet-to-india-asks-for-evidence-of-allegations-against-pakistan">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> as it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an incursion and India‚Äôs premier granting ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>‚Äù to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war">military</a> warning of a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907785/any-military-misadventure-by-india-will-be-met-with-swift-resolute-notch-up-response-coas">swift</a>‚Äù response to any misadventure by New Delhi, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907930/us-hopes-that-indias-response-to-pahalgam-attack-doesnt-lead-to-broader-regional-conflict-vance">diplomatic channels</a> have remained engaged to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>Addressing the Regional Dialogue 2025 in Islamabad today, organised by the Institute of Regional Studies, Dar said Pakistan believed the Pahalgam attack was part of an effort to ‚Äúdivert attention‚Äù from India‚Äôs internal challenges, adding that it could be ‚Äúself-choreographed‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe believe that what has happened is to divert attention ‚Äî I am talking of Pahalgam ‚Äî from India‚Äôs internal challenges, state-sponsored terrorism, the ongoing human rights violations in the Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir, and to gain narrow domestic political objectives,‚Äù Dar said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget that there are some by-elections coming in the next few months in India,‚Äù he added, referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907658">upcoming polls in Bihar</a> in October.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis brinkmanship carries consequences that extend far beyond India‚Äôs borders,‚Äù the deputy PM warned, calling India‚Äôs actions ‚Äúunilateral, politically-motivated and highly provocative‚Äù.</p>
<p>He noted: ‚ÄúThere appears to be a calculated and premeditated attempt to escalate regional tensions, following a familiar pattern ‚Äî level allegations against Pakistan without evidence, use inflammatory rhetoric, incite war hysteria and use this as a pretext for aggression and unilateral actions.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a reference to the Indian government, Dar stressed that regional and international peace and security could not be ‚Äúsacrificed at the altar of narrow electoral gains‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is a dangerous political game and gamble, putting at stake the lives of millions in the region,‚Äù the foreign minister highlighted. However, he also reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to regional peace: ‚ÄúWe will support all efforts towards de-escalation.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnalysts say this could be another ploy. It might have been self-choreographed,‚Äù echoing Pakistani leaders‚Äô previous statements of the Pahalgam attack being a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906207">false flag operation</a>‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow can an FIR (first information report) be registered in 10 minutes at a police station where you need at least 45 minutes to reach? [‚Ä¶] Come on. Nobody‚Äôs a fool,‚Äù Dar quipped.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInternational dignitaries are talking [to] both sides. Few of them ‚Äî great friends ‚Äî suggested to me, ‚ÄòCan you try and help the perpetrators be caught?‚Äô I said ‚Äòcome on, do you know the distance where it happened and where‚Äôs the Line of Control? 230 kilometres.‚Äù</p>
<p>The deputy PM asserted: ‚ÄúPakistan has exposed India‚Äôs mala fide and they are now on the backfoot. But it takes two to tango. I am telling all these dignitaries that we will show patience and will not be the first ones to attack.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut if anybody makes any mistake and ventures into adventurism, then God knows what situation that will lead to. I hope sense prevails and they should [reflect].‚Äù</p>
<p>He detailed that he has directed Pakistan‚Äôs permanent representative to the United Nations to request a meeting of the UN Security Council.</p>

<p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs share with them the facts and figures and the details and the evidence we showed the other day,‚Äù said Dar, referring to his press briefing with the military‚Äôs spokesperson, where they <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">accused India</a> of activating its ‚Äúassets‚Äù to inte¬≠nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI cannot find the word abeyance in any international treaties‚Äô dictionary. The word suspension is there,‚Äù Dar said, referring to India‚Äôs unilateral <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">suspension</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>.</p>

<p>The premier shared Pakistan‚Äôs perspective on the prevailing situation in South Asia in the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident and rejected India‚Äôs attempts to link Pakistan to the incident without providing any evidence.</p>
<p>He also reiterated his offer for a transparent, credible and neutral international investigation into the incident and invited the UK to join it, the PMO statement added.</p>
<p>Noting that the UK enjoyed ‚Äúgood relations‚Äù with both India and Pakistan, PM Shehbaz assured Marriott that Islamabad ‚Äúwould never take any action that could imperil regional peace and security‚Äù.</p>
<p>The prime minister stressed that with the support of friendly countries, including the UK, his government‚Äôs ‚Äúforemost priority remained advancing economic growth and development of the country‚Äù.</p>

<p>The two discussed matters of bilateral importance, with a particular focus on the ongoing situation between Pakistan and India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>The Chinese ambassador reaffirmed the ‚Äúenduring and time-tested friendship between China and Pakistan‚Äù, describing the relationship as one of ‚Äúironclad brothers‚Äù who have always supported each other in challenging times.</p>

<p>Zardari conveyed his deep appreciation and gratitude to the Chinese government for its ‚Äúconsistent support, always standing by Pakistan in difficult times‚Äù.</p>
<p>On Thursday, PM <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907760">thanked China‚Äôs envoy</a> for endorsing his offer to conduct a neutral probe into the Pahalgam attack. Last week, China had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907094/china-urges-india-pakistan-to-exercise-restraint-after-pahalgam-attack">urged</a> both India and Pakistan to ‚Äúexercise restraint‚Äù as the two countries reportedly exchanged fire at the Line of Control (LoC).</p>
<p>As Pakistan continues diplomatic engagement with various countries to brief them on the ongoing situation, PM Shehbaz yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908460#:~:text=Prime%20Minister%20Shehbaz%20Sharif%20talked%20to%20his%20Malaysian%20counterpart%2C%20while%20Foreign%20Minister%20Ishaq%20Dar%20spoke%20to%20the%20Malaysian%20as%20well%20as%20Russian%20foreign%20ministers">spoke</a> to his Malaysian counterpart, while Dar spoke to the foreign ministers of Malaysia and Russia.</p>

<p>Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar visited the LoC in Azad Jammu and Kashmir with local and foreign media and dismissed India‚Äôs allegations of ‚Äúterrorist hideouts‚Äù there, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/05-05-2025/info-minister-visits-loc-along-with-local-foreign-media" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The visit facilitated by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting was aimed at exposing the ‚Äúfalse and baseless Indian propaganda‚Äù, the report said, pointing out that media representatives were taken to specific locations that India had allegedly ‚Äúlabelled as terrorist hideouts‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBy witnessing the ground situation, hearing from the local population, and observing the environment firsthand, the media got the opportunity to assess the truth behind India‚Äôs claims,‚Äù <em>Radio Pakistan</em> noted.</p>
<p>Among the group of international journalists was <em>CNN</em>‚Äôs International Diplomatic Editor <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/NicRobertsonCNN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nic Robertson</a>.</p>
<p>According to <em>Radio Pakistan</em>, Robertson visited a village where Muhammad Farooq and Muhammad Deen were killed in a ‚Äúfake encounter by the Indian army‚Äù.</p>
<p>The <em>CNN</em> editor interviewed both men‚Äôs bereaved families, who appealed for justice through international media, the report said.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Tarar said: ‚ÄúIndia is now claiming the presence of training camps in Bela Noor Shah, which is near Pir Chinasi, and that they were used in the Pahalgam attack.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis area is 26 kilometres away from the LoC and the purpose of coming here is to show that Indian propaganda is false, fake, and concocted,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs narrative has failed miserably, and the international media has not picked it up. There are contradictions in India‚Äôs response and they are not able to provide evidence,‚Äù the minister said.</p>
<p>He asserted: ‚ÄúThere are no terrorist camps here. There are beautiful mountains and people [only].‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt resort to any misadventure,‚Äù Tarar warned, adding that Pakistan would give a befitting response to any Indian aggression and would go to any extent to defend its sovereignty.</p>
<p>Echoing Deputy PM Dar‚Äôs statements, Tarar said India uses propaganda to ‚Äúhide its internal failures‚Äù.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Pakistan Army again responded to unprovoked firing by the Indian army along the LoC overnight, state broadcaster <em><a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvworld/newsdetail/5439" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PTV News</a></em> reported.</p>

<p>According to security sources, Indian troops resorted to unprovoked firing on multiple Pakistani military posts in Nakyal, Khuiratta, Sharda, Kel, Neelum and Haji Pir sectors along the LoC.</p>
<p>The action was responded to in a befitting manner by the Pakistan Army, <em>PTV News</em> added. It quoted security sources as saying that the armed forces were ‚Äúfully alert‚Äù.</p>
<p>Pakistani troops had previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension#:~:text=Pakistan%20responds%20to%20unprovoked%20Indian%20firing%20on%20LoC">responded</a> to ‚Äúunprovoked‚Äù Indian firing on April 30.

<p>Acting on a global level, Islamabad has decided to seek an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908460">immediate session</a> of the United Nations Security Council to apprise world powers about the recent tensions with India.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Foreign Office said FM Dar has issued directions to Pakistan‚Äôs permanent representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar, to take immediate steps for the UNSC session.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis important diplomatic move is part of Pakistan‚Äôs efforts to present true facts before the international community,‚Äù the statement said, adding that Pakistan decided to formally brief the UNSC on the latest situation in the region, as well as India‚Äôs aggressive steps and provocative statements.</p>
<p>It said Pakistan would specifically highlight the suspension of the IWT by India.</p>
<p>The instructions came two days after Ambassador Iftikhar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908062">said</a> Pakistan was closely following the situation stemming from India‚Äôs aggressive moves in the wake of the Pahalgam attack and would seek a UNSC meeting at an appropriate time.</p></p>
