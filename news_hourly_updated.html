                <h2>Trump says escalation ‘a shame’, Guterres urges restraint</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump has said said the escalation between India and Pakistan was a “shame”.</p>
<p>He was the first world leader to react to the tense situation after India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">carried out strikes</a> inside Pakistan which also retaliated and reportedly shot down Indian jets.</p>
<p>“It’s a shame. We just heard about it as we were walking in the doors of the Oval [Office],” he said inside the White House after overseeing the swearing-in ceremony for his special envoy, Steve Witkoff.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>“I guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past. They’ve been fighting for a long time,” the US president added.</p>
<p>“I hope it ends very quickly.”</p>
<p>In a statement, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called for restraint from both countries, Associated Press  reported.</p>
<p>“The Secretary-General is very concerned about the Indian military  operations across the Line of Control and international border. He calls  for maximum military restraint from both countries. The world cannot  afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan,” said  the statement.</p>
<p>The US State Department also said it is “closely monitoring developments,” <em>CNN</em> reported.</p>
<p>“We are aware of the reports, however we have no assessment to offer at this time,” the spokesperson said. “This remains an evolving situation,and we are closely monitoring developments.”</p>

                <h2>Pakistan downs 5 Indian jets as retaliation for late-night strikes at 6 sites: officials</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Pakistani military has brought down five Indian jets in retaliation for late-night strikes launched by its neighbouring country at six sites, including in Punjab’s Sialkot and Bahawalpur, as well as Azad Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between Pakistan and India began a little after 1am on Wednesday with the Indian air strikes when the neighbouring country launched what it termed “Operation Sindoor”. Soon after reports emerged, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) confirmed the strikes, saying that India had carried out the attacks from within its airspace. The military spokesperson provided an updated damage assessment of the scenario at around 4am, reporting the death of eight civilians.</p>
<p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed the downing of two Indian jets around 2:45am after Pakistan launched its swift response, while the confirmation for the third plane, a Rafale aircraft, came an hour later. Confirmation of the fourth and fifth Indian jets being taken down came after 5am by Tarar and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif.</p>
<p>Providing further updates on the casualties, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said the number of lives had risen to 26 civilians across six localities that India hit, with 46 injured.</p>

<p>Talking to the media around 7am at the information ministry, Tarar asserted that India had waved a white flag at the Line of Control and “accepted defeat”. The minister said this as footage of a white flag played in the background.</p>
<p>“They have been forced to wave a white flag,” Tarar said. <em>PTV News</em> also shared <a class="link--external" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJVelCktXce" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">footage</a> of a white flag hoisted seemingly on top of a structure.</p>

<p>Tarar further said that “several” posts of the Indian army across the border had been destroyed by the armed forces.</p>
<p>He recalled that Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">called for a probe</a> into the Pahalgam attack but India “conducted this attack and then fled from it”. “It is a cause of shame for them that they targeted innocent labourers and citizens,” he added.</p>
<p>According to the minister, Pakistan did not target any civilians in India in its retaliatory actions.</p>

<p>In an interview to <em>Bloomberg TV</em>, Defence Minister Asif said that Pakistan has shot down five Indian planes and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles, with checkposts destroyed along the Line of Control.</p>

<p>Similarly, appearing on <em>Geo News</em> at 5:09am, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also said that Pakistan had downed five Indian jets.</p>
<p>“[We shot jets down] in Akhnoor, Ambala, Barnala and in Jammu. We also shot down quadcopters and a big drone,” he stated. “It is an ongoing situation, we need to see what India does.”</p>
<p>The military, <em>Reuters</em> reported, said the five Indian fighter jets included three Rafale planes and one each of Russian planes, a Su-30 and MiG-29.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch    media--uneven  media--stretch">

    </figure></p>
<p>A spokesman for the military told <em>Reuters</em> Indian planes were only targeted after they attacked Pakistan.</p>
<p>There was no word from India on the downing of the jets, which would be the most serious loss for the Indian military in decades and risked further escalation.</p>
<p>The Rafale fighter is a new addition to India’s military, part of a plan to modernise its military, reduce dependence on Russian-origin equipment, and boost domestic weapons production to supply forces deployed along two contentious borders with Pakistan and China.</p>
<p>Before the clash, the Indian Air Force operated 36 Rafale fighters, while the navy’s aircraft fleet mainly comprises Russian MiG-29 jets.</p>
<p>India signed a deal with France’s Dassault Aviation on Monday to buy another 26 Rafale fighter aircraft worth 630 billion rupees ($7.4bn) for its navy in late April.</p>
<p>Tarar earlier said that Pakistan’s military response was ongoing but did not share operational details. “We shot down two Indian planes and we are responding to Indian aggression right now as we speak,” he told British broadcaster <em>Sky News</em>.</p>
<p>“Indian media, in a state of frenzy, is continuously running fabricated stories about losses of Pakistani Air Force and false claims of damaged aircraft,” <em>PTV</em> had said, stating, “No Pakistan Air Force aircraft has sustained any damage.”</p>

<p>“We offered an investigation into the whole Pahalgam episode, we wanted a fair and transparent investigation. But … India, without evidence, has targeted civilians, women and children. India had no right to do that,” he added.</p>
<p>“As the minister for information, I have occupied a seat of responsibility,” Tarar said. “I have taken an oath and I will give you verified information.”</p>
<p>When asked why India blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack, Tarar replied: “This area (Pahalgam) is a good 200km from the LoC. The FIR was filed in 10 minutes, but police arrived after one and a half hours.”</p>
<p>Tarar accused India of “running away” from an investigation into the Pahalgam attack and accused India’s governing party of “wanting a reason to attack Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“We have a high morale and we will respond to Indian aggression,” he said.</p>
<p>“India has no evidence whatsoever to link Pakistan to this incident,” he stressed. “India has attacked civilians … without any justifiable cause and because we have the right to self-defence, we will defend our country, we will respond.”</p>
<p>Questioned about terrorists found hiding in Pakistan in the past, including Al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden, Tarar rejected the allegations and reiterated that Pakistan was facing terrorist attacks “every second week”.</p>
<p>“If you’re talking about the history — the Soviet invasion, the cold war — then that’s a different story,” he said.</p>
<p>Tarar also maintained that the US had thanked Pakistan for its efforts in the war against terrorism and “for the good fight we are fighting”.</p>
<p>“India will now face Pakistan’s very fierce response, because we are never the aggressors,” he said.</p>
<p>Referring to Pahalgam, Tarar said India “is questioning its own government”.</p>
<p>“They have no evidence, they have no facts and they ran away from the investigation which Pakistan had offered,” the minister added. They attacked our civilians, they attacked our mosque today, they attacked five localities. Pakistan will now respond and will respond very, very effectively.</p>
<p>“Our desire for peace should not be mistaken for weakness,” he said.</p>
<p>When asked about India’s strikes, Tarar said that no terrorist infrastructure was hit.</p>
<p>“When I took foreign and local journalists to a village near the LoC … tomorrow morning, I was planning to take them to Bahawalpur and Muridke to show them where the strikes have occurred, to show that the local population is living there.</p>
<p>“We totally deny India’s allegations regarding terrorists,” Tarar maintained. “We have complete evidence that women and children have been targeted, there are civilian casualties in this and we will bring the evidence to foreign and local media. There are no terrorist camps.”</p>
<p>Questioned about the possibility of de-escalation, Tarar said that the situation is ongoing, adding, “let’s see how it turns out”.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>ARY News</em> at 1:06am about the initial details of the attack, DG Chaudhry said: “All of our air force jets are airborne. This cowardly and shameful attack was carried out from within India’s airspace. They were never allowed to come and intrude into the space of Pakistan.”</p>
<p>He noted: “Let me say it unequivocally: Pakistan will respond to this at a time and place of its own choosing. This heinous provocation will not go unanswered.”</p>
<p>“This temporary happiness that India has achieved with this cowardly attack will be replaced with enduring grief.”</p>

<p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told <em>ARY News</em> that civilian areas were attacked.</p>
<p>“The attacks were carried out on civilian areas,” Asif said, adding that the “cowards” attacked from their own airspace. “They never left their house. Let them come out, we will respond fittingly.”</p>
<p>When asked about Pakistan’s decisions, Asif replied that Pakistan will retaliate.</p>
<p>“We will give a far greater response than their own strike,” the minister said. “Not only did they attack civilians but they did it from their own airspace.”</p>
<p>On <em>Geo News</em>, Asif clarified that the strikes were launched from within India’s airspace.</p>
<p>“Women and children have been martyred in civilian areas. India is claiming it was targeting terrorist camps,” he said. “There is no such thing, international media can visit the targets so that India’s lies are exposed. We are offering international media to come wherever attacks have happened.”</p>
<p>The defence minister further said: “They don’t have the courage to attack us in our airspace, and they are firing on women and children. Mosques have been destroyed.”</p>
<p>He vowed that “we will give a befitting response,” he said. “They will immediately receive their due.”</p>
<p>Multiple loud explosions were heard in Azad Jammu and Kashmir close to the mountains around the city of Muzaffarabad after midnight, multiple <em>Reuters</em> witnesses said.</p>
<p>After the explosions, the city’s power was blacked out, the witnesses said.</p>

<p>The FO said that on Dar’s direction, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the United Nations in New York has informed the UN Security Council of India’s open aggression and threats to international peace and security.</p>
<p><a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/michaelkugelman/status/1919893617620972016?s=46" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michael Kugelman</a>, an expert on Washington’s relations with South Asian nations, noted: “India’s strike on Pakistan is of much greater scale than the one in 2019.</p>
<p>“Pakistan’s response, which according to many reports included downing several Indian jets, has also exceeded the scale of 2019.  They’re already higher up the escalatory ladder than any time in [the] 2019 crisis,” he added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, sources in the Civil Aviation Authority said Pakistan’s airspace was to be completely closed and the Islamabad International Airport was closed for flights, with all flights diverted to Karachi airport.</p>
<p>The sources said the airspace was initially closed for 48 hours and all flights were cancelled, with passengers advised to return home.</p>
<p>“Major change in air routes in the region. All foreign flights rerouted to Pakistani airspace. Foreign flights leave Pakistani airspace and head towards the Arabian Sea. Flights withdrawn from Pak-India airspace, new route to the Arabian Sea adopted. International flights away from Pakistani airspace,” the sources said.</p>

<p>“Authorities have advised passengers not to come to the airport and to return home,” it reported.</p>
<p>The Flight Radar 24 online tracker showed that international flights to Karachi were still scheduled.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the British Foreign Office <a class="link--external" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued</a> a travel advisory advising against all but essential travel to Pakistan.</p>

<p>Earlier, Asif said that a clash with India “can happen anytime” amid the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586">ongoing tensions</a> between the two countries in the wake of a militant attack in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the headquarters of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) earlier in the day, where he was briefed on the country’s preparation for a “conventional threat”. Asif was also part of the visit.</p>
<p>Speaking in an interview on <em>Geo News</em> show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ on the briefings in the ISI HQ, the defence minister reiterated that he had already said before that a clash with India was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907158">imminent</a>.</p>
<p>“That is still imminent today and can happen anytime,” he said, adding that a confrontation could be “one of the choice” India could want to adopt but “we have developed a countermeasure for every choice, whether that is a surgical strike or ground attack or air attack or naval engagement.</p>
<p>“We are ready for them everywhere at all times.”</p>
<p>He said the “crux” of today’s briefing was that “every kind of incursion or attack is being expected from them.”</p>
<p>Asif added that the briefing also delved into Pakistan’s strategy for responding to any situation.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

<p>Questioned about the chance of an ambush on a large scale, the minister said such actions were always taken on a small scale and added that he did not see any possibility of a big ambush or movement since it was detected immediately.</p>
<p>“We are continuously monitoring them,” he said, referring to Indian activities on the border. “Everything is in our watch. It is not the matter that they’re doing something hidden, which will cause an ambush.”</p>
<p>Asif said Pakistan’s preparation was complete and the government would not sit idly by. “A befitting response will be given to them at every level the moment they make a move.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the United States on Tuesday again called for calm between India and Pakistan, after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned of stopping water from flowing across borders.</p>
<p>“We continue to urge Pakistan and India to work towards a responsible resolution that maintains long-term peace and regional stability in South Asia,” State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters.</p>
<p>She did not comment on Modi’s latest comments but said that the US was “aware of various reports” on the situation and was “engaged”. “We remain in touch with the governments of both countries at multiple levels,” she said.</p>

<p>Pakistan has also taken the matter to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586">United Nations Security Council</a>, which was briefed on the country’s stance on the Pahalgam attack and India’s “unsubstantiated” allegations.</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz’s visit to the ISI HQ in Islamabad entailed a detailed briefing on the prevailing security environment, “with a particular focus on preparedness for [a] conventional threat in the light of India’s increasingly aggressive and provocative posture along Pakistan’s eastern border”, a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1919716801669148837" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from the PM Office (PMO) said.</p>

<p>“The leadership was apprised of regional security developments and the evolving threat matrix, including conventional military options, hybrid warfare tactics and terrorist proxies,” it added.</p>
<p>The premier was accompanied by Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, Asif and the services chiefs, the PMO said.</p>
<p>The services chiefs — Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar — were part of the visiting team, according to a group photo released on the occasion.</p>
<p>The picture also showed ISI Director General Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik — who was recently appointed as the country’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907660">national security adviser</a> — and the DG ISPR present there.</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz and the accompanying dignitaries “underscored the imperative of heightened national vigilance, seamless inter-agency coordination, and reinforced operational readiness to deter and decisively respond to any violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”, the PMO said.</p>
<p>Commending the ISI’s “professionalism and strategic acumen”, the prime minister lauded its “critical role in safeguarding national interests and enabling informed national security decision-making under complex and dynamic conditions”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan Army is one of the most professional and disciplined force in the world,” the premier was quoted as saying. He reaffirmed that the entire nation was standing with “our brave armed forces”.</p>
<p>“The leadership reaffirmed Pakistan’s unambiguous resolve to defend the homeland against all threats — conventional or otherwise,” the statement read.</p>
<p>The leaders reiterated that with the nation’s full support, the armed forces, supported by all other elements of national power and state institutions, remained “fully prepared to uphold Pakistan’s security, prestige, and honour under all circumstances”.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also visited the newly established National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre (Niftac) and formally inaugurated its state-of-the-art headquarters, “which will serve as the central node for coordinating Pakistan’s national counterterrorism strategy”, the PMO said.</p>
<p>“Niftac, a federal institution, integrates over 50 relevant federal and provincial departments and agencies into a unified intelligence and threat management architecture supported by a centralised national database.”</p>
<p>The statement added that at the subnational level, Niftac is linked to six Provincial Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centres (Piftacs), including those in AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan, ensuring seamless coordination from the federation to the provinces.</p>
<p>Commending the efforts of all stakeholders involved in operationalising this vital capability, the prime minister described Niftac as a quintessential national platform for collaborative threat assessment and response. He underscored that “dismantling the nexus between terrorism, illicit networks, and external sponsorship requires robust and efficient institutional mechanisms.”</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said Niftac would play a pivotal role in uprooting terrorism and its support structures from the country.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Modi said that water from India that once flowed across borders would be stopped.</p>
<p>Modi did not mention Pakistan specifically, but his speech comes after New Delhi suspended its part of the 65-year-old Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which governs water critical for consumption and agriculture.</p>
<p>“India’s water used to go outside, now it will flow for India”, Modi said in a speech in New Delhi. “India’s water will be stopped for India’s interests, and it will be utilised for India.”</p>
<p>Pakistan has warned that tampering with its rivers would be considered “an act of war”.</p>
<p>However, experts also pointed out that India’s existing dams do not have the capacity to block or divert water and can only regulate the timing of when they release flows.</p>
<p>Islamabad accused India of altering the flow of the Chenab River, one of three rivers placed under Pakistan’s control according to the IWT.</p>
<p>“We have witnessed changes in the river (Chenab) which are not natural at all,” Punjab Irrigation Minister Kazim Pirzada told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>“The majority impact will be felt in areas which have fewer alternate water routes,” Pirzada warned.</p>
<p>“One day the river had normal inflow and the next day it was greatly reduced,” Pirzada added.</p>
<p>In AJK, large quantities of water from India were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906856">reportedly released</a> on April 26, according to the Jinnah Institute.</p>
<p>“This is being done so that we don’t get to utilise the water,” Pirzada added.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the FO Dar held a telephonic conversation with Afghan Acting FM Amir Khan Muttaqi who “appreciated Pakistan’s proactive steps to ease trade and facilitate travel”, amid rising tensions with India.</p>
<p>It added that Muttaqi extended an invitation to Dar to visit Afghanistan again. “He conveyed prayers and best wishes for the government and people of Pakistan,” the FO said.</p>
<p>Dar also briefed his Afghan counterpart on recent provocation and “illegal and unilateral measures” by India against Pakistan, reiterating Pakistan’s commitment to peace and safeguarding its sovereignty.</p>
<p>Both leaders expressed satisfaction with the pace of progress made by the two sides in bilateral relations since the deputy PM’s visit to Afghanistan on April 19, with a focus on trade, connectivity, economic cooperation, people-to-people contacts and reactivating political consultative mechanisms.</p>
<p>The two sides also agreed on the importance of maintaining high-level contacts for fostering long-term cooperation to promote peace and security in the region and beyond, the statement concluded.</p>
