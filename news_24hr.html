            <p><p>UK’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs David Lammy on Saturday urged “all sides” to abide by their treaty obligations, referring to India’s move last month to hold the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a> (IWT) with Pakistan in abeyance unilaterally.</p>
<p>Delhi’s suspension of its participation in the 1960 IWT was part of its series of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">measures</a> against Pakistan, which it blamed, without any evidence, for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">strongly denied</a> any involvement and offered a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a> into it.</p>
<p>“We would urge all sides to meet their treaty obligations,” Lammy told <em>Reuters</em> in Islamabad at the end of his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911413/india-should-adhere-to-ceasefire-pakistan-will-respond-if-hostilities-resume-fo#:~:text=FM%20Dar%20appreciates%20UK%20role%20in%20de%2Descalation">two-day visit</a>, when asked about India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">April 23 suspension</a> of the (IWT), potentially <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911383">squeezing</a> Pakistan’s water supply.</p>
<p>The 1960 pact governs the use of the Indus River system. Pakistan has said it would consider “any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan” to be an “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">act of war</a>”.</p>
<p>Islamabad plans to launch <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907454">international legal action</a> against India over its move. The Pakistan Commission on Indus Waters earlier this month <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908458">shared</a> a detailed report with the federal government about massive violations of the IWT by New Delhi.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>During his interview with <em>Reuters</em>, Lammy also said Britain was working with the US to ensure a ceasefire between India and Pakistan endures.</p>
<p>“We will continue to work with the United States to ensure that we get an enduring ceasefire, to ensure that dialogue is happening and to work through with Pakistan and India how we can get to confidence and confidence-building measures between the two sides,” Lammy said.</p>
<p>“These are two neighbours with a long history but they are two neighbours that have barely been able to speak to one other over this past period, and we want to ensure that we do not see further escalation and that the ceasefire endures,” he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Pakistan has said Britain and other countries, in addition to the United States, played a major role in de-escalating the fighting. Diplomats and analysts say the ceasefire <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911472">remains fragile</a>.</p>
<p>Lammy also said Britain would continue to work with Pakistan on countering “terrorism”, saying that it is “a terrible blight on this country and its people, and of course on the region”.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said Washington had averted what could have been a nuclear war between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as tensions over the Pahalgam attack allegations continued to build up. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepting drones</a> sent by India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns. On May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, Trump announced that a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> had been reached between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>“The situation had escalated to the point where nuclear war could have broken out,” Trump said in an interview with US outlet <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-says-comey-knew-assassination-meaning-behind-deleted-social-media-post#:~:text=pointed%20to%20a%20recent%20ceasefire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News</a></em> on Friday.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to a question about getting both countries to step back from the brink of war, Trump called it a “bigger success than I will ever be given credit for”.</p>
<p>“Those are major nuclear powers […] and they were angry. […] It was tit-for-tat, it was getting deeper and more missiles,” he said. He added the next step would have been “the N-word”, responding in the affirmative to the host confirming he meant “nuclear”.</p>
<p>“That’s the worst thing that can happen,” Trump noted. Referring to discussions he said he had with both Pakistan and India on trade, the US president said: “I’m using trade to settle scores and make peace.”</p>
<p>Trump said that he had great conversations with Pakistan. “You know we can’t forget them because it takes two to tango.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“So proud of what we’re able to do with India and with Pakistan,” the US president said.</p>
<p>He continued that Pakistan would love to trade with the US. “They are brilliant people. They make amazing products. We don’t do much trading with them.”</p>
<p>As the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810/trumps-tariffs-stoke-global-trade-war-as-china-eu-hit-back">imposed heavy levies</a> on dozens of allies and rivals alike on April 2, Pakistan was hit by a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901838/economists-see-hurdles-and-opportunities-for-pakistan-as-us-imposes-29pc-tariff-on-country">29 per cent tariff</a> on goods it exports to the US. The government has said it is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906864">seeking ways</a> to address the existing trade imbalance between the two countries.</p>
<p>On trade with New Delhi, Trump said that India was one of the highly tariffed nations, making it almost “impossible to do business”.</p>
<p>However, India is ready to cut 100pc of its tariffs for the US, he added. “That deal will come soon,” the president said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, he had stated that India had offered a trade deal that proposed “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911203">no tariffs</a>” for American goods.</p>
<p>This interview was the third time in a week that the US president expressed his intention of deepening trade ties with Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>“We’re going to do a lot of trade with Pakistan … and India,” Trump said earlier this week, recalling that he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910565/trump-says-warned-pakistan-india-of-no-trade-if-fighting-not-halted">warned</a> both countries of “not doing any trade” if they did not stop fighting. A day after the ceasefire, he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910382#:~:text=adding%20that%20he%20also%20intended%20to%20%E2%80%9Cincrease%20trade%20substantially%20with%20both%20of%20these%20great%20nations%E2%80%9D">said</a> he was going “to increase trade substantially with both of these great nations”.</p>
<p>The US-brokered ceasefire had brought a halt to a week of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909156/nuclear-war-can-break-out-at-any-time-in-case-of-pak-india-standoff-khawaja-asif">record escalation</a> between Pakistan and India as the latter took a series of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988">unprovoked military actions</a> despite Islamabad’s call for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a> into India’s allegations over the Pahalgam attack.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Trump said after the ceasefire was struck that talks should take place in a third-country venue but no dates or location for the talks have been announced.</p>
<p>The military has confirmed that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910992">13 security personnel</a>, including members of the Pakistan Army and the Pakistan Air Force, were martyred while over 75 were injured during the confrontation with India.</p>
<p>It has also stated that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910848/40-civilians-11-personnel-martyred-in-indian-strikes">40 civilians</a> — including seven women and 15 children — lost their lives during the Indian aggression, while 121 others sustained injuries.</p></p>

            <p><p>Lt General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, director general of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), has lauded Iran’s peace efforts in the recent Pakistan-India conflict and warned of “forces” seeking to create a rift among brotherly countries.</p>
<p>Just two days after India, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">without</a> any evidence, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack">blamed</a> Pakistan over last month’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, Iran had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers">offered to mediate</a> between the two as tensions escalated.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is fully grateful to the international community, and we are especially grateful to brotherly countries, including the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Gen Chaudhry told <em>IRNA</em> in an <a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85835207/Exclusive-Pakistani-military-spokesperson-Islamabad-appreciates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> published today — the first by any Pakistani armed forces’ spokesperson to an Iranian outlet.</p>
<p>“We should be aware that there are forces in the region that, with the help of external factors, are seeking to create misunderstanding and confusion among brotherly countries in the region and want to create a rift between friends and brothers,” the DG ISPR added.</p>

<p>According to <em>IRNA</em>, Lt Gen Chaudhry spoke about the latest developments in South Asia as well as the “importance of regional and international diplomacy to help de-escalate tensions”. He also “focused” on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">recent visit</a> of Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to Islamabad, the report added.</p>
<p>During his visit to Islamabad, Araghchi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586#:~:text=Iran%20FM%20meets%20with%20PM%20Shehbaz%2C%20army%20chief">met with</a> Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir. He later also made a trip <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909355/irans-foreign-minister-repeats-call-for-restraint-in-india-pakistan-standoff">to New Delhi</a>, reiterating his call for restraint.</p>

<p>The DG ISPR appreciated Tehran’s efforts and support to help de-escalate tensions in the region.</p>
<p>“We are pleased with all the efforts of the international community and brotherly countries, especially Iran, which played a role in reducing tensions,” he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as tensions over the Pahalgam attack continued to build up. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties.

<p>The Pakistani army spokesman emphasised that Iran and Pakistan “have very historical and brotherly relations and have always stood by each other in all challenges and trials”.</p>

<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry highlighted that the two nations were “neighbouring and friendly countries that are in contact with each other on many issues and fields”.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is eager and pursues that the borders of the two countries are the borders of peace and friendship, and we look forward to it,” the DG ISPR told <em>IRNA</em>.</p>
<p>The military’s spokesperson stressed that Tehran and Islamabad were “cooperating together for lasting peace and stability in the region”.</p>

<p>Separately, the ISPR said President Asif Ali Zardari visited Gujranwala Cantonment today where he lauded the “exemplary conduct and professional excellence” of the military in the successful execution of Marqa-i-Haq, acknowledging their “resolute determination and unshakable courage in the face of unprovoked aggression”.</p>
<p>“He paid solemn tribute to the military and civilian martyrs who laid down their lives in defence of the motherland, affirming that their sacrifice remains a sacred trust and a source of enduring national pride. He underscored that the sons of the soil, fortified by the enduring spirit of the nation, stood with unwavering resolve to defend the motherland and thwarted hostile designs with exceptional valour and operational acumen.”</p>
<p>The president said history would bear witness to how, “within a matter of hours, the Pakistan Armed Forces repelled aggression with unmatched precision and resolve, sending an unequivocal message” of the country’s strength, resilience and national unity.</p>
<p>During his interaction with officers and troops, the president commended their “exemplary morale, combat readiness and devotion to duty”.</p>
<p>The ISPR added that he extended congratulations on the successful culmination of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, and expressed “profound pride in the defenders of the nation, affirming that the people of Pakistan hold their brave soldiers in the highest esteem as the true custodians of national honour and sovereignty”.</p>
<p>Separately, PML-N President and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif praised the armed forces and parliament for national unity.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the PML-N said Nawaz lauded the professionalism and bravery of the armed forces, saying they “defended the motherland like an iron wall against Indian aggression”.</p>
<p>“We offer our deepest gratitude to God for granting us success,” he was quoted as saying during a meeting with PML-N Parliamentary Leader in the Senate and Chairman of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Senator Irfan Siddiqui, who called on him in Raiwind.</p>
<p>Nawaz also lauded the role of parliament, saying that “setting aside all political differences and speaking with one voice for the sake of national security” was a welcome and commendable step.</p>
<p>“By reflecting the emotions of 240 million citizens, the people’s representatives boosted the spirit of the brave armed forces,” he said.</p>
<p>He also commended Pakistani media for “presenting the truth before the world and exposing the enemy’s falsehoods”.</p>
<p>Senator Siddiqui briefed the PML-N president on the parliamentary party’s performance during the session. Nawaz underscored the importance of institutional collaboration, stating that parliament’s unified stance had reinforced national resolve and showcased Pakistan’s democratic maturity in times of crisis.</p>
<p>The statement concluded that the meeting underscored the PML-N’s commitment to upholding state interests and its confidence in democratic institutions.</p>

            <p><p>PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khanum and former party MNA Kanwal Shauzab had a tense exchange in court on Saturday over a video that surfaced of the latter criticising the former.</p>
<p>In the recently surfaced video, Shauzab can be allegedly heard and seen criticising Aleema for disrespecting party office-holders and interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, saying that Imran’s sister should not dent the party. Shauzab allegedly said she would confront Aleema herself over the issue.</p>
<p>That happened today as Shauzab approached Aleema in the Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court (ATC), saying she wanted to talk to her. However, Imran’s sister said: “Just leave it. What you said was right. Many other people speak against us. We are now used to such accusations.”</p>
<p>To this, Shauzab told her that she wanted to speak with her in this regard to which Aleema rebuffed her, saying: “I am not angry with you, [now] go.”</p>
<p>Shauzab replied: “A specific part of an old video of mine was used against me.” Aleema subsequently told her that many from the PML-N and other parties also spoke against her. Imran’s sister thereafter left while ignoring the party member.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah rejected Aleema’s petition requesting permission to exempt her from court appearances so she could travel abroad.</p>
<p>Talking to the media outside the court, she said she had been visiting the courts for the past week due to “newer and newer cases”, alleging that they were being filed to impede her travel abroad.</p>
<p>She questioned who was afraid of her and why for going abroad.</p>
<p>Aleema further alleged that there were around 50-60 cases against her for delivering her brother’s messages to the people.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Islamabad High Court Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910842/ihc-removes-raoof-aleema-from-no-fly-lists">directed the removal</a> of her name from the Provisional National Immigration List and Passport Control List.</p>
<p>Aleema had approached the court to challenge the inclusion of her name in the travel ban lists. The court had allowed her to seek permission to travel abroad by approaching the relevant trial court handling the cases registered against her.</p></p>
