<p>The fatal crash tarnishes the Dreamliner jet’s safety record and could muddy Boeing’s efforts to rebuild trust related to safety and ramp up production under new Chief Executive Officer Kelly Orthberg.</p>
<p>Shares of Spirit AeroSystems, a key supplier, and GE Aerospace, which makes engines for the jet, also fell about 4pc each.</p>
<p>Boeing’s shares were down about 8pc at $196.75 in premarket trading.</p>
<p>“It’s a knee-jerk reaction [to the incident] and there’s revised fears of the problems that plagued Boeing aircraft and Boeing itself in recent years,” said Chris Beauchamp, analyst at IG Group.</p>

<p>In one of the worst aviation disasters in India, two passenger planes collided mid-air near New Delhi in 1996, with the loss of all 349 on board both flights.</p>
<p>Decades earlier, an Air India Boeing 747 flying from Montreal to London in June 1985 crashed into the sea off Ireland with 329 people on board and leaving no survivors.</p>
<p>India’s airline industry has boomed in recent years, International Air Transport Association (IATA) Director General Willie Walsh last month calling growth “nothing short of phenomenal”.</p>
<p>The growth of its economy has made India and its 1.4 billion people the world’s fourth-largest air market — domestic and international — with IATA projecting it will become the third biggest within the decade.</p>
<p>Air India ordered 100 more Airbus planes last year after a giant contract in 2023 for 470 aircraft — 250 Airbus and 220 Boeing.</p>
<p>India’s domestic air passenger traffic reached a milestone last year by “surpassing 500,000 passengers in a single day”, according to India’s Ministry of Civil Aviation.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916729/president-pm-call-for-joint-efforts-from-employers-parents-to-end-child-labour-exploitation' target='_blank'><strong>President, PM call for joint efforts from employers, parents to end child labour, exploitation</strong></a>
            <p><p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday urged parents and employers to make joint efforts to eliminate child labour, as the country observed World Day Against Child Labour.</p>
<p>Over 12.5 million children in Pakistan are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1264451">involved</a> in child labour, according to the Child Rights Movement (CRM) National Secretariat. One in four households in Pakistan employed a child for domestic work, often in hazardous conditions, as per the International Labour Organisation (ILO). According to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1808631/govt-survey-finds-111-per-cent-of-kp-children-working">provincial survey</a>, working children accounted for 11.1 per cent of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s child population.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the President’s House, President Zardari, in his message, called for efforts to protect children from exploitation, expressing hope for a future where children could “learn, play, and grow in a safe and dignified environment”.</p>
<p>Stressing the need for collective action by governments, the president urged employers to “strictly follow child labour laws and ensure that their workplaces are free from exploitation.”</p>
<p>He also called on parents and guardians to prioritise their children’s education over “short-term gains”.</p>
<p>“I urge schools and teachers to identify children at risk of dropping out and keep them in classrooms,” he was quoted as saying in his message.</p>
<p>Detailing Pakistan’s efforts towards ending child labour, he added: “Pakistan has enacted the National Commission on Rights of Child Act (2017), the ICT Child Protection Act (2018), the Juvenile Justice System Act (2018), the Employment of Children’s Act (1991), and the Domestic Workers Act (2002).”</p>
<p>“Pakistan has also established effective mechanisms and service units for the prevention of child exploitation, child labour, and providing care and rehabilitation to the affected children.</p>
<p>“Pakistan, as a signatory to various international conventions aimed at eliminating child labour, is fully committed to ending the exploitation of children.”</p>
<p>He called on the media to raise awareness on the matter of child labour and appealed to philanthropists to “support vulnerable families so that no child is forced into Labour due to poverty.”</p>
<p>He further urged the international community to “pay urgent attention to the children in Gaza”.</p>
<p>“Thousands of innocent children in these areas have been displaced, injured, or orphaned due to violence and aggression by the occupation forces,” he stated.</p>
<p>Noting that children in such vulnerable states were at a heightened risk of being pushed into child labour, he emphasised the need for “immediate global support, protection, and justice.”</p>
<p>“Together, we can dismantle the systems that exploit children and create a Pakistan and a world where every child is free to dream, learn, and build a brighter future.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz, while reaffirming the government’s commitment to ending child labour, highlighted the role of “the federal and provincial governments, the private sector, educational institutions, media, and civil society” in preventing child labour, the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-reaffirms-commitment-to-end-child-labour-ensure-brighter-future-for-every-child/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>“Children subjected to child labour not only face sexual and psychological abuse but they are also deprived of their fundamental right to education. They are robbed of their childhood,” he said.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also noted that children from “developing countries are the most affected by the scourge of child labour.”</p>
<p>“Pakistan stands shoulder to shoulder with the global community in its fight against child labour,” he added.</p>
<p>He said that this year’s theme, “Progress is clear, but there’s more to do: let’s speed up efforts!” highlights that while progress has been made, much more remains to be done.</p>
<p>“On this occasion, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and UNICEF are launching the 2025 Global Estimates and Trends Report on Child Labour, which will help assess the effectiveness of the steps taken so far,” the PM’s statement read.</p>
<p>Reiterating Pakistan’s commitment to ILO conventions on child labour, he noted that Article 11 of the Constitution of Pakistan prohibits all forms of forced labour and child labour.</p>
<p>Appealing to all stakeholders to help the government in its effort to promote education, he pointed out the Danish School system as an initiative by the government to provide access to quality education to underprivileged children.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s last Child Labour Survey, conducted in 1996, determined that agriculture involved the greatest proportion of children engaged in child labour (66pc), followed by manufacturing (11pc), hotels and restaurants (9pc), domestic work, social and personal services (8pc), transport (4pc) and construction (2pc), as per an ILO <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ilo.org/sites/default/files/wcmsp5/groups/public/@asia/@ro-bangkok/@ilo-islamabad/documents/publication/wcms_851153.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report.</a></p>
<p>Every year on June 12, the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ilo.org/topics/child-labour/campaign-and-advocacy-child-labour/world-day-against-child-labour" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ILO</a>, along with its constituents and partners around the world, commemorates the World Day Against Child Labour. This year’s theme reflects both the progress achieved and the urgency to intensify action to meet global targets.</p>
<p>The 2025 World Day focuses on a key milestone: the release of the 2025 global estimates and trends of child labour. This ILO and UNICEF joint report will provide a comprehensive overview of where we stand in our global commitments to eliminate child labour.</p>
<p>Although the detailed data are not yet available, the estimates and trends identified will guide policy debates and calls for renewed commitment and investment.</p></p>

            <p><p>Police arrested a suspect with an extensive criminal record in Punjab’s Lodhran district, while two other suspected dacoits escaped during an exchange of fire, police officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A first information report (FIR) was filed against the suspect at the City Kahror Pakka Police Station on the behalf of the state under sections 324 (attempt to murder), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) for “deliberately attacking police officers with the intention to kill and assisting his accomplices escape”.</p>
<p>The suspect was arrested in an injured condition by the Crime Control Department (CCD), the FIR said. It added that the police team was present at Allah Warai chowk when they received a tip-off that three armed persons were present at Khudai Phatak area.</p>
<p>“Police immediately formed teams and conducted a raid, when the suspects suddenly opened direct fire on the CCD team,” the complaint said.</p>
<p>“The suspects ran towards the railway track as police resorted to aerial firing and chased the suspects,” the FIR added. “Suddenly, two suspects managed to escape on a motorcycle while taking advantage of the darkness of the night.”</p>
<p>Police searched the area and found one of the suspects in an “injured condition”, the FIR further said. The suspect was wounded during an exchange of fire with his accomplices, it stated.</p>
<p>The suspect identified himself as Gul Sher, a resident of Bahawalpur’s Karpal district, while one pistol and 30-bore ammunition were recovered from his possession.</p>
<p>According to a police statement, efforts were being made to arrest the escaped suspects.</p>
<p>It added the suspect had an “extensive criminal record comprising 15 cases related to murder, attempt to murder, resisting a public servant, and robbery”. The cases had been registered against him in different police stations.</p>
<p>The police record showed the suspect was also a “proclaimed offender”, according to a case registered at the Musafir Khana Police Station Bahawalpur on charges of murder, attempt to murder and resisting a government servant.</p>
<p>In another similar incident, a criminal was arrested in an injured condition following an exchange of fire between police and his accomplices, police said.</p>
<p>They added the suspect, Imran alias Imran Khoja, also had an extensive criminal record and had been previously nominated in 30 cases, including armed robbery.</p>
<p>A case was registered against him at the CCD Lodhran police station under Section 324, 353 186 and 34 of the penal code on the complaint of the state, stating that a police team was present at the Jind Pir bridge when they received a tip-off that two suspects, including Imran, were spotted at Aibak Mor.</p>
<p>Police conducted a raid to arrest them when “three suspects opened direct fire upon seeing the police vehicle,” the FIR said.</p>
<p>The police responded by firing shots as the suspects managed run towards the crop fields, it said.</p>
<p>“The exchange of gunfire continued as police searched the fields using a torch and found one of the suspect in an injured condition,” it added.</p>
<p>The complaint said the suspect was “injured after being shot by his accomplices during the exchange of fire.” He identified himself as Imran, while one pistol and 30-bore ammunition were recovered from his possession.</p>
<p>Police said two suspects escaped taking advantage of the darkness of the night and are being perused while police have blocked the exit routes.</p></p>

            <p><p>Florence in Italy could hit 39C as hot weather sweeps continent, while parts of South Africa brace for snow</p><p>The severe thunderstorms that have been lashing parts of Europe over recent days are expected to give way to high temperatures this week. Several regions could climb to 10C (50F) above seasonal norms, with Italy braced for the full force of the heat. Florence in Tuscany is forecast to soar to a sweltering 39C on Thursday and across the weekend.</p><p>Germany, France and Belgium will also face hot weather from Wednesday, with widespread highs at least 9C above the June average. Many other parts of Europe are forecast to experience temperatures 5-7C above normal. This is the result of a high-pressure system creating a heat dome over the region, whereby sinking air compresses and warms as it descends, trapping heat near the surface.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/09/weather-tracker-storms-summer-heat-europe-south-africa">Continue reading...</a></p>
