            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908705/chenab-parched-after-india-reduces-flows-manifold' target='_blank'><strong>Chenab parched after India reduces flows manifold</strong></a>
            <p><p><strong>• Pakistan’s waters being used to fill up three Indian reservoirs with total capacity of 1.2MAF; official says sudden discharge could create a ‘flood-like’ situation<br />
• Decreased inflows at Marala will result in more water shortage for crops, Irsa warns<br />
• Reuters report claims New Delhi plans to boost reservoir holding capacity at two hydroelectric projects</strong></p>
<p>NEARLY a week after its unilateral <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274">suspension</a> of the Indus Waters Treaty, India on Monday virtually stopped water discharges from the Chenab River into Pakistan without prior notice, reducing flows in the river manifold.</p>
<p>Water flows in the Chenab, recorded at the Marala headworks, decreased from up to 35,000 cusecs on Sunday to about 3,100 cusecs on Monday morning.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“They have almost blocked the River Chenab flows to downstream (Pakistan) after they (Ind­ian authorities) took the dec­ision on Sunday,” a senior official of the Punjab irrigation department confirmed on Monday.</p>
<p>“Currently, they are using our water to fill up their dams/hydropower projects in the Chenab basin. They cannot do this since it is a grave violation of the Indus Water Treaty…,” the official deplored.</p>
<p>According to a document seen by <em>Dawn</em>, India has three major hydropower projects in the Chenab Basin. The first is the 1,000MW Pakal Dul Dam, having an 88,000 acre-feet reservoir storage capacity and a 10km head race tunnel to divert water south.</p>
<p>The second is the Baglihar Dam (88km from Pakal Dul upstream). This is a 900MW power generation plant, having a 321,002 acre-feet reservoir storage along with a spillway capacity of 582,692 cusecs.</p>
<p>The third one is Salal Dam, located 78km from Baglihar, having an installed power generation capacity of 690MW along with 228,000 acre-feet reservoir storage and spillway capacity of 792,012 cusecs.</p>
<p>“From Salal Dam, Marala Barrage (in Pakistan) is situated 76km away. The reason behind the massive reduction in the flows is the filling of these dams, which have a total storage capacity of over 1.2 million acre-feet. And if they keep filling their dams and avert discharging, they (India) may leave us without water for four to five days more,” the official warned.</p>
<p>To a question, he said that if India suddenly started discharging water downstream, there could be a flood-like situation in Chenab, putting the local population at risk.</p>
<p>To another question, he said Marala’s capacity was 1.1 million cusecs, whereas the total storage capacity of India’s dams in the Chenab basin was over 1.3 million acre-feet. “However, they don’t have control over the water inflows to Pakistan in the river from the Jammu-Tavi and Munawar-Tavi distributaries,” the official added.</p>
<p>According to the official, Chenab is very important for Pakistan’s irrigation system, as its canals, including the UCC and BRB canals, irrigate a vast tract of agricultural land in Punjab.</p>
<p>According to the daily water report issued by the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the water inflows in Chenab at Marala were recorded at 5,300 cusecs, whereas there were zero outflows on Monday.</p>
<p>The inflows and outflows in the river at Marala on Sunday were 34,600 and 25,400 cusecs, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Shortage for Kharif crops</strong></p>
<p>Separately, a meeting of the advisory committee of the Indus River System Authority also expressed concerns over the unilateral Indian decision that would cause additional shortages to Kharif crops, already facing an estimated 21pc shortfall.</p>
<p>“…sudden decrease in river Chenab inflows at Marala due to short supply by India would result in more shortages in early Kharif season,” said a statement issued by Irsa. The water regulator declared an overall shortage of 21pc for the remaining early Kharif season in case supplies in River Chenab remained normal. However, the situation would be monitored on a daily basis and if the decrease continues, the shortages would be revisited accordingly, Irsa said, adding the late Kharif shortages were expected to be 7pc.</p>
<p>An official told <em>Dawn</em> that Chenab flowed at 35,600 cusecs on Sunday at Marala headwork, but dropped to 3,177 cusecs on Monday morning, showing a reduction of almost 11 times. He said three storages — Baglihar, Dulhasti and Salal — on Chenab in Kashmir had the capacity to stop river flows.</p>
<p><strong>Sindh’s concerns</strong></p>
<p>Sindh representatives recorded their objections over the operationalisation of Chashma-Jhelum Link Canal by Punjab, but was explained that Punjab was using its own share. Sindh, nevertheless, insisted that the opening of the emergency link canal affected Sindh’s allocated share downstream.</p>
<p>Sindh was also told that its share of 76,000 cusecs was being released, which would reach its canal command areas in five to six days. Punjab’s discharges were reduced from 84,000 cusecs to 65,000 cusecs at its request.</p>
<p>The Irsa meeting worked out Punjab’s water availability estimate at 31.35 million acre feet (MAF) for the entire Kharif season, followed by Sindh’s 28.85MAF. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan would get 0.82MAF and 2.86MAF, respectively, during the season.</p>
<p><strong>Work on Indian dams</strong></p>
<p>Separately, the Reuters news agency reported that India has begun work to boost reservoir holding capacity at two hydroelectric projects.</p>
<p>A “reservoir flushing” process to remove sediment began on Thursday, carried out by India’s biggest hydropower company and authorities in the occupied Kashmir, it reported.</p>
<p>The process initially results in sediment-laden waters being released downstream from the reservoirs, potentially causing sudden inundation, followed by a reduced flow of water as the reservoirs are refilled, one of the unnamed sources cited by Reuters said.</p>
<p>The report said the work may not immediately threaten supply to Pakistan, which depends on rivers flowing through India for much of its irrigation and hydropower, but it could eventually be affected if other dams launch similar efforts. There are more than half a dozen such projects in the region.</p>
<p>“India did not inform Pakistan about the work at the Salal and Baglihar projects, which is being done for the first time since they were built in 1987 and 2008/09, respectively, as the treaty had blocked such work,” Reuters said, quoting sources.</p>
<p>The report said the Indian authorities had also asked officials concerned to open the adjustable gates for cleaning, which they did from May 1. The effort was aimed at freeing dam operations from any restrictions, it added.</p>

            <p><p>NEW DELHI: Air France and Germany’s Lufthansa were among global carriers avoiding Pakistani airspace, airlines and flight trackers showed, as tensions between India and Pakistan remained high.</p>
<p>India took measures such as closing its airspace to Pakistan airlines, while Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906648">barred</a> those owned or operated by its neighbour, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908417">suspended trade</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284#:~:text=As%20done%20by%20India%2C%20Pakistan%20also%20suspended%20all%20visas%20under%20the%20Saarc%20Visa%20Exemption%20Scheme%20(SVES)%20issued%20to%20Indian%20nationals%20and%20deemed%20them%20cancelled%20with%20immediate%20effect%2C%20except%20for%20Sikh%20religious%20pilgrims.">halted special visas</a> for Indians, although it let international airlines use its airspace.</p>
<p>Lufthansa Group’s airlines are  “avoiding Pakis­tani airspace until further notice”, it said in a statement to <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Civil Avi­a­tion Authority declined a <em>Reuters</em> request for comment.</p>
<p>However, flight tracking data showed some flights of British Airways, Swiss International Air Lines and Emirates turning north towards Delhi in order to avoid Pakistani airspace, after travelling over the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>British Airways and Emirates did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>“The airline has decided to suspend overflight of Pakistan until further notice,” Air France said in a statement, citing the  “recent evolution of tensions” between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>The carrier said it was altering its flight schedule and flight plans with destinations such as Delhi, Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh, entailing longer flight times.</p>

• Dar sees Pahalgam incident as ‘calculated attempt’ at escalation<br />
• Any violation of sovereignty to be met with ‘decisive force’, vows army chief<br />
• Kremlin following situation with ‘great concern’</strong></p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Monday urged the global community to swiftly intervene to bring down tensions in the South Asian region and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586/pakistans-objectives-largely-served-and-achieved-by-unsc-moot-on-south-asia-tensions-asim-iftikhar">de-escalate the crisis</a> by addressing its underlying reason: the unresolved Kashmir dispute.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s leadership also pledged to fiercely defend national sovereignty against any provocation in the wake of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> that resulted in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">death of 26 people</a> in the held-Kashmir region. The government said that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack%20were%20brought%20out">provocative rhetoric</a> from New Delhi and baseless accusations against Pakistan were part of a pattern aimed at diverting attention from the Kashmir dispute.</p>
<p>In his meetings with foreign dignitaries, including Iran’s foreign minister, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated Pakistan’s offer for an “independent, tra­nsparent, neutral and credible” international inv­e­stigation into the Pahal­gam incident and invited cou­ntries, including the UK, to participate.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also raised concerns over what he termed India’s attempts to politicise international fina­ncial institutions to damage Pakistan’s economy and condemned <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274">recent actions</a> concerning the Indus Waters Treaty, calling them “unacceptable” and a “red line”.</p>
<p><strong>Iran FM visit</strong></p>
<p>During their separate meetings with visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi, PM Shehbaz and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar highlighted their shared commitment to diplomacy.</p>
<p>Iran had offered to mediate between India and Pakistan, with President Pezeshkian already having spoken to leaders in both capitals and Mr Araghchi expected to travel to New Delhi on Thursday.</p>
<p>“The prime minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to work closely with Iran for peace, stability, and development in the region,” the PM Office said in a statement after the meeting. Foreign Minister Araghchi reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to strengthening its relations with Pakistan and playing its part in bringing peace and stability to South Asia, reported state-run APP.</p>
<p>In his meeting with UK High Commissioner Jane Marriott, the prime minister emphasised that Pakistan would not take any step that endangers regional peace. “Our priority remains economic development,” he said, urging London to use its good offices with both countries to promote peace.</p>
<p><strong>‘Pakistan will defend itself’</strong></p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, at a seminar in Islamabad, said that Pakistan remained committed to regional stability but would not hesitate to defend itself if provoked.</p>
<p>“There appears to be a calculated and premeditated attempt to escalate regional tensions, following a familiar pattern—level accusations without evidence, incite hysteria, and use it as a pretext for aggression,” Mr Dar said.</p>
<p>“If aggression is imposed on us, we will exercise our inherent right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.”</p>
<p>He also voiced concern over India’s move to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, calling it a dangerous development with far-reaching implications. The foreign minister urged the global community to intervene before the situation spirals further.</p>
<p>“The international community must take serious note of these developments. At a time when the region requires cooperation and restraint, any tolerance for adventurism would only embolden further instability,” he emphasised.</p>
<p>“Being a responsible member of the international community, Pakistan remains committed to regional peace and stability. We will support all efforts towards de-escalation,” he reassured the international partners about Pakistan’s cooperation for de-escalation.</p>
<p>The Pakistani military reinforced the civilian leadership’s stance, with Gen Asim Munir warning that while the country sought peace, any violation of its sovereignty would be met with decisive force.</p>
<p>“If Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are violated, we will respond with full force to preserve national prestige and the well-being of our people,” Gen Munir said during remarks at the Balochistan National Security Workshop.</p>
<p>Islamabad has consistently framed the Kashmir dispute as central to the region’s volatility and reiterated its call for a resolution based on UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>The Iranian top envoy also called on army chief General Asim Munir at GHQ, Rawalpindi.  “The meeting featured constructive discussions on the geo-strategic environment, with particular focus on challenges confronted by both countries in the domain of security. The Pak-Iran border security mechanism was also reviewed as part of efforts to enhance bilateral coordination,” said a statement issued by the army’s media wing after the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Kremlin’s concern</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Kremlin also called for a de-escalation on Monday, expressing the hope that both sides would work towards reducing tensions.</p>
<p>“We hope that the parties will be able to take measures (…) that will reduce tensions,” Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that “we are following with great concern the tense atmosphere that has developed on the border.”</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a phone call on Monday that the “particularly privileged partnership” between Moscow and Delhi was “not subject to external influence and continues to develop dynamically in all areas”, the Kremlin said in a statement.</p>
<p>Moscow last week said it was ready to mediate after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov held calls with both sides last week.</p>
<p>“India is our strategic partner. Pakistan is also our partner. We value our relations with both Delhi and Islamabad,” Peskov said.</p>
