                <h2>President, PM condemn Balochistan bus killings, vow action against perpetrators ‘at all costs’</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The country’s top leaders on Friday strongly condemned the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923411/armed-men-kidnap-and-kill-nine-passengers-in-balochistan">kidnapping and killing</a> of nine bus passengers in the Sardhaka area of Balochistan last night, vowing action against the perpetrators “at all costs”.</p>
<p>Zhob Assistant Comm­issioner Naveed Alam said a day ago that at least nine passengers travelling on two Punjab-bound coaches were abducted and killed by unidentified armed men in the Sur-Dakai area, situated on the border between Balochistan’s Zhob and Loralai districts.</p>
<p>Provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind also confirmed the incident and said that <em>Fitna-al-Hindu­stan</em>  — a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">term</a> the government uses for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan — had carried out attacks at three different places — Kakat, Mastung, and Sur-Dakai.</p>
<p>The Balochistan Liberation Front, a banned outfit, later claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group said it had killed the nine individuals after blocking the highway between Musakhail-Makhtar and Khajuri.</p>
<p>In a statement today, President Asif Ali Zardari said, “This barbarity is part of <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>’s evil conspiracy to spill blood in Pakistan”, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed commitment to “clear the land of <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> and its facilitators at all costs.”</p>
<p>Similarly, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in a statement issued by his office: “We will deal with terrorists with full force. The blood of innocent people will be avenged.”</p>
<p>The premier added that the killing of unarmed civilians was a blatant act of terrorism by <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>.</p>
<p>“With resolve, unity, and strength, we will confront the scourge of terrorism and uproot it completely,” the prime minister said.</p>
<p>Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also strongly condemned the incident, calling it “blatant terrorism”.</p>
<p>“The killing of innocent civilians based on Pakistani identity is an unforgivable crime,” Bugti said, vowing that the response would be “severe”.</p>
<p>“The terrorists have proven that they are not human beings, but cowardly beasts,” he said, adding that the state “would not even let these murderers hide underground.”</p>
<p>The chief minister added: “All networks of terrorists who are the sponsors of <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> will be destroyed.”</p>
<p>Noting that this was a “state war”, he vowed decisive action.</p>
<p>CM Bugti further vowed to crush “every plan of terrorism” with strength, determination and unity. “Balochistan will become a graveyard for enemies.”</p>
<p>According to sources, two passenger coaches en route to Punjab were intercepted in the Sur-Dakai area near the N-70 highway, close to Dab — a place along the Loralai-Zhob border. A group of armed men had blocked the road and stopped the two vehicles.</p>
<p>The armed assailants boarded the coaches, checked the identity cards of passengers and forced 10 persons off the vehicles at gunpoint.</p>
<p>“They dragged out 10 passengers — seven from one coach and three from the other — and took them away (to an unknown place),” a surviving passenger told Levies. “I don’t know what they did to them, but I heard gunfire as we were leaving.”</p>
<p>After abducting the nine passengers, the assailants allowed both coaches to leave the area.</p>
<p>Security forces suspended traffic on the highway and began a large-scale search operation to locate the perpetrators.</p>
<p>According to sources, the attackers checked the national identity cards of all passengers and specifically targeted individuals with Punjab addresses. They also opened fire on the coaches during the abduction to prevent any escape.</p>
<p>In May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna-al-Hindu­stan</em>.</p>
<p>Balochistan has witnessed a spate of attacks targeting those hailing from Punjab. In two separate incidents in April 2024, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1827193">nine people</a> were killed after being forced off a bus near Noshki, while <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1830243">two labourers</a> from Punjab were shot in Kech.</p>
<p>In February, seven Punjab-bound passengers were offloaded from a bus and shot dead in Barkhan district. The incident came days after 12 were killed in a blast targeting a bus carrying coal miners in Harnai.</p>
<p>In May last year, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832433">seven barbers</a> from Punjab were shot dead near Gwadar, while August saw <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854830">23 travellers</a> offloaded from trucks and buses and shot in the Musakhail district.</p>

                <h2>Trump threatens Canada with 35pc tariff rate starting Aug 1</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Canada will face a 35 per cent tariff on exports to the United States starting August 1, President Donald Trump said on Thursday in a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney.</p>
<p>It was the latest of more than 20 such letters issued by Trump since Monday, as he continues to pursue his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922611">trade war</a> threats against dozens of economies.</p>
<p>Canada and the US have been locked in trade negotiations in hopes of reaching a deal by July 21, but the latest threat appeared to have shifted that deadline.</p>
<p>Both Canada and Mexico are trying to find ways to satisfy Trump so that the free trade deal uniting the three countries — known as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1448743">USMCA</a> — can be put back on track.</p>
<p>“Throughout the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses.</p>
<p>We will continue to do so as we work towards the revised deadline of August 1,“ Carney posted on the social media platform X Thursday night.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement replaced the previous NAFTA accord in July 2020, after Trump successfully pushed for a renegotiation during his first term in office.</p>
<p>It was due to be reviewed by July next year, but Trump has thrown the process into disarray by launching his trade wars after he took office in January.</p>
<p>Canadian and Mexican products were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896198">initially</a> hard hit by 25pc US tariffs, with a lower rate for Canadian energy.</p>
<p>Trump targeted both neighbours, saying they did not do enough on illegal immigration and the flow of illicit drugs across borders.</p>
<p>But he eventually announced exemptions for goods entering his country under the USMCA, covering large swaths of products.</p>
<p>The letter on Thursday came despite what had been warming relations between Trump and Carney, who has been faced with his counterpart’s regular musings that Canada should become the 51st US state.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#reciprocity" id="reciprocity" title="Permalink"></a>Reciprocity</h2>
<p>The Canadian leader came to the White House on May 6 and had a cordial <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908949">meeting</a> with Trump in the Oval Office.</p>
<p>They met again at the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920819/g7-agrees-to-avoid-higher-taxes-for-us-companies">G7 summit</a> last month in Canada, where leaders pushed Trump to back away from his punishing trade war.</p>
<p>Canada also agreed to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920614/trump-ends-trade-talks-with-canada-over-tax-on-us-tech-firms">rescind</a> taxes impacting US tech firms that had prompted Trump to retaliate by calling off trade talks.</p>
<p>Separately, Trump announced in an interview with <em>NBC</em> that he was also thinking of slapping blanket tariffs of between 15pc and 20pc on August 1 on countries that had not yet received one of his letters.</p>
<p>The letters announce tariff rates of as much as 50pc in the case of Brazil to kick in on August 1 unless better terms can be found before then.</p>
<p>Trump told <em>NBC</em> that the letter to the 27-country European Union, the US’s biggest trading partner, would be sent “today or tomorrow (Friday).”</p>
<p>Brazilian President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva said on Thursday that he is willing to negotiate with the United States after Trump said he would hit the country with his tough tariff.</p>
<p>He, however, reiterated that the Brazilian government is evaluating reciprocity measures. In his letter addressed to Lula, Trump criticised the treatment of his right-wing ally Jair Bolsonaro.</p></p>
