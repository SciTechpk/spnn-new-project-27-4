                <h2>2 killed, cops among 10 injured in Wana bomb blast: police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Two people were killed while 10 others were injured in a bomb blast in the Wana tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Lower South Waziristan district on Thursday, police said.</p>
<p>Lower South Waziristan‚Äôs District Police Officer Tahir Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em>: ‚ÄúTwo people died, while two policemen were among 10 individuals injured in a blast in the Wana bazaar.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that the wounded were immediately taken to the Wana District Headquarters Hospital. Security forces have cordoned off the area and initiated a search operation to trace the perpetrators, DPO Khan added.</p>
<p>Investigation was also underway to determine the nature of the bomb used, the officer noted.</p>
<p>The incident follows residents‚Äô complaints of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929167/action-sought-against-armed-men-roaming-wana-bazaar">open display of firearms</a> and the free movement of armed men in Wana‚Äôs Rustam Bazaar, an important commercial hub of Lower South Waziristan.</p>
<p>Sources said no one was allowed to roam Rustam Bazaar openly carrying weapons, and that strict measures would be implemented soon to curb the practice.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a police constable was among <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929116/2-injured-as-upper-south-waziristan-dcs-vehicle-comes-under-attack">two people injured</a> when Upper South Waziristan Deputy Commissioner Asmatullah Wazir‚Äôs vehicle came under attack in the district‚Äôs Ladha tehsil.</p>

                <h2>4 rescued after emerald mine collapse in Swat: rescue officials</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Four workers trapped 900 feet underground in a Swat emerald mine were rescued during an operation, Rescue 1122 said on Thursday.</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, a major rescue operation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929128/rescue-operation-underway-after-emerald-mine-collapses-in-kps-malook-abad">was launched</a> after a section of the emerald mine collapsed, trapping multiple workers underground. According to initial reports by Rescue 1122 Swat, the mine caved in suddenly during extraction activity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRescue 1122 medical teams are providing immediate medical assistance to the rescued workers,‚Äù Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi told <em>Dawn.com</em>. ‚ÄúThe operation continued for several hours after the mine collapsed, in which more than 40 personnel participated.‚Äù</p>
<p>The rescue operation was led by District Emergency Officer Swat Rafiullah Marwat, as per Faizi.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe trained personnel and modern equipment of Rescue 1122 made the operation successful,‚Äù Faizi said.</p>
<p>Mining in Swat‚Äôs lush mountains, particularly for emeralds, has long been criticised for poor regulation and inadequate oversight, often putting the lives of workers at <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875437">serious risk</a>.</p>
<p>The current incident has once again brought attention to the pressing need for standardised safety frameworks and proper training for mine workers in the region.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, the mining industry in Swat has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921194/washed-away-how-unregulated-mining-turned-the-swat-river-into-a-killer">seen a boom</a>, with around 350 crush plants established along the path of the 240km-long river, from Kalam to downstream Kanju.</p>
<p>In November, two workers <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875437">were killed</a> after elevator in an emerald mine collapsed. The tragic incident occurred when an elevator rope snapped, causing two workers to fall to their death.</p></p>
