<p>Bannu CTD personnel Assistant Sub-Inspector Benyamin Khan, Constable Inam Khan and Constable Musawar were martyred. Two constables, Wafid Khan and Imran, were wounded.</p>
<p>He said two <em>khawarij</em> ‚Äî a term the state uses to refer to terrorists ‚Äî were killed and another two injured in police firing, and their accomplices took bodies and injured with them.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWeapons, ammunition, IEDs (improvised explosive device) and hand grenades were recovered from the terrorists, which were seized by the police,‚Äù the spokesman said.</p>
