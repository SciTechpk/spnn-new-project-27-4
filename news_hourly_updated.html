                <h2>3 tourists killed, 15 missing as floods inundate GB‚Äôs Babusar and Naran areas</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least three tourists were killed, four others were injured and 15 went missing after floods triggered by heavy rain swept through Gilgit-Baltistan‚Äôs (GB) Babusar area in Diamer district on Monday.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities.</p>
<p>According to Faizullah Firaq, spokesperson for the GB government, three bodies were recovered from flood debris today, while four injured people were transported to a hospital in Chilas.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFifteen other tourists have gone missing, as eight tourist vehicles were washed away in the raging flood,‚Äù Firaq said in a statement. ‚ÄúMedical assistance for the injured is ongoing, with one individual in critical condition.‚Äù</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that communication systems were disrupted due to a fibre optic break, while thousands of tourists were stranded and communication with their homes had been cut off.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe government has successfully rescued hundreds of stranded tourists on Babusar Highway, and many have sought shelter with local residents,‚Äù Firaq said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe GB chief minister has ordered that all available resources be used to rescue those stranded. The Babusar Highway is closed at multiple points, with roads and farmland severely damaged.‚Äù</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amir Khadam Khan, spokesperson for Rescue 1122 Mansehra, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that Jalkhad road in Naran was blocked by large stones and debris due to heavy rain in the area.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAccording to initial reports, a car is stuck in the debris,‚Äù Khan said. ‚ÄúFortunately, no loss of life or property has been reported so far.‚Äù</p>
<p>The National Highways Authority (NHA) deployed heavy machinery from nearby places to start the process of clearing the road and restoring traffic.</p>
<p>A Rescue 1122 ambulance also reached the scene to provide assistance in case of any possible emergency.</p>
<p>On June 29, the GB Disaster Management Authority issued a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925556">warning</a> of increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glof) and flash floods. The public and tourists were advised to avoid going near rivers, streams and other waterways, and avoid bathing or washing clothes in streams since the water flow can reach dangerous levels.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said that there will be more monsoon rains in the province until July 25, according to a statement.</p>
<p>According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the Malakand and Hazara divisions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the southern parts of Punjab and Sindh, eastern Balochistan and parts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) were expected to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925556">receive</a> rain and thunderstorms with strong winds.</p>
<p>Rain and thunderstorms were forecast for urban centres of Punjab in the south, such as Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur and Dera Ghazi Khan, though overall weather of the province was expected to remain partly cloudy and humid.</p>
<p>According to the PDMA, Punjab will receive a fourth wave of monsoon rains until July 25, which the authority says is ‚Äúslightly more powerful‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRain has been forecast in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiat, Attock, Chakwal, Mandi Bahauddin, Hafizabad, Gujarat, Jhelum and Gujranwala,‚Äù the statement read. ‚ÄúRain is also expected in Lahore, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Narowal, Toba Tek Singh, Jhang, Sargodha and Mianwali,‚Äù its statement read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRain is also predicted in Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar and Multan.‚Äù</p>
<p>Punjab PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia announced that due to the heavy rain, there is a high possibility of increased water flow in rivers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA flood alert has been issued for rivers and canals in Punjab,‚Äù the statement quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>The PDMA warned that there is a possibility of increased flow in the Ravi, Jhelum, Sutlej and Chenab rivers, while stating that water flow in the Indus River was measured at 420,000 cusecs at the Taunsa barrage.</p>
<p>The Flood Forecasting Division showed that by 6pm, water flow at the Taunsa barrage stood at 383,456 cusecs.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIn the Indus River, there is a low-level flood at Tarbela, Kala Bagh and Chashma,‚Äù the PDMA said.</p>
<p>The PDMA DG said that on the instructions of the Punjab chief minister, an alert has been issued to all administrations across the province.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDeputy commissioners have been instructed to remain in the field, while Section 144 should be imposed along the banks of rivers and canals,‚Äù Kathia said, instructing police to increase patrols along waterways.</p>
<p>The DG added: ‚ÄúAll relevant departments, including Wasa, Rescue 1122 and district administrations, should be on alert. The drainage of standing water from low-lying areas must be ensured, as must the deployment of machinery and staff at choke points.‚Äù</p>
<p>Kathia further ordered that disposal stations be kept functional, while urging people in private housing to ensure adequate drainage. He warned that those unable to ensure drainage would face action.</p>
<p>He also urged the public to take precautionary measures amid heavy rain, such as keeping away from electric pylons and appliances during a storm and avoiding houses made from mud or in dilapidated condition.</p>
<p>So far, 123 people have been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925094">killed</a> and 462 injured since June 25 as the province received record rainfall, triggering urban flooding which inundated residential areas, the PDMA said last week. Of these, 71 deaths were reported in the past two days alone.</p></p>

                <h2>Senate elections: arrangement comes through as PTI wins 6 and opposition bags 5 seats in KP</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The seat-adjustment arrangement between the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and opposition arrangement came through in the Senate elections in the province on Monday ‚Äî with the treasury winning six and the opposition bagging five seats, according to unofficial results.</p>
<p>The treasury and the joint opposition alliance had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925325">agreed</a> on a seat-sharing formula under which six seats would go to the treasury, which has 92 members in the KP Assembly, and five seats to the opposition, which is 53-strong.</p>
<p>On Sunday, it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925557">emerged</a> that what initially shaped up to be a three-way contest ‚Äî among PTI, PTI ‚Äúdissidents‚Äù and opposition lawmakers ‚Äî turned out to be almost a two-way match after the size of PTI‚Äôs ‚Äúdisgruntled‚Äù faction was effectively reduced to just one candidate.</p>
<p>PTI‚Äôs Murad Saeed, Faisal Javed, Mirza Afridi and Noorul Haq Qadri were elected as senators on general seats, according to the unofficial results.</p>
<p>Murad Saeed received 26 votes, Mirza Afridi and Faisal Javed both bagged 22, and Noor-ul-Haq Qadri 21.</p>
<p>PTI‚Äôs Azam Swati was elected on a technocrat seat with 89 votes. Similarly, PTI‚Äôs Rubina Naz became a senator on a women‚Äôs seat with 89 votes.</p>
<p>Federal Minister for Gilgit Baltistan and Kashmir Affairs and States and Frontier Regions Amir Muqam‚Äôs son Niaz Ahmed reached the upper house by with 18 votes on a general seat.</p>
<p>PPP‚Äôs Talha Mehmood bagged a Senate seat with 18 votes. PPP‚Äôs Rubina Khalid was elected as a senator on women‚Äôs seat with 52 votes.</p>
<p>JUI-F‚Äôs Attaul Haq won on a general seat and the party‚Äôs Dilawar Khan on a technocrat seat to become members of the upper house with 18 and 54 votes, respectively.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Twenty-five MPAs-elect of the KP opposition were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925431">sworn</a> into office after KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi administered their oaths.</p>
<p>The oath-taking issue has risen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1831068">once again</a> after the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925091/ptis-senate-poll-campaign-beset-by-political-wrangling">redistribution</a> of reserved seats in the wake of a verdict by the Supreme Court‚Äôs constitutional bench that effectively took away the seats from the PTI and declared other political parties eligible for them.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) finally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922230">announced</a> the schedule for the long-overdue Senate elections in KP, setting July 21 as the polling date.</p>
<p>The much-delayed but suspenseful exercise saw elections on 11 seats ‚Äî seven general and two each reserved for women, ulema and technocrats.</p>
<p>Currently, the ruling coalition has 54 members in the 96-member Senate ‚Äî 10 short of the two-thirds majority (64 seats).</p>
<p>A separate election for the seat vacated by Senator Sania Nishtar is scheduled for July 31.</p>
<p>According to an ECP statement, the Senate elections in KP were delayed due to an incomplete electoral college. The schedule was announced two days after 25 reserved seats ‚Äî originally allocated to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) ‚Äî were redistributed among parties, including PML-N, PPP, JUI-F, PTI-P and ANP.</p>
<p>The elections were earlier postponed in April 2024, exacerbating political uncertainty in the province. Polling for another Senate seat ‚Äî vacated after the death of Professor Sajid Mir ‚Äî will also take place on July 21.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925569">by-election</a> on a vacant Senate seat in Punjab was won by PML-N‚Äôs Hafiz Abdul Kareem with 243 votes, according to official results from the ECP.</p>
<p>The PML-N had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913415">nominated</a> the emir of the Markazi Jamiat Ahle Hadith, as its candidate for the seat, which fell vacant after the demise of Professor Mir.</p>
<p>The total available votes were 368, with 345 polled votes, of which valid votes were 342, while three were rejected.</p>
<p>In a speech after his victory, Kareem thanked God and mentioned that he was grateful to PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif</p>
<p>‚ÄúI thank Mian Nawaz Sharif, who always remained loyal to Jamiat Ahle Hadith,‚Äù Kareem said.</p>
<p>He added that he was also deeply grateful to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, whom he credited for his victory.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe left work in the flood-affected areas and cast her vote for me,‚Äù Kareem said.</p></p>
