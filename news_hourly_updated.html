                <h2>Finance Bill sails through parliament to greenlight Rs17.57tr budget</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Finance Bill, 2025, was approved by parliament on Thursday, meaning that the Rs17.57 trillion budget for the coming fiscal year has been greenlit.</p>
<p>The PPP on Wednesday voiced strong reservations over a set of politically unpopular provisions in the federal budget for the next fiscal year, urging the government to amend ‚Äúcontentious‚Äù clauses ahead of its expected approval in the National Assembly today (Thursday).</p>
<p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb‚Äôs amendments to various legislation, including the Income Tax Ordnance, 2001, were all approved, while opposition amendments were rejected, according to a <em>Dawn.com</em> correspondent.</p>
<p>The bill was read out in the assembly and approved clause by clause. The session has been adjourned until 11am tomorrow.</p>

<p>Addressing the House, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said his party would ‚Äúhappily support the budget,‚Äù since the government had accepted the party‚Äôs proposals.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe appreciate the government‚Äôs efforts as BISP‚Äôs (Benazir Income Support Programme) budget has been increased,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMoreover, the salaried class will not be taxed if their income equals to Rs1.2m per year and the solar tax has been reduced by 50 per cent.‚Äù</p>
<p>Bilawal added that after the PPP‚Äôs initial rejection, their recommendations regarding the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) were accepted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are grateful to the government and the prime minister for accepting our proposals,‚Äù Bilawal said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, amendments to the Sales Tax Act, 1990, presented by Aurangzeb were approved by a majority vote in the House.</p>
<p>The amendment granted the finance committee powers to arrest traders involved in tax fraud exceeding Rs50 million. The federal government had earlier proposed an amendment to give the powers of arrest to the tax commissioner.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe FBR will not have the power of arrest during the investigation stage,‚Äù the amendment added.</p>
<p>All amendments introduced by the opposition in the Sales Tax Act were rejected by majority vote.</p>
<p>Similarly, an amendment to the Salaries and Allowances Act was presented with the support of the finance minister, according to which ministers and ministers of state will receive the same salary as members of parliament.</p>
<p>The amendment was approved by a majority vote.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#107-institutions-granted-tax-exempt-status" id="107-institutions-granted-tax-exempt-status" title="Permalink"></a>107 institutions granted tax-exempt status</h2>
<p>During the session, 107 entities‚Äî including lawyers‚Äô bodies, hospitals and government projects ‚Äî were granted tax-exempt status as part of amendments to the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001.</p>
<p>The finance minister‚Äôs amendments were all approved, while those presented by the opposition were rejected.</p>
<p>According to the amendments, the following institutions and organisations are exempt from tax:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provincial bar councils</li>
<li>Pakistan Bar Council</li>
<li>The Military Foundation</li>
<li>Army Welfare Trust</li>
<li>Foundation University</li>
<li>Forman Christian College</li>

<li>The Poverty Alleviation Fund</li>
<li>National Rural Support Programme</li>
<li>National Endowment Scholarship</li>
<li>Pakistan Agricultural Research Council</li>
<li>Audit Oversight Board</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the amended ordinance, the pensions of former presidents and their widows will also be tax-exempt.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Aurangzeb unveiled Pakistan‚Äôs annual <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292">federal budget</a> in a charged National Assembly session, outlining ambitious proposals to drive 4.2 per cent economic growth in the coming fiscal year while cutting back on overall spending and tightening tax measures.</p>
<p>The federal budget for fiscal year 2026 has a total outlay ‚Äî the sum of expenditures and net lending of funds ‚Äî of Rs17.573 trillion, representing a 6.9 per cent decrease from the previous year‚Äôs budget.</p>
<p>The government has proposed Rs16,286bn for current expenditure in the FY26 budget, a 5.33pc decrease from the previous year.</p>

            <p><p>The United States consulates in Karachi and Lahore on Thursday requested that all applicants for F, M or J nonimmigrant visas make their social media accounts public for vetting, after similar instructions were issued by the US Embassy in Delhi earlier this week.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration on Wednesday ordered the resumption of student visa appointments but significantly tightened its social media vetting in a bid to identify any applicants who may be hostile towards the country, according to an internal State Department cable reviewed by <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>US consular officers are now required to conduct a ‚Äúcomprehensive and thorough vetting‚Äù of all student and exchange visitor applicants to identify those who ‚Äúbear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles‚Äù, said the cable, which was dated June 18 and sent to US missions on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In Instagram posts uploaded today, the consulates said: ‚ÄúEffective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to ‚Äòpublic‚Äô to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States.‚Äù</p>

<p>They added that since 2019, the US has required visa applicants to provide social media identifiers on immigrant and nonimmigrant visa application forms. The post stated that applicants had to fill out social media identifiers and account handles for each platform on the application form.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOmitting social media information on your application could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future US visas,‚Äù the consulate warned.</p>
<p>F and M are different <a class="link--external" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/student-visa.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">student visa</a> types, while the <a class="link--external" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/exchange.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">J visa</a> is a nonimmigrant visa for individuals approved to participate in exchange visitor programmes in the US.</p>
<p>On May 27, the Trump administration ordered its missions abroad to stop <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913788">scheduling</a> new appointments for student and exchange visitor visa applicants, saying the State Department was set to expand social media vetting of foreign students.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said updated guidance would be released once a review was completed.</p></p>
