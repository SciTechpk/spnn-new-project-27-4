            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that he was “honoured” to meet Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir for talks at the White House — also marking the first time a US president has hosted Pakistan’s army chief at the White House unaccompanied by senior civilian officials.</p>
<p>The meeting, listed on the president’s official schedule, was held in the Cabinet Room and closed to the press.</p>
<p>The lunch is being seen in Islamabad as a major diplomatic win, particularly because earlier this month, an Indian delegation met US Vice President JD Vance and Indian media depicted it as a diplomatic success, contrasting it with the apparent inability of the Pakistani delegation to secure a similar meeting. Gen Munir’s invitation to the White House is now being projected by officials in Islamabad as a diplomatic counterpoint to those narratives.</p>
<p>When questioned about the meeting in an interaction with the media later, Trump said, “I was honoured to meet him (Field Marshal Munir) today.”</p>
<p>Asked whether the talks included the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917867/i-may-do-it-i-may-not-do-it-trump-says-on-us-striking-iran-as-khamenei-rules-out-surrender">current Iran-Israel conflict</a>, Trump said: “They (Pakistan) know Iran very well, better than most, and they’re not happy about anything. It’s not that they’re bad with Israel. They know them both, actually, but they know Iran better.</p>
<p>“He (Field Marshal Munir) agreed with me. The reason I had him here was that I wanted to thank him for not going into the war [with India]. And I want to thank PM [Narendra] Modi as well, who just left a few days ago. We’re working on a trade deal with India and Pakistan. These two very smart people decided not to keep going with a war that could have been a nuclear war. Pakistan and India are two big nuclear powers.”</p>

<p>Trump’s lunch with Field Marshal Munir represented a major boost in US-Pakistan ties, which had largely languished under Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, as both assiduously courted India as part of efforts to push back against China.</p>
<p>Earlier, when questioned by reporters on the White House lawn about the diplomatic outcomes expected from the meeting with Field Marshal Munir, Trump remarked, “This man was extremely influential in stopping it (India-Pakistan fighting) from the Pakistan side.”</p>

<p>Trump also once again claimed credit for the Pakistan-India ceasefire despite Modi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917877/modi-maintains-there-was-no-us-mediation-in-ceasefire-with-pakistan">maintaining</a> in a conversation with him late on Tuesday that the breakthrough was achieved through talks between the two militaries and not US mediation.</p>
<p>Former foreign minister and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had earlier praised the development as a “positive step for bilateral relations.”</p>
<p>“Today, Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir will meet with Donald Trump over lunch, a positive step in Pakistan-US relations. Especially given the president’s role in mediating a ceasefire.</p>
<p>“Following Pakistan’s decisive victory in the recent five-day war, India has regrettably resisted all efforts toward a permanent peace,  including US-led diplomacy.”</p>
<p>He said Pakistan neither sought conflict nor was it “desperate for dialogue”. However, Bilawal said Pakistan recognised that peace was in the interest of both nations.</p>
<p>“There is no military solution to our disputes. India’s weaponisation of water, repression in Kashmir, and politicisation of terrorism are unsustainable positions. The path forward lies in honest diplomacy — not denial.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst, emphasised that the meeting should not be seen only in the context of the Iran-Israel conflict.</p>
<p>“There’s been US-Pak engagement on critical minerals, crypto, counterterrorism. Trump takes a deep personal interest in all of these. And Munir is empowered to talk about it all. Also, Kashmir.”</p>

<p>This development also marks a notable success for Pakistan in the ongoing diplomatic contest that followed last month’s air combat with India — a confrontation that brought South Asia dangerously close to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">nuclear conflict.</a> Munir is in the US on a five-day official visit.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>Field Marshal Munir, who was elevated to Pakistan’s rare <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912277">five-star rank</a> last month — the first such promotion since Ayub Khan in 1959 — has made headlines during his trip, urging India to engage with Pakistan “as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917734/army-chief-asks-india-to-engage-with-pakistan-like-a-civilised-nation">civilized nation</a>,” rather than attempting to impose regional hegemony.</p>
<p>Speaking to members of the Pakistani American community on Monday evening, he strongly rejected Indian claims that Pakistan was behind the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, calling it a “pretext for cross-border aggression.”</p>
<p>He accused India of seeking to establish a dangerous “new normal” of violating international borders, which Pakistan had forcefully rejected. “We would rather embrace martyrdom than accept this dishonour,” he said.</p>
<p>The interaction at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington’s Georgetown neighbourhood drew a large and enthusiastic crowd, with supporters showering the army chief with rose petals and chanting slogans in his praise. Protesters aligned with the opposition PTI party demonstrated outside, calling for democratic reforms and the release of jailed leaders, but their voices were largely drowned out inside the venue.</p>
<p>In his remarks, Munir also addressed the broader regional landscape, declaring Pakistan’s “clear and strong” support for Iran in its war with Israel while also backing US efforts to de-escalate the situation. “We want this war to end immediately,” he said.</p>
<p>One of the most consequential developments during Munir’s visit, however, has been Pakistan’s strengthened counterterrorism partnership with the US — particularly against the militant Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) group. Last week, Gen Michael Kurilla, head of US Central Command, had described Pakistan as a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524">phenomenal partner</a>” in the fight against IS-K, praising Islamabad’s operations along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.</p>
<p>Gen Kurilla revealed to the House Armed Services Committee that Pakistani operations, supported by US intelligence, had killed dozens of IS-K militants and captured multiple high-value individuals, including Mohammad Sharifullah, one of the masterminds of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1642871">Abbey Gate bombing</a> in Kabul that killed 13 American troops.</p>
<p>“The first person Munir called was me,” Gen Kurilla said. “He said, ‘I’ve caught him — ready to extradite him back to the US. Please tell the secretary of defence and the president’.” Sharifullah was promptly extradited.</p>
<p>In a separate statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Kurilla noted that Pakistan had conducted “dozens of operations” to dismantle IS-K’s presence in the border regions and continues to play a pivotal role in countering terrorism in Central and South Asia.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The Centcom chief’s comments reflect a growing acknowledgement in Washington that Pakistan remains essential to regional stability. As Kurilla noted, while the Taliban have pushed IS-K militants into the tribal areas, these sanctuaries still allow the group to plan and plot attacks not just against regional allies, but also the US homeland.</p>
<p>Despite the security challenges Pakistan faces — including over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075">1,000 terrorist attacks</a> last year alone, which claimed the lives of some 700 security personnel and 2,500 civilians — Gen Kurilla said Pakistan “has been a phenomenal partner in the counterterrorism world”.</p>
<p>During his interaction with the diaspora community, Gen Munir emphasised Pakistan’s gratitude for the role overseas Pakistanis play in bolstering the national economy. He dismissed concerns over brain drain, describing it instead as a “brain gain.”</p>
<p>He avoided discussing domestic politics directly, and when one attendee attempted to criticise former prime minister Imran Khan, Munir discouraged it. When another guest jokingly suggested that political opponents might need their “software fixed,” the general responded that democratic societies must protect the right to dissent.</p>
<p>The evening concluded with pledges of renewed commitment from both the army chief and the diaspora to work toward a stronger, more resilient Pakistan.</p></p>

            <p><p>President Donald Trump left the question of whether the United States will join Israeli strikes on Iran up in the air on Wednesday, as he said that Tehran had reached out to seek negotiations.</p>
<p>“I may do it, I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I’m going to do,” Trump told reporters as he supervised the installation of a new flagpole on the White House South Lawn.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a televised message that the country “will stand firm against an imposed war, just as it will stand firm against an imposed peace” as the archfoes entered their sixth day of war.</p>
<p>Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">launched</a> wide-scale air strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences on Friday, killing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">top commanders</a>, scientists, and civilians. It claimed the strikes are part of a broader operation codenamed ‘Rising Lion’ to deter Tehran’s nuclear ambitions, which the latter has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a>, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p>

<p>Addressing reporters about whether the US would enter the fray after his earlier comments, Trump said: “I can tell you this, Iran’s got a lot of trouble and they want to negotiate.”</p>
<p>Trump said Iran had even suggested sending officials to the White House to negotiate on Tehran’s nuclear program to end Israel’s air assault, but added that it was “very late”. “I said it’s very late to be talking. We may meet. There’s a big difference between now and a week ago, right? Big difference,” Trump added.</p>
<p>“They’ve suggested that they come to the White House. That’s, you know, courageous, but it’s, like, not easy for them to do.”</p>
<p>He reiterated his demand for an “unconditional surrender” from Iran, saying: “I’ve had it. I give up. No more. Then we go blow up all the nuclear stuff that is all over the place there [in Iran].”</p>
<p>Trump said the next week would be “very big” without elaborating. When asked if it was too late for negotiations, he said: “Nothing is too late.”</p>
<p>Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said, even as he declined to confirm preparations of strike options on Iran, that the US military was “prepared to execute” any decision Trump might make on matters of war and peace.</p>
<p>“If and when those decisions are made, the Department [of Defence] is prepared to execute them,” Hegseth told the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p>
<p>Iran later denied it had offered to send officials to Washington.</p>
<p>“No Iranian official has ever asked to grovel at the gates of the White House,” Iran’s mission to the UN said in a post on X.</p>
<p>“The only thing more despicable than his lies is his cowardly threat to ‘take out’ Iran’s supreme leader.”</p>

<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also spoke to <em>Al Jazeera</em> about reports of a negotiating team dispatched to Oman and said: “This report is not true and Iran has not sent any negotiating team to Muscat.”</p>
<p>Israeli newspaper <em>Haaretz</em> had reported that three Iranian government planes, including the presidential plane, had landed in Oman for “reasons unknown”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Khamenei said: “This nation will not surrender to anyone in the face of imposition,” according to <em>Tasnim</em> news agency.</p>
<p>The Iranian leader also pointed out to statements made by Trump, saying that those who know Iran and its history “know that Iranians do not answer well to the language of threat”.</p>
<p>“And the Americans should know that any US military intervention will undoubtedly be accompanied by irreparable consequences.”</p>
<p>Earlier, Iran claimed firing hypersonic missiles at Israel as Khamenei vowed his country would show “no mercy” to its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916920/a-timeline-of-the-long-standing-conflict-between-israel-and-iran">longtime</a> archfoe, hours after Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917651/in-dramatic-escalation-trump-says-wont-kill-khamenei-for-now-demands-irans-unconditional-surrender">demanded</a> Tehran’s “unconditional surrender”.</p>
<p>“We must give a strong response to the terrorist Zionist regime. We will show the Zionists no mercy,” Khamenei posted on X, hours after Trump’s escalatory remarks.</p>

<p>Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, Ali Bahreini, said his country had conveyed to Washington that it will respond firmly to the United States if it becomes directly involved in Israel’s military campaign.</p>
<p>Bahreini told reporters that he saw the US as “complicit in what Israel is doing”. Iran would set a red line, and respond if the US crosses it, he said, without specifying what actions would provoke a response.</p>
<p>“We will not show any reluctance in defending our people, security and land — we will respond seriously and strongly, without restraint,” Bahreini told reporters.</p>
<p>The Iranian envoy called Trump’s remarks “completely unwarranted and very hostile”. “We cannot ignore them. We are vigilant about what Trump is saying. We will put it in our calculations and assessments.”</p>
<p>“I am confident that [Iran’s military] will react strongly, proportionally and appropriately. We are closely following the level of involvement in the US […] We will react whenever it is needed,” he asserted.</p>
<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also said  Iran had the “legitimate” right to defend itself in the face of Israel’s ongoing bombing campaign.</p>
<p>“It is a very natural, legitimate and legal right for Iran to defend itself against Israel’s thuggery and state terrorism,” the Turkish leader said, a day after he referred to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as “the biggest threat to the security of the region”.</p>
<p>The US has so far only taken indirect actions in the current conflict with Iran, including helping to shoot down missiles fired toward Israel. It is deploying more fighter aircraft to the Middle East and extending the deployment of other warplanes, three US officials told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>Trump met with his National Security Council earlier today to discuss the conflict, ending after an hour and 20 minutes with no immediate public statement.</p>
<p>While he has repeatedly vowed to avoid wading into the “forever wars” of the Middle East, Trump ordered the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier to the region along with a number of US military aircraft.</p>
<p>US officials stressed he has not yet made a decision about any intervention, according to <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Thomas Massie from Trump’s Republican Party said that he introduced an Iran War Powers Resolution with fellow lawmaker Ro Khanna to prohibit US involvement in the Israel-Iran war.</p>
<p>“This is not our war. Even if it were, Congress must decide such matters according to our constitution,” he said.

<p>The most likely option under consideration by Trump would be the use of giant US “bunker-buster” bombs against Iran’s deeply buried Fordow nuclear facility that Israel’s bombs cannot reach.</p>
<p>“Bunker buster” is a broad term used to describe bombs that can penetrate about 61 metres below the surface before exploding, according to the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://apnews.com/article/bunker-buster-bomb-israel-iran-fordo-fordow-b2-nuclear-8a612cbf16aa0f99bd9992334ffc93d7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press</a></em>. Therefore, the precision-guided bombs are used to attack “deeply buried and hardened bunkers and tunnels”.</p>

<p>So far, 24 people have been killed in Israel, more than 800 have been wounded and over 3,800 have been evacuated from their homes, <em>CNN</em> quoted a statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office as saying.</p>
<p>Iran has launched more than 400 missiles and hundreds of drones towards Israel since Friday, the office said. It added that the strikes have hit 40 sites across Israel, resulting in nearly 19,000 damage claims submitted to the tax authority.</p>
<p>Israeli military strikes have hit two facilities in Iran that made parts for centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium, the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today, identifying them as the Tesa Karaj workshop and the Tehran Research Centre.</p>
<p>“At the Tehran site, one building was hit where advanced centrifuge rotors were manufactured and tested.

<p>Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said that hypersonic missiles were used during the latest attack on Israel.</p>
<p>“The 11th wave of the proud Operation Honest Promise 3 using Fattah-1 missiles” was carried out, the IRGC said in a statement carried by state television, claiming that Iranian forces “have gained complete control over the skies of the occupied territories”.</p>
<p>Hypersonic missiles travel at more than five times the speed of sound and can manoeuvre mid-flight, making them harder to track and intercept.</p>

<p>Iran also sent a “swarm of drones” towards Israel, where the army said it intercepted two over the Dead Sea area. The Israeli military said two barrages of Iranian missiles were launched toward Israel in the first two hours of Wednesday morning. Explosions were heard over Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>Israel told residents in the area of Tehran to evacuate so its air force could strike Iranian military installations.</p>
<p>Iranian news websites said Israel was also attacking a university linked to the IRGC in the country’s east, and the Khojir ballistic missile facility near Tehran, which was also targeted by Israeli airstrikes last October.</p>
<p>An Israeli military official claimed 50 fighter jets struck around 20 targets in Tehran overnight, including sites producing raw materials, components and manufacturing systems for missiles.</p>
<p>Iran’s semi-official <em>Mehr</em> news agency reported clashes earlier today between security forces and unidentified gunmen in the city of Rey, south of Tehran, adding the assailants may be linked to Israel and intended to carry out “terrorist operations in densely populated areas of the capital”.</p>
<p>The IRGC last night claimed hitting a “major centre” of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency in Tel Aviv, <em>Tasnim</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/06/17/3337185/mossad-center-hit-in-iran-s-strike-irgc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Iran’s police forces intercepted 14 drones and identified hostile drone-producing workshops and drone-carrying vehicles across various provinces, police spokesperson Saeed Montazerolmahdi said today, according to the <em>Iranian Labour News Agency</em>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Israel is running low on defensive “Arrow” missile interceptors, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home">reported</a>, citing an unnamed US official, raising concerns about the country’s ability to counter long-range ballistic missiles from Iran.</p>

<p>A cyberattack yesterday crippled Sepah Bank, one of Iran’s main state-owned banks, the <em>Fars</em> news agency reported.</p>

<p>“We’ve decided to permanently set camp here until it’s all clear, I guess,” 30-year-old Mali Papirany told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Iran also said it had detained five suspected Mossad agents on charges of tarnishing the country’s image online, Iranian news agencies reported.</p>
<p>“These mercenaries sought to sow fear among the public and tarnish the image of the sacred system of the Islamic Republic of Iran through their calculated activities online,” the <em>Tasnim</em> and <em>Isna</em> news agencies quoted a statement from the IRGC as saying.</p>

<p>France is planning along with European partners to suggest a negotiated solution to end the conflict between Iran and Israel, the country’s presidency said after President Emmanuel Macron chaired a national security council meeting.</p>
<p>Macron at the meeting ordered Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot to draw up in the coming days “an initiative with close European partners that would propose a demanding negotiated settlement to put an end to the conflict”, the presidency said in a statement, without giving details on the nature of the plan.</p>
<p>Macron urged Israel to end strikes on targets in Iran not linked to nuclear activities or ballistic missiles, his office said.</p>
<p>Addressing a national security council meeting, he “noted his concern over the current escalation, with Israeli strikes increasingly hitting targets not linked to Iran’s nuclear or ballistic programme, and a mounting number of civilian victims in Iran and Israel”, it said.</p>
<p>Macron said it was “necessary to urgently end these military operations, which pose significant threats to regional security”.</p>

<p>Israel’s airspace has been closed since the two countries began trading attacks on Friday, stranding tens of thousands whose flights to Tel Aviv were cancelled.</p>
<p>Israel announced special flights for the repatriation of its nationals on Tuesday. Its Transportation Ministry has said as many as 150,000 Israelis are abroad, with about a third trying to get home.</p>

<p>In a series of posts on Truth Social, Trump’s increasingly irate tone and choice of words indicated that the US was not far from intervening to support Israel, its closest ally in the region.</p>
<p>“We now have completely and total control of the skies over Iran,” he posted, prompting many to question what he meant by “we”.</p>
<p>The US president has maintained that his country is not involved in the Iran-Israel conflict yet, but threatened Iran with severe consequences if it targeted US troops and assets in the Middle East.</p>
<p>He then posted “unconditional surrender”, an apparent demand addressed at Tehran.</p>

<p>Trump also made a veiled threat against Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying “we know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding … We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now”.</p>

<p>Trump’s sometimes contradictory and cryptic messaging about the conflict between close US ally Israel and longtime foe Iran has deepened the uncertainty surrounding the crisis. His public comments have ranged from military threats to diplomatic overtures, not uncommon for a president known for an often erratic approach to foreign policy.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-moving-fighter-jets-middle-east-israel-iran-war-rages-2025-06-17/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> yesterday that the US military was deploying more fighter aircraft to the Middle East and extending the deployment of other warplanes.</p>
<p>The deployments include F-16, F-22 and F-35 fighter aircraft, and officials said had so far been used to shoot down drones and projectiles targeting Israel.</p>
<p>Four US Stratofortress bombers are currently stationed at a remote US base in the Indian Ocean, an <em>AFP</em> analysis of satellite imagery indicated. The four B52H bombers, which can carry nuclear weapons or other precision-guided munitions, were spotted on a southern tarmac at Diego Garcia on Monday at 2:22pm PKT.</p>
<p>US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also described the deployments as defensive in nature. A White House official said Trump spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The US already has a sizeable force in the Middle East, with nearly 40,000 troops in the region, including air defence systems, fighter aircraft and warships that can detect and shoot down enemy missiles.</p>

<p>British PM Keir Starmer, speaking at the Group of Seven nations <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917316">summit</a> in Canada that Trump left early, said there was no indication the US was about to enter the conflict.</p>

<p>“Given the security situation and in compliance with Israel Home Front Command guidance, the US Embassy in Jerusalem will be closed tomorrow (Wednesday, June 18) through Friday (June 20),” the embassy said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://il.usembassy.gov/security-alert-u-s-embassy-jerusalem-june-17-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> posted on Tuesday to its website.</p>

<p>Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916909">launched</a> its air war, its largest ever on Iran, on Friday after saying it concluded Iran was on the verge of developing a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and has pointed to its right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, including enrichment, as a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
<p>Israel, which is not a party to the NPT, is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has stressed that he will not back down until Iran’s nuclear development is disabled, while Trump says the Israeli assault could end if Iran agrees to strict curbs on enrichment.</p>
<p>Before Israel’s attack began, the 35-nation board of governors of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in almost 20 years.</p>
<p>However, a US intelligence assessment found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was “years away from producing one”, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917691/us-assessment-finds-iran-years-away-from-nuclear-weapon-refutes-israeli-claims">report</a> from <em>CNN</em> released on Tuesday said.</p>

<p>The IAEA said on Tuesday that an Israeli strike directly hit the underground enrichment halls at the Natanz facility.</p>
<p>Israel says it now has control of Iranian airspace and intends to escalate the campaign in coming days. But Israel will struggle to deal a knock-out blow to deeply buried nuclear sites like Fordow, which is dug beneath a mountain, without the US joining the attack.</p>
<p>Global oil markets are on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917009">high alert</a> following strikes on sites including the world’s biggest gas field, South Pars, shared by Iran and Qatar.</p></p>

<p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held what both sides called productive talks on Tuesday at the G7 summit in Alberta and agreed to reinstate top diplomats they had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1865267">withdrawn</a> last year.</p>
<p>Carney <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917110">drew outrage</a> from some members of Canada’s Sikh community when he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915911">invited</a> Modi to the G7.</p>

<p>Canada-India relations have been tense since former prime minister Justin Trudeau in 2023 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1776704/indian-envoy-expelled-as-pm-trudeau-links-delhi-to-sikh-leaders-death">accused</a> India’s government of involvement in the June 18, 2023, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1865374">murder</a> of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist leader in Canada.</p>
<p>Modi’s government has denied involvement in Nijjar’s killing and has accused Canada of providing a safe haven for Sikh separatists.</p>
<p>The intelligence report noted transnational repression “plays a central role in India’s activity in Canada”, though it said China poses the greatest counter-intelligence threat to Canada and also named Russia, Iran and Pakistan.</p>

<p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said in October that they had communicated more than a dozen threats to Sikhs advocating for the creation of a homeland carved out of India.</p>
<p>“Indian officials, including their Canada-based proxy agents, engage in a range of activities that seek to influence Canadian communities and politicians,” the Canadian Security Intelligence Service report reads.</p>
<p>“These activities attempt to steer Canada’s positions into alignment with India’s interests on key issues, particularly with respect to how the Indian government perceives Canada-based supporters of an independent homeland that they call Khalistan.”</p>
<p>The Indian High Commission and the Chinese embassy in Canada did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p></p>
