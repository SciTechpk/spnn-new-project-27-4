                <h2>COAS Munir stresses potential for ‚Äòbroader, multidimensional‚Äô ties with US built on mutual respect</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir has stressed the ‚Äúimmense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect‚Äù with the United States, the military‚Äôs media wing said on Friday.</p>
<p>COAS Munir is on a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917414">five-day</a> official visit to the US, where he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093/trump-coas-munir-talk-counterterrorism-and-trade-in-cordial-meeting-ispr">met with</a> President Donald Trump over luncheon, becoming the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">first</a> serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. National Security Advisor Lt Gen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907660/in-a-first-isi-chief-made-national-security-adviser">Muhammad Asim Malik</a> ‚Äî also the intelligence chief ‚Äî has accompanied Gen Munir.</p>
<p>COAS Munir held an interaction in Washington DC with prominent US think tanks and representatives of the strategic affairs institutions, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7326" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>Senior scholars, analysts, policy experts and representatives of leading international media outlets were also part of the ‚Äúcomprehensive and candid exchange‚Äù, ISPR added.</p>
<p>The army chief ‚Äúunderscored the immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect, shared strategic interests, and economic interdependence‚Äù, the statement said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Evaluating the Pakistan-US partnership, Gen Munir underlined the ‚Äúhistorical convergences between the two nations, particularly in areas such as counterterrorism, regional security and economic development‚Äù.</p>
<p>In his remarks, the army chief also highlighted Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúunwavering commitment to regional peace and stability, and its constructive role in fostering a rules-based international order‚Äù.</p>
<p>The army chief also noted the ‚Äúmalign influence of certain regional actors in sponsoring and perpetuating terrorism as a tool of hybrid warfare‚Äù, the statement added.</p>
<p>He mentioned this as he alluded to the details and analysis of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910729/operation-bunyanum-marsoos-11-soldiers-martyred-78-wounded-while-defending-pakistan">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a> during the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186">conflict</a> with India and ‚Äúelaborated on Pakistan‚Äôs perspective on terrorism‚Äù.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir emphasised that Pakistan had been on the ‚Äúfront lines of the global war against terrorism, having rendered immense sacrifices ‚Äî both human and economic ‚Äî in pursuit of a safer and more secure world‚Äù.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has repeatedly <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a> that Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911617#:~:text=which%20lost%2090%2C000%20lives%20and%20over%20%24150%20billion%20economic%20losses">lost</a> 90,000 valuable lives and incurred $150 billion worth of economic losses over the past few decades.</p>
<p>During the session, COAS Munir also invited international partners to explore collaborative opportunities in various sectors to ‚Äúunlock shared prosperity‚Äù.</p>
<p>He highlighted Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúremarkable untapped potential, particularly in the domains of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915901">information technology</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1871762">agriculture</a>, and its vast and underexploited reserves in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903248">mining</a> and mineral sectors‚Äù, echoing topics discussed in his meeting with Trump and previous Pak-US interactions.</p>
<p>The army chief also provided a detailed exposition of Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúbalanced approach to regional and global conflicts, advocating for dialogue, diplomacy, and adherence to international law‚Äù, the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He reaffirmed that Pakistan continues to play a ‚Äúresponsible and proactive role in mitigating regional tensions and promoting cooperative security frameworks‚Äù. The statement comes amid heightened tensions in the Middle East amid the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/israel-iran-conflict">Israel-Iran war</a> as the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918216/how-trump-a-self-proclaimed-peacemaker-embraced-israels-campaign-against-iran">weighs</a> whether to intervene militarily or not.</p>
<p>Participants, the ISPR said, noted the ‚Äúopenness and clarity of the COAS‚Äôs perspectives and appreciated Pakistan‚Äôs consistent and principled policies‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe interaction was marked by a spirit of mutual understanding and was widely regarded as a positive step toward enhancing strategic dialogue between Pakistan and the United States,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The interaction also provided an opportunity to articulate Pakistan‚Äôs principled stance on key regional and global issues, and to deepen understanding of Pakistan‚Äôs strategic outlook, the military‚Äôs media wing noted. It reflected the country‚Äôs ‚Äúcommitment to transparent diplomacy, international engagement, and the pursuit of peaceful coexistence through principled and proactive dialogue‚Äù.</p></p>

                <h2>Suspect arrested as another case of child pornography comes to light in Punjab‚Äôs Muzaffargarh</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A suspect was arrested in yet another case of child pornography in Punjab‚Äôs Muzaffargarh, Police said on Friday.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915195">claimed</a> to have dismantled an international child exploitation network operating out of a so-called gaming club in Muzaffargarh, where children aged six to 10 were lured, abused and filmed for the sake of selling their videos on the dark web.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSeveral children were sexually abused and filmed in Sardarabad village,‚Äù a police statement said today.</p>
<p>The matter came to light when one of the victims contacted the police. According to the statement, the suspect had been blackmailing the children using compromised videos.</p>
<p>A first information report (FIR) of the incident was lodged at Saddar police station in Muzaffargarh district under section 292 (sale, distribution, and public exhibition of obscene material) and section 355 (assault or criminal force with intent to dishonour a person) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p>
<p>According to the FIR, a boy was sexually abused and filmed by his older brother‚Äôs former employer when he went to collect his brother‚Äôs pending wages. The older brother had previously worked for the suspect as an animal caretaker.</p>
<p>The statement added that the Sadar police station has arrested the suspect, while the victims were being contacted for legal action.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, the punishment for sexually abusing a minor can range from seven years to life imprisonment, while rape of a child carries the death penalty or life term. Laws such as the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2016 and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1540094">Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Act, 2020</a> were enacted to address <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1851068">rising</a> cases of abuse, strengthen penalties, and ensure timely action. Offences related to child pornography are punishable by up to 14 years in prison, along with hefty fines.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Despite existing laws, cases of child sexual abuse continue to surface across the country.</p>
<p>As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908682/over-3350-child-abuse-cases-reported-across-pakistan-in-2024-report">reported</a> from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the year 2024, according to the civil society report ‚Äô<a class="link--external" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BiZQB4r46gbIYR88plzov08iuLzJ606_/view" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cruel Numbers 2024‚Äô</a> by Sahil that was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.</p>
<p>These included reported cases of child sexual abuse, abduction, missing children, and child marriages. It shows that nine children were abused per day during the year. A gender-divide analysis indicates that out of the total reported cases, 1,791 (53 per cent) victims were girls and 1,573 (47pc) boys.</p>
<p>In April, Punjab police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903749">arrested</a> five suspects for their alleged involvement in the gang rape of a child in Muzaffargarh, according to an official statement.</p></p>
