                <h2>29 schoolchildren, driver injured after van skids off road in AJK</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least 29 schoolchildren and their driver were injured after a van plunged off a treacherous hilly road in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Tuesday, police said.</p>
<p>Fatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain and poor infrastructure.</p>
<p>The van, carrying boys and girls from the private Islamia Public School in Chikar, was returning students to their homes when it met with the accident near a spot known as Tambrial Mor, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Mirza Zahid Hussain told <em>Dawn.com.</em></p>
<p>Chikar, a town and hill station in AJK‚Äôs Jhelum Valley district, is situated at an altitude of 5,272 feet above sea level and lies about 46 kilometres from Muzaffarabad, the state capital.</p>
<p>As a winter resort, Chikar‚Äôs educational institutions do not observe extended summer vacations, unlike other areas.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is assumed that after negotiating a bend, the vehicle went out of the driver‚Äôs control and fell down the road, causing injuries to almost everyone on board,‚Äù the SSP said.</p>
<p>According to the police official, 16 injured children were admitted to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Chikar, while the driver and 13 children were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital in Hattian Bala.</p>
<p>The children admitted to the Chikar Tehsil Headquarters Hospital were subsequently sent home after treatment.</p>
<p>The van driver, identified as Sajjad Shah, and two of the children were said to be in serious condition. However, the remaining students were out of danger.</p>
<p>A video clip shared by the SSP showed the overturned van resting on a steep, forested slope, surrounded by local residents rushing to help.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHad it not been for the tall trees that broke the fall, the van could have rolled further down the slope, resulting in heavier losses,‚Äù the SSP said.</p>
<p>Last week, six members of a family were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922093/6-dead-as-car-plunges-into-ajks-neelum-valley-officials">killed</a> in AJK‚Äôs Neelum valley when their car veered off the road and plummeted hundreds of feet, crashing onto the right bank of the river, officials had said.</p>
<p>In May, an assistant director, three inspectors and a constable of the AJK police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913950">lost</a> their lives when their vehicle plunged into a deep ravine in the Poonch division.</p></p>

                <h2>Islamabad court orders blocking of 27 YouTube channels on NCCIA‚Äôs request</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>An Islamabad court ordered the blocking of 27 YouTube channels for allegedly airing anti-state content and spreading ‚Äúfalse, misleading and fake‚Äù information, it emerged on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The federal government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1887118">established</a> the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) to probe illegal activities on social med¬≠ia. The NCCIA, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902145">operating</a> under the Interior Divi¬≠sion, has a key role in combatting cybercrime in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Sub-Inspector (SI) Waseem Khan of the NCCIA‚Äôs Cyber Crime Circle informed the Islamabad judicial magistrate on June 24 that under Section 37 (unlawful online content) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, the department was conducting an inquiry regarding 27 ‚ÄúYoutube channels who are involved in disseminating and propagating fake and misleading information against the state Institutions which is likely to cause fear, panic, disorder or unrest in the general public or society along with defamatory and fake remarks/information, which violates the privacy and harms the dignity of the officials of state institutions‚Äù.</p>
<p>Among the 27 channels are those of the PTI, journalists Matiuallah Jan, Wajahat Khan, Ahmad Noorani and Asad Ali Toor; former anchors Imran Riaz, Orya Maqbool, Sabir Shakir, and Moeed Pirzada .</p>
<p>He further said that the YouTube channels were ‚Äúfound involved in sharing highly intimidating, provocative and derogatory contents against state institutions and officials of state of Pakistan‚Äù and were a ‚Äúsource of publicly disseminating/propagating false, misleading and fake information against the state institutions/officials‚Äù.</p>
<p>He said that through their channels, the suspects had ‚Äúattempted to provoke the general public and armed forces personnel by trying to create a feeling of ill-will among pillars of the state‚Äù.</p>
<p>SI Khan had requested the court to issue a warrant/subpoena to Google to remove/block the 27 YouTube channels.</p>
<p>Judicial Magistrate Muhammad Abbas Shah‚Äôs June 24 order, available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, said he had heard the inquiry officer (IO) and examined the record on file.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the light of facts explained and evidence presented by the IO, this court is convinced that the subject matter constitutes offences punishable under the Peca and penal laws of Pakistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>He ordered the ‚Äúhead officer in charge of the security department/custodian of records‚Äù to Google block/remove the 27 YouTube channels.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Toor said he had received a notice from YouTube, informing him about the legal request received to remove his channel. ‚ÄúYou may choose to act on the said content in terms of the aforesaid court order. If you fail to do so, as per our local law obligations, we may comply with the request without further notice to you,‚Äù the notice said.</p>
