                <h2>Pakistan to celebrate Eidul Azha on June 7 as Zilhaj moon not sighted</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee (RHC) on Tuesday announced that it has not sighted the Zilhaj moon, meaning Pakistan would observe Eidul Azha on June 7.</p>
<p>The committee‚Äôs meeting took place on a roof in Islamabad‚Äôs Kohsar Block, where the religious affairs ministry has its <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/QExNBEGH6bpF75948" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">office</a>.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference, RHC Chairman Maulana Abdul Khabeer Azad said, ‚ÄúNo testimony of sighting the moon of the month of Zilhaj was received from any part of Pakistan [‚Ä¶]. Therefore, it was decided with consensus that Zilhaj 1, 1446AH would be on May 29, Thursday and Eidul Azha would be observed on June 7, Saturday.‚Äù</p>
<p>He noted that the weather remained cloudy in most parts of the country and clear in some.</p>
<p>Maulana Azad presided over the meeting of the RHC earlier in the evening, with officials and experts from other departments also gathered to sight the moon.</p>
<p>Simultaneous zonal meetings of the RHC also took place at their respective headquarters in the provincial capitals to send testimonies.</p>
<p>Dr Mohammad Hasan Ali, director of the Institute of Meteorology and Geophysics at the Pakistan Meteorological Department; Shaukatullah Khan of the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco); and Zainul Abedin from the science and tech ministry were among those present during the meeting, Azad said.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Suparco <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912584">predicted</a> that the festive occasion of Eidul Azha would likely be celebrated across Pakistan on June 7.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>According to Suparco, while the birth of a new moon for Zilhaj 1446 AH would occur on May 27, the possibility of the moon being sighted across the country today would be extremely low even under optimal weather conditions.</p>
<p>Cloudy weather <a class="link--external" href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/pk/islamabad/258278/hourly-weather-forecast/258278" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> in the federal capital further reduced the sighting probability.</p>
<p>Celebrated on the 10th of Zilhaj, Eidul Azha marks the culmination of Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam.</p></p>

<p>In their meeting today, PM Shehbaz and Aliyev reviewed the ‚Äúfull spectrum of bilateral relations and expressed satisfaction over the upward trajectory of political, economic, defence, and cultural cooperation‚Äù between their countries, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> stated.</p>
<p>The prime minister thanked Aliyev‚Äôs country for its steadfast support during the recent Pakistan-India confrontation and ‚Äúacknowledged the public expressions of solidarity from both the leadership and the people of brotherly Azerbaijan‚Äù.</p>

<p>During his visit, PM Shehbaz will have ‚Äúwide-ranging discussions with the leaders of these countries on an entire range of issues covering bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance‚Äù, the Foreign Office had said earlier.</p>

<p>As tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi escalated, with India launching deadly strikes on Pakistan on May 6, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909193/erdogan-conveys-turkiyes-solidarity-to-pm-shehbaz-amid-india-escalation">conveyed his solidarity</a> to the prime minister and said it supported Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúcalm and restrained policies‚Äù.</p>
