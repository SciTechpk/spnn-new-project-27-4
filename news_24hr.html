            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump has introduced tariffs on exports from dozens of trading partners, including a 19 per cent tariff on Pakistani goods — revised from the previous 29pc — a day after the two countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927783">finalised</a> a trade agreement.</p>
<p>Late on Wednesday night, a Pakistani <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925309/pakistan-us-near-breakthrough-as-trade-talks-enter-final-stage">delegation</a> led by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in Washington, DC, finalised a trade agreement with the US, expected to lower tariffs, although no figure was announced. Trump also said Washington would help Islamabad develop “massive oil deposits”.</p>
<p>According to an <a class="link--external" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/further-modifying-the-reciprocal-tariff-rates/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> detailing the tariffs, it was announced that Pakistan is set to face a 19pc tariff rate as Trump’s tariff deadline comes to an end on August 1 (today).</p>
<p>While the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) dipped by as many as 433 points earlier today, it soon regained its bullish <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927928/stocks-rally-on-euphoria-over-us-trade-deal">momentum</a>.</p>
<p>The benchmark <a class="link--external" href="https://dps.psx.com.pk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KSE-100 index</a> rose by 120.07 points (0.09pc) to reach 139,510.49 points at 11:34am, from the previous close of 139,390.42 points.</p>
<p>Having witnessed heavy <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927527/market-sinks-1415-points-on-political-noise">selling pressure</a> on Tuesday due to corporate earnings and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927349/cjp-led-bench-adjourns-hearing-on-imrans-bail-pleas-in-may-9-cases-without-issuing-notices">political noise</a>, the PSX had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927928/stocks-rally-on-euphoria-over-us-trade-deal">bounced back</a> above the 139,000-mark yesterday, driven by the trade agreement with the US.</p>

<p>Trump set rates including a 35pc duty on many goods from Canada, 50pc for Brazil, 25pc for India, 20pc for Taiwan and 39pc for Switzerland, according to a presidential executive order.</p>
<p>The order listed higher import duty rates of 10 to 41pc starting in seven days for 69 trading partners as the 12:01am EDT (9:01am PKT) deadline approached.</p>

<p>Some of them had reached tariff-reducing deals; others had no opportunity to negotiate with his administration. Trump included an exception for some goods shipped within the coming week.</p>
<p>Goods from all other countries not listed would be subject to a 10pc US import tax. Trump had previously said that the rate might be higher.</p>
<p>The administration also teased that more trade deals were in the pipeline as it seeks to close trade deficits and boost domestic factories.</p>
<p>According to the executive order, if a trading partner fails to take “adequate steps” to address the tariffs or retaliates against the US, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, in coordination with the appropriate senior officials, shall recommend additional action.</p>
<p>Facing a Friday deadline of his making, the Republican president has tapped emergency powers, pressured foreign leaders, and pressed ahead with trade policies that sparked a market sell-off when they were first announced in April.</p>

<p>This time, markets had a more muted reaction. Stocks and equity futures fell modestly in Friday morning trading in Asia.</p>
<p>Trump’s order said that some trading partners, “despite having engaged in negotiations, have offered terms that, in my judgment, do not sufficiently address imbalances in our trading relationship or have failed to align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national-security matters”.</p>
<p>Other details are still to come, including on the “rules of origin” that will determine what products might face even higher tariffs.</p>
<p>Trump also said “we have made a few deals today that are excellent deals for the country”, and a US official later told reporters that they were still to be announced.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#canada-mexico" id="canada-mexico" title="Permalink"></a>Canada, Mexico</h2>
<p>Trump issued a separate order for Canada that raises the rate on Canadian goods subject to fentanyl-related tariffs to 35pc, from 25pc previously, saying Canada had “failed to cooperate” in curbing illicit narcotics flows into the US.</p>
<p>The higher tariffs on Canadian goods contrasted sharply with Trump’s decision to grant Mexico a 90-day reprieve from higher tariffs of 30pc on many goods to provide more time to negotiate a broader trade pact.</p>
<p>Trump complained to reporters earlier that Canada had “been very poorly led”.</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was disappointed by Trump’s decision.</p>
<p>“While we will continue to negotiate with the United States on our trading relationship, the Canadian government is laser focused on what we can control: building Canada strong,” Carney said in a post on X.</p>

<p>US duties and tariffs will heavily affect lumber, steel, aluminium, and automobiles, he added, vowing action to protect Canadian jobs, buy Canadian goods, invest in industrial competitiveness and diversify export markets.</p>
<p>The extension for Mexico avoids a 30pc tariff on most Mexican non-automotive and non-metal goods compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade and came after a Thursday morning call between Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.</p>
<p>“We avoided the tariff increase announced for tomorrow,” Sheinbaum <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/Claudiashein/status/1950938276967403563" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X, adding that the Trump call was “very good”.</p>
<p>About 85pc of US imports from Mexico comply with the rules of origin outlined in the USMCA, shielding them from 25pc tariffs related to fentanyl, according to Mexico’s economy ministry.</p>

<p>Trump said the US would continue to levy a 50pc tariff on Mexican steel, aluminum and copper and a 25pc tariff on Mexican autos and on non-USMCA-compliant goods subject to tariffs related to the US fentanyl crisis.</p>
<p>“Additionally, Mexico has agreed to immediately terminate its Non-Tariff Trade Barriers, of which there were many,” Trump said in a Truth Social post, without providing details.</p>

<p>Trump’s rollout of higher import taxes on Friday comes amid more evidence they have begun driving up consumer goods prices.</p>
<p>Commerce Department data released Thursday showed prices for home furnishings and durable household equipment jumped 1.3pc in June, the biggest gain since March 2022. Recreational goods and vehicles prices shot up 0.9pc, the most since February 2024. Prices for clothing and footwear rose 0.4pc.</p>

<p>Trump hit Brazil’s exports on Wednesday with a steep 50pc tariff as he escalated his fight with Latin America’s largest economy over its prosecution of his friend and former president Jair Bolsonaro, but softened the blow by excluding sectors such as aircraft, energy and orange juice from heavier levies.</p>

<p>The run-up to Trump’s tariff deadline was unfolding as federal appeals court judges sharply questioned Trump’s use of a sweeping emergency powers law to justify his sweeping tariffs of up to 50pc on nearly all trading partners.</p>
<p>Trump invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare an emergency over the growing US trade deficit and impose his “reciprocal” tariffs and a separate fentanyl emergency.</p>
<p>The Court of International Trade ruled in May that the actions exceeded his executive authority, and questions from judges during oral arguments before the US Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit in Washington indicated further scepticism.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, China is facing an August 12 deadline to reach a durable tariff agreement with Trump’s administration, after Beijing and Washington reached preliminary deals in May and June to end escalating tit-for-tat tariffs and a cut-off of rare earth minerals.</p>
<p>A US official told reporters that they are making progress toward a deal.</p></p>

            <p><p>Pakistan’s largest refiner <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1833600">Cnergyico</a> will import 1 million barrels of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927725">oil</a> from Vitol in October, its Vice Chairman Usama Qureshi told <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/pakistan-get-first-us-oil-shipment-cnergyico-seals-import-deal-2025-07-31/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reuters</a></em> on Friday, marking the country’s first-ever purchase of US crude following a landmark <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927783">trade deal</a>.</p>
<p>The West Texas Intermediate light crude cargo will be loaded from Houston this month and is expected to arrive in Karachi in the second half of October, Qureshi said.</p>
<p>“This is a test spot cargo under our umbrella term agreement with Vitol. If it is commercially viable and available, we could import at least one cargo per month,” he said, adding that the shipment was not meant for resale.</p>
<p>The deal follows months of multiple negotiations, which first began in April, he said, after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810/trumps-tariffs-stoke-global-trade-war-as-china-eu-hit-back">29pc tariffs</a> on imports from Pakistan.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Pakistan hailed a trade deal struck with the US, its top export market, and said the agreement would increase investments. The White House said on Thursday the US will charge a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927992/trump-slaps-19pc-tariff-on-pakistani-goods-targets-dozens-of-countries-with-steep-duties">19pc</a> tariff on imports from Pakistan.</p>
<p>Qureshi said Pakistan’s finance and petroleum ministries encouraged local refineries to explore US crude imports after the April tariff announcement.
Vitol did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside of office hours.</p>
<p>A key China ally, Pakistan has been warming up to Trump after he threatened tariffs. It has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923026/trumps-claim-on-averting-india-pakistan-war-gains-new-life">credited</a> US diplomatic intervention for ending recent hostilities with neighbouring India and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922774">nominated</a> Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<p>Oil is Pakistan’s biggest import item, and its shipments were valued at $11.3 billion in the year ended June 30, 2025, accounting for nearly a fifth of the country’s total import bill.</p>
<p>The import deal will help Pakistan diversify its crude sourcing and reduce reliance on Middle Eastern suppliers, who account for nearly all of its oil imports.</p>
<p>“Gross refining margin is on par with Gulf grades, and no blending or refinery tweaks are required,” Qureshi said.</p>
<p>Cnergyico can process 156,000 barrels of crude per day and operates the country’s only single-point mooring terminal near Karachi, enabling it to handle large tankers, unlike other refiners in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The company plans to install a second offshore terminal to allow larger or more frequent shipments, and to upgrade its refinery over the next five to six years, Qureshi said.</p>
<p>The refiner, which has been operating at an average refinery run rate of 30 to 35pc due to tepid local demand, is betting on growth in demand for oil products.</p>
<p>“We expect run rates to rise as domestic demand strengthens and local production is prioritised over imported fuels,” Qureshi said.</p>
<p>Trump said on Wednesday the US would also cooperate with Pakistan to develop the South Asian country’s “massive oil reserves”, without providing further details.</p></p>

<p>“As everyone knows, on the night of February 8, a brazen robbery of the public mandate took place through money and coercion,” Mr Achakzai said. “Whoever paid the highest price was awarded victory with a check mark. What followed was the auction of the entire state apparatus — consciences, government jobs, and public resources were all put up for sale.”</p>
<p>Mr Achakzai argued that “powerful undemocratic forces have treated the Constitution as nothing more than a piece of paper”.</p>

<p>He claimed that after the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party was stripped of its electoral symbol, voters still overwhelmingly chose its candidates, only to have their mandate “snatched at gunpoint” by the night of Feb 9.</p>
<p>He asserted the country was engulfed in corruption, with 45 per cent of the population living below the poverty line, and questioned military actions in certain regions.</p>
<p>“Areas in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other Pashtun and Baloch regions are routinely subjected to bombardment and shelling,” he said. “What was the fault of the unarmed people of Tirah and the innocent children of Bajaur who were riddled with bullets?”</p>
<p>Mr Achakzai appealed to all “democratic” forces to unite and formulate a new consensus charter and social contract.</p>
<p>In a warning to the international community, he said any agreements made by the current government regarding national resources have no legal legitimacy because the government does not represent the people.</p>
<p>A formal resolution from the conference is expected to be released Friday.</p>
