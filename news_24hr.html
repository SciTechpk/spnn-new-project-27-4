            <p><p>Security forces have killed 14 more terrorists attempting to infiltrate across the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Balochistan’s Zhob district, the military’s media wing said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The development adds to 33 terrorists, belonging to the “Indian proxy <em>Fitna al Khwaraj</em>”, who were eliminated on the night of August 7 and 8.</p>
<p>“On [the] night 8/9 August 2025, a deliberate sanitisation operation was conducted in surrounding areas of Sambaza along Pakistan-Afghanistan border,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7384" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>“During the conduct of the operation, 14 more Indian-sponsored <em>khwarij</em> were hunted down and successfully neutralised. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed <em>khwarij</em>,” the ISPR noted.</p>

<p>This followed the “successful engagements by the security forces in general area Sambaza, Zhob District on 7-8 August 2025, during which 33 <em>khwarij</em> were sent to hell”.</p>
<p>“The number of <em>khwarij</em> killed in two days anti-infiltration operation has risen to 47,” the military highlighted.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna">Fitna al Khawarij</a></em> is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>“The security forces remain committed to secure the nation’s frontiers and thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Pakistan,” the statement asserted.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to the security forces and praised their professionalism.</p>
<p>“The nation looks with admiration at the successes of the security forces against the terrorists of the Indian conspiracy. The security forces have brought the Indian-sponsored terrorists involved in spreading chaos in Balochistan to an exemplary end,” he said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MOIofficialGoP/status/1954104835948646886" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X.</p>
<p>He added, “Security forces, through timely operations, sent 47 terrorists of <em>Fitna al-Hindu­stan</em> to hell in two days. By taking swift action, they foiled a sinister conspiracy to sabotage peace in Balochistan.”</p>

<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>The country <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">ranked</a> second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>
<p>Last month, security forces killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926404">three terrorists</a>, while two security personnel, including an army major, embraced martyrdom during an intelligence-based military operation in Mastung district.</p>
<p>It followed two separate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925436/4-terrorists-killed-in-balochistans-kalat-operation-ispr">military operations</a> in Kalat district, where a total of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925871/4-terrorists-killed-in-sanitisation-operation-in-balochistans-kalat-ispr">eight terrorists</a>, belonging to the Indian proxy, <em>Fitna al-Hindustan</em>, were killed.</p></p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President Donald Trump’s peace efforts following his role in brokering the Armenia-Azerbaijan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929655/azerbaijan-and-armenia-sign-peace-deal-at-white-house">peace deal</a>.</p>
<p>A day earlier, Azerbaijan and Armenia signed an initial US-brokered peace agreement during a meeting with Trump, a deal aimed at boosting economic ties between the two countries after decades of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897786">conflict</a>.</p>
<p>“Pakistan welcomes the historic peace agreement signed between the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia at the White House Summit under the auspices of US President Donald J Trump,” the premier wrote in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/CMShehbaz/status/1954026703321461024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on X.</p>
<p>He congratulated both countries on “charting a course for a peaceful future for their region”, stating: “Pakistan has always stood by the brotherly nation of Azerbaijan and we stand with them at this proud moment of their history.”</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz continued: “We also appreciate the facilitation role of the United States, under President Donald Trump, in bringing the two sides together and securing an agreement that opens new avenues for trade, connectivity, and regional integration.”</p>
<p>“It is our hope that this spirit of dialogue will serve as an example for other regions facing protracted conflicts,” he added.</p>
<p>He also said that the development marks the “dawn of a new era of peace, stability, and cooperation in the South Caucasus”, which has endured “conflict and human suffering” for decades.</p>

<p>Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also appreciated Trump’s role in “facilitating this breakthrough” and congratulated Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MIshaqDar50/status/1954040055724429781" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, he wrote, “Today marks a truly historic moment as Azerbaijan and Armenia take a decisive step towards resolving a bitter conflict that has lasted for over three decades.</p>
<p>“May this milestone pave the way in the Caucasus for a future free of the painful shadows of the past, and one built on peace, stability, and hope,” he added.</p>

<p>Separately, Trump said that both countries were “committing to stop all fighting forever, open up commerce, travel and diplomatic relations, and respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”, while speaking to <a class="link--external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Po1W0CPNhI&amp;pp=ygUkQXplcmJhaWphbiBhbmQgQXJtZW5pYSB0cnVtcCByZXV0ZXJz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reporters</a> alongside Azerbaijan’s Aliyev and Armenian PM Nikol Pashinyan.</p>
<p>Trump said the US signed separate deals with each country to expand cooperation on energy, trade and technology, including artificial intelligence. Details were not released.</p>
<p>Both leaders praised Trump for helping to end the conflict and said they would nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

<p>Trump has tried to present himself as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928543">global peacemaker</a> in the first months of his second term. The White House credits him with brokering a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926693/trump-says-thailand-and-cambodia-agree-to-hold-immediate-ceasefire-talks">ceasefire</a> between Cambodia and Thailand and sealing peace deals between <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923026/trumps-claim-on-averting-india-pakistan-war-gains-new-life">India and Pakistan</a>, and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920693">Rwanda</a> and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>Following the announcement, Trump stated: “As president, my highest aspiration is to bring peace and stability to the world.”</p>
<p>“Today’s signing follows our success with India and Pakistan. They were going at it. They were going at it big. And, they were great leaders that came together just prior to what would have been a tremendous conflict, a nuclear conflict probably.”</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">claimed</a> — in contrast to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923175">India’s stance</a> — that US intervention prevented a “bad nuclear war” between India and Pakistan following their most intense <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military confrontation</a> in decades.</p>
<p>Tensions between the two countries escalated after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> in occupied Kashmir, which saw the killing of 26 tourists. New Delhi, without any evidence, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">blamed</a> Islamabad for the attack, while the latter strongly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">denied</a> the claims and offered a neutral probe. The two nations then fought a four-day conflict before a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> on May 10.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929736/altaf-hussain-discharged-from-london-hospital-after-chest-infection' target='_blank'><strong>Altaf Hussain discharged from London hospital after ‘chest infection’</strong></a>
            <p><p>Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) founder Altaf Hussain was discharged from a London hospital in the early hours of Saturday after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929559/mqm-founder-altaf-hussain-hospitalised-again-in-london">being admitted</a> for a second time in a month, a party leader said.</p>
<p>The MQM founder was last <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923722">hospitalised</a> in London on July 10 due to “severe illness”. After undergoing multiple tests and blood transfusions, he was <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/azizabadi/status/1948095629831414059" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discharged</a> on July 23.</p>
<p>Hussain was allowed to leave the hospital at 12:30am GMT (5:30am PKT) today after being treated in its emergency ward for nine hours and undergoing various tests, London-based senior MQM leader Mustafa Azizabadi said on X.</p>

<p>“After various tests, doctors diagnosed him with severe flu and a chest infection. The doctors prescribed antibiotics and other medications for Mr Altaf Hussain and advised him to take complete rest,” Azizabadi said.</p>
<p>Detailing Hussain’s hospital stay, Azizabadi noted the MQM founder “underwent a blood test, [electrocardiography], chest X-ray, and monitoring of oxygen levels”.</p>
<p>“Hussain has expressed his gratitude to all the workers and the public who prayed for his recovery during his illness,” Azizabadi said.</p>
<p>The MQM founder had also remained in the intensive care unit at a hospital in Britain, apparently after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1604892">contracting Covid-19</a> in February 2021.</p>
<p>Hussain has been in <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1110320">self-imposed exile</a> since 1992 and currently lives in London, where he was later granted British citizenship. From there, Hussain played an active role in politics, regularly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1111169/newspaper/column">broadcasting political speeches</a> to his followers in Karachi.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Previously known as the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, Hussain founded his party in 1984 to represent the Urdu-speaking community, which had migrated to Pakistan amid Partition.</p>
<p>Under Hussain’s leadership, MQM swept the 1988 election in Sindh’s urban areas, emerging as the third-largest party in the country.</p>
<p>The MQM under Hussain was accused of using violent tactics to attain and retain political power. On the contrary, Hussain maintained that the state and other political parties have targeted MQM and its workers ever since its formation</p>
<p>Viewed as the man who controlled Karachi from London, Hussain came under fire in May 2013 for his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1012874/action-sought-against-altaf-for-anti-pakistan-speech">televised speech</a> across Pakistan, where he allegedly demanded the separation of Karachi from the rest of Pakistan if the public mandate of his party was not acceptable to the ‘establishment’. The party later said the statement was taken out of context.</p>
<p>However, the final undoing of the MQM, as it was known, came after Hussain delivered an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1279393">incendiary speech</a> in August 2016 in which he raised slogans against Pakis­tan.</p></p>
