            <p><p>PTI founder Imran Khan said in a “clear message” to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Saturday that the federation should not be allowed to conduct another military operation in the province and its tribal areas.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, security forces, backed by gunship helicopters and artillery, launched ‘Operation Sarbakaf’ against terrorists in Lowi Mamund tehsil and imposed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927438/curfew-imposed-as-3-day-operation-against-militants-begins-in-bajaur-official">three-day curfew</a> in the region. A day after he and his party <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927600/kp-seeks-confidence-over-bajaur-military-operation-vows-to-lift-curfew">came out all guns blazing</a> against the military offensive, CM Gand­apur had appea­red to throw his full weight behind a “targeted operation” against militants. His statement came in complete contrast to the one issued on Tuesday night following a PTI parliamentary meeting, in which he vowed to take stringent measures, such as the withdrawal of the Action in Aid of Civil Power Regulations 2011.</p>
<p>Though CM Gandapur took a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927723/cm-gandapur-changes-his-mind-backs-military-action">U-turn</a>, his party, the ruling PTI, had denounced the Bajaur operation, alleging that the decision bypassed the constitutionally elected government and it was nothing but a “dangerous replay of past mistakes”.</p>
<p>In a message from Imran <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ImranKhanPTI/status/1951703536540262746" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> today on his X account, which is not operated by him, the ex-premier said regarding any operation in KP: “I convey a clear message to Ali Amin that the federation must not be allowed to conduct another military operation in KP and the tribal areas.</p>
<p>“Confrontation between the army and the people destroys the institution of the army. Operations are not a solution to any problem. Issues should be resolved through dialogue in accordance with the system there. Afghanistan is our Muslim neighbouring country. Relations with them should also be improved, and issues should be addressed through discussions.”</p>
<p>Responding to the party founder’s instruction from his personal account, Gandapur said that keeping in mind Imran’s thinking, he had hosted today the first of several jirgas on restoring law and order in the province.</p>

<p>Gandapur had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927600">announced</a> earlier this week that a series of jirgas would be convened to decide on future steps on a wide array of concerns among the province’s residents.</p>
<p>In a post on X, a statement from the CM Office said the regional jirgas began today and were attended by tribal elders and elected public representatives from the Khyber and Orakzai districts, as well as representatives from the tribal subdivisions of Darra Adam Khel and Hassan Khel.</p>
<p>It added that 150 tribal elders from the aforementioned areas, six MPAs, three MNAs and one senator participated in the jirga.</p>

<p>The statement added that the CM’s adviser on information, the KP chief secretary, inspector general of police and commissioners and deputy commissioners were also present in the jirga.</p>
<p>The statement listed down the recommendations made by the jirga, such as ensuring unity against terrorism to restore peace, as well as declaring that displacement amid the ongoing military operation was “unacceptable under any circumstances”.</p>
<p>“Development is linked to peace and it will accelerate when peace is restored,” the statement said. “No one has asked for any resources of the province, including minerals, nor has it been given to anyone, nor will it be given to anyone.</p>
<p>“Tribal elders have recommended to the federal government that arrangements should be made to send a jirga of the provincial government and tribal elders for negotiations with Afghanistan,” the statement added.</p>
<p>The statement said that the jirga should receive resources and cooperation to achieve this, adding that the next regional jirga would be held in the Mohmand and Bajaur districts. A third jirga would be held in North and South Waziristan, while the fourth would be convened in Kurram district.</p>
<p>No dates were given for the jirgas in this statement.</p>
<p>“Immediately after the regional jirgas, a grand jirga will be held under the chairmanship of the Chief Minister,” the statement added.</p></p>

            <p><p>Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian landed in Islamabad on Saturday for a two-day visit, eyeing to reaffirm his commitment to elevate annual bilateral trade with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan has recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924349/dar-slams-israel-us-attacks-against-fellow-sco-member-iran-as-unacceptable">expressed solidarity</a> and a desire for cooperation with Iran, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927716/closer-pak-iran-cooperation-vital-to-securing-shared-interests-say-experts">experts say</a> is vital to securing shared interests in a shifting geopolitical environment.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian is paying a two-day official visit to Pakistan over the weekend, making it his first trip to Islamabad in his current role, the Foreign Office <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928047/iranian-president-to-visit-pakistan-on-saturday-fo">said</a>. Ahead of his trip, Pakistan yesterday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919380/the-history-of-us-iran-tensions">pledged</a> to help defuse <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919380/the-history-of-us-iran-tensions">tensions</a> between Iran and the United States.</p>

<p>PM Shehbaz had met with Pezeshkian during his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913442/ready-to-talk-with-india-pm-shehbaz-says-during-meeting-with-iranian-president-in-tehran">visit to Iran</a> in late May, which was part of his regional tour to friendly countries aimed at expre­ssing gratitude for their support during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">conflict with India</a>.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian is the second Iranian president to visit Pakistan in as many years. Late Ebrahim Raisi had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1828957">visited</a> the country in April last year, just a month before he died in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1834463">helicopter crash</a>.</p>
<p>According to Iran’s state media <em><a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85903178/Pezeshkian-Iran-aims-to-expand-trade-with-Pakistan-to-10-billion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IRNA</a></em>, before departing for Pakistan, Pezeshkian emphasised the plan to elevate their annual trade exchanges to $10 billion. The two countries had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1829136">agreed</a> in April last year to boost trade over the next five years.</p>
<p>The president termed the trade relations between Tehran and Islamabad as “good” and identified boosting trade with Pakistan via land, air and sea as priorities for this trip, the report added.</p>
<p>“Through Pakistan, Iran can connect to the Silk Road linking China and Pakistan, and the route can then extend through Iran to Europe,” he said.</p>
<p>Emphasising that security and border issues were of great importance to both Iran and Pakistan, he stressed that regional security must be achieved through cooperation, according to <em>IRNA</em>.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Pezeshkian noted that the two neighbours have “enjoyed good, friendly, and deep-rooted relations” since Pakistan’s independence. “The two countries cooperate in economic, scientific, cultural, and border areas, and a deep bond exists between the people of both sides,” he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian highlighted that during the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919798/ceasefire-brokered-with-iran-after-washington-request-for-liaison-qatars-pm-says">Israel-Iran war</a> and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">United States’ strikes</a> against its nuclear facilities, “Pakistan was among the countries that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924349/dar-slams-israel-us-attacks-against-fellow-sco-member-iran-as-unacceptable">strongly condemned</a> this aggression and declared its readiness to provide any necessary support for Iran’s territorial integrity, as well as for the government and people of Iran”.</p>
<p>According to <em>IRNA</em>, the president also noted that “the enemy plans to create division among Muslims, but Iran will thwart the enemies’ plots”, adding that Tehran aims to maintain unity and solidarity between Iran and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian had left for Pakistan earlier today, accompanied by a high-level delegation.</p>

            <p><p>The Darakshan Police on Saturday registered a case against eight nominated suspects under terrorism and murder charges for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928052/senior-lawyer-gunned-down-in-karachis-dha-police">killing</a> senior lawyer Khawaja Shamsul Islam and critically injuring his young son inside a mosque in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority a day prior.</p>
<p>South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza had told <em>Dawn.com</em> on Friday that the firing took place after prayers at a mosque in DHA Phase 6. “As advocate Khawaja Shamsul Islam and his son [Khawaja Daniyal, 25] were about to leave the mosque, a lone gunman apparently resorted to firing on them and fled,” the DIG had said.</p>
<p>The Darakshan Police registered a first information report (FIR) today upon the complaint of the victim’s brother and under Section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment), 302 (premeditated murder) and 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act.</p>
<p>“My brother Khawaja Shamsul Islam, along with his two young sons and two guards had gone to offer Friday prayers and attend funeral prayers at the Quran Academy mosque located on Khayaban-i-Rahat, Phase 6,” the FIR read.</p>
<p>“He was picking up his slippers at the staircase of the mosque when [the suspect] fired two shots at around 2:30pm. As a result, one bullet hit my brother and another hit his son. The suspect managed to escape while taking advantage of the rush.”</p>
<p>The complainant added that the victim’s younger son was unharmed in the incident and took his injured father to a private hospital in Clifton, while unidentified persons took the injured son to another private hospital in the same locale.</p>
<p>“Khawaja Shamsul Islam expired during treatment while his son was admitted with critical injuries,” the FIR added.</p>
<p>The complainant alleged that the primary suspect, along with 15-20 accomplices, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1872404">attacked</a> the lawyer last November, in which he was shot twice and tortured. The case was registered with Clifton police under terror and other charges.</p>
<p>“Now, the suspect, his two brothers and five other suspects attacked together … resulting in the death of the lawyer and serious injuries to his son,” the complainant stated, adding that the incident also triggered fear and chaos among the general public.</p>
<p>The complainant said he wanted legal proceedings against the nominated suspects over terrorism, murder charges and criminal conspiracy.</p>
<p>DIG Raza also told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “The prime suspect has confessed to the crime in a recorded video message.”</p>
<p>On Friday, the DIG constituted a special team under the supervision of the South senior superintendent of police to arrest the suspects who murdered the advocate and injured his son.</p>
<p>He had added that the prime suspect was the son of a police constable deployed for Islam’s security in the past, as witnesses heard him saying that he had taken “revenge” for the murder of his father.</p>
<p>In a statement issued yesterday, the Karachi Bar Association condemned the murder of Islam and announced that its members would not appear before any court today to express solidarity with the slain senior lawyer.</p></p>
