            <p><p>Pakistan’s top military man General Sahir Shamshad Mirza has stressed the need to move towards conflict resolution instead of management, warning that its absence could result in a destructive escalation.</p>
<p>The remarks follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. As New Delhi launched <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> in early May, killing civilians, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downed five Indian jets</a> in retaliation. After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>Gen Mirza, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, made the remarks at the annual <a class="link--external" href="https://www.iiss.org/events/shangri-la-dialogue/shangri-la-dialogue-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shangri-La Dialogue 2025</a> organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore on Saturday evening.</p>
<p>During a panel discussion, titled “<a class="link--external" href="https://www.iiss.org/events/shangri-la-dialogue/shangri-la-dialogue-2025/special-sessions/special-session-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Regional Crisis-Management Mechanisms</a>”, Gen Mirza said: “It has become imperative to move beyond conflict management towards conflict resolution. This will ensure sustainable peace and an assured crisis management.”</p>
<p>He then stressed that an “early resolution of Kashmir [dispute] in line with the UN Security Council <a class="link--external" href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/111955/?ln=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resolutions</a> and as per the aspirations of the people is essential” for an enduring peace in South Asia.</p>
<p>The CJCSC cautioned: “Given the Indian policies and polities’ extremist mindset, the absence of a crisis management mechanism may not give enough time to the global powers to intervene and affect cessation of hostilities. They will be probably too late to avoid damage and destruction.”</p>

<p>During his address, Gen Mirza also highlighted the Kashmir dispute and the recent military clash between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>“When there is no crisis, Kashmir is never discussed, and as we always say that it is the Kashmir dispute resolution in line with the aspirations of the people of Kashmir and in line with the <a class="link--external" href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/111955/?ln=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UNSC resolutions</a> that will address many issues.</p>
<p>“The core that resides between Pakistan and India is Kashmir,” the CJCSC pointed out.</p>
<p>He added that unless countries did not “enter conflict resolution” — which he said could initially be through conflict management and then lead to resolution — issues would “always erupt”.</p>
<p>Other speakers on the panel included Canada’s Deputy Minister of National Defence Stefanie Beck and Fiji’s army chief Major Gen Jone Logavatu Kalouniwai. India’s Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan also addressed a separate <a class="link--external" href="https://www.iiss.org/events/shangri-la-dialogue/shangri-la-dialogue-2025/special-sessions/special-session-1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discussion</a> on defence innovation yesterday.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In an apparent reference to the Kashmir dispute, the CJCSC also noted: “Crisis prevention is better than crisis fighting. Suppressed disputes, whether territorial or ideological, cannot be indefinitely managed.”</p>
<p>Gen Mirza said the recent Pak-India escalation had underscored “how regional crisis management frameworks remain hostage to countries’ belligerence”, noting that the only line of contact between the two countries was the director general military operations <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911867">(DGMO) hotline</a>.</p>
<p>The top general further said that following the military conflict, the “threshold of an escalatory war has come dangerously low, implying greater risk on both sides, not just in the disputed territory but all of India and all of Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“Emboldening of India as a net security provider by the West and its ambition to become a regional hegemon is disincentivising it to engage in conflict management options,” CJCSC Mirza asserted.</p>
<p>He went on to state that Pakistan desired a “peaceful coexistence with India based on mutual respect, sovereign equality and most importantly, dignity and honour”.</p>
<p>“We seek a principal order, an order anchored in sovereign equality and restraint. In this, crisis management is not merely a set of tools but a strategic ethic,” he added.</p>
<p>The CJCSC stressed the need for Asia-Pacific and South Asia regions to re-energise and strengthen existing bilateral, regional and multilateral frameworks instead of chalking out new mechanisms. “States need to communicate more and more often and more effectively.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#conventional-warfare-threshold-now-dangerously-lower" id="conventional-warfare-threshold-now-dangerously-lower" title="Permalink"></a>‘Conventional warfare threshold now dangerously lower’</h2>
<p>During the IISS session, Gen Mirza also asserted that following the Pakistan-India military clash, the threshold of strategic stability had been lowered to “dangerous levels”.</p>
<p>He stated, “The threshold of what we say conventional warfare has significantly degraded.”</p>
<p>Gen Mirza pointed out that the 1965 and 1971 wars with India were “always confined to the disputed territory”. “[However,] this time, it has transcended that and come to the international border.”</p>
<p>The CJCSC highlighted: “Instead of targeting the borders first, which used to be the conventional domain or erstwhile domain, the cities have been targeted and the borders have relatively remained, if not silent, comfortable.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He noted that strategic stability hinged on conflict resolution, adding: “The lowering of this threshold to the dangerous levels, if next time such a conflict occurs and the cities are targeted first, […] there could be a chance — I’m not trying to create an alarm but I’m speaking based on logic — there could be a possibility that before the international community intervenes because of the restricted or constricted times window, the damage and destruction may have already taken place.”</p>
<p>On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi had launched a series of air strikes in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">Punjab</a> and Azad Kashmir, resulting in at least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910848">40 civilians</a> losing their lives with 121 others injured.</p>
<p>The military has confirmed that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910992">13 security personnel</a>, including members of the Pakistan Army and the Pakistan Air Force, were martyred while over 75 were injured during the confrontation with India.</p>
<p>Gen Mirza noted that by those attacks, India had “crossed the threshold of disputed territory into the international border”.</p>
<p>He recalled that India’s strikes on Pakistan “disturbed the deterrence stability”, which had to be restored while remaining within the conventional domain. However, he added, strategic stability was still disturbed.</p>
<p>Highlighting the absence of a crisis management mechanism, “jingoistic” role of Indian media and its leadership’s mindset, he said, “Had there been no third party mediation, it would have gone to the next levels.”</p>
<p>The top general mentioned the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">United States</a>, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as the “interlocutors”.</p>

<p>Speaking on crisis management in Asia-Pacific, CJCSC Mirza termed it the “geopolitical cockpit of the 21st century”. “Its trajectories will shape the security architecture not only for this region but for the world.”</p>
<p>Offering eight observations, he stated that the crisis management debate in the Asia-Pacific must also focus on South Asia, adding that structures holding the modern state system were losing vitality.</p>
<p>He also called for institutionalised protocols, inclusion of key stakeholders and peaceful dispute resolution; highlighted the importance of communication; and stressed that emerging technologies compress the decision space.</p>
<p>“Misconception, narrative warfare and information distortion are the oxygen for escalation. We must disarm not only militarily but rhetorically,” Gen Mirza observed. “Power and interests, not morality or principles, now reign supreme.”</p>
<p>On the challenges faced by the Asia-Pacific, CJCSC Mirza made four observations, one being: “Asia-Pacific today appears to be descending into an extended era of great power contestation and strategic uncertainties.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He further pointed out that the Asia-Pacific direly needed an “institutional security architecture organic to the region itself”, which was missing as it had “largely been guided by extra-regional powers”.</p>
<p>On South Asia, the CJCSC remarked: “A looming threat of a global scale resides.</p>
<p>“South Asian strategic outlook is shaped by competing interests of the global power play, complicated <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911193">Iran-West relations</a>, perpetual instability in Afghanistan, India-Pakistan-China equation and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900227">unresolved Kashmir dispute</a> that remains at the core of India-Pakistan dyad, leading to regional instability in the geostrategic realm.”</p></p>

            <p><p>India’s Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge has said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government had “misled the nation”, amid a furore about the now-acknowledged <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">aircraft losses</a> to Pakistan during the recent conflict.</p>
<p>The remarks come a day after India’s top general <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914500">confirmed</a> that his country’s fighter jets were downed by Pakistan but did not specify a number. That admission followed a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.facebook.com/pakistanstrategicforum/videos/attention-bjp-leader-subramanian-swamy-accepts-that-indian-air-force-lost-5x-fig/1016013560662216/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by Subrahmanyam Swamy, a member of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) but a staunch critic of the Indian premier, that Pakistan had downed five Indian planes.</p>
<p>“The Modi govt has misled the nation. The fog of war is now clearing,” Kharge wrote in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/kharge/status/1928783909946318854" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X.</p>

<p>He said that in the wake of the remarks made by India’s Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan in Singapore during an interview, there were some very important questions which needed to be asked.</p>
<p>“These can only be asked if a Special Session of the Parliament is immediately convened,” he said.</p>
<p>“The Congress party demands a comprehensive review of defence preparedness by an independent expert committee, on the lines of the Kargil review committee,” he added.</p>
<p>Congress leader and Telangana Minister Uttam Reddy separately demanded transparency from the Indian government to reveal the extent of losses, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/india/modi-govt-should-come-clean-on-military-losses-suffered-during-op-sindoor-congress-amid-cds-chauhans-remark-3565775" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deccan Herald</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>“The fact that the fighter aircraft were downed is something that the government needs to stop denying. The CDS himself mentioned that. “Earlier Air Marshal Bharti had mentioned it indirectly in his briefing along with the DGMO,” Reddy, himself a former air force pilot, was quoted as having said.</p>
<p>Indian fighter jets were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">shot down</a> by the Pakistan Air Force on the night of May 6-7 in response to the Indian Air Force’s late-night missile strikes at six Pakistani sites, including Subhan Mosque in Bahawalpur’s Ahmedpur East, Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad, Abbas Mosque in Kotli, Umalkura Mosque in Muridke, the village of Kotki Lohara in Sialkot district, and Shakargarh.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911307">took down</a> six Indian jets, including three advanced French Rafale planes. According to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911123"><em>Dawn.com</em> report</a>, the recent clash between India and Pakistan marks a significant development in the regional air power constellation. Three Rafales, one Su-30MKI, one Mirage 2000 and one MiG-29 were downed within a 40-minute span. Not one Pakistani jet crossed the border or engaged in close combat.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909476/at-least-29-drones-neutralised-by-pakistan-so-far-dg-ispr">intercepting drones</a> sent by India on May 8 and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases on the night of May 9-10, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910113/world-community-hails-ceasefire-decision-between-pakistan-and-india">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>The US-brokered ceasefire had brought a halt to a week of record escalation between Pakistan and India as the latter took a series of unprovoked military actions despite Islamabad’s call for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a> into India’s allegations over the Pahalgam attack.</p>

<p>BJP legislator Ranbir Pathania questioned the role of Indian Air Force (IAF) personnel at the Udhampur base in Indian-occupied Kashmir during Operation Sindoor, allegedly used derogatory words against them, Indian outlet <em>The Telegraph</em> reported.</p>
<p>The BJP defended the legislator, saying his statement has been twisted, while Congress has asked the party to apologise. Pathania also issued a video statement, denying the use of foul language against the force.</p>
<p>In a video uploaded by Congress, Pathania appears to be ridiculing the IAF at Udhampur for its performance during Operation Sindoor. “Everybody knows what happened at the air force station, it was their incompetence; they were sleeping. What is our fault? We have held them in very high esteem,” a man purportedly Pathania can be heard saying.</p>
<p>The BJP leader denied abusing soldiers, saying he is proud of the army and his video had been edited. However, he defended his stand against the IAF’s land acquisition in the area.</p>
<p>The Congress said the statement was shameful and reprehensible, saying it was “an insult to our army and our brave soldiers.”</p>
<p>It added, “The BJP should apologise to the entire country and the army on this matter and should dismiss Ranbir Pathania from his post. If the BJP does not take any action against its MLA, then it will be considered as the thinking and statement of Narendra Modi and the BJP.”</p>
<p>Pathania on Wednesday joined a protest in a village in Udhampur, where he accused the IAF and the local administration of violating the legal rights of landowners by taking over their land without paying any compensation. He said notices had been issued to locals asking them to vacate the land.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Punjab home department has banned the operation of temporary mechanical rides installed during Eidul Azha holidays, fairs, festivals and other seasonal events for a short period of time at any location of the province, according to a notification issued on Sunday.</p>
<p>In the past, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1420339">several accidents</a> have been reported due to malfunctioning and falling mechanical rides, resulting in the loss of lives, including children, and injuries to several other riders. Such incidents were reported at amusement and water parks in different cities, including Lahore and Multan, in the province.</p>
<p>Mechanical ride accidents are generally reported during Eid holidays or Christmas holidays, as more families visit amusement parks with their children to enjoy the rides.</p>
<p>A notification issued today by the Punjab home department said that temporary mechanical rides typically setup or installed during Eidul Azha holidays, fairs, festivals, and other seasonal events for a short period of time “shall not to be allowed to operate at any location of Punjab on the eve of Eidul Azha 2025.”</p>
<p>However, mechanical rides installed on a permanent basis at different amusement parks, theme parks and play areas “will be allowed to operate, subject to the provision of a fitness certificate by the owners/operators of mechanical rides.</p>
