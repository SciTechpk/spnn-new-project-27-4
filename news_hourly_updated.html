                <h2>Not a shred of evidence provided by India for baseless allegations against Pakistan: DG ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry,  on Tuesday said that India hadn’t provided a “shred of evidence for its baseless allegations” against Pakistan concerning the Pahalgam attack, adding that India was involved in “undertaking cross-border terrorism inside Pakistan.”</p>
<p>Relations between Pakistan and India have plummeted to their lowest level in years following the April 22 attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">killed 26 men</a>, mostly tourists, and was one of the deadliest armed attacks on civilians in the disputed Himalayan region since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front, said it “unequivocally” denied involvement in the attack, after an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=The%20Resistance%20Front%E2%80%99%2C%20is%20said%20to%20have%20claimed%20responsibility%20for%20the%20attack.">initial message</a> that claimed responsibility.</p>

<ul>
<li>Says India has not provided evidence for “baseless allegations” against Pakistan</li>
<li>Says India has been found operating a terror network inside Pakistan targeting not only military but also innocent civilians</li>
<li>Says forensic analysis of retrieved materials shows “irrefutable evidence” of Indian terrorism</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Following the incident, New Delhi, without providing any evidence, implied Pakistan backed the attackers — an allegation that Islamabad has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">strongly denied</a>. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a> into the incident.</p>
<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry said that seven days had passed since the Pahalgam incident but, so far, India had not provided a “shred of evidence” for its “baseless allegations” against Pakistan.</p>
<p>“We will present to you how India has been found to operate a terror network inside Pakistan in which explosives, IEDs (improvised explosive devices) and other materials are being provided to terrorists to target not only military but also innocent civilians,” he said.</p>

<p>The army’s spokesperson said the evidence he was presenting was just “one small part” of India’s “state-sponsored terrorism”.</p>
<p>“Four days ago, on April 25, an Indian-trained and sponsored terrorist, who was a Pakistani citizen, was arrested near the Jhelum bus stand from whom one IED, two mobile phones, and Rs70,000 were recovered,” he said, adding that further investigation yielded an Indian-origin drone from his house along with Rs1 million in cash.</p>
<p>The DG ISPR said that a forensic analysis of the retrieved materials showed “irrefutable” evidence that could be examined by any credible independent agency.</p>
<p>“The handler was a junior commissioned officer (JCO) of the Indian army, Subedar Sukvinder,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. “The Indian officer had sent an IED and instructed the terrorist to collect it from a point.</p>
<p>“The evidence I’m putting forth before you [shows] how India is carrying out terrorism in Pakistan [through] serving officers and JCOs of the Indian army.”</p>
<p>He said further forensic analysis showed the involvement of four Indian army officials in the situation: Major Sandeep Verma alias Sameer, the main handler and a commanding officer of the Indian army in occupied Kashmir; Subedar Sukvinder alias Sikander; Havildar Amit alias Adil Aman: and another Indian soldier.</p>
<p>He said that Major Sandeep had hired terrorist Abdul Majeed and aired an alleged audio exchange between the two discussing the mode of payment.</p>
<p>“Just see, just hear what is being said by an Indian serving major. He is saying that ‘we conduct terrorism from Balochistan to Lahore’; He is telling the details of entry and how terror financing is carried out,” Chaudhry added.</p>
<p>The DG ISPR said the audio clip was “what you call irrefutable evidence of state-sponsored terrorism” collected from just one terrorist cell that the military was putting forth in today’s press conference.</p>
<p>Chaudhry said the Indian-trained terrorist had carried out four acts of militancy through IED attacks and that the IEDs were transported through drones.</p>
<p>He added that it was not the Indian intelligence agency RAW but the Indian army that was doing such activities of state-sponsored terrorism.</p>
<p>“The terrorist’s fourth attack took place after the Pahalgam incident,” he said, adding that a location near Nadala was shared with Majeed to retrieve the IED on April 22 and carry out the attack the next day at a populated bus stand.“</p>
<p>The DG ISPR said the terrorist was apprehended on April 25.</p>
<p>“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he said, using the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>This, he said, was manifested two nights back when security forces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906939/54-terrorists-killed-as-infiltration-attempt-thwarted-in-kp-ispr">killed 54 terrorists</a> attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district.</p>
<p>DG ISPR said the total number of terrorists killed was 71 so far after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907126/security-forces-neutralise-17-more-terrorists-operating-on-behest-of-indian-masters-ispr">17 more were taken out later</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the Pakistan Army <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907326/pakistan-shoots-down-indian-quadcopter-violating-airspace-near-loc">shot down</a> an Indian quadcopter drone near the Line of Control (LoC) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, state media reported. The development came as Indian and Pakistani soldiers <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906606/friends-offer-to-help-calm-south-asian-tempers#:~:text=troops%20exchanged%20fire%20overnight%20across%20the%20Line%20of%20Control%20(LoC)%20in%20Kashmir">reportedly traded</a> fire along the Line of Control for a fifth straight night, after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1609468">four years</a> of relative calm.</p>
<p>Separately, speaking about the situation at the border, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that “everything is being monitored,: stating that if an incursion were to take place, then Pakistan would “respond accordingly”.</p>
<p>Responding to a question about whether the rise in tension had something to do with the elections in India, the interior minister said that the Indian government had “many motives”.</p>

<p>Earlier today, the Pakistan Mission to the United Nations said the country had “credible evidence” proving that the Jaffer Express attack was “externally sponsored by its regional adversaries”, according to a press release issued today.</p>
<p>The Jaffar Express train was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897237/rescue-operation-for-hostages-underway-after-terrorists-attack-jaffar-express-in-balochistan">hijacked</a> on March 11 when Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) terrorists ambushed the Peshawar-bound train carrying 440 passengers, opening fire and taking hostages.</p>
<p>Security forces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419">launched</a> a two-day operation, concluding on March 12.

                <h2>India gives army ‘operational freedom’ to respond to Pahalgam attack</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given India’s military “operational freedom” to respond to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir last week, a senior government source told <em>AFP</em> on Tuesday, after New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">blamed</a> it on arch-rival Pakistan, albeit without proof.</p>
<p>A week after the deadliest attack on civilians in the contested region in years, Modi on Tuesday held a closed-door meeting with army and security chiefs, during which he told the armed forces that they had the “complete operational freedom to decide on the mode, targets and timing of our response to the terror attack”, said the government source, who was not authorised to speak to the media.</p>
<p>The government released video images of a stern-faced Modi meeting with army chiefs, as well as Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.</p>
<p>Also on Tuesday, India’s army said it had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907094/china-urges-india-pakistan-to-exercise-restraint-after-pahalgam-attack#:~:text=The%20statement%20came%20after%20Pakistan%20and%20India%20reportedly%20exchanged%20gunfire%20for%20a%20fourth%20night%20in%20a%20row%20across%20the%20LoC%2C%20after%20four%20years%20of%20relative%20calm.">repeatedly traded gunfire</a> with Pakistani troops across the Line of Control (LoC). The two neighbours have been trading fire across the LoC for five days now, with each blaming the other for provocation.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Army did not confirm the shooting, but state media reported on Tuesday it had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907326/pakistan-shoots-down-indian-quadcopter-violating-airspace-near-loc">shot down an Indian drone</a>, calling it a violation of its airspace.</p>
<p>It did not say when the incident happened, and there was no comment from New Delhi.</p>
<p>India alleged the “Pakistan Army resorted to unprovoked small arms firing across the LoC” overnight from Monday to Tuesday, the fifth night in a row that fire was exchanged there.</p>
<p>The Indian army said its troops had “responded in a measured and effective manner to the provocation”. There were no reports of casualties.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#pm-shehbaz-urges-un-chief-to-counsel-india-to-exercise-restraint" id="pm-shehbaz-urges-un-chief-to-counsel-india-to-exercise-restraint" title="Permalink"></a>PM Shehbaz urges UN chief to ‘counsel India’ to ‘exercise restraint’</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres held calls today with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and India’s foreign minister to express “deep concern at rising tensions”, his spokesman said.</p>
<p>The UN chief “underscored the need to avoid a confrontation that could result in tragic consequences. He offered his good offices to support de-escalation efforts”, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.</p>
<p>During the telephone call, the prime minister affirmed that Pakistan condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, while highlighting the significant sacrifices rendered by the country in the global war against terror.</p>
<p>While rejecting Indian accusations against Pakistan as “baseless”, the prime minister categorically rejected any attempt to link Pakistan with the Pahalgam incident and reiterated his call for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">transparent and neutral investigation</a> into the incident.</p>
<p>He expressed serious concerns over India’s attempts to delegitimise the Kashmiri freedom struggle by using the bogey of terrorism, as well as its widely documented state-sponsored terrorism in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>He particularly highlighted India’s weaponisation of the waters of the Indus Basin as unacceptable, while noting that water was the lifeline of 240 million people.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>While underscoring that Pakistan would defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity with full force in case of any misadventure by India, the prime minister encouraged the UN chief to counsel India to “act responsibly and exercise restraint”.</p>
<p>He emphasised that the unresolved issue of Jammu and Kashmir remained the root cause of instability in South Asia, and urged the UN chief to play his role for its just resolution, in accordance with relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>The prime minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering commitment towards fostering international peace and security as a responsible member of the international community and a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>The UN chief appreciated Pakistan’s efforts for peace in South Asia and said that the world could not afford any escalation in the region at the crucial time.</p>
<p>Relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours have plummeted after India accused Pakistan of backing an attack in occupied Kashmir on April 22 in which 26 men were killed.</p>
<p>Islamabad has rejected the charge and both countries have since exchanged gunfire and diplomatic barbs, as well as expelled citizens and ordered the main land border crossing shut.</p>
<p>Last week, Modi vowed to pursue those who carried out the attack in the tourist hotspot of Pahalgam and those who had supported it.</p>
<p>“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” he said on Thursday.</p>
<p>“We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth”.</p>
<p>The bellicose statements have prompted worries of a rapid spiral into military action, with several nations, including <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907094/china-urges-india-pakistan-to-exercise-restraint-after-pahalgam-attack">neighbouring China</a>, calling for restraint and dialogue.</p>
<p>Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their independence from British rule in 1947. Both claim the territory in full.</p>
<p>Freedom fighters in the Indian-occupied area have waged an insurgency since 1989, seeking independence or a merger with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Indian police have issued wanted posters for three men accused of carrying out the attack — two alleged Pakistanis and an Indian — who they claim are members of the Lashkar-i-Taiba group, a UN-designated terrorist organisation.</p>
<p>They have announced a two million rupee ($23,500) bounty for information leading to each man’s arrest and carried out sweeping detentions seeking anyone suspected of links to the alleged killers.</p>
<p>The worst attack in recent years in occupied Kashmir was at Pulwama in 2019, when a person rammed a car packed with explosives into a security forces convoy, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1463946">killing 40</a> and wounding 35.</p>
<p>Indian fighter jets <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1466038">carried out air strikes</a> on Pakistani territory 12 days later. The next day, Pakistan Air Force undertook strikes across the LoC from Pakistani airspace.</p>
<p>Iran has already offered to mediate and Saudi Arabia has said Riyadh was trying to “prevent an escalation”.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906480">downplayed tensions</a>, saying on Friday the dispute will get “figured out, one way or another”.</p></p>
