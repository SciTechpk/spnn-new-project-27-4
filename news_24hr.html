            <p><p>Pakistan has conducted a successful training launch of the Abdali Weapon System, a surface-to-surface missile with a range of 450 kilometres, the military’s media affairs wing said on Saturday.</p>
<p>“The launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile’s advanced navigation system and enhanced maneuverability features,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release.</p>
<p>It noted that the launch was a part of “Ex Indus” and was witnessed by the commander of the Army Strategic Forces Command (AFSC), senior officials from the Strategic Plans Division and the AFSC, as well as scientists and engineers from Pakistan’s strategic organisations.</p>
<p>The ISPR also released a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/GovtofPakistan/status/1918574501459100072" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> of the successful launch.</p>

<p>President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza and the services chiefs extended their congratulations to the participating troops, scientists, and engineers, the ISPR said.</p>
<p>“They expressed complete confidence in the operational preparedness and technical proficiency of Pakistan’s Strategic Forces to ensure credible minimum deterrence and safeguard national security against any aggression,” the statement added.</p>
<p>The test launch comes amid heightened tensions between nuclear powers Pakistan and India in the wake of New Delhi’s aggressive measures in the wake of a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.</p>

<p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir on Thursday asserted that any “misadventure” by India would be met with a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907785/any-military-misadventure-by-india-will-be-met-with-swift-resolute-notch-up-response-coas">swift, resolute and notch-up response</a>”. The next day, the army’s top brass also warned India of a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war">sure and decisive</a>” response should it attempt to impose war.</p>

            <p><p>Pakistan’s envoy to the United States has called on the global community to resolve the Kashmir dispute, terming it the “core issue” of the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284/trade-ties-and-flights-off-limits-as-pakistan-retaliates-to-indias-moves">complete breakdown</a> of ties with India in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.</p>

<p>“It could be an important part of President [Donald] Trump’s legacy to attend to this situation — not with a Band-Aid solution, but by addressing the core issue: the Kashmir dispute,” Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855847">Rizwan Saeed Sheikh</a> said in an interview with <em>Fox News Digital</em> published earlier today.</p>
<p>“This is one nuclear flashpoint,” the envoy said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Sheikh’s statement echoes his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907760/pm-shehbaz-thanks-china-for-endorsing-pakistans-proposal-of-neutral-probe-into-pahalgam-attack#:~:text=Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20envoy%20calls%20on%20Trump%20to%20ease%20tensions%20with%20India%3A%20report">recent call to Trump</a> to step in and help ease soaring tensions with India. He had highlighted that as a president “standing for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration”, there was no “higher or flashier flashpoint” than the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>Trump, in his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=Overseas%20wars%20and%20plans%20for%20peace">inaugural speech</a> as the US president, had said: “My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.”</p>
<p>A ceasefire — which has since been broken — was secured between <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886289">Israel and Hamas</a> following Trump’s election, and he has also been engaging with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906950">Ukraine and Russia</a> to halt their war.</p>
<p>During his interview with <em>Fox News</em>, Sheikh also called on nations around the globe to help with a lasting settlement to the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>He said: “Previously, when the situation has been at this level or the tensions have escalated, the international community has attended to the situation, but taken their eyes [and] attention away, even before the situation could fully diffuse.</p>
<p>“This time, perhaps it would be […] timely in terms of the situation elsewhere on the globe, with similar instances, […] to perhaps not afford a Band-Aid solution, but to address the broader problem.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“Any misadventure or miscalculation can lead to a nuclear interface,” the ambassador was quoted as saying. “That is certainly not desirable in such a densely populated region.”</p>
<p>“We want a peaceful neighbourhood,” Sheikh emphasised, adding that Pakistan did not want any instability in the region.</p>
<p>However, he stressed, Pakistan’s desire for peace “should not in any way be misconstrued as a sign of weakness”. “We want peace with dignity.”</p>
<p>Sheikh described India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">response</a> to the Pahalgam attack as dangerously premature and inflammatory, according to the report.</p>
<p>The envoy reiterated Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s offer to hold a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral and transparent</a>” probe into the Pahalgam attack. He pointed out that both the investigation offer and Pakistan’s request for evidence linking it to the attack had gone “unanswered”.</p>
<p>“Within minutes of the attack, India began levelling accusations against Pakistan,” he said, noting that a post-investigation report was filed just 10 minutes after the incident occurred, despite the remote and rugged terrain near the scene.</p>
<p>The ambassador warned that the region was once again being held “hostage to the war of hysteria” by India’s government and media, who immediately “began beating war drums”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>On the allegations implied by India, which has not yet named Pakistan or any entity directly, Sheikh said the suspects were reportedly Indian nationals whose homes have already been raided.</p>
<p>He questioned why India is looking outside its borders rather than addressing “administrative inadequacies” in occupied Kashmir. He slammed India’s broader policies in held Kashmir, including the alleged settlement of non-residents into the region.</p>
<p>Speaking about India’s <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unilateral suspension</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a>, Ambassador Sheikh said: “That is as grossly illegal as it can get. This is one treaty that has withstood wars between India and Pakistan.”</p>
<p>Law Minister Azam Naz­eer Tarar said yesterday that Pakistan’s final response to India’s letters on the IWT <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908128/multiple-ministries-to-craft-pakistans-response-on-iwt">would be crafted</a> in consultation with all relevant ministries, including foreign affairs, water resources and law.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik has also said Islamabad would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907454">approach international forums</a>, including the World Bank that brokered it, regarding the treaty’s suspension.</p></p>

            <p><p>Five terrorists were killed and two were apprehended in three separate intelligence-based operations (IBOs) conducted by the security forces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Saturday.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>“Five <em>Khwarij</em> were sent to hell, while two were apprehended during three separate operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p><em>Khwarij</em> is a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna">term</a> the state uses to refer to terrorists.</p>
<p>In the first of the three operations, an IBO was conducted by the security forces in Bajaur District on the reported presence of terrorists.</p>
<p>“During the conduct of operation, [our] troops effectively engaged the <em>Khwarij</em> … and after an intense fire exchange, three <em>Khwarij</em>, including high-value target (HVT) <em>Kharji</em> Fareed Ullah, were sent to hell,” the statement added.</p>
<p>Another IBO was conducted in the general area of Dossali, North Waziristan District. “In [the] ensuing fire exchange, two <em>Khwarij</em> were effectively neutralised by the security forces,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p>In the third encounter that took place in Mohmand District, “security forces successfully busted a <em>Kharji</em> hideout and apprehended two terrorists, including HVT <em>Kharji</em> Lal Ameer Ibrahim,” the statement continued.</p>
<p>Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from these men, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities.</p>
<p>“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Late last month, security forces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906939/54-terrorists-killed-as-infiltration-attempt-thwarted-in-kp-ispr">killed</a> 54 terrorists attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district, the military’s media wing said.</p>
<p>Militant violence and security operations intensified in the country in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901722/militant-attacks-in-march-surged-to-highest-level-since-2014">report</a> by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.</p>
<p>Pakistan ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p></p>
