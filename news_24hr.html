            <p><p>Three children were among five dead, while several others were injured when a bus carrying students was targeted in a blast in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district on Wednesday morning, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.</p>
<p>“In yet another cowardly and ghastly attack planned and orchestrated by terrorist state of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">India</a> and executed by its proxies in Balochistan, innocent school-going children’s bus was targeted today in Khuzdar,” a statement by the ISPR read.</p>
<p>“As per the initial reports, three innocent children and two adults have embraced martyrdom and multiple children have sustained injuries,” the press release added.</p>
<p>“After having miserably failed in the battlefield, through these most heinous and cowardly such like acts, Indian proxies have been unleashed to spread terror and unrest in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the ISPR said.</p>

<p>“Indian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians,” the statement said.</p>
<p>It noted that India had “failed” in Pakistan’s Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent conflict, and its [proxies] were “being hunted [down] by military and law enforcement agencies”.</p>
<p>“Use of terrorism as a state policy by [the] Indian political government is abhorrent and reflective of their low morality and disregard of <em>[sic]</em> basic human norms,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p>“Planners, abettors and executors of this cowardly Indian sponsored attack will be hunted down and brought to justice and [the] heinous face of India will be exposed in front of the entire world,” the military vowed.</p>
<p>Pakistan Armed Forces, with the support of the brave Pakistani nation, stand “united to uproot Indian sponsored terrorism from Pakistan in all its manifestations”, the ISPR said.</p>
<p>Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">accused India</a> of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan.</p>
<p>He had detailed the arrest of a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India as “irr­e­futable evidence” of state-sponsored terrorism directed by Ind­ian military personnel.</p>
<p>On Monday, the ISPR said <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005/3-terrorists-of-indian-proxy-blf-killed-in-balochistan-engagements-ispr">12 terrorists</a> of “Indian proxy” outfits were killed by security forces in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Deputy Commissioner Yasir Iqbal Dashti had told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the blast occurred when the school bus was near the <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/o5j2xJxqzLLkz6mbA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Khuzdar Zero Point</a>.</p>
<p>The bodies and the injured were taken to the Khuzdar CMH, from where the seriously injured would be referred to medical facilities in Quetta and Karachi, the DC said.</p>
<p>Police, the Frontier Corps (FC) and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel have reached the site of the incident to collect evidence for an investigation.</p>
<p>While a probe was underway, the DC said preliminary findings indicated that the attack was a suicide blast.</p>

<p>Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind denounced the attack as the “hideous face of Indian state-sponsored terrorism”, as well as a “cowardly and inhumane act”.</p>
<p>In a statement, Rind echoed the ISPR’s stance, saying that India was “creating instability in Balochistan to hide its failures”. He called India’s “state-sponsored terrorism a threat to world peace.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi strongly condemned the “explosion inside the bus near Khuzdar Zero Point”.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MOIofficialGoP/status/1925053540763902171" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, he expressed deep sorrow and grief over the death of four children, and extended his condolences to their families.</p>
<p>“The beasts who target innocent children do not deserve any leniency. The enemy demonstrated barbarity by attacking innocent children,” Naqvi asserted.</p>
<p>“The attack on the school bus is a heinous conspiracy of the enemy to create instability in the country. With the unity of the nation, we will foil every conspiracy,” the interior minister vowed.</p>
<p>Naqvi also prayed for the speedy recovery of the wounded.</p>

<p>Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti vowed that they will not only expose every terrorist operating in the province,  but also “eradicate them completely”.</p>
<p>“Following the success of Operation [Bunyanum Marsoos] and India’s disgraceful defeat, they have now resorted to cowardly and shameful tactics,” he wrote on X.</p>

<p>Later while talking to the media, Bugti said they had solid information that Ajit Doval, the Indian national security adviser, was planning something in Balochistan but did not expect him to target children.</p>
<p>“We had intelligence regarding this but to target innocent children, this is [India’s cowardice.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and agreed to extend the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>On Monday, Deputy PM Dar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911977">arrived</a> in China’s capital of Beijing on a three-day official visit at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Yi amid regional tensions. The trilateral forum was established in 2017, with earlier meetings held in Beijing and the Afghan capital.</p>
<p>China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/dar-appreciates-china-for-backing-pakistans-sovereignty">said</a> on Tuesday that it supports Pakistan in defending “national sovereignty and territorial integrity”, after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910060/us-president-trump-says-india-pakistan-have-agreed-to-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> ended four days of fighting with India over a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>“Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar Member of the Communist Party of China Political Bureau &amp; Foreign Minister of the People’s Republic of China Wang Yi, and Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan Amir Khan Muttaqi, held an informal trilateral meeting in Beijing today,” the statement by the Foreign Office said.</p>

<p>“They agreed to deepen Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation and extend the CPEC to Afghanistan,” the FO added.</p>
<p>The three foreign ministers reaffirmed trilateral cooperation as a vital platform to promote regional security and economic connectivity, the statement continued.</p>
<p>“It was agreed that the 6th Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Meeting will be held in Kabul at an early, mutually convenient date,” according to the FO.</p>
<p>The foreign ministers discussed enhancing diplomatic engagement, strengthening communications, and taking practical steps to boost trade, infrastructure, and development as key drivers of shared prosperity.</p>
<p>The ministers underscored their shared commitment to countering terrorism and fostering stability and development in the region.</p>

<p>Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu has commended China’s role in assisting Pakistan’s defence modernisation and technological advancement, state-owned <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>During a meeting with Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong, who called on him in Islamabad, the air chief expressed his profound gratitude to China for its continued support and unwavering friendship.</p>
<p>He emphasised that the bond between both countries has only strengthened over the decades and will continue to deepen through future cooperation and partnership.</p>
<p>They held comprehensive and in-depth discussion on a range of matters including corporate-level engagements, defence cooperation and the evolving geostrategic environment in the region.</p>
<p>The dignitaries underscored the importance of cohesive and collaborative approaches in responding to emerging challenges, emphasising the necessity of maintaining peak operational readiness and swift coordination amidst the prevailing regional security dynamics.</p>
<p>They reaffirmed their pledge to institutionalise regular high-level exchanges through expanded joint operational exercises and exploration of multilateral frameworks that bolster collective response mechanisms to emerging threats.</p>

            <p><p>Pakistan’s ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh hailed the potential of Starlink services — soon to be functional in the country — as a means to bridge Pakistan’s digital divide during a visit to SpaceX headquarters in Los Angeles, <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Starlink Services, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, is one of the most technologically advanced companies globally among those providing internet via low-Earth orbit satellites. Last month, the Federal Minister for IT and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902731">announced</a> that Starlink services are expected to be operational in the country by the end of this year.</p>
<p>The ambassador, accompanied by a delegation, was briefed on the collaboration efforts between Pakistan and SpaceX, particularly how Starlink’s low-Earth orbit satellite infrastructure and SpaceX’s commercial capabilities held “transformative” potential for Pakistan’s digital landscape.</p>
<p>The delegation was received at SpaceX Headquarters by the vice-president of Starlink global business operations and the director of global business development, and provided a guided tour of the space giant’s headquarters.</p>
<p>During the visit, the two parties discussed efforts focused on “expanding broadband access and strengthening national connectivity, particularly in remote and underprivileged areas”, as per the report.</p>
<p>Ambassador Rizwan Saeed reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment towards promoting innovation through strategic international partnerships, hoping that such engagement would result in tangible cooperation in space technology, digital infrastructure, and commercial innovation.</p>
<p>The engagement is part of a series of efforts focused on strengthening ties between the private IT sectors of Pakistan and the US.</p>
<p>Last month, the IT minister announced that a provisional licence has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902838">granted</a> to Starlink to provide satellite-based internet services in the country, and services were expected to be available in the country by the end of this year. She also announced that a Chinese firm — Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology — has also applied for a satellite-based internet licence, adding that, “the government is encouraging competition in the sector.”</p></p>
