            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923476/bodies-of-slain-passengers-in-balochistan-bus-killing-sent-to-punjab-hometowns-official' target='_blank'><strong>Bodies of slain passengers in Balochistan bus killing sent to Punjab hometowns: official</strong></a>
            <p><p>The bodies of nine bus passengers who were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923411/armed-men-kidnap-and-kill-nine-passengers-in-balochistan">kidnapped and killed</a> in Balochistan’s Sardhaka area last night were recovered and transported to their hometowns in Punjab on Friday morning, officials said.</p>
<p>On Thursday night, at least nine passengers travelling on two Punjab-bound coaches were abducted and killed by unidentified armed men in the Sur-Dakai area, situated on the border between Balochistan’s Zhob and Loralai districts, Assistant Comm­issioner Naveed Alam said a day ago.</p>
<p>Provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind also confirmed the incident and said that <em>Fitna-al-Hindu­stan</em>  — a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">term</a> the government uses for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan — had carried out attacks at three different places — Kakat, Mastung, and Sur-Dakai.</p>
<p>The Balochistan Liberation Front, a banned outfit, later claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group said it had killed the nine individuals after blocking the highway between Musakhail-Makhtar and Khajuri.</p>
<p>Alam told <em>Dawn.com</em> on Friday that the bodies of all nine passengers were handed over to a political agent in the Sakhi Sarwar district of Dera Ghazi Khan to be handed over to their families.</p>
<p>He said that seven of the passengers had been identified but two could not be identified due to a lack of documents.</p>
<p>“The terrorists must have taken the passengers’ identification documents with them,” AC Alam said.</p>
<p>Of the seven passengers identified, two were residents of Lodhran, while one passenger each were residents of Dera Ghazi Khan, Gujrat, Attock, Khanewal and Gujranwala.</p>
<p>The country’s top leaders strongly condemned the incident and vowed action against the perpetrators “at all costs”.</p>
<p>In a statement today, President Asif Ali Zardari said: “This barbarity is part of <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>’s evil conspiracy to spill blood in Pakistan,” state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed commitment to “clear the land of <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> and its facilitators at all costs”.</p>
<p>Similarly, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in a statement issued by his office: “We will deal with terrorists with full force. The blood of innocent people will be avenged.”</p>
<p>The premier added that the killing of unarmed civilians was a blatant act of terrorism by <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>.</p>
<p>“With resolve, unity, and strength, we will confront the scourge of terrorism and uproot it completely,” the prime minister said.</p>
<p>Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also strongly condemned the incident, calling it “blatant terrorism”.</p>
<p>“The killing of innocent civilians based on Pakistani identity is an unforgivable crime,” Bugti said, vowing that the response would be “severe”.</p>
<p>“The terrorists have proven that they are not human beings, but cowardly beasts,” he said, adding that the state “would not even let these murderers hide underground.”</p>
<p>The chief minister added: “All networks of terrorists who are the sponsors of <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> will be destroyed.”</p>
<p>Noting that this was a “state war”, he vowed decisive action.</p>
<p>CM Bugti further vowed to crush “every plan of terrorism” with strength, determination and unity. “Balochistan will become a graveyard for enemies.”</p>
<p>According to sources, two passenger coaches en route to Punjab were intercepted in the Sur-Dakai area near the N-70 highway, close to Dab — a place along the Loralai-Zhob border. A group of armed men had blocked the road and stopped the two vehicles.</p>
<p>The armed assailants boarded the coaches, checked the identity cards of passengers and forced 10 persons off the vehicles at gunpoint.</p>
<p>“They dragged out 10 passengers — seven from one coach and three from the other — and took them away (to an unknown place),” a surviving passenger told Levies. “I don’t know what they did to them, but I heard gunfire as we were leaving.”</p>
<p>After abducting the nine passengers, the assailants allowed both coaches to leave the area.</p>
<p>Security forces suspended traffic on the highway and began a large-scale search operation to locate the perpetrators.</p>
<p>According to sources, the attackers checked the national identity cards of all passengers and specifically targeted individuals with Punjab addresses. They also opened fire on the coaches during the abduction to prevent any escape.</p>
<p>In May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna-al-Hindu­stan</em>.</p>
<p>Balochistan has witnessed a spate of attacks targeting those hailing from Punjab. In two separate incidents in April 2024, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1827193">nine people</a> were killed after being forced off a bus near Noshki, while <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1830243">two labourers</a> from Punjab were shot in Kech.</p>
<p>In February, seven Punjab-bound passengers were offloaded from a bus and shot dead in Barkhan district. The incident came days after 12 were killed in a blast targeting a bus carrying coal miners in Harnai.</p>
<p>In May last year, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832433">seven barbers</a> from Punjab were shot dead near Gwadar, while August saw <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854830">23 travellers</a> offloaded from trucks and buses and shot in the Musakhail district.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923479/trump-threatens-canada-with-35pc-tariff-rate-starting-aug-1' target='_blank'><strong>Trump threatens Canada with 35pc tariff rate starting Aug 1</strong></a>
            <p><p>Canada will face a 35 per cent tariff on exports to the United States starting August 1, President Donald Trump said on Thursday in a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney.</p>
<p>It was the latest of more than 20 such letters issued by Trump since Monday, as he continues to pursue his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922611">trade war</a> threats against dozens of economies.</p>
<p>Canada and the US have been locked in trade negotiations in hopes of reaching a deal by July 21, but the latest threat appeared to have shifted that deadline.</p>
<p>Both Canada and Mexico are trying to find ways to satisfy Trump so that the free trade deal uniting the three countries — known as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1448743">USMCA</a> — can be put back on track.</p>
<p>“Throughout the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses.</p>
<p>We will continue to do so as we work towards the revised deadline of August 1,“ Carney posted on the social media platform X Thursday night.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement replaced the previous NAFTA accord in July 2020, after Trump successfully pushed for a renegotiation during his first term in office.</p>
<p>It was due to be reviewed by July next year, but Trump has thrown the process into disarray by launching his trade wars after he took office in January.</p>
<p>Canadian and Mexican products were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896198">initially</a> hard hit by 25pc US tariffs, with a lower rate for Canadian energy.</p>
<p>Trump targeted both neighbours, saying they did not do enough on illegal immigration and the flow of illicit drugs across borders.</p>
<p>But he eventually announced exemptions for goods entering his country under the USMCA, covering large swaths of products.</p>
<p>The letter on Thursday came despite what had been warming relations between Trump and Carney, who has been faced with his counterpart’s regular musings that Canada should become the 51st US state.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#reciprocity" id="reciprocity" title="Permalink"></a>Reciprocity</h2>
<p>The Canadian leader came to the White House on May 6 and had a cordial <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908949">meeting</a> with Trump in the Oval Office.</p>
<p>They met again at the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920819/g7-agrees-to-avoid-higher-taxes-for-us-companies">G7 summit</a> last month in Canada, where leaders pushed Trump to back away from his punishing trade war.</p>
<p>Canada also agreed to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920614/trump-ends-trade-talks-with-canada-over-tax-on-us-tech-firms">rescind</a> taxes impacting US tech firms that had prompted Trump to retaliate by calling off trade talks.</p>
<p>Separately, Trump announced in an interview with <em>NBC</em> that he was also thinking of slapping blanket tariffs of between 15pc and 20pc on August 1 on countries that had not yet received one of his letters.</p>
<p>The letters announce tariff rates of as much as 50pc in the case of Brazil to kick in on August 1 unless better terms can be found before then.</p>
<p>Trump told <em>NBC</em> that the letter to the 27-country European Union, the US’s biggest trading partner, would be sent “today or tomorrow (Friday).”</p>
<p>Brazilian President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva said on Thursday that he is willing to negotiate with the United States after Trump said he would hit the country with his tough tariff.</p>
<p>He, however, reiterated that the Brazilian government is evaluating reciprocity measures. In his letter addressed to Lula, Trump criticised the treatment of his right-wing ally Jair Bolsonaro.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923483/musks-tesla-marks-formal-india-entry-with-mumbai-launch-event' target='_blank'><strong>Musk’s Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event</strong></a>
            <p><p>Tesla will open its first India showroom in Mumbai next week, having imported $1 million worth of cars and merchandise, marking its entry into the world’s third-largest car market despite CEO Elon Musk’s complaints about high import tariffs.</p>
<p>In an invitation to the media on Thursday, the carmaker said the July 15 event was the “launch of Tesla in India through the opening of the Tesla experience centre at Bandra Kurla Complex,” located in the city’s leading commercial business district.</p>
<p>Grappling with excess manufacturing capacity at its other factories and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901658">falling sales</a>, Tesla has pivoted to selling imported cars in India, on which it will need to pay about 70 per cent import duty and other levies.</p>
<p>Commercially available custom records from January to June showed Tesla imported vehicles, chargers and accessories into India worth close to $1m, mainly from China and the United States.</p>
<p>The vehicles included six of Tesla’s best-selling Model Y at a shipment value of $32,500 each for five cars, and $46,000 for the long-range version, as well as several Superchargers.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has for years <a class="link--external" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/26/modi-wants-tesla-to-build-cars-in-india-making-the-plan-work-may-not-be-easy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wooed</a> Tesla, including forming a new policy to attract the carmaker to build its EVs locally.</p>
<p>Last year, Musk had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1827140">planned</a> to visit India, where he was expected to announce an investment of $2 billion to $3 billion, including in local EV manufacturing. But he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1828591">cancelled</a> the trip at the last moment. Tesla has conveyed that it is not interested in manufacturing in India at the moment.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-unfair-us-if-musk-builds-factory-india-2025-02-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has said</a> that if Tesla were to build a factory in India to circumvent that country’s tariffs, it would be “unfair” to the US. Tesla has hired for several of the three dozen positions it advertised in India earlier this year, bringing on board store managers, sales and service executives. It is looking for supply chain engineers and vehicle operators for its autopilot ambitions.</p></p>
