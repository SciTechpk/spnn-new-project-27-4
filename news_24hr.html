            <p><p>Three children were among five dead, while several others were injured when a bus carrying students was targeted in a blast in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district on Wednesday morning, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.</p>
<p>“In yet another cowardly and ghastly attack planned and orchestrated by terrorist state of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">India</a> and executed by its proxies in Balochistan, innocent school-going children’s bus was targeted today in Khuzdar,” a statement by the ISPR read.</p>
<p>“As per the initial reports, three innocent children and two adults have embraced martyrdom and multiple children have sustained injuries,” the press release added.</p>
<p>“After having miserably failed in the battlefield, through these most heinous and cowardly such like acts, Indian proxies have been unleashed to spread terror and unrest in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the ISPR said.</p>

<p>“Indian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians,” the statement said.</p>
<p>It noted that India had “failed” in Pakistan’s Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent conflict, and its [proxies] were “being hunted [down] by military and law enforcement agencies”.</p>
<p>“Use of terrorism as a state policy by [the] Indian political government is abhorrent and reflective of their low morality and disregard of <em>[sic]</em> basic human norms,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p>“Planners, abettors and executors of this cowardly Indian sponsored attack will be hunted down and brought to justice and [the] heinous face of India will be exposed in front of the entire world,” the military vowed.</p>
<p>Pakistan Armed Forces, with the support of the brave Pakistani nation, stand “united to uproot Indian sponsored terrorism from Pakistan in all its manifestations”, the ISPR said.</p>
<p>Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">accused India</a> of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan.</p>
<p>He had detailed the arrest of a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India as “irr­e­futable evidence” of state-sponsored terrorism directed by Ind­ian military personnel.</p>
<p>On Monday, the ISPR said <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005/3-terrorists-of-indian-proxy-blf-killed-in-balochistan-engagements-ispr">12 terrorists</a> of “Indian proxy” outfits were killed by security forces in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Deputy Commissioner Yasir Iqbal Dashti had told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the blast occurred when the school bus was near the <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/o5j2xJxqzLLkz6mbA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Khuzdar Zero Point</a>.</p>
<p>The bodies and the injured were taken to the Khuzdar CMH, from where the seriously injured would be referred to medical facilities in Quetta and Karachi, the DC said.</p>
<p>Police, the Frontier Corps (FC) and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel have reached the site of the incident to collect evidence for an investigation.</p>
<p>While a probe was underway, the DC said preliminary findings indicated that the attack was a suicide blast.</p>

<p>Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind denounced the attack as the “hideous face of Indian state-sponsored terrorism”, as well as a “cowardly and inhumane act”.</p>
<p>In a statement, Rind echoed the ISPR’s stance, saying that India was “creating instability in Balochistan to hide its failures”. He called India’s “state-sponsored terrorism a threat to world peace.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi strongly condemned the “explosion inside the bus near Khuzdar Zero Point”.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MOIofficialGoP/status/1925053540763902171" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, he expressed deep sorrow and grief over the death of four children, and extended his condolences to their families.</p>
<p>“The beasts who target innocent children do not deserve any leniency. The enemy demonstrated barbarity by attacking innocent children,” Naqvi asserted.</p>
<p>“The attack on the school bus is a heinous conspiracy of the enemy to create instability in the country. With the unity of the nation, we will foil every conspiracy,” the interior minister vowed.</p>
<p>Naqvi also prayed for the speedy recovery of the wounded.</p>

            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and agreed to extend the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>On Monday, Deputy PM Dar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911977">arrived</a> in China’s capital of Beijing on a three-day official visit at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Yi amid regional tensions. The trilateral forum was established in 2017, with earlier meetings held in Beijing and the Afghan capital.</p>
<p>China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/dar-appreciates-china-for-backing-pakistans-sovereignty">said</a> on Tuesday that it supports Pakistan in defending “national sovereignty and territorial integrity”, after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910060/us-president-trump-says-india-pakistan-have-agreed-to-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> ended four days of fighting with India over a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>“Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar Member of the Communist Party of China Political Bureau &amp; Foreign Minister of the People’s Republic of China Wang Yi, and Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan Amir Khan Muttaqi, held an informal trilateral meeting in Beijing today,” the statement by the Foreign Office said.</p>

<p>“They agreed to deepen Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation and extend the CPEC to Afghanistan,” the FO added.</p>
<p>The three foreign ministers reaffirmed trilateral cooperation as a vital platform to promote regional security and economic connectivity, the statement continued.</p>
<p>“It was agreed that the 6th Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Meeting will be held in Kabul at an early, mutually convenient date,” according to the FO.</p>
<p>The foreign ministers discussed enhancing diplomatic engagement, strengthening communications, and taking practical steps to boost trade, infrastructure, and development as key drivers of shared prosperity.</p>
<p>The ministers underscored their shared commitment to countering terrorism and fostering stability and development in the region.</p>

<p>During a meeting with Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong, who called on him in Islamabad, the air chief expressed his profound gratitude to China for its continued support and unwavering friendship.</p>
<p>He emphasised that the bond between both countries has only strengthened over the decades and will continue to deepen through future cooperation and partnership.</p>
<p>They held comprehensive and in-depth discussion on a range of matters including corporate-level engagements, defence cooperation and the evolving geostrategic environment in the region.</p>
<p>The dignitaries underscored the importance of cohesive and collaborative approaches in responding to emerging challenges, emphasising the necessity of maintaining peak operational readiness and swift coordination amidst the prevailing regional security dynamics.</p>
<p>They reaffirmed their pledge to institutionalise regular high-level exchanges through expanded joint operational exercises and exploration of multilateral frameworks that bolster collective response mechanisms to emerging threats.</p>

<p>ISLAMABAD: The government on Tuesday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912186/cabinet-approves-coas-gen-asim-munirs-promotion-to-field-marshal">promoted</a> Chief of the Army Staff Gen Asim Munir to the rank of field marshal in recognition of his ‘strategic leadership and decisive role’ in defeating India in the conflict that started earlier this month following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam inci­dent</a> in India-occu­pied Kashmir.</p>
<p>“The Government of Pakistan has approved the promotion of General Syed Asim Munir (Nishan-e-Imtiaz, Military) to the rank of Field Marshal in recognition of his superior strategy and courageous lead­ership… (and) infli­cted a decisive defeat upon the enemy,” a statement read.</p>
<p>The elevation, first cleared by the federal cabinet and later communicated by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to President Asif Ali Zardari, marks the first such promotion in over six decades. Pakistan had a serving field marshal in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1355171#:~:text=MILITARY%20RULER%20GETS%20HIMSELF%20ELEVATED">1959</a>, when Ayub Khan, the-then military ruler, awarded himself the five-star title.</p>
<p>Shortly after the announcement, PM Sheh­baz <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/CMShehbaz/status/1924843057788211244" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on X, formerly Twitter, saying: “Under his command, our valiant armed forces staunchly defended Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity with unity, courage and the highest standards of military professionalism.”</p>

<p>Field Marshal Munir, who has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723789">serving</a> as the army chief since November 2022, accepted the elevation, saying, as per a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), that it was not a personal honour but a tribute to the entire armed forces and the people of Pakistan.</p>
<p><strong>Second extension for air chief</strong></p>
<p>The government also announced a second, open-ended extension in the tenure of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu.</p>
<p>His current extension, granted last year, expires in March. He becomes the first PAF chief to receive two extensions, a move that underscores the central role he played in the successful execution of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos from May 7 to 10. “The government has also unanimously decided to extend the tenure of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu upon the completion of his current term,” a statement by the PM’s Office said.</p>
<p><strong>Implications for military hierarchy</strong></p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir’s promotion has set off widespread speculation about its implications for Pakistan’s higher defence organisation (HDO), comprising the joint chiefs of staff committee (JCSC), headed by its chairman, and the three service chiefs (army, navy, air force).</p>
<p>While the five-star title is largely ceremonial, questions have also been raised about its impact on the civil-military balance, the operational command chain, and the defence leadership’s future.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In a symbolic gesture, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza issued a congratulatory message, which analysts viewed as signalling that he would continue in his current role, despite now being technically junior to a five-star service chief.</p>
<p>Among retired military officials and analysts, opinions are divided. Retired Lt Gen Naeem Khalid Lodhi, a former defence secretary and caretaker national security adviser, anticipated the creation of a long-proposed chief of defence staff (CDS) role, a concept first floated during Nawaz Sharif’s previous tenure. Under this structure, COAS Munir could serve both as COAS and CDS, further consolidating his authority, he believed.</p>
<p>Conversely, retired Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, also a former defence secretary, downplayed the prospects of any structural change. “The field marshal rank is ceremonial,” he said, adding that the COAS remained the most powerful operational position within the military hierarchy. “CDS is a coordinating role, not a command authority,” Mr Yasin noted, suggesting the existing setup would remain intact.</p>
<p>Both, however, foresee the creation of a position of the vice chief of army staff for a four-star general.</p>
<p><strong>Legal and constitutional ambiguities</strong></p>
<p>The promotion has also revived debates over the legal foundations of the field marshal rank in Pakistan, with some experts noting the silence of the Constitution and the <a class="link--external" href="https://pakistancode.gov.pk/pdffiles/administrator5a436c410d7fc88fc27dae7b864c6f63.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pakistan Army Act</a> on such an appointment.</p>
<p><a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part12.ch2.html#:~:text=Command%20of%20Armed%20Forces.%2D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Article 243</a> grants the president the authority to appoint service chiefs on the advice of the prime minister, but it does not mention five-star ranks. The 2024 amendment to the Army Act extended the COAS’s tenure to five years and removed retirement age limits for four-star generals.</p>
<p>A Ministry of Defence notification, however, said that the promotion had been made under Rule 199A of the Army Regulations (Rules) 1998. The rules are classified, but according to a military source, the mentioned rule reads: “199-A. Promotion to field marshal. A general officer, whether serving or retired, may be promoted to the rank of field marshal by the federal government without regard to seniority or any specific appointment.”</p>
<p>Military law expert retired colonel Inamur Raheem, when contacted for verification of the secretive rules, confirmed the wording of Rule 199A.</p>
<p><strong>A strategic signal</strong></p>
<p>While the rank does not grant additional operational authority, its conferral during a period of heightened regional tension carries strategic and political symbolism. It may also bolster Field Marshal Munir’s standing both within the military and in political circles, particularly amid ongoing internal instability and civil-military friction.</p>
<p>Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, who previously headed the Senate defence committee, noted that “Field Marshal Asim Munir is now very much in the driving seat as the pivot of the power structure, more so, given the weakness and divisions amongst the civilian politicians. Even before May, which has become an inflection point for Pakistan, for India and for South Asia, all the mainstream political forces were convinced that the road to Islamabad lies through Rawalpindi.”</p>
<p>Columnist and political analyst Abbas Nasir, while commenting on the political angle of the promotion, said, “As far as its domestic impact is concerned, by jumping the gun without evidence after the Pahalgam terror attack, the Modi government gifted Pakistan a considerable amount of unity as the country rallied behind the armed forces, setting aside internal political differences, disappointments.”</p>
<p>“Let’s see if national reconciliation is possible as a result of this Godsend or whether the country will revert to square one,” he worried.</p>
<p>Mr Nasir, while commenting on the move, said, “One only hopes that the world governments and media, which appeared to hyphenate Pakistan and India after years of lining up behind India and ap­p­eared to buy Islam­abad’s view largely, do not consider this a non-serious, or worse still belligerent, move.”</p>
<p><strong>Global context</strong></p>
<p>Pakistan’s only precedent for this move is Ayub Khan, whose 1959 elevation to the field marshal rank occurred amid his presidency and did not restructure the armed forces. Likewise, COAS Munir’s promotion is not expected to alter operational command but serves as a symbolic acknowledgement of his wartime leadership.</p>
<p>The global precedent supports this view. In India, Field Marshals Sam Manekshaw (1973) and K.M. Cariappa (1986) were promoted purely for ceremonial reasons, with no changes to the army’s structure. Similarly, in the United Kingdom and the United States, five-star titles have historically honoured extraordinary service during major wars without altering command frameworks.</p>
