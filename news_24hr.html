            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930219/govt-hails-hague-courts-award-saying-india-must-let-flow-waters-of-western-rivers-for-pakistans-unrestricted-use' target='_blank'><strong>Govt hails Hague court’s award saying India must ‘let flow’ waters of western rivers for Pakistan’s ‘unrestricted use’</strong></a>
            <p><p>The federal government on Monday welcomed the decision by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague to issue an “Award on Issues of General Interpretation of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT)” in the Indus Waters case, stating that India must generally “let flow” the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan’s “unrestricted use”.</p>
<p>India in April held the IWT <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">in abeyance</a> following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">termed</a> any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907454">considering</a> court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920611/pakistan-hails-hague-courts-supplemental-award-in-indus-waters-case-says-india-cant-sideline-arbitration-process">supplemental award</a> by the PCA in June held that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. India, in response, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920611/pakistan-hails-hague-courts-supplemental-award-in-indus-waters-case-says-india-cant-sideline-arbitration-process#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIndia%20has%20never,the%20ministry%20maintained.">did not recognise</a> the court or its decisions.</p>
<p>A press release issued <a class="link--external" href="https://docs.pca-cpa.org/2025/08/a4fbccca-2023-01-20250811-press-release.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">today</a> by the PCA said it rendered an award on Friday in an arbitration initiated by Pakistan against India on August 19, 2016, pursuant to Article IX and Annexure G to the IWT.</p>
<p>“This arbitration concerns the interpretation and application of the IWT to certain design elements of the run-of-river hydro-electric plants that India is permitted by the treaty to construct on the tributaries of the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab Rivers.”</p>
<p>Regarding the overall approach to Article 3 (provisions regarding western rivers) of the IWT, the award said: “The general rule is that India shall ‘let flow’ the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan’s unrestricted use.</p>
<p>“There are certain specified exceptions to this rule, including in relation to the generation of hydroelectric power, but these exceptions must be strictly construed: the design and operation of run-of-river hydroelectric plants must hew strictly to the requirements in the treaty, rather than to
what India might consider an ‘ideal’ or ‘best practices’ approach.”</p>
<p>It further noted that questions relating to the balance between the parties’ respective rights and obligations in this regard were to be identified and addressed through the treaty’s procedures for notification, objection and dispute resolution in furtherance of the treaty’s objective and its obligations of mutual cooperation.</p>

<p>The PCA said that to date, India had not participated in the arbitration proceedings and had repeatedly objected to the court’s competence of the court, adding that it had addressed the issue on various counts before.</p>
<p>“Throughout these proceedings, the court has ensured that India is fully informed in respect of the
proceedings and that the opportunity to participate remains open to it. Notwithstanding this, the court
has endeavoured to ascertain, understand, and consider India’s views, drawing on available materials,
including the records of the commission, correspondence between the parties, and/or submissions by
India in previous dispute resolution proceedings under the treaty,” the PCA said.</p>
<p>It added that it had also taken steps to test the accuracy of Pakistan’s claims, including by requesting further written submissions from Pakistan, by questioning Pakistan both before and during the hearing on the merits, by requesting that Pakistan produce historical evidence concerning the operation of the IWT and the Permanent Indus Commission, and by considering publicly available materials and jurisprudence not presented by Pakistan.</p>
<p>The PCA explained that the Aug 8 award addressed questions concerning the treaty’s overall interpretation and application, including in relation to Article 3 and Paragraph 8 of Annexure D (which concerns new run-of-river hydro-electric plants that India may construct on the western rivers).</p>
<p>“The award also addresses a related question on the legal effect of decisions issued by dispute resolution bodies under the treaty (namely, courts of arbitration and neutral experts),” the PCA press release said.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930217/foreign-office-slams-indias-mea-for-twisting-coas-asim-munirs-remarks' target='_blank'><strong>Foreign Office slams India’s MEA for ‘twisting’ COAS Asim Munir’s remarks</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Monday castigated India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) for “distorting” and “twisting” remarks made by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir during his recent visit to the United States.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir on Sunday completed his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930030/coas-says-india-wont-be-allowed-to-choke-indus-river">second high-profile trip</a> to the US in less than two months. Like his previous visit, he engaged with both political and military leadership in the host country. In Tampa, Florida, the army chief attended the US Central Command’s (Centcom) change of command ceremony.</p>
<p>His most closely watched appearance came later at a black-tie dinner hosted by Adnan Asad, Pakistan’s honorary consul in Tampa. The event was attended by about 150 guests, including Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Ambassador Rizwan Shaikh, embassy officials, and prominent members of the diaspora.</p>
<p>Comments Field Marshal Munir reportedly made at the event were later picked up and, according to the FO, distorted by Indian media outlets. Responding to Indian media reports, the MEA had said earlier today: “Our attention has been drawn to remarks reportedly made by the Pakistani COAS while on a visit to the US. Nuclear sabre-rattling is Pakistan’s stock-in-trade.</p>
<p>“The international community can draw its own conclusions on the irresponsibility inherent in such remarks, which also reinforce the well-held doubts about the integrity of nuclear command and control in a state where the military is hand-in-glove with terrorist groups.”</p>
<p>The MEA had also said that it was “regrettable” that the alleged remarks were “made from the soil of a friendly third country”.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>In a terse response to the Indian MEA’s statement, the FO said: “Pakistan strongly rejects the immature remarks made by the Indian MEA earlier today, which is yet another demonstration of their chronic tendency to distorting facts and twisting statements out of context.</p>
<p>“The Indian narrative of an alleged ‘nuclear blackmail’ is a misleading and self-serving construct. Pakistan remains firmly opposed to the use or threat of use of force. India’s sabre-rattling and warmongering whenever confronted, invite unfounded allegations bereft of rationality.”</p>
<p>The FO said Pakistan was a responsible nuclear-weapon state with an “elaborate command and control structure under full civilian control” that had always exercised “discipline and restraint” while dealing with issues of such importance.</p>

<p>“Pakistan’s sustained and credible counterterrorism efforts are internationally acknowledged. Our security forces remain the bulwark against terrorism. The Indian MEA’s spurious insinuations are irresponsible and without a shred of evidence.</p>
<p>“We also note with concern a pointless reference to the third countries, in a bid to exert pressure on Pakistan. This not only reflects India’s lack of diplomatic confidence but also constitutes a futile attempt to unnecessarily involve other countries.”</p>
<p>The FO said that “contrary to India’s belligerent and jingoistic approach”, Pakistan would continue to act as a responsible member of the global community.</p>
<p>“However, any act of Indian aggression or violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity will be met with an immediate and matching response. The onus of any ensuing escalation will rest squarely with the Indian leadership,” it warned.</p>
<p>The two countries had entered a brief but intense military escalation after India, without evidence, blamed Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam attack. On May 6–7, New Delhi launched <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> that killed civilians, and the PAF <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">downed</a> six Indian jets in its response. After tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">strikes</a> on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>Since India’s short but deadly conflict with Pakistan in May, New Delhi has been unhappy about Trump’s closeness with Islamabad and has protested, casting a shadow over trade talks. Despite former public displays of bonhomie between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has taken a slightly harder stance against the US in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925193">repeatedly</a> taken credit for the India-Pakistan ceasefire he announced on social media on May 10, but India disputes his claim that it resulted from his intervention and trade threats.  Trump also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044">hosted</a> the army chief at the White House in the weeks following the conflict.</p>
<p>By declaring the Indian economy dead in the water, Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929119">put</a> Modi and his party in a bind. Until recently, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was canvassing support for the US president’s election. Its supporters were holding special prayers and muttering mystical chants for Trump’s victory. There was at least one temple created where a sculptured image of Trump was worshipped.</p>
<p>But Trump has ignored the lavish praise and called out India’s energy imports from Russia and its tariff regime as non-negotiable.</p>
<p>The Indian government said it was trying to figure out a response by consulting all the “stakeholders”, a euphemism for angry businesses whose hopes were riding on Modi’s daring ability to play both sides of the street.</p>
<p>That appears to have hit a dead end as Trump last week <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929119/trump-imposes-additional-25pc-tariff-on-indian-goods-relations-hit-new-low">imposed</a> an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, citing New Delhi’s continued imports of Russian oil in a move that sharply escalated tensions between the two nations after trade talks reached a deadlock. The new import tax, set to come into place in three weeks, will raise duties on some Indian exports to as high as 50pc — among the highest levied on any US trading partner.</p></p>

            <p><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Monday acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi in two more cases related to the May 9 riots, while sentencing Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudry, Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mehmoodur Rashid to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, following which thousands were arrested.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The ATC had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929899/verdict-in-two-may-9-riots-cases-reserved">reserved its verdict</a> in the two cases on Saturday related to the May 9 riots — the Shadman police station attack and burning of police vehicles near Jinnah House — after completing proceedings at Kot Lakhpat jail. The judge concluded the hearings inside the jail in two sessions during the whole day.</p>
<p>ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced the judgments today and convicted Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema and Rashid in both cases.</p>
<p>PTI leaders Aliya Hamza and Sanam Javed were also sentenced to five years in prison in the Shadman case.</p>
<p>Advocate Rana Mudassar confirmed today’s sentencing to <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, Hamza said that the PTI leaders did not fear punishment and would not take one step back.</p>
<p>“We are standing with the PTI founder and will continue to stand with him,” she said. “I was in government custody when I was sentenced.”</p>
<p>She continued: “Maryam Nawaz was convicted because of corruption, while I was convicted because of loyalty. I have already served 16 months in prison, I am not afraid.”</p>
<p>Hamza stated that she was already consulting with her lawyers to file an appeal against the sentence with the Lahore High Court (LHC).</p>
<p>In the Shadman police station case, the court indicted 25 accused out of 41 nominated in the challan and recorded statements of 45 prosecution witnesses. At least 15 accused have been declared proclaimed offenders in this case.</p>
<p>In the police vehicles torching case, the court indicted 17 accused, declared seven proclaimed offenders and recorded statements of 65 prosecution witnesses.</p>
<p>Last month, the Lahore ATC had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925887/lahore-atc-acquits-qureshi-sentences-yasmin-rashid-ejaz-chaudhry-and-others-to-10-years-in-may-9-riots-case">acquitted</a> Qureshi while sentencing Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema, Rashid and others to 10 years in prison over a May 9 riots case related to violence on Sherpao Bridge.</p>
<p>Sarwar Road police had registered a case against PTI leaders and workers on charges of ransacking and burning public property at Sherpao Bridge in the Cantonment area during the violent protests.</p>
<p>Chaudhry had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929752/ptis-zartaj-gul-ejaz-chaudhry-appeal-to-lhc-against-atc-convictions-in-may-9-riots-cases">filed two petitions</a> in the LHC on Saturday, pleading with the court to suspend his sentence and conviction, along with ordering his release on bail. He further requested the court in the second petition to set aside his conviction and acquit him in the case in the “interest of justice”.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#ptis-gohar-blasts-convictions" id="ptis-gohar-blasts-convictions" title="Permalink"></a>PTI’s Gohar blasts convictions</h2>
<p>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan assailed the convictions, saying: “We’ve said before that if injustice is allowed to thrive, then the voice of the people will be silenced.”</p>
<p>Lamenting that the PTI’s mandate was stolen, Gohar said that the government did not have the people’s respect or vote and did not have the people’s trust.</p>
<p>“Yet we sat [in parliament] so that we could move forward and protect the nation, save democracy, free the courts and ensure the supremacy of order.</p>
<p>“If this blade of injustice doesn’t stop, the nation will suffer a great loss,” he warned.</p>
<p>“We condemn the judgments and reject them,” Gohar added. “Justice has been killed.”</p>
<p>The PTI chairman further said that the party condemned the riots on May 9, stating that they should not have happened and should not happen again. However, he added that the party submitted a petition requesting a hearing on the allegations.</p>
<p>“That hearing has not happened, our petition was ignored and no decision was made,” he stated.</p>
<p>“Because the courts didn’t grant us justice, political tensions and instability rose. We don’t get justice and it keeps getting killed,” Gohar emphasised.</p>
<p>He said that Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai was saying the right thing: “People need to rise up, their voice cannot be silenced.</p>
<p>“We will carry on our movement until the true leader of the world’s 6th biggest party is released.”</p>
<p>Referring to those convicted in today’s hearing, Gohar said that the party members were voices who were representatives of the state who did not condone violence against it.</p>
<p>“If their voices are silenced, if the knife of injustice plunges deeper, then there will be a lot of division. This needs to end,” Gohar emphasised.</p>
<p>According to Gohar, the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) summoned the party leadership, who requested a meeting with Imran. “He (the CJP) said he is pursuing judicial reforms and would allow us to meet Imran in Adiala,” Gohar recalled.</p>
<p>“It’s been six months and there has been no meeting. We submitted a privileged motion to meet Imran, but there has been no action on it.</p>
<p>“We even submitted requests and raised the issue in parliament, but nothing happened,” he added.</p></p>
