                <h2>Navy thwarted Indian aircraft carrier threat, says Shehbaz</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>• PM praises Navy for ensuring maritime sovereignty<br />
• Reiterates Pakistan will give strong response to India if truce violated; lauds Trump for taking up Kashmir dispute</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday visited Karachi to pay tribute to the Pakistan Navy, which successfully safeguarded the sea lines of communication and ensured absolute maritime sovereignty through a layered seaward defence.</p>
<p>During the visit to Pakistan Naval Dockyard, the PM was briefed by officials on the Pakistan Navy’s strategic orientation, operational undertakings, and contributions during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">recent conflict</a>.</p>
<p>He praised the navy for its preparedness and said it would have given a robust response to India if the neighbouring country had tried to attack Pakistan using its fleet.</p>
<p>In his address, the prime minister said India’s aircraft carrier Vikrant retreated after sensing the preparedness of the Pakistan Navy. “Indian Navy’s (aircraft carrier) Vikrant had reached close to Pakistan by 400 nautical miles, but after suffering immense losses inflicted by Paki­stan Air Force and Pakistan Army (elsewhere), Vikrant retreated, sensing the preparedness of the Pakistan Navy to respond vigorously,” he added.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The premier also recalled the navy’s proud legacy of decisive operations, saying the naval force remained fully capable of executing high-intensity operations akin to the historic ‘Operation Dwarka’ (1965), whenever and wherever required.</p>
<p>“Strong coordination am­o­ng the armed forces is a golden chapter in the country’s history,” he said, adding that the ground forces targeted the enemy’s positions with precision using Fatah missiles and other weapons.</p>
<p>He also commended the Pakistan Navy for its resolute posture, operational dexterity, and effe­ctive deterrent response in countering adversarial maritime threats. The PM particularly praised the navy’s role in ensuring the uninterrupted flow of maritime trade.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Lauding the role of PN, the prime minister said the navy was ready to give a befitting response to India if the neighbouring country dared to attack Pakistan from the sea.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said that over the past 15 years, the Pakistan Navy has gained the latest technology. “I congratulate Pakis­tan Navy for the progress it attained during the last 15 years through indigenous technology,” he said.</p>
<p>The PM reiterated that Pakis­tan was ready to give a stronger response to India if the neighbouring country violated the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p><strong>‘Man of peace’</strong></p>
<p>He also called US President Donald Trump a ‘man of peace’ and expressed confidence that the US president would play an effective role in resolving the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>“President Trump is a man of peace as he played a major role in averting war between the two nuclear states (Pakistan and India),” the prime minister said. PM Shehbaz said he wanted to express his gratitude to President Trump for his desire to play a “sincere role” for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute.</p>
<p>He also thanked the leaders of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911469">Turkiye</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910257/fazl-claims-saudis-played-crucial-role-in-pakistan-india-ceasefire">Saudi Arabia</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910086/uae-deputy-pm-welcomes-ceasefire-understanding-between-pakistan-india-fo">UAE</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909096/qatar-expresses-deep-concern-on-escalation-between-india-and-pakistan">Qatar</a>, and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910558/china-welcomes-ceasefire-between-pakistan-india-to-play-role-for-peaceful-stable-region">China</a> for supporting Pakistan.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>The PM said these countries supported Pakistan’s stance that there should be an independent and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">transparent inquiry</a> into the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam terror attack</a> and questioned why India was not entertaining the offer.</p>
<p>Chief of Army Staff Syed Asim Munir and air chief Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu also accompanied the PM, who was received and welcomed by the naval chief, Admiral Naveed Ashraf.</p>

                <h2>Indian foreign secretary says no US mediation in ceasefire with Pakistan</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri has said that the United States had no role in mediating the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> between New Delhi and Islamabad, according to Indian media reports on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Misri’s statement comes despite US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911576/us-averted-likely-pak-india-nuclear-war-says-trump#:~:text=US%20averted%20likely%20Pak%2DIndia%20nuclear%20war%3A%20Trump">taking credit</a> multiple <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910565/trump-says-warned-pakistan-india-of-no-trade-if-fighting-not-halted">times</a> for his administration’s role in the truce, which Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">thanked</a> him for.</p>
<p>New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating last month’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">strongly denied</a> the allegations and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>. As the situation turned into a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military confrontation</a> between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>During a meeting yesterday of the parliamentary committee on external affairs, led by Congress lawmaker Shashi Tharoor, Misri claimed that the offer for a ceasefire came from Pakistan and that no other country was involved in the negotiations, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-n-signal-pak-wasn-t-tipped-off-misri-to-panel-101747680035793.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hindustan Times</a></em> reported, citing a “senior lawmaker”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Asked by parliamentarians about Trump’s statements that Washington had helped India and Pakistan “settle” the “problem”, the report quoted Misri as saying: “New Delhi had routine talks with the US but there was no mediation.”</p>
<p>According to the report, this was Misri’s first appearance before the 31-member parliamentary panel. The meeting went on for more than three hours as members asked the foreign secretary numerous questions.</p>
<p>India’s <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.ptinews.com/story/national/india-and-pakistan-conflict-was-always-in-conventional-domain-misri-to-parliamentary-panel/2569079" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Press of Trust India</a></em>, citing sources, also stated that Misri “reiterated the government’s stand that the decision to stop military actions was taken at a bilateral level”, indicating no third-party role.</p>
<p>During the parliamentary panel’s moot, Misri was questioned about why the Indian government was giving Trump the centre stage and not refuting the US president’s claims on mediating the ceasefire.</p>
<p>However, Misri “did not give any answer” to the questions, <em>Hindustan Times</em> reported, quoting the lawmaker, whose name it did not specify.</p>
<p>“Trump publicly claimed at least seven times that he facilitated the ceasefire. Why was India silent?” <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/no-us-role-ceasefire-nuclear-signalling-pakistan-foreign-secretary-vikram-misri-tells-parliament-panel-2727150-2025-05-19" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">India Today</a></em> quoted an unnamed member of the panel as asking.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Another asked him why India “allowed Trump to repeatedly seize the narrative”, referring to the US president’s statements on the truce.</p>
<p>“The sense the MPs got was that India neither involved the US in the discussions with Pakistan nor was India involved in the US’s decision to announce it,” <em>India Today</em> stated.</p>
<p><em><a class="link--external" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-restoration-of-normalcy-with-pakistan-in-near-future-foreign-secretary-vikram-misri/articleshow/121279714.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Times of India</a></em> similarly reported that Misri reportedly said Trump made his remarks on the ceasefire on social media and not through any official channel, where India could have put its point across.</p>
<p>During the in-camera session, the foreign secretary also ruled out the “restoration of normalcy with Pakistan in [the] near future”.</p>

<p>Misri also said that the recent military confrontation with Pakistan was “entirely in the conventional domain and involved no ‘nuclear signalling’ from the other side”, the <em>Hindustan Times</em> added.</p>

<p>While Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned of an “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906661">all-out war</a>” prior to the conflict, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said last week that a nuclear war was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910847">never an option</a> for the government.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Misri was also “pressed about the number of Indian aircraft lost during the hostilities”, referring to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911307/indias-false-pride-stands-shattered-says-pm#:~:text=downing%20not%20five%20but%20six%20fighter%20planes%2C%20including%20three%20Rafale%20jets">six</a> fighters <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downed</a> by the Pakistan Air Force, <em>India Today</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/no-us-role-ceasefire-nuclear-signalling-pakistan-foreign-secretary-vikram-misri-tells-parliament-panel-2727150-2025-05-19#:~:text=Pressed%20about%20the%20number%20of%20Indian%20aircraft%20lost%20during%20the%20hostilities%2C%20the%20Foreign%20Secretary%20declined%20to%20comment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
