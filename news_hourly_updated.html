                <h2>Lahore police detains over 30 PTI activists amid protests marking 2 years of Imran‚Äôs imprisonment</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Lahore police on Tuesday said it detained more than 30 PTI activists after they took to the streets to officially kick off a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928760/pti-to-kick-off-free-imran-movement-today">nationwide movement</a> for the release of ex-premier Imran Khan, who has been in jail for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">two years</a> now.</p>
<p>Imran, imprisoned since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">Aug 5, 2023</a> in a case related to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1873672/ihc-grants-imran-bail-in-new-toshakhana-case-as-govt-rules-out-release">state gifts</a>, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831">¬£190 million corruption case</a> and also faces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845818">pending trials</a> in alleged terrorism cases related to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9, 2023 riots</a>.</p>
<p>Imran had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922952">issued</a> a nationwide protest call, with a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTIofficial/status/1952386498889683368" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> attributed to him saying that the ‚Äúmovement that begins on August 5 will continue until democracy is restored in its true spirit‚Äù. According to PTI leader Asad Qaiser, August 5 was the inception of the protest, but it should not be considered a ‚Äúfinal call‚Äù.</p>
<p>Lahore Deputy Inspector General (operations) Faisal Kamran told <em>Dawn.com</em>: ‚ÄúMore than 30 PTI activists trying to block roads in different areas of the city were taken into custody.‚Äù</p>
<p>He denied <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-police-arrest-120-workers-ex-pm-imran-khans-party-ahead-protest-2025-08-05/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a> of the police arresting hundreds of activists.</p>
<p>At around 1pm, the PTI claimed that one of its leaders, Rehana Dar, had been detained by the police in Lahore.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAn elder like Rehana Dar is being dragged by the shameless Punjab Police, a disgraceful sight,‚Äù the PTI said on its official X account.</p>
<p>It shared a video showing Dar, who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1816570">contested</a> the 2024 general elections in Sialkot against PML-N‚Äôs Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, being dragged into a police van by personnel with riot gear.</p>
<p>The PTI said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Punjab Inspector General Dr Usman Anwar ‚Äúhave sunk to a new low with this act‚Äù and ‚Äúabandoned all sense of shame and decency‚Äù.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mahmood Achkazai and others departed for Adiala Jail, where Imran is imprisoned, the party <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTIKPOfficial/status/1952670976140800073" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> at 3pm.</p>

                <h2>Balochistan govt told to operate flights from Quetta to Iran, Iraq for Arbaeen pilgrims: defence minister</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif assured the National Assembly on Tuesday that the government was taking measures for Arbaeen pilgrims following an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927007">overland travel ban</a>, saying the Balochistan government had been directed to operate direct flights from Quetta to Iran and Iraq.</p>
<p>Every year, Shia Muslims from Pakistan travel by land route to Karbala in Iraq via Iran to take part in Arbaeen rituals during the Islamic month of Safar. Arbaeen marks the end of a 40-day mourning period following Ashura, the anniversary of Imam Hussain‚Äôs martyrdom in the Battle of Karbala.</p>
<p>Late last month, the government announced that Pakistani Zaireen (pilgrims) would be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927007">barred</a> from travelling by road to Iran and Iraq for Arbaeen due to security concerns.  The decision immediately drew flak from the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927487">Sindh government</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927719">senators</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927338/pti-raps-overland-travel-ban-on-arbaeen-pilgrims">PTI</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927195">PPP</a>, while Iran <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926827">advised</a> pilgrims to secure an e-visa for the pilgrimage by August 7.</p>
<p>Speaking in the NA today, the defence minister acknowledged that the ban was enforced due to serious security concerns, particularly because of the threat of terrorist attacks targeting pilgrim convoys.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTo mitigate these risks, the federal government has authorised the Balochistan government to operate direct flights from Quetta, allowing pilgrims to safely travel by air to their destinations,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIran has so far allowed one such flight; we are pressing them to start frequent flight operations as well.‚Äù</p>
<p>Arrangements had also been made for onward transportation of pilgrims from airports in Iran and Iraq to their intended sites, he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAdvertisements had been published over the past four days inviting private carriers to operate on the route, and all licensed private airlines had been allowed to provide services,‚Äù he told the NA.</p>
<p>‚ÄúChartered flights have also been approved to maximise the number of pilgrims able to travel safely.‚Äù</p>
<p>He urged potential operators and the market to take full advantage of the permissions granted, while acknowledging that these measures were aimed at offering maximum facilities while avoiding the security hazards of road travel.</p>
<p>Asif further said that the matter was discussed during the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928404">visit</a> of the Iranian president to Pakistan, adding that Iran had allowed an additional flight to facilitate the movement of Pakistani pilgrims.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI want to assure the House and the people across Pakistan that the government is fully committed to ensuring safe, comfortable, and timely transportation for all Arbaeen pilgrims,‚Äù he said.</p></p>
