            <p><p>As the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench resumed hearing review petitions in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914188">reserved seats case</a>, Justice Salahuddin Panhwar recused himself from the bench following an objection from senior counsel Hamid Khan.</p>
<p>In its July 12, 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845531/sc-gives-pti-its-groove-back">short order</a>, eight out of 13 judges ruled that 39 out of a list of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860621#:~:text=the%20verdict%20stated.-,List%20of%2080%20MNAs,-The%20verdict%20listed">80 MNAs</a> were and are the returned candidates of the PTI, setting it to emerge as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845532">single largest party</a> in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>However, the ruling had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1868333">not been implemented</a> by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1860119">National Assembly</a>, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had raised some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1859716">objections</a>.

<p>An 11-member bench headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan resumed the hearing today.</p>
<p>Justice Panhwar noted that Hamid Khan, counsel for the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), had yesterday raised an objection to the bench.</p>
<p>“Hamid Khan raised an objection to the inclusion of judges in the bench who came to the Supreme Court after the 26th Amendment in the bench,” Justice Panhwar said, noting that he is one of the judges included in the objection.</p>
<p>“Public trust in the judiciary is essential,” Panhwar stated.</p>
<p>“It is essential that no party has any objection to the bench,” he said. “It is because of these objections that I cannot sit on this bench.”</p>
<p>The judge told Khan that although he was hurt by his remarks — having worked together since 2010 — this was not a personal matter.</p>

            <p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke on Thursday with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif about <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920431/iran-wont-back-down-but-looking-to-avoid-war">recent developments</a> in the Middle East, underlining a shared commitment to regional stability and non-proliferation amid renewed efforts to engage <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920138">Iran</a>.</p>
<p>“Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke today with Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif regarding events in the Middle East. Secretary Rubio emphasised that Iran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon,” US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/06/secretary-rubios-call-with-pakistani-prime-minister-sharif-3/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>“The two leaders acknowledged the importance of working together to promote a durable peace between Israel and Iran and to maintain regional stability,” she added.</p>

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The call highlights Washington’s growing engagement with Islamabad at a time when the Trump administration is reportedly exploring a new diplomatic initiative with Tehran, possibly “as early as next week”.</p>
<p>Rubio’s statement that “Iran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon” will be interpreted in various ways in both Pakistan and the United States. Some may see it as an indication of alignment between the two countries, while others may view it as an affirmation of Pakistan’s position as a potential stabilising partner in a region fraught with uncertainty.</p>
<p>The latest contact builds on a series of high-level engagements, including a phone call last Friday in which PM Shehbaz expressed satisfaction over what he described as a “cordial and productive discussion” <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917868">between</a> US President Donald Trump and Pakistan’s military chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir.</p>
<p>That meeting, held earlier this month at the White House, was notable for both its optics and timing. Munir became the first serving Pakistani army chief to be formally received by a sitting US president — a gesture widely interpreted as an acknowledgment of the military’s central role in Pakistan’s foreign and security policy.</p>
<p>The Pakistani military’s media wing later reported that the White House luncheon focused on joint counterterrorism efforts and the potential for expanded bilateral trade.</p>
<p>Trump, in remarks at a Nato summit in The Hague following the meeting, credited General Munir with helping to avert a nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan, referring to him — though not by name — as a quiet but decisive actor during last month’s standoff.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>“The most important of these conflicts,” Trump said, “was last month’s war scare between India and Pakistan. And that was not whether or not they may someday have nukes, like we are talking about the Middle East… This is — they have nuclear weapons.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump described how he intervened through a series of calls that linked trade to peace.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>“If you are going to be fighting each other… we are not going to do any trade,” he recalled telling both sides. “They said, ‘No, no. No, you have to do a trade deal.’… And we stopped the nuclear war.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Trump avoided naming General Munir directly, he has in the past referred to the Pakistani general as “an exceptional human being and an inspiring personality”.</p>
<p>These remarks, which closely mirror Pakistan’s version of events, stand in contrast to India’s official stance. New Delhi maintains it acted independently during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918769">May crisis</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917877/modi-maintains-there-was-no-us-mediation-in-ceasefire-with-pakistan">rejects</a> any suggestion of third-party mediation. Trump’s candid remarks suggest otherwise, indicating a more active White House role than previously acknowledged.</p>
<p>In his broader comments following last week’s White House meeting, Trump also noted: “The Pakistanis know Iran very well, better than most. But they are not happy.”</p>
<p>Though brief, this comment hints at Washington’s evolving perception of Pakistan — not merely as a South Asian actor but as a player with insight into regional dynamics. It also reinforces the relevance of Rubio’s phone call with Sharif, suggesting that the US is keen to draw on Islamabad’s experience as it revisits the idea of talks with Tehran.</p>
<p>Rubio’s statement on preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon re-emphasises US strategic priorities. Pakistan’s apparent position — implicit in the call’s emphasis on peace and stability — may help strengthen its image in Washington as a constructive and responsible actor in a volatile neighborhood.</p>
<p>Observers say the back-to-back engagements — and Pakistan’s active role in both South Asian and Middle Eastern dialogues — signal a diplomatic moment of consequence, one in which Islamabad has the opportunity to shape outcomes far beyond its immediate borders.</p></p>

            <p><p>Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh told his Chinese counterpart that the two countries should seek a “permanent solution” to their decades-old border dispute, India’s defence ministry said on Friday.</p>
<p>Singh met China’s Dong Jun on the sidelines of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920249">meeting</a> of the defence ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Qingdao on Thursday and stressed on solving issues between the two countries through a structured roadmap, the ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>The world’s two most populous nations — both nuclear powers — share a 3,800-km, largely undemarcated and disputed border in the Himalayas and have gone to war over it.</p>
<p>Although the frontier has been mostly peaceful in recent decades, a deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1563892/indian-army-says-20-of-its-troops-killed-in-border-clash-with-china">clash</a> between their troops in 2020 resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers.</p>
<p>The clash led to a four-year military standoff with both armies deploying tens of thousands of troops in the mountains until they reached a pact in October to step back, leading to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866675">thaw</a> in ties.</p>
<p>During his meeting with Dong, Singh also called for bridging the trust deficit created after the 2020 standoff, New Delhi said.</p>
<p>The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, India, Pakistan, and Iran. Their defence ministers’ meeting was held as a precursor to the annual summit of its leaders set for the autumn.</p></p>
