            <p><p>• Gen Munir’s promotion to five-star rank marks first such elevation in over six decades<br />
• Field Marshal terms honour ‘tribute to the entire armed forces and the people of Pakistan’<br />

<p>ISLAMABAD: The government on Tuesday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912186/cabinet-approves-coas-gen-asim-munirs-promotion-to-field-marshal">promoted</a> Chief of the Army Staff Gen Asim Munir to the rank of field marshal in recognition of his ‘strategic leadership and decisive role’ in defeating India in the conflict that started earlier this month following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam inci­dent</a> in India-occu­pied Kashmir.</p>
<p>“The Government of Pakistan has approved the promotion of General Syed Asim Munir (Nishan-e-Imtiaz, Military) to the rank of Field Marshal in recognition of his superior strategy and courageous lead­ership… (and) infli­cted a decisive defeat upon the enemy,” a statement read.</p>
<p>The elevation, first cleared by the federal cabinet and later communicated by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to President Asif Ali Zardari, marks the first such promotion in over six decades. Pakistan had a serving field marshal in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1355171#:~:text=MILITARY%20RULER%20GETS%20HIMSELF%20ELEVATED">1959</a>, when Ayub Khan, the-then military ruler, awarded himself the five-star title.</p>
<p>Shortly after the announcement, PM Sheh­baz <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/CMShehbaz/status/1924843057788211244" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on X, formerly Twitter, saying: “Under his command, our valiant armed forces staunchly defended Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity with unity, courage and the highest standards of military professionalism.”</p>

<p>Field Marshal Munir, who has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723789">serving</a> as the army chief since November 2022, accepted the elevation, saying, as per a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), that it was not a personal honour but a tribute to the entire armed forces and the people of Pakistan.</p>
<p><strong>Second extension for air chief</strong></p>
<p>The government also announced a second, open-ended extension in the tenure of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu.</p>
<p>His current extension, granted last year, expires in March. He becomes the first PAF chief to receive two extensions, a move that underscores the central role he played in the successful execution of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos from May 7 to 10. “The government has also unanimously decided to extend the tenure of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu upon the completion of his current term,” a statement by the PM’s Office said.</p>
<p><strong>Implications for military hierarchy</strong></p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir’s promotion has set off widespread speculation about its implications for Pakistan’s higher defence organisation (HDO), comprising the joint chiefs of staff committee (JCSC), headed by its chairman, and the three service chiefs (army, navy, air force).</p>
<p>While the five-star title is largely ceremonial, questions have also been raised about its impact on the civil-military balance, the operational command chain, and the defence leadership’s future.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In a symbolic gesture, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza issued a congratulatory message, which analysts viewed as signalling that he would continue in his current role, despite now being technically junior to a five-star service chief.</p>
<p>Among retired military officials and analysts, opinions are divided. Retired Lt Gen Naeem Khalid Lodhi, a former defence secretary and caretaker national security adviser, anticipated the creation of a long-proposed chief of defence staff (CDS) role, a concept first floated during Nawaz Sharif’s previous tenure. Under this structure, COAS Munir could serve both as COAS and CDS, further consolidating his authority, he believed.</p>
<p>Conversely, retired Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, also a former defence secretary, downplayed the prospects of any structural change. “The field marshal rank is ceremonial,” he said, adding that the COAS remained the most powerful operational position within the military hierarchy. “CDS is a coordinating role, not a command authority,” Mr Yasin noted, suggesting the existing setup would remain intact.</p>
<p>Both, however, foresee the creation of a position of the vice chief of army staff for a four-star general.</p>
<p><strong>Legal and constitutional ambiguities</strong></p>
<p>The promotion has also revived debates over the legal foundations of the field marshal rank in Pakistan, with some experts noting the silence of the Constitution and the <a class="link--external" href="https://pakistancode.gov.pk/pdffiles/administrator5a436c410d7fc88fc27dae7b864c6f63.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pakistan Army Act</a> on such an appointment.</p>
<p><a class="link--external" href="https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part12.ch2.html#:~:text=Command%20of%20Armed%20Forces.%2D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Article 243</a> grants the president the authority to appoint service chiefs on the advice of the prime minister, but it does not mention five-star ranks. The 2024 amendment to the Army Act extended the COAS’s tenure to five years and removed retirement age limits for four-star generals.</p>
<p>A Ministry of Defence notification, however, said that the promotion had been made under Rule 199A of the Army Regulations (Rules) 1998. The rules are classified, but according to a military source, the mentioned rule reads: “199-A. Promotion to field marshal. A general officer, whether serving or retired, may be promoted to the rank of field marshal by the federal government without regard to seniority or any specific appointment.”</p>
<p>Military law expert retired colonel Inamur Raheem, when contacted for verification of the secretive rules, confirmed the wording of Rule 199A.</p>
<p><strong>A strategic signal</strong></p>
<p>While the rank does not grant additional operational authority, its conferral during a period of heightened regional tension carries strategic and political symbolism. It may also bolster Field Marshal Munir’s standing both within the military and in political circles, particularly amid ongoing internal instability and civil-military friction.</p>
<p>Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, who previously headed the Senate defence committee, noted that “Field Marshal Asim Munir is now very much in the driving seat as the pivot of the power structure, more so, given the weakness and divisions amongst the civilian politicians. Even before May, which has become an inflection point for Pakistan, for India and for South Asia, all the mainstream political forces were convinced that the road to Islamabad lies through Rawalpindi.”</p>
<p>Columnist and political analyst Abbas Nasir, while commenting on the political angle of the promotion, said, “As far as its domestic impact is concerned, by jumping the gun without evidence after the Pahalgam terror attack, the Modi government gifted Pakistan a considerable amount of unity as the country rallied behind the armed forces, setting aside internal political differences, disappointments.”</p>
<p>“Let’s see if national reconciliation is possible as a result of this Godsend or whether the country will revert to square one,” he worried.</p>
<p>Mr Nasir, while commenting on the move, said, “One only hopes that the world governments and media, which appeared to hyphenate Pakistan and India after years of lining up behind India and ap­p­eared to buy Islam­abad’s view largely, do not consider this a non-serious, or worse still belligerent, move.”</p>
<p><strong>Global context</strong></p>
<p>Pakistan’s only precedent for this move is Ayub Khan, whose 1959 elevation to the field marshal rank occurred amid his presidency and did not restructure the armed forces. Likewise, COAS Munir’s promotion is not expected to alter operational command but serves as a symbolic acknowledgement of his wartime leadership.</p>
<p>The global precedent supports this view. In India, Field Marshals Sam Manekshaw (1973) and K.M. Cariappa (1986) were promoted purely for ceremonial reasons, with no changes to the army’s structure. Similarly, in the United Kingdom and the United States, five-star titles have historically honoured extraordinary service during major wars without altering command frameworks.</p>

            <p><p>At least four children were killed while 38 other individuals were injured when a school bus was targeted in a blast in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district on Wednesday morning, an official said.</p>
<p>Khuzdar Deputy Commissioner Yasir Iqbal Dashti confirmed the casualties to <em>Dawn.com</em>, adding that the blast occurred when the school bus was near Zero Point.</p>
<p>The bodies and the injured were taken to a nearby hospital, from where the seriously injured would be referred to medical facilities in Quetta and Karachi, the DC said.</p>
<p>Police, the Frontier Corps (FC) and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel have reached the site of the incident.</p>
<p>After collecting evidence, they have begun an investigation into the attack.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi strongly condemned the “explosion inside the bus near Khuzdar Zero Point”.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MOIofficialGoP/status/1925053540763902171" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, he expressed deep sorrow and grief over the death of four children, and extended his condolences to their families.</p>
<p>“The beasts who target innocent children do not deserve any leniency. The enemy demonstrated barbarity by attacking innocent children,” Naqvi asserted.</p>
<p>“The attack on the school bus is a heinous conspiracy of the enemy to create instability in the country. With the unity of the nation, we will foil every conspiracy,” the interior minister vowed.</p>
<p>Naqvi also prayed for the speedy recovery of the wounded.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912301/pakistan-set-to-miss-growth-projection-for-fy25' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan set to miss growth projection for FY25</strong></a>
            <p><p>• GDP expands at 2.6pc, per capita income sees modest rise to $1,824<br />
• Economy size swells to $411bn, agriculture grows just 0.56pc and LSM contracts 1.5pc</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita income increased in dollar terms at a modest pace in 2024-25, reflecting a sustained recovery in the country’s overall output compared to the previous year, the government said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It was announced on Tuesday that the country’s economy is expected to grow by 2.68 per cent in the current fiscal year, a revision from earlier projections of 3.6pc, suggesting that Pakistan will fall short of its GDP target.</p>
<p>The leading global financial institutions’ estimates also show that Pakistan’s economy is expected to grow between 2.6 and 2.8pc in FY25, a slower-than-expected recovery with challenges in agriculture, industrial output, and external financing weighing on economic momentum. The lenders have already revised downward their earlier GDP projections for Pakistan.</p>
<p>The IMF <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905933">revised</a> the growth forecast to 2.6pc, citing weaker economic performance. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906217">estimate</a> a slightly higher growth rate of 2.8pc, reflecting cautious optimism.</p>
<p>The 113th National Accounts Committee (NAC) meeting, chaired by Planning Commission Secretary Awais Manzur Sumra, approved revised GDP growth rates for Q1, Q2, and Q3 of FY25, along with final figures for FY23 and revised estimates for FY24. The provisional GDP growth for FY25 stands at 2.68pc compared to 2.51pc in FY24, a marginal increase.</p>
<p>The size of the economy went up to $410.96 billion in FY25 from $371.66bn in FY24, mainly driven by growth in the services sector, followed by industry and livestock. Higher public and private sector investments, stable exchange rates, moderating inflation, and rising per capita income supported growth.</p>
<p>The per capita income slightly increased to $1,824 in FY25 from $1,680 in FY24. However, it was $1,551 in FY23, $1,766 in FY22 and $1,677 in FY21. This suggests the deterioration of the standard of living and well-being of almost all segments of society with no tangible increase in personal incomes.</p>
<p>It may lead to decreased disposable income, limiting individuals’ ability to afford goods and services, save, or invest.</p>
<p><strong>Agriculture sector</strong></p>
<p>The agriculture sector will post a modest growth of 0.56pc in FY25. This indicates that the agriculture sector faced setbacks, with important crops contracting by 13.49pc in FY25 compared to a healthy increase in important crops last year.</p>
<p>Important crops dipped due to a decline of 8.91pc in wheat production this year. The provincial crop reporting services estimated that wheat production may fall to 28.98 million tonnes from 31.81m tonnes last year. Maize production fell 15.4pc to 8.24m tonnes from 9.74m tonnes last year, rice production fell 1.38pc to 9.72m tonnes, from 9.86m tonnes, sugarcane by 3.88pc to 84.24m tonnes from 87.64m tonnes and a 30.7pc in cotton production to 7.08m bales from 10.22m bales last year.</p>
<p>Despite a 16.6pc reduction in the production of grams, other crops posted a provisional growth of 4.78pc. The production of potatoes saw an increase of 11.5pc to 9.40m tonnes from 8.43m tonnes, onion by 15.9pc from 2.30 to 2.67m tonnes, mango by 26.7pc from 2.09 to 2.65m tonnes and sesame by 44.7pc from 0.30 to 0.44m tonnes. While cotton ginning and miscellaneous components declined by 19.03pc, livestock, fores­t­­ry and fishing posted provisional growth rates of 4.72pc, 3.03pc and 1.42pc.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial sector</strong></p>
<p>The industry provisionally demonstrated a growth of 4.77pc in 2024-25. Despite a 2.84pc rise in coal production, the mining and quarrying sector experienced a contraction of 3.38pc. This decline is attributed to lower production of natural gas, which fell by 7.05pc, crude oil, down by 14.72pc, and other minerals.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The Large-Scale Manufacturing, as indicated by the Quantum Index of Manufacturing (QIM) for the first nine months of FY25, experienced a decline of 1.53pc, reflecting a mixed trend in the production across different groups. The electricity, gas and water supply sector witnessed a notable growth of 28.88pc, primarily attributed to the low-base effect from FY24. The construction sector recorded a rise of 6.61pc, which was attributed to heightened expenditures on construction-related activities by both the private sector and the general government.</p>
<p><strong>Services industry</strong></p>
<p>The services sector also grew 2.91pc in 2024-25, bolstered by favourable contributions from all its components. The wholesale and retail trade sector experienced a slight increase of 0.14pc, which was attributed to a deceleration in output growth within the agriculture and manufacturing industries.</p>
<p>The transport and storage sector has seen a rise of 2.20pc, which is attributed to the growth in output across water, air, and road transport. The information and communication sector grew 6.48pc driven by a notable increase of 24pc in the output of computer programming and consultancy activities.</p>
