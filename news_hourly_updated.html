                <h2>Fazl, others urge govt to review decision to nominate Trump for Nobel peace prize</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistani politicians on Sunday raised their concerns over the government’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514/govt-to-recommend-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize-for-decisive-diplomatic-intervention-in-india-pakistan-crisis">decision</a> to recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, as Washington <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">joined</a> Israel’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">war</a> with Iran.</p>
<p>The government had decided to nominate Trump for the prestigious award to hail his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” during last month’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">Pak-India conflict</a>, when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">US mediation</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/GovtofPakistan/status/1936159807326900577" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, it had highlighted that Trump “demonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi”, which ultimately secured a ceasefire.</p>
<p>However, after the US bombed Iran’s Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites, with Trump saying they were “totally obliterated”, leaders across the political spectrum joined Pakistani <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193760/can-you-believe-pakistan-nominated-trump-for-a-nobel-peace-prize-the-internet-cant-either">citizens</a> in voicing their reservations.</p>
<p>Veteran politician Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who heads his own faction of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F), demanded that the government rescind its decision.</p>
<p>“President Trump’s claim of peace has proven to be false, the proposal for the Nobel Prize should be withdrawn,” Fazl told workers at a party meeting in Murree today, according to a JUI-F <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/juipakofficial/status/1936808805804765304" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>

<p>He said that Trump’s recent meeting and lunch with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir “pleased Pakistani rulers so much” that they recommended nominating the US president for the Nobel prize.</p>
<p>The JUI-F chief noted that Trump won the presidential election with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20what%20I%20want%20to%20be%3A%20a%20peacemaker%20and%20unifier.">slogan of peace</a> but was “proven false in his claim”.</p>
<p>Fazl said that when Pakistan “destroyed India’s defence force”, President Trump intervened and said he had declared a ceasefire.</p>
<p>“[But] Trump has supported the Israeli attacks on Palestine, Syria, Lebanon and Iran. How can this be a sign of peace?” Fazl questioned. “With the blood of Afghans and Palestinians on America’s hands, how can he claim to be a proponent of peace?”</p>
<p>Trump campaigned for office as a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886582#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20what%20I%20want%20to%20be%3A%20a%20peacemaker%20and%20unifier.">peacemaker</a>” who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end wars in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging five months into his presidency.</p>
<p>The US has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1873752">several</a> times <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1815897">vetoed</a> resolutions calling for a ceasefire in Gaza at the UN Security Council, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915498/us-vetoes-security-councils-call-for-gaza-ceasefire">latest</a> earlier this month.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Fazl said his party was in favour of friendship with the US but not of its “slavery”.</p>
<p>“National sovereignty, the right of the people to govern themselves, and economic freedom should be maintained in relations with America,” the JUI-F chief asserted.</p>
<p>Fazl further said that in the last three months, a US delegation has visited him three times, after which he attended their diplomatic ceremony in Islamabad.</p>
<p>He also expressed his view that the attacks on Iran were an attempt to stop China’s economic growth in the Middle East. China is the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899284#:~:text=China%20is%20the%20largest%20importer%20of%20Iranian%20oil.">largest importer</a> of Iranian oil.</p>
<p>“Pakistan’s economic strength in the region has been affected the most. The economic balance is shifting towards Asia instead of Europe, which is a good omen for Asia,” he said.</p>

<p>Calls to reconsider the government’s decision also came from other politicians.</p>
<p>Former senator Mushahid Hussain <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/Mushahid/status/1936730192094876044" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X: “Since Trump is no longer a potential peacemaker, but a leader who has willfully unleashed an illegal war, [the] Pakistan government must now review, rescind and revoke his Nobel nomination!”</p>
<p>He said Trump had been “trapped by Netanyahu and Israeli war lobby, committing [the] biggest blunder of his presidency”.</p>
<p>“Trump will now end up presiding over [the] decline of America!”</p>

<p>Hussain, former chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Defence, had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514/govt-to-recommend-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize-for-decisive-diplomatic-intervention-in-pak-india-crisis#:~:text=request%20for%20comment.-,Mushahid%20Hussain,-%2C%20former%20chairman%20of">previously said</a> that if the nomination “panders to Trump’s ego, so be it”.</p>

<p>In a separate <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTIofficial/status/1936692515794551145" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a>, the opposition PTI condemned the “unprovoked” US strikes and voiced “total support” for Iran’s sovereignty.</p>
<p>Raoof Hasan, head of PTI’s political think-tank, said the government’s decision was now a “cause of unmitigated shame and embarrassment for those who were instrumental in making the choice”.</p>
<p>“That’s why it is said that legitimacy can neither be bought nor gifted,” said Hasan, as he took a jibe at the government. He also <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/RaoofHasan/status/1936655007140450692" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denounced</a> the US’s “total disregard for international covenants” through the attacks on Iran.</p>

<hr />
<p>The US president had stepped up his rhetoric against Iran since Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">first struck</a> Iran on June 13, repeating his insistence that it could never have a nuclear weapon. Tehran has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a> the claim, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p>
<p>Israel had launched wide-scale air strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences, killing top <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">commanders</a>, scientists and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918702">hundreds</a> others. Both countries have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918048/iran-israel-trade-fresh-air-attacks-as-trump-weighs-us-involvement">traded</a> wave after wave of devastating strikes since then.</p>
<p>In a televised address to the nation from the White House earlier today, Trump warned that the United States would go after more targets if Iran did not make peace quickly.</p>

<p>The intervention by a US president who had vowed to avoid another “forever war” in the region threatens to dramatically widen the conflict, with Iran having said it would retaliate if Washington got involved.</p>
<p>“Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success,” said Trump, adding that they targeted the crucial underground nuclear enrichment plant of Fordow along with facilities at Natanz and Isfahan.</p>
<p>“Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace,” said Trump.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump on the strikes, saying that “the awesome and righteous might of the United States will change history”.</p>

<p>Trump spoke to Netanyahu after the attacks, while the US also gave Israel a “heads up” before the strikes, a senior White House official told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Not long after, sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and explosions were heard from Jerusalem as Iranian state TV announced a fresh salvo of missiles launched.</p>
<p>Tehran said there were “no signs of contamination” after the US attacks and Saudi regulators said “no radioactive effects were detected” in the Gulf region.</p>
<p>Iranian media <a class="link--external" href="https://en.mehrnews.com/news/233460/Official-in-Iran-s-Qom-confirms-attack-on-Fordow-site" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that part of the Fordow plant, as well as the Isfahan and Natanz <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918984/what-are-the-key-sites-in-irans-nuclear-programme">nuclear sites</a>, were attacked.</p>
<p>The US strikes push the Middle East to the brink of a major new conflagration in a region already aflame for more than 20 months with devastating conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as a toppled ruler in Syria.</p>
<p>Tehran had threatened reprisals on US forces in the Middle East if Trump attacked.</p>

<p>US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth hailed the strikes an “incredible and overwhelming success”, adding that the operation was intended at a regime change in Iran.</p>
<p>“We devastated the Iranian nuclear programme, but it is worth noting that the operation did not target the Iranian troops or people,” Hegseth told a press conference at the Pentagon.</p>
<p>The secretary reiterated Trump’s claims that Iran must never get a nuclear weapon, stating that by employing the president’s policy of “peace through strength”, Iran’s nuclear ambitions were “obliterated”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hegseth said the strikes were not a preamble to plans for regime change in Iran, adding that private messages had been sent to Tehran encouraging them to negotiate.</p>
<p>“This mission was not and has not been about regime change,” Hegseth stated. “The president authorised a precision operation to neutralise the threats to our national interests posed by the Iranian nuclear programme.”</p>
<p>“The operation President Trump planned was bold and it was brilliant, showing the world that American deterrence is back,” Hegseth added. “When this president speaks, the world should listen.”</p>

<p>Hegseth also read a statement from Trump, warning that any retaliation by Iran “will be met with force far greater than what was witnessed tonight”.</p>
<p>“Iran would be smart to heed these words,” the defence secretary warned, adding that US forces were postured to defend themselves, and take action if needed.</p>
<p>Hegseth said that the operation took months of preparation and required “a great deal of precision […] misdirection and highest of operational security”.</p>
<p>Describing the complex operation, dubbed “Midnight Hammer”, Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine said the “main strike package comprised” of seven <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/b-2-bombers-moving-guam-amid-middle-east-tensions-us-officials-say-2025-06-21/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">B-2 stealth bombers</a> flying 18 hours from the US mainland to Iran with multiple aerial refuellings.</p>
<p>The US strikes included 14 bunker-buster bombs, more than two dozen submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles and over 125 military aircraft, the top general added.</p>

<p>Trump had earlier told <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/israel-iran-conflict-june-21-2025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News</a></em>’ Sean Hannity show that five to six “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918152/read-why-israel-wants-us-bunker-busters-to-hit-irans-fordow-nuclear-site">bunker-buster</a>” bombs were dropped on the deep-underground Fordow facility, while 30 Tomahawk missiles were fired against other nuclear sites.</p>
<p>Caine said initial battle damage assessments indicated that all three sites sustained “extremely severe damage and destruction”, but he declined to speculate whether any Iranian nuclear capabilities might still be intact.</p>
<p>“Iran’s fighters did not fly, and it appears that Iran’s surface to air missile systems did not see us throughout the mission. We retained the element of surprise,” Caine added.</p>

<p>It said the US actions — “carried out in collusion with the genocidal Israeli regime— once again laid bare the depth of depravity that governs American foreign policy and revealed the extent of hostility harboured by the US ruling establishment against the peace-seeking and independence-loving people of Iran”.</p>
<p>“The world must not forget that it was the United States that, in the midst of a diplomatic process, betrayed diplomacy by supporting the genocidal and lawbreaking Israeli regime to impose a war of aggression on the Iranian nation,” the ministry said.</p>

<p>Iran called for an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to condemn this “criminal act of aggression”.</p>
<p>It also urged the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which it accused of “evident bias in favour of warmongering parties”, to “carry out its legal responsibility” as Iran’s nuclear facilities were under the agency’s safeguards and monitoring.</p>
<p>It highlighted that the US attacks violated the UN Charter and UNSC’s <a class="link--external" href="https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/en/content/2231/background" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Resolution 2231</a> from 2015 on Iran’s nuclear issue, also terming it a “devastating blow” to the global non-proliferation system.</p>
<p>“Silence in the face of such blatant aggression would plunge the world into an unprecedented level of danger and chaos,” the statement added.</p>
<p>Pakistan also condemned the US attacks, saying it was “gravely concerned at the possible further escalation of tensions in the region”.</p>
<p>“We reiterate that these attacks violate all norms of international law and that Iran has the legitimate right to defend itself under the UN Charter,” a <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by the Foreign Office said.</p>

<p>“The unprecedented escalation of tension and violence, owing to ongoing aggression against Iran, is deeply disturbing. Any further escalation of tensions will have severely damaging implications for the region and beyond,” it warned.</p>
<p>It stressed that “recourse to dialogue, diplomacy, in line with the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, remains the only viable pathway to resolve the crises in the region”.</p>
<p>“We emphasise the imperative need to respect civilian lives and properties and immediately bring the conflict to end. All parties must adhere to international law, particularly International Humanitarian Law,” the statement asserted.</p>

<p>Trump had said on Thursday that he would decide “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918331#:~:text=a%20White%20House%20spokesperson%20said%20the%20president%20would%20make%20a%20decision%20on%20whether%20to%20attack%20Iran%20%E2%80%9Cwithin%20two%20weeks%E2%80%9D">within two weeks</a>” whether to join Israel’s campaign, in a move that many saw as a window of diplomatic opportunity.</p>
<p>But the Republican’s decision to strike Iran came far sooner.</p>
<p>Flanked by JD Vance, Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump said that future attacks would be “far greater” unless Iran reached a diplomatic solution.</p>
<p>“Remember, there are many targets left,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump, however, made no mention of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917243">regime change</a>, despite having warned last week that Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was an “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917651">easy target</a>”.</p>
<p>The US contacted Iran diplomatically yesterday to say the strikes are all the US plans and it does not aim for regime change, <em>CBS News</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-launches-strikes-iranian-nuclear-facilities-trump-says/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20reached%20out%20to%20Iran%20diplomatically%20Saturday%20to%20say%20the%20strikes%20are%20all%20the%20U.S.%20plans%20and%20that%20regime%20change%20efforts%20are%20not%20planned%2C%20the%20sources%20said" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114724035571020048" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> earlier on his Truth Social site that a “full payload of bombs” was dropped on Fordow, adding that “all planes are safely on their way home.

<p>“There is not another military in the world that could have done this. Now is the time for peace!” he said.</p>

<p>Iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons and says its programme is for civilian purposes only. The IAEA last week Tehran was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914610">in breach</a> of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years.</p>
<p>However, a US intelligence assessment found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was “years away from producing one”, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917691/us-assessment-finds-iran-years-away-from-nuclear-weapon-refutes-israeli-claims">report</a> from <em>CNN</em> released on Tuesday said.</p>
<p>Israel, which is not a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.</p>
<p>Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian had warned yesterday of a “more devastating” retaliation should Israel’s nine-day bombing campaign continue. He said Tehran’s right to pursue a civilian nuclear programme “cannot be taken away … by threats or war”.</p>
<p>Pictures posted by the White House showed Trump in a red “Make America Great Again” cap meeting with top national security officials in the Situation Room, shortly before the strikes were announced.</p>

<p>After the address, Trump warned Iran against “any retaliation”.</p>

<p>Iran and other armed groups have previously attacked US military bases in the region, including in Iraq.</p>
<p>Iran’s Houthi allies in Yemen had yesterday threatened to resume their attacks on US vessels in the Red Sea if Washington joined the war.</p>

<p>However, the issue has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918298/prospect-of-iran-strike-exposes-divisions-in-trumps-maga-base">opened a split</a> in Trump’s “MAGA” movement, with many key Republican supporters calling on Trump to avoid embroiling the United States in another foreign war.</p>
<p>Trump’s first <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1295226">2016 election victory</a> in particular came on the back of his promises to get America out of its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Republican <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1936564082477531596" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> said, “There would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first.”</p>
<p>Pointing out that Israel was a nuclear-armed nation, she wrote on X: “This is not our fight.”</p>
<p>“Every time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war,” Greene said.</p>
