            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir is undertaking an official visit to the United States and has engaged in high-level interactions with senior political and military leadership, as well as members of the Pakistani diaspora, the military’s media wing said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The visit comes shortly after he went to the US in June on a five-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917414">official visit</a>, where he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093/trump-coas-munir-talk-counterterrorism-and-trade-in-cordial-meeting-ispr">met</a> with US President Donald Trump over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">luncheon</a>, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.</p>
<p>During the trip in June, Field Marshal Munir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918382">stressed</a> the “immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect” with Washington.</p>
<p>Today’s <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7386" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said: “In Tampa, COAS attended the Retirement Ceremony of outgoing Commander United States Central Command (Centcom), General Michael E. Kurilla, and the Change of Command Ceremony marking the assumption of command by Admiral Brad Cooper.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>“COAS lauded General Kurilla’s exemplary leadership and his invaluable contributions to strengthening bilateral military cooperation, and extended his best wishes to Admiral Cooper, expressing confidence in continued collaboration to address shared security challenges.</p>
<p>In June, Gen Kurilla hailed Pakistan as a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524/us-centcom-chief-lauds-phenomenal-partner-pakistan-in-counter-terrorism-efforts">phenomenal partner</a>” in the arena of counter-terrorism, citing their struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State.</p>
<p>The field marshal also met with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine, where matters of mutual professional interest were discussed and Munir extended an invitation to General Caine to visit Pakistan.</p>
<p>The army chief also interacted with the chiefs of defence from friendly nations on the sidelines of the meeting, ISPR said.</p>
<p>“During an interactive session with the Pakistani diaspora, COAS urged them to remain confident in Pakistan’s bright future and to actively contribute to attracting investments.</p>
<p>“The diaspora reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Pakistan’s progress and development.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Two siblings were killed and their father injured in a road accident involving a dumper on Karachi’s Rashid Minhas Road near Lucky One Mall early Sunday, sparking mob violence and protests that disrupted traffic on key city routes, officials said.</p>
<p>In recent months, Karachi has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891767">rise</a> in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.</p>
<p>According to Central Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi said that around 3:15am, a dumper truck hit a motorcycle carrying a family, killing Mahnoor, 22, and her 14-year-old brother Ahmed Raza, and injuring their 48-year-old father, Shakir.</p>
<p>Following the incident, transporters staged a protest by blocking Rashid Minhas Road and the Superhighway near Sohrab Goth, causing traffic jams.</p>
<p>“A mob gathered and set fire to a total of seven dumpers on both sides of the road within the limits of Yusuf Plaza and Federal B Area police stations,” the SSP told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>“The police reached the spot to apprehended the driver and took the dumper in custody.”</p>
<p>The police cordoned off the area, set up diversions, and called fire tenders to put off the fire, Siddiqi said.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, police have arrested 14 suspects on charges of torching the dumpers, and more arrests are being made with the help of videos and technical evidence.”</p>
<p>Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told <em>Dawn.com</em> the siblings were brought dead to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, while their father was injured. Quoting relatives, she said the deceased girl was to get married soon.</p>
<p>Dr Summaiya said police brought in two drivers with critical injuries after they were beaten by the mob. She said the alleged errant driver was critically injured but stable, while a driver of another burnt dumper was also in critical condition with head injuries.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan confirmed that seven dumpers were torched near Lucky One Mall in Gulshan-i-Iqbal, adding that the fire tenders controlled the fire. “The heavy vehicles were badly damaged in arson acts,” he said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a high-speed trailer truck <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928663">crashed</a> in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA), injuring two people.</p>
<p>In July, a 59-year-old milk supplier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924967">was killed</a> when a dumper ran over his motorcycle in Karachi’s Saudabad.</p></p>

            <p><p>QUETTA: Iranian Consul General in Quetta Ali Reza Rajaei and President of the Zahidan Chamber of Commerce and Industry Abdul Hakim Regi have invited Balochistan’s industrialists and business community to launch joint ventures with Iranian investors in Mirjaveh Free Zone.</p>
<p>They said that the Iranian government will extend all facilities and incentives for starting joint ventures with Iranian entrepreneurs and investors.</p>
<p>They extended the offer during a meeting with business leaders and representatives of the Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Small Chamber of Commerce and Small Industries and the Pak-Iran Chamber of Commerce in Quetta on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Iranian officials emphasised that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1928471">achieving</a> the $10 billion bilateral trade target between Pakistan and Iran depends on cooperation. They also congratulated Balochistan’s business community on the resumption of Quetta-Zahedan flight services via Mashhad.</p>
<p>The Iranian envoy and members of the delegation expressed satisfaction over recent agreements signed between Pakistani and Iranian officials in Islamabad, including plans to expand bilateral trade to $10bn.</p>
<p>They noted that while official agreements are encouraging, their implementation will not be possible without the cooperation of chambers of commerce and the business community. They stressed that Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan may have different geographies but share common economic interests and trade barriers must be removed collectively.</p>
<p>The delegation agreed to the proposal for forming a transport issue resolution committee and encouraged private-sector initiatives to further enhance bilateral trade.</p>
<p>Earlier, Quetta Chamber President Haji Muhammad Ayub Mariani and Vice President Engineer Mir Wais Khan Kakar highlighted the chamber’s long-standing efforts to promote and strengthen brotherly trade ties with neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>They stressed the need to resolve transport issues and reduce tariffs on imports from each other to boost bilateral trade. They also proposed forming a joint committee — comprising chamber representatives, NLC officials and transport ministry authorities from both countries — to address cross-border goods transport problems. According to them, resolving these issues would create dignified employment opportunities and improve living standards for people in both nations.</p>
