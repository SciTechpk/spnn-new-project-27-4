                <h2>Heavy rain expected countrywide over next two days: Met Office</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday issued an alert for heavy rainfall in several parts of the country, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northeast Punjab, Azad Kashmir and parts of Balochistan, for the next two days.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1852031#:~:text=Monsoon%20rains%20across%20the%20region%20from%20June%20to%20September%20offer%20respite%20from%20the%20summer%20heat%20and%20are%20crucial%20to%20replenishing%20water%20supplies.%20They%20are%20also%20vital%20for%20agriculture%2C%20and%20therefore%20the%20livelihoods%20of%20millions%20of%20farmers%20and%20food%20security%20for%20South%20Asia%E2%80%99s%20nearly%20two%20billion%20people.">fall across</a> the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. They are also vital for agriculture, and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security for South Asia‚Äôs nearly two billion people. However, they also wreak havoc by triggering deadly floods, landslides, and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>The National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922678/19-killed-as-country-braces-for-more-rain">issued</a> an alert for heavy rainfall and a flood-like situation in various parts of the country, while 19 people lost their lives in Balochistan, KP, and the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi due to extreme weather. It said moderate to heavy monsoon rainfall is expected until July 10, particularly in the catchment areas of all major rivers, which will likely cause flash flooding in various regions of Pakistan, according to the NEOC.</p>
<p>In its latest weather update issued today, the Met Office said, ‚ÄúMonsoon rains continue to lash Pakistan, with further downpours expected in upper parts till July 10, 2025.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRain-wind/thundershower are expected today (July 8) in Punjab, KP, Azad Kashmir, GB, northeastern and southern Balochistan and Islamabad.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Met Office added that ‚Äúheavy rainfall is also likely at isolated places in Kashmir, northeastern Punjab, Potohar region, and northeastern and southern Balochistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe public is urged to exercise caution and stay informed as rain continues in the coming days,‚Äù the weather agency advised.</p>
<p>The low-lying areas in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Nowshera and Peshawar are expected to be submerged due to heavy rainfall, it warned.</p>
<p>Islamabad and other areas will receive downpours with strong winds and thunderstorms, while Karachi and other areas of Sindh‚Äôs coastal belt could receive drizzling or light rainfall, it added.</p>
<p>The advisory warned against flooding in rainwater drains and local streams in Murree, Galliyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Abbottabad, Buner, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Nowshera, Swabi, Mardan, Islamabad/Rawalpindi, D.G. Khan, Kashmir and Baluchistan‚Äôs Barkhan, Kohlu, Musakhel, Dera Bugti, Naseerabad, Sibi, Loralai, Zhob, Qalat, Khuzdar, Lasbela, Awaran, Panjgur and Turbat districts.</p>
<p>It cautioned that heavy rainfall and downpours could cause landslides, leading to roadblocks and hurdles in traffic flow in KP districts, Murree, Galliyat and Azad Kashmir.</p>
<p>In the previous 24 hours, several cities recorded heavy to moderate rainfall across Pakistan. In Punjab, Sheikhupura received 48mm, Lahore (City and Airport, 40mm each), Islamabad (Saidpur, 16mm, Zero Point, 12mm, Golra, 9mm), Gujranwala, 6mm, Murree, 5mm, Faisalabad, 4mm, Sialkot, 2mm, Mandi Bahauddin and Hafizabad, 1mm each, and traces of rainfall in Toba Tek Singh, Bahawalnagar, Kasur, and Bahawalpur.</p>
<p>In KP, Balakot received the highest 40mm rainfall, Kakul, 31 mm, Malam Jabba, 17mm, Bannu, 8mm, Lower Dir, 4mm, Cherat, 2mm, Upper Dir, Bajaur, and Ghalanai, 1mm each, and traces of rain in Kalam and Peshawar.</p>
<p>In Sindh, Badin received 4mm of rainfall, Mithi, 2mm, while Jacobabad, Larkana, Hyderabad, and Karachi received traces, while in Balochistan, Kalat received 17mm, Ziarat 12mm, and Lasbella received light rainfall.</p>

                <h2>Not possible for govt to provide housing for all residents of dilapidated buildings: Sharjeel Memon</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>As people continue to be evacuated from nearby structures following a deadly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050">building collapse</a> in Karachi‚Äôs congested Lyari neighbourhood that left <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922486/death-toll-in-lyari-building-collapse-stands-at-27-as-rescue-operation-ends-on-3rd-day">27 people dead</a>, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said on Wednesday it would not be possible for the government to provide housing to all residents living in dilapidated buildings.</p>
<p>The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market collapsed on Friday morning, with the rescue operations concluding on Sunday. The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, with the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) saying it had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922050/at-least-10-dead-9-injured-as-five-storey-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari#:~:text=SBCA%20says%20issued%20multiple%20prior%20notices%20to%20vacate%20building">issued multiple prior notices</a> to residents to vacate the structure since 2023.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>GeoNews</em>, Memon said that there were 740 dilapidated buildings across Sindh, out of which 51 were in ‚Äúextremely dangerous‚Äù condition, out of which 11 buildings had been vacated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOrders have been issued to vacate the others in the next 48 hours for residents‚Äô safety,‚Äù Memon said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, it won‚Äôt be possible for the government to provide housing to all residents living in dilapidated buildings,‚Äù the minister said, adding that there was no such law obligating the government to do so.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNonetheless, the government in the past had provided temporary shelters to flood victims and Covid-19 patients for quarantine,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhatever space is available with the government, we will provide that for housing to the most deserving residents who have no other option available [for housing].‚Äù</p>
<p>Memon‚Äôs comments come a day after the Sindh government announced the suspension of SBCA Director General Ishaque Khuhro over the building collapse.</p>
<p>According to Local Government (LG) Minister Saeed Ghani, other SBCA officials who were suspended included the director, deputy director and building inspectors assigned to Lyari. He also noted that the Sindh government has announced Rs1 million in compensation to the families of the 27 deceased people.</p>
<p>Major opposition parties ‚Äî the PTI, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and Jamaat-i-Islami ‚Äî have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922336/sindh-govt-sbca-earn-oppositions-ire-over-lyari-tragedy">condemned</a> the PPP‚Äôs Sindh government, the SBCA and other authorities, accusing them of ‚Äúcriminal negligence‚Äù that led to the disaster.</p>
<p>They not only demanded compensation and alternative residences for the affected families but also called for the registration of manslaughter cases against the officials responsible for the tragedy.</p>

<p>In April, a 10-year-old girl <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907402/minor-girl-dies-in-building-collapse">died</a> when a three-storey building in Bhains Colony suddenly collapsed, while a man and a woman were pulled alive from the debris.</p>
<p>In October 2023, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1780534/five-killed-as-another-building-going-up-illegally-collapses">five people</a> were killed and four others injured when an under-construction building collapsed in Shah Faisal Colony.</p>
<p>The city witnessed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1579454/2-killed-10-injured-as-second-building-collapses-in-karachi-in-less-than-72-hours">two</a> such <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1578939">incidents</a> within 72 hours in September 2020, claiming the lives of at least three people and injuring over a dozen.</p>
<p>Lyari also faced a similar incident in June 2020, when <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1562672">22 people</a> were killed after a five-storey residential building housing about 40 apartments <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1561975/1-dead-4-injured-after-residential-building-collapses-in-karachis-lyari-neighbourhood?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20dawn-news%20%28Dawn%20News%29">collapsed</a>.</p>
<p>A building collapse in Karachi‚Äôs Gulbahar area in March 2020 killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1539325">27 people</a>. A similar 2011 incident in Lyari‚Äôs Musa Lane neighbourhood took <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/650268/death-toll-from-karachi-building-collapse-at-33">33 lives</a>.</p></p>
