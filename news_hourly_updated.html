                <h2>PM, president stress protecting minority rights, hail their patriotism</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistani leadership, including President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the rights of minorities while hailing their services to the country on Monday, in celebration of National Minorities Day.</p>
<p>National Minorities Day is celebrated on August 11 every year. It commemorates the historic speech by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, made on Aug 11, 1947, where he emphasised equal rights for all citizens regardless of religion. The day aims to highlight the religious and socio-economic rights of minorities in Pakistan.</p>
<p>In separate addresses today, President Zardari and PM Shehbaz both reaffirmed their commitment to safeguarding and advancing the rights of minorities while acknowledging their contributions to the country.</p>
<p>The president reaffirmed his resolve to continue efforts to promote interfaith harmony, brotherhood and unity to build an inclusive and prosperous Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis day reflects Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah‚Äôs vision of a Pakistan where every citizen lives in equality, harmony, and mutual respect,‚Äù he said, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://ppp.org.pk/pr/34450/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>

<p>The president said that the Constitution guaranteed equal rights to all citizens ‚Äúirrespective of religion, caste, creed, or colour‚Äù, and that it safeguarded the political, economic, religious, social and cultural rights of minorities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan stands resolutely against all forms of discrimination, extremism, and religious intolerance,‚Äù he stressed. ‚ÄúWe remain determined to build a society free from prejudice ‚Äî one that embraces diversity as a strength and is anchored in mutual respect, interfaith harmony, and shared progress.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that the day was also an occasion to acknowledge the contributions of the minority communities to nation-building, saying that they had served the country with dedication in the armed forces, judiciary, civil services, education and healthcare.</p>
<p>Their patriotism and service remained a ‚Äúsource of pride for the entire nation‚Äù, he added.</p>
<p>The president noted measures taken by the country for the welfare and empowerment of minorities, including the establishment of the National Commission for Minorities, allocation of a Minorities Welfare Fund, restoration and preservation of places of worship and provision of scholarships and financial assistance to minority students.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe continue to promote interfaith dialogue and ensure meaningful participation of minorities in every sphere of national life,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>In a separate address, PM Shehbaz also reaffirmed the government‚Äôs commitment to the full inclusion of minorities in government institutions, Parliament and the national mainstream while appreciating their role in the country‚Äôs development and progress.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe welfare and well-being of all minorities in Pakistan, be they Sikhs, Christians, Hindus (or) Parsis, is one of the priority duties of the government of Pakistan,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He emphasised the services rendered by minorities ‚Äúin every walk of life‚Äù, including those who had sacrificed their lives defending Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe pay tribute to them from the bottom of our hearts,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPakistan is proud of its minorities‚Äô patriotism, professional hard work and attachment to national heritage and culture.‚Äù</p>
<p>The PM also stressed that protecting minority rights, aside from a constitutional obligation, was also a religious duty, saying, ‚ÄúIslam specifically advocates the protection of civil, religious and social rights of minorities. Ulema and religious leaders play a key role in protecting religious freedom.‚Äù</p>
<p>He called on all Pakistanis to practise unity and solidarity, mutual respect and tolerance.</p>
<p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also acknowledged National Minorities Day, appreciating the role of minorities in the development of the country.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe true strength and beauty of Pakistan lies in its diversity,‚Äù he said in a post on social media, calling the safeguarding and respecting of minority rights an ‚Äúunbreakable pillar of the country‚Äôs democratic vision‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur struggle is for a Pakistan where no citizen feels isolated or unsafe due to their religion, but where bonds of brotherhood rise above prejudice.‚Äù</p>

<p>Tarar called the occasion a ‚Äúsolemn reminder of our shared responsibility to ensure that every citizen of Pakistan enjoys equality, justice, and respect, irrespective of faith‚Äù.</p>
<p>He echoed the messages of the PM and president, emphasising the vision of the country‚Äôs founding father for a state ‚Äúwhere religion would never hinder the rights, dignity, or equal standing of its people‚Äù, as well as Islamic teachings to ‚Äúuphold justice without exception‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet us pledge to build a Pakistan where diversity is celebrated, unity is our strength, and justice remains our guiding principle‚Äù, the minister said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CM Murad condemned intolerance against minorities and reaffirmed the province‚Äôs commitment to peaceful co-existence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur beloved Sindh has always been tolerant and progressive in terms of religious freedom,‚Äù he said while addressing a gathering at a Hindu temple in Karachi. During his speech, he compared the province to ‚Äúintolerant‚Äù Western democracies.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn our province, across the board, we condemn actions against minorities because we are the land of Sufis,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúThe Sufis of Sindh have always given the same lesson, which is that we should all co-exist in peace and harmony.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am happy to see today that our Hindu, Sikh and Parsi brothers are standing and celebrating the day together.‚Äù</p>
<p>He reaffirmed that the government of Sindh would ‚Äúalways stand with minorities‚Äù and that action would always be taken against any ‚Äúunfortunate incident‚Äù against minorities in Sindh.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the Sindh Workers Welfare Board decided to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929987/sindh-govt-to-extend-e-bike-scheme-to-minority-workers">extend</a> its upcoming electric bikes scheme beyond women to industrial workers from minority communities.</p>
<p>However, despite the leadership‚Äôs statements, religious freedom remains a challenge in Pakistan, with recurring incidents of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1837480">mob attacks</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918828">forced conversions</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1841740">blasphemy cases</a>, as noted by the European Union‚Äôs Sebastien Lorion.</p>
<p>Last month, State Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Kesoo Mal Kheal Das <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904861">acknowledged</a> that religious minorities in the country face administrative and governance issues.</p>
<p>According to Kheal Das, the law for the establishment of the National Commission for Minority Rights has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904861">approved</a> by both houses of the parliament and awaits presidential assent.</p></p>

                <h2>7 dead, 6 injured in GB‚Äôs Danyor as landslide hits volunteers restoring water supply</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least seven volunteers died and six were injured early on Monday when a landslide hit individuals working at a water channel in Gilgit-Baltistan‚Äôs (GB) Danyor city, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate cha¬≠nge and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660/situationer-unprecedented-melting-in-g-b">melting glaciers</a> have become more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921009/at-least-8-dead-13-injured-in-rain-related-incidents-across-gb-punjab-and-sindh-officials#:~:text=two%20sisters%20died%20after%20being%20swept%20away">late June</a>.</p>
<p>The situation worsened when deadly floods <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20so%20far%2C%2010%20fatalities%20and%20four%20injuries%20have%20been%20reported">10 deaths</a> have been confirmed across the region, with a dozen tourists <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928659/funeral-held-in-absentia-for-missing-tourists-in-gbs-babusar-after-14-days-of-search-efforts">missing</a>.</p>
<p>Thirteen volunteers, mainly young people, were attempting to restore the water supply in the main water channel from Danyor nullah to Danyor town, which had been damaged due to the recent floods, when the landslide hit at 2am today.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThirteen volunteers restoring the water supply were buried under the rubble,‚Äù Gilgit‚Äôs Rescue 1122 said in a statement.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Stating the casualties, it said the injured were taken to a hospital. District Emergency Officer (operations) Abdul Basit was present at the site to supervise the restoration, Rescue 1122 added.</p>
<p>Muhammad Akbar, one of the residents who took part in the rescue operations, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the bodies and injured had been moved to ‚Äúvarious hospitals in Gilgit and Danyor‚Äù.</p>
<p>On July 22, a flash flood in Danyor nullah <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930#:~:text=Rescue%201122%20said%20a%20flash%20flood%20in%20Danyor%20nallah%20inundated%20residential%20communities">inundated</a> residential communities and damaged crops and irrigation channels. The deluge also damaged link roads and suspension bridges, cutting road links to affected areas.</p>
<p>Hussain Akbar Shah, another local, said thousands of Danyor residents were facing a shortage of drinking water and irrigation water as the valley depended on water from the nullah.</p>
<p>A statement by the GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq stated that the total number of volunteers was 15, out of whom seven were confirmed dead.</p>
<p>An emergency has been declared at hospitals in Gilgit, the spokesperson added. ‚ÄúOur hearts are saddened by this unfortunate accident. Gilgit is in a state of mourning,‚Äù Faraq said.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Funeral prayers were later held for the volunteers who died in the incident. Residents also protested at Danyor Chowk against the incident, holding the government responsible for it.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters, area elders led by former GB minister Muhammad Iqbal said the government had failed to res¬≠tore the disrupted water supply despite repeated assurances.</p>
<p>The elders noted that although residents had managed to temporarily restore the pipeline, subsequent flooding destroyed it again, while the government had not started work on it. The protesters demanded that the government take action, or they would launch protests.</p>
<p>GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan expressed his condolences on the incident and announced compensation for the bereaved families.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe families of those who died in the Danyor nullah [incident] will receive compensation as per the government policy,‚Äù CM Gulbar said, directing that the wounded be provided with the best medical treatment.</p></p>
