            <p><p>• Many goods, services will now be taxed at higher rates<br />
• Lower rates for digital payments versus cash transactions set to replace distinction between filers, non-filers<br />
•  Some relief expected for salaried persons earning around Rs100,000 per month</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Facing limited room for fresh tax measures, the Shehbaz Sharif-led coalition government has resorted to rebranding taxation — shifting from “broadening the tax base” to pursuing “equity” — in an effort to justify higher taxes on lower-income segments. This transition comes as the government eyes a record revenue target of nearly Rs14 trillion for FY26, a 22 per cent increase over projections for the outgoing fiscal year.</p>
<p>Tied to its commitments under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, the government estimates autonomous revenue collection at Rs12.845tr, based on 4.2pc GDP growth and 7.5pc inflation.</p>
<p>To meet the ambitious target, the government will need an additional Rs655 billion in new tax measures and another Rs400bn through enforcement — figures expected to be finalised in Tuesday’s cabinet meeting ahead of Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s budget speech.</p>
<p>The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) faces significant challenges in meeting its tax collection targets, as doubts persist over its ability to enforce existing tax laws effectively.</p>
<p>Despite concerns about sluggish field operations, no substantial measures have been introduced to bolster enforcement in recent years. An initiative to provide operational vehicles to field officers was also withdrawn following backlash.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ministry of Finance officials continue to present optimistic projections, seemingly hoping for a tax windfall without acknowledging economic headwinds. Large-scale ind­us­tries remain in decline, while sectors like real estate and consumption goods bear the brunt of excessive taxation, further dampening economic activity.</p>
<p>With key industries contracting and consumer confidence fading, the feasibility of achieving ambitious revenue targets remains highly questionable in the next fiscal year.</p>
<p>The government’s proposed tax-to-GDP ratio target for FY26 is 12.3pc, comprising FBR’s share (10.6pc of GDP), provincial collections and the petroleum development levy (PDL).</p>
<p>Moreover, revenue collection could face further setbacks due to a lower-than-expected <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914987/govt-to-prioritise-high-value-projects-as-development-budget-stands-at-rs880bn-only-ahsan-iqbal">allocation</a> for the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), which includes fewer new projects. The federal PSDP also remains notably smaller than those of Punjab and Sindh.</p>
<p>Compounding the issue, the federal government is now seeking financial contributions from Punjab and Sindh to fund dam construction, an unusual move that underscores fiscal limitations at the Centre. These factors create added pressure, as the federal government struggles to balance tax collection efforts with a constrained development budget.</p>
<p><strong>From broadening to equity</strong></p>
<p>Officials involved in tax policy formulation indicate that the government is now moving from tax broadening measures to a new approach centred on equity. This shift means lower tax rates on a wide range of goods and services will be raised, a move the FBR anticipates will generate maximum revenue.</p>
<p>Under the earlier broadening strategy, exemptions were systematically withdrawn, even on essential products like food, stationery items and books, to expand the tax base.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Now, in the second phase, the FBR is introducing “equity” as a justification for increasing lower tax rates across various sectors. This approach will result in a series of hikes in withholding tax rates, targeting dividends, stock markets and other financial transactions.</p>
<p>It is also proposed to levy taxes at the Thresher Unit Level, which would require the use of larger machines to improve the quality of tobacco processing — an effort aimed at increasing revenue collection from the tobacco sector.</p>
<p>At the same time, the FBR intends to implement a new concept of transactions using banking instruments, applying lower tax rates to digital transactions and higher rates to cash-based ones.</p>
<p>This concept will replace the current distinction between filers and non-filers.</p>
<p>However, the real test lies ahead — whether these increased tax rates will bolster revenue collection or further stifle economic activity, particularly as key industries and investment sectors struggle under mounting financial pressures. As part of its proposed new tax measures, the FBR is preparing to introduce a new tax on solar panels, processed food items and a carbon tax, signalling an effort to expand revenue streams amid fiscal constraints.</p>
<p>The tax measures are likely to spark concerns among consumers and businesses, particularly in the renewable energy sector. A tax on solar panels could dampen incentives for clean energy adoption at a time when Pakistan faces mounting electricity costs and energy shortages. Similarly, additional taxation on processed foods may lead to higher consumer prices, affecting household budgets.</p>
<p>However, in a move to provide temporary relief to the agricultural sector, the government has secured an exemption from the IMF on fertilisers and pesticides.</p>
<p>This exemption, extended for another year, will alleviate cost pressures on farmers struggling with rising input prices and uncertain market conditions.</p>
<p>While the government tightens fiscal measures in other sectors, some relief is expected for the salaried class in lower tax slabs. Officials indicate that the exemption limit may be further raised, alongside a lower tax rate for individuals earning around Rs100,000 per month.</p>
<p><strong>Fiscal challenges</strong></p>
<p>While this move aims to stimulate domestic manufacturing and enhance production capacity, it comes at a cost to government revenue. The reduction in import duties will significantly lower tax collection at the import stage, creating further fiscal challenges for an already strained revenue system.</p>
<p>The government is also considering extending the tax measures to former Fata and Pata members, who are exempt until June 30, 2025. This will be another area where the government plans to include tax measures in the budget. However, the Sindh government has asked the federal government to avoid all taxes, including the agriculture income tax on farm products.</p>
<p>Former FBR chairman Dr Irshad Ahmed criticised the government’s persistent reliance on policy measures, arguing that new tax measures alone would not resolve systemic revenue challenges. According to him, such additional revenue merely increases the burden on existing taxpayers while failing to expand the tax base effectively.</p>
<p>Dr Ahmed stressed that the core issue lies in enforcement, which requires a complete overhaul of the FBR’s field formations. He pointed out that officers remain confined to their offices with little access to potential taxpayers, rendering tax collection efforts ineffective.</p>
<p>He also recalled a previous attempt to establish strong tax offices at the district level, an initiative that was ultimately blocked by bureaucratic resistance.</p>
<p>Despite possessing ext­en­sive taxpayer data, FBR lacks the capacity to analyse it effectively and identify tax evaders. Add­ressing these gaps requires significant investment in capacity-building, infrastructure and operational enhancements — elements currently missing from the government’s strategy.</p>
<p>Without a robust enforcement framework, new revenue measures will provide only a temporary financial boost, while those outside the tax net continue to evade their dues.</p>

<p>• Major crops down 13.5pc amid water crisis, restricting agriculture and overall GDP growth<br />
• Industry, services underperform; large-scale manufacturing struggles for third straight year<br />
• Inflation drops to 4.6pc, a 60-year low, amid declining interest rates<br />
• Finance czar calls it ‘a gradual recovery’, promises ‘turnaround’ next year<br />
• GDP growth reaches 2.68pc, missing 3.56pc target</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: “Next year will be a turnaround story,” Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb promised on Monday as he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916059/fantastic-story-on-inflation-economic-survey-shows-ambitious-gdp-growth-for-fy25">unveiled</a> the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25 (PES) document, which highlighted widespread slippages across major sectors of the economy in the outgoing fiscal year.</p>
<p>Reviewing the economy report card, the finance minister suggested that Pakistan’s performance should be evaluated in a global context rather than a historical one.</p>
<p>He stated that while global economic growth has been on a declining trend, expanding 3.5pc in 2023, 3.3pc in 2024, and 2.8pc in 2025, Pakistan had progressed from a contraction of 0.2pc in 2023 to 2.5pc growth in 2024, with a further rise to almost 2.7pc this year.</p>
<p>“This is gradual recovery, and the right way to ensure sustainable growth,” he insisted, adding that no one wanted a return to the boom-and-bust cycles of the past.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The current year’s GDP growth will clock in at 2.68pc; well short of the 3.56pc target, although slightly improved from last year’s 2.5pc. It is below the five-year average of around 3.3pc, and well below Pakistan’s long-term average of over 4.5pc.</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb noted that global inflation stood at 2.6pc in 2023, rose to 2.7pc in 2024, and is projected to reach 3.1pc in 2025. In contrast, inflation in Pakistan had fallen from 29pc in 2023 to 23pc in 2024, and now to a six-decade low of 4.6pc.</p>
<p>“So, this too has moved in the right direction,” Mr Aurangzeb remarked, noting that the benchmark interest rate had been reduced by a cumulative 1,100 basis points during the current year to 11pc, down from a peak of 22pc. Resultantly, the public debt-to-GDP ratio declined from 68pc last year to 65pc, aided by the government’s buyback of approximately Rs1 trillion in debt, which created additional fiscal space, the minister said.</p>
<p><strong>Missed targets</strong></p>
<p>The Economic Survey data reveals that almost all major components of the economy missed targets. The finance minister singled out a 13.5pc contraction in major crops, which was estimated to have restricted the overall GDP growth rate by 0.6pc. The overall agriculture sector, which accounts for nearly 24pc of GDP, posted modest growth of 0.6pc this year, falling well short of the 2pc target and significantly below last year’s announced growth of 6.4pc. Major crops such as wheat, cotton, and maize contracted by 13.5pc, a sharper decline than an estimated 4.5pc.</p>
<p>This was primarily due to initial estimates of a 35pc water shortage, which were later revised down to 11-12pc. As a result, cotton ginning saw a 19pc decline, compared to last year’s growth of 0.1pc, and well below a targeted contraction limit of 2.3pc.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the industrial sector was announced to have shown 4.8pc growth, surpassing the 4.4pc target. This triggered some pointed questions, however. A journalist commented that it seemed likely the industry’s performance would later be revised downward, given that an almost 1pc contraction had been reported for the first nine months of the current year.</p>
<p>Within industries, mining and quarrying contracted by 3.4pc against a growth target of 5pc, shrinking for the third consecutive year. Likewise, Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM), which contributes nearly 8pc to GDP, contracted by 1.5pc, falling far short of the growth target of 3.5pc.</p>
<p>This also marked the third consecutive year of struggles for LSM, which saw a 10pc contraction in fiscal ’23, followed by less than 1pc growth in fiscal ’24 (that too, owing to a low base effect), and followed by an additional 1.5pc contraction this year.</p>
<p>The services sector, which makes up nearly 59pc of GDP, was said to have posted growth of 2.9pc, well short of the 4.1pc target. Within the services sector, wholesale and retail trade, transport and storage, financial and insurance services, and private services all missed targets, whereas government services, education and similar sectors that outperformed expectations.</p>
<p>Separately, the investment-to-GDP ratio improved to 13.8pc in fiscal ’25, up from 13.1pc in fiscal ’24, although falling short of the 14.2pc target. Private investment grew by 9.1pc, slightly below the 9.7pc target. National savings also saw an improvement, rising to 14.1pc of GDP, surpassing the 13.3pc target.</p>
<p><strong>Indian meddling</strong></p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb said structural reforms aimed at transforming the foundations of Pakistan’s economy would have remained elusive without the ongoing 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme. The programme, he noted, had supported taxation reforms that raised the tax-to-GDP ratio to a five-year high and contributed to a reduction in power sector losses.</p>
<p>The minister described the recent release of a $1bn tranche by the IMF as a major success, achieved “against all odds.” For the first time publicly, it was revealed that India had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909885">actively opposed</a> the move.</p>
<p>“Just as our armed forces fought for a victory, a similar battle was being fought on the economic front,” he said, claiming that the Indian executive director at the IMF had made every effort to keep Pakistan’s case off the board’s agenda, or, if it was included, to block both the second instalment of the EFF as well as a new $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility, which is crucial for Pakistan’s climate adaptation financing needs.</p>
<p>But Pakistan’s bilateral allies and multilateral partners stood by the country and offered their support, Mr Aurangzeb said, while also acknowledging that this outcome would not have been possible without the strength of Pakistan’s economic performance.</p>
<p><strong>Reform-centric budget</strong></p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb also stated that reforms in public finance, including pension reforms, rightsizing of government, and privatisation of public sector entities, would be pushed through, and this would be evident in the budget to be presented on Tuesday (today).</p>
<p>The minister avoided multiple questions regarding the quality of data, and the use of May-June projections to calculate growth numbers instead of relying on actual data. However, he affirmed his support for the published data, stating that, as finance minister, he stood behind it.</p>
<p>He also expressed his support for the inclusion of members from the private sector on the board of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, which is responsible for the Economic Survey report.</p>

            <p><p>LAHORE: Although the country’s total installed power generation capacity is set to rise to 46,605 megawatts in the outgoing fiscal year (FY25), substantial capacity payments to idle power plants continue to burden electricity consumers nationwide.</p>
<p>However, energy experts in both the public and private sectors remain optimistic that this capacity payment burden — estimated at Rs12 to Rs15 per unit and passed on to consumers — will gradually decline, as the government has halted new power projects and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1864412">terminated</a> power purchase agreements (PPAs) with several independent power producers (IPPs).</p>
<p>“The issue of capacity payments is not considered very painful during summer, but it becomes more significant in winter when our total electricity demand drops to just 12,000-13,000 MW,” a senior official at the Ministry of Energy told <em>Dawn</em> on Monday.</p>
<p>According to the Economic Survey, the country’s total installed electricity generation capacity reached 46,605MW, with the energy mix comprising hydel (24.4 per cent), thermal (55.7pc), nuclear (7.8pc) and renewables (12.5pc).</p>

    </figure></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Economic Survey puts total installed power generation capacity at 46,605MW</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During July-March FY25, total electricity generation stood at 90,145GWh — hydel (30.4pc), thermal (46.3pc), nuclear (19.1pc), and renewables (4.2pc). Electricity consumption during the same period was 80,111GWh, with households accounting for 49.6pc, industrial users 26.3pc, agriculture 5.7pc, and commercial consumers 8.6pc.</p>
<p>According to the survey, six nuclear power plants with a total capacity of 3,530MW supplied 17,174 million units of electricity during July-March FY25.</p>
<p>The 46,605MW installed capacity includes an addition of over 2,800MW through solar net metering, reflecting a 1.6pc increase compared to the 45,888MW recorded in the corresponding period of FY24.</p>
<p>While thermal power still makes up the largest portion of the electricity supply at 55.7pc, its share has declined in recent years, indicating a shift towards more indigenous and sustainable sources. Hydel, nuclear and renewable sources now collectively account for 53.7pc of total electricity generation.</p>
<p>“If we examine the total installed capacity, almost 50pc comes from IPPs, including around 5,000MW from four RLNG plants owned by the Punjab and federal governments. Excluding these, the share of IPPs is around 16,000-17,000MW. Of this, 4,000-5,000MW worth of plants remain under annual maintenance. Meanwhile, the generation capacity of old government-owned plants at Guddu (Gencos) has also reduced to almost half or so. So, the generation from IPPs usually stays around 10,000MW during summer,” explained an official, on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>According to him, total generation from IPPs, hydel, nuclear and other non-IPP sources ranges between 33,000MW and 34,000MW, while demand reaches around 32,000MW. “Thus, we roughly pay capacity charges for 1,000-2,000MW in summer and 3,000-5,000MW in winter, when hydel generation declines due to reduced water availability,” he said, adding that terminating PPAs with idle IPPs and halting new power projects would help reduce the overall tariffs.</p>
<p>Dr Fayyaz A. Chaudhry, chairman of the Board of Directors of National Grid Company of Pakistan (formerly NTDC), said the system’s firm capacity — the amount that can be dispatched to the power grid at any time — is around 40,000MW.</p>
<p>He noted that solar power generation, including 4,000-5,000MW from net-metered systems and additional non-net-metered capacity, is not considered firm capacity because it’s unavailable in the evening.</p>

            <p><p>Florence in Italy could hit 39C as hot weather sweeps continent, while parts of South Africa brace for snow</p><p>The severe thunderstorms that have been lashing parts of Europe over recent days are expected to give way to high temperatures this week. Several regions could climb to 10C (50F) above seasonal norms, with Italy braced for the full force of the heat. Florence in Tuscany is forecast to soar to a sweltering 39C on Thursday and across the weekend.</p><p>Germany, France and Belgium will also face hot weather from Wednesday, with widespread highs at least 9C above the June average. Many other parts of Europe are forecast to experience temperatures 5-7C above normal. This is the result of a high-pressure system creating a heat dome over the region, whereby sinking air compresses and warms as it descends, trapping heat near the surface.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/09/weather-tracker-storms-summer-heat-europe-south-africa">Continue reading...</a></p>
