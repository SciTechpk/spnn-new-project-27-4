            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910505/psx-jacks-up-record-9pc-in-intraday-trade-as-ceasefire-with-india-holds' target='_blank'><strong>PSX jacks up record 9pc in intraday trade as ceasefire with India holds</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) gained a record nine per cent on Monday during intraday trade — the restored calm in the markets mirroring that of a recent Pakistan-India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> that boosted investor mood.</p>
<p>Saturday’s ceasefire, announced by US President Donald Trump, followed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">four days</a> of tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">strikes</a> between the nuclear-armed neighbours, as well as diplomacy and pressure from Washington.</p>
<p>The KSE-100 index opened with a gain of 9,929.48 points, or 9.26pc, to stand at 117,104.11 points from the previous close of 107,174.63 at 9:30am.</p>
<p>Due to the massive gains, the PSX was suspended for an hour after opening to control excessive volatility.</p>
<p>Later, the benchmark index stood at 116,857.00 points, 9,682.37 points (9.03pc) higher than yesterday’s close, at 1:30pm.</p>
<p>“The market has reacted jubilantly to the ceasefire announcement after Pakistan established effective <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910381/deterrence-re-established-say-armed-forces">deterrence against India</a>,” noted Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>“The PSX has saluted the Pakistan Air Force this morning with a surge of over 9pc in the KSE-100 Index,” he remarked, in reference to the PAF’s actions in response to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186">India’s strikes</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Farooq noted that the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908601/sbp-cuts-interest-rate-by-100bps-to-11pc">interest rate cut</a> and the approval of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">$1 billion tranche</a> by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) “further fueled investor enthusiasm”.</p>
<p>Commenting on the future investor mood, Farooq said market participants were now expected to shift their focus towards the upcoming federal budget for the next fiscal year, which is <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909569">expected on June 2</a>.</p>
<p>Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, listed three main reasons for the robust market activity.</p>
<p>Other than the ceasefire and the IMF’s green light to the disbursement, Tariq mentioned US President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910382/kashmir-takes-centre-stage-as-fragile-ceasefire-holds">recent statement</a> on increasing trade with Pakistan.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">mediating</a> the halt of hostilities between the South Asian arch-rivals, Trump not only offered his help in resolving the Kashmir dispute but also announced he would “increase trade substantially” with both Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, pointed out the heightened possibility of further improving ties with Gulf countries due to Pakistan’s enhanced geopolitical position.</p>
<p>“This brief conflict has also demonstrated our military and technological superiority over India, strengthening our geopolitical position. As a result, it is likely to enhance ties with Gulf countries amid regional tensions and support growth in our defence and technology exports,” Ashraf told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>While noting the investor zest in light of the Pak-India “conflict ending with dominance”, he said the attention was now expected to shift towards improving macroeconomic indicators, including <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908067">historically low inflation</a> and a record-high current account surplus.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s consumer inflation rate plunged to an all-time low of 0.3pc year-on-year <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908067">in April</a>, while the $1.195bn current account surplus <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904945">in March</a> was the highest-ever monthly surplus.</p>
<p>Indian shares also rallied today.</p>

            <p><p>The United States and China announced on Monday an agreement to drastically reduce tit-for-tat tariffs for 90 days, de-escalating a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904617">trade war</a> that has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902788">roiled</a> financial markets and raised <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905525">fears</a> of a global economic downturn.</p>
<p>After their first talks since US President Donald Trump launched his trade war, the world’s two biggest economies agreed in a joint statement to bring their triple-digit tariffs down to two figures and continue negotiations.</p>
<p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the weekend talks with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and international trade representative Li Chenggang as “productive” and “robust”.</p>
<p>“Both sides showed a great respect,” Bessent told reporters.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903391">imposed</a> duties of 145 per cent on imports for China last month — compared to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902420">10pc</a> for other countries in the global tariff blitz he launched last month.</p>
<p>Beijing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903545">hit back</a> with duties of 125pc on US goods.</p>
<p>Bessent said the two sides agreed to reduce those tariffs by 115pc, taking US tariffs to 30pc and those by China to 10pc.</p>
<p>In their statement, the two sides agreed to “establish a mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations”.</p>
<p>China hailed the “substantial progress” made at the talks.</p>
<p>“This move… is in the interest of the two countries and the common interest of the world,” the Chinese commerce ministry said, adding that it hoped Washington would keep working with China “to correct the wrong practice of unilateral tariff rises”.</p>
<p>The dollar, which tumbled after Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905287">launched</a> his tariff blitz in April, rallied on the news while US stock futures soared. European and Asian markets also rallied.</p>
<p>The trade dispute between Washington and Beijing has rocked financial markets, raising fears the tariffs would rekindle inflation and cause a global economic downturn.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#bodes-well-for-the-future" id="bodes-well-for-the-future" title="Permalink"></a>‘Bodes well for the future’</h2>
<p>The head of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, praised the talks on Sunday as a “significant step forward” that “bode well for the future”.</p>
<p>“Amid current global tensions, this progress is important not only for the US and China but also for the rest of the world, including the most vulnerable economies,” she added.</p>
<p>Ahead of the meeting at the discreet villa residence of Switzerland’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Trump had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909866/trump-floats-cutting-china-tariffs-to-80pc">signalled</a> he might lower the tariffs, suggesting on social media that an “80% Tariff on China seems right!”</p>
<p>However, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified that the United States would not lower tariffs unilaterally, saying China would also need to make concessions.</p>
<p>The Geneva meeting came days after Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909458">unveiled</a> a trade agreement with Britain, the first with any country since he unleashed his blitz of global tariffs.</p>
<p>The five-page, nonbinding deal confirmed to nervous investors that Washington was willing to negotiate sector-specific relief from recent duties.</p>
<p>But Trump maintained a 10pc levy on most British goods, and threatened to keep it in place as a baseline rate for most other countries.</p></p>

            <p><p>• ISPR DG says 26 Indian sites struck, response textbook demonstration of integrated tri-services<br />
• Indian military dodges question about loss of fighter jets</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s armed forces on Sunday said they struck 26 Indian targets in ‘<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a>’ to re-establish deterrence after India violated Pakistan’s airspace earlier this week and separately targeted air bases in early-morning strikes.</p>
<p>In a press conference alongside Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Director General Public Relations Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed and Naval Staff (Operations) Deputy Chief Vice Admiral Raja Rab Nawaz, Pakistan Army’s chief spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared details about the operation.</p>
<p>He said the dastardly attacks began on the night of May 6 and 7, resulting in the loss of innocent civilian lives, including women, children and the elderly. He said one Pakistani aircraft was slightly damaged during the Indian missile attack.</p>
<p>“Twenty-six military targets, along with facilities in India used to target Pakistani citizens and entities involved in fomenting terrorism in Pakistan, were engaged in both Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and mainland India,” he said in the presser.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Gen Chaudhry said Pakistan’s response was a “textbook demonstration” of integrated tri-services, enabled by real-time situational awareness, network-centric warfare capabilities and seamless multidomain operations.</p>
<p>“The targets included air force and aviation bases at Suratgarh, Sirsa, Adampur, Bhooj, Nalia, Bathinda, Barnala, Halwara, Avantipura, Srinagar, Jammu, Mamoon, Ambala, Udampur and Pathankot — all of which sustained major damages,” he added.</p>
<p>The DG said Brahmos facilities, which had fired missiles in Pakistan and killed innocent civilians, were also destroyed.</p>

<p>India launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">series of strikes</a> under ‘Operation Sindoor’ soon after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam tragedy</a> in the early hours of May 7 across Pakistan, in which 31 people were martyred. Pakistan’s military responded swiftly, downing five Indian jets, destroying Indian brigade headquarters, and check posts in the occupied Kashmir along the Line of Control.</p>
<p>The ISPR chief paid tribute to those who were martyred in the Indian aggression and their families, while praying for the speedy recovery of the wounded.</p>
<p>“We extend our heartfelt gratitude to every officer, soldier, airman and sailor of the Armed Forces of Pakistan who made this success on the battlefield possible through their courage, professionalism and sacrifice.”</p>
<p>The military spokesperson particularly thanked the youth of Pakistan — “who became the frontline soldiers as information and cyber warriors of the country” — and the media that stood as a “steel wall” against the Indian media. He also appreciated politicians for their support to the army during these times and lauded the premier for taking “destiny-changing decisions” during this testing time</p>
<p><strong>War not an option</strong></p>

        <figcaption class="media__caption  ">LAHORE: People wave flags atop a truck as they take part in a rally to support the armed forces, a day after the ceasefire announcement between India and Pakistan.—Reuters</figcaption>
    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to a question about who first requested for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>, the DG ISPR said: “Put it on record that Pakistan never requested for a ceasefire.”</p>
<p>He warned that there was no space for a war between two nuclear-armed nations. “if anyone wants to carve out this space for war, he is actually carving out the space for mutual annihilation,” he added.</p>
<p>He said: “This is why you saw how in this conflict Pakistan acted in a very mature manner and through conventional forces, we maintained escalation control, through conventional forces we gave them a two notch up response while also ensuring that the Pakistan forces employed on the counterterrorism operations … no pull is also exerted on them.”</p>
<p><strong>IAF airfields hit</strong></p>
<p>Air Vice Marshal Ahmed, while describing Pakistan’s response to the Indian Air Force, said the PAF’s response was based “on the time and place of own choosing”, displaying “bold, aggressive and unwavering resolve of the brave military leadership”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“I must appreciate the leadership … they were resolute and clear in giving instructions to all of us and that is perhaps the reason why we were so sure about what we had to do,” he said.</p>
<p>“With unprecedented reach, precision and lethality, while avoiding collateral, the PAF hit maximum number of IAF airfields in a single operational package since 1971 because they crossed the international border,” the officer said.</p>
<p>“While reestablishing deterrence, Pakistan negated the setting of a new normal under the hegemonistic design of a supremacist regime through swift and effective response.”</p>
<p><strong>Sea frontiers</strong></p>
<p>Vice Admiral Rab Nawaz said the Pakistan Navy was able to defend the country’s sea frontiers from a “numerically superior enemy”.</p>
<p>He gave details of the navy’s readiness to thwart any attack from the sea. He said there was a hype that INS Vikrant (Indian fleet) was approaching Karachi. “We were keeping a very close eye on the activities at sea […] we were monitoring it from day one,” he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“On the night of May 6 and 7, it was close to Bombay and on May 9, it was essentially 400 nautical miles from the Pakistani coast and it retreated close to Bombay,” he said.</p>
<p>“If a carrier gets within 400 nautical miles, it simplifies our problem. The navy maritime air arm was proper ready to generate a response at all times. If there was any aggression from the sea we were ready to respond effectively,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Indian military dodges question</strong></p>
<p>Indian military officers, meanwhile, said that the objectives of ‘Operation Sindoor’ were achieved, with ‘high-value terrorists’ being eliminated, but dodged a question whether they had lost a bunch of warplanes in the operation.</p>
<p>The officers, speaking at a press conference, provided key details on Operation Sindoor, its impact and results, saying that the “objective has been achieved”.</p>
<p>Air Marshal AK Bharti, DGMO Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai, Maj Gen SS Sharma and Vice Admiral AN Pramod addressed the press. Responding to reports that Rafale fighter jets were downed, Air Marshal AK Bharti did not confirm or deny the claims, stating instead that “losses are a part of any combat scenario”.</p>
<p>The Indian military said, “We are in a combat scenario and losses are a part of it. Question is that ‘have we achieved our objective’? Answer is a thumping yes. As for details, at this time I would not like to comment on that, as we are still in combat, and give advantage to (our) adversary. All our pilots are back home.”</p>
