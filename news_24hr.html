            <p><p>At least three tourists were killed, four others were injured and 15 went missing after floods triggered by heavy rain swept through Gilgit-Baltistan’s (GB) Babusar area in Diamer district on Monday.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities.</p>
<p>According to Faizullah Firaq, spokesperson for the GB government, three bodies were recovered from flood debris today, while four injured people were transported to a hospital in Chilas.</p>
<p>“Fifteen other tourists have gone missing, as eight tourist vehicles were washed away in the raging flood,” Firaq said in a statement. “Medical assistance for the injured is ongoing, with one individual in critical condition.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that communication systems were disrupted due to a fibre optic break, while thousands of tourists were stranded and communication with their homes had been cut off.</p>
<p>“The government has successfully rescued hundreds of stranded tourists on Babusar Highway, and many have sought shelter with local residents,” Firaq said.</p>
<p>“The GB chief minister has ordered that all available resources be used to rescue those stranded. The Babusar Highway is closed at multiple points, with roads and farmland severely damaged.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amir Khadam Khan, spokesperson for Rescue 1122 Mansehra, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that Jalkhad road in Naran was blocked by large stones and debris due to heavy rain in the area.</p>
<p>“According to initial reports, a car is stuck in the debris,” Khan said. “Fortunately, no loss of life or property has been reported so far.”</p>
<p>The National Highways Authority (NHA) deployed heavy machinery from nearby places to start the process of clearing the road and restoring traffic.</p>
<p>A Rescue 1122 ambulance also reached the scene to provide assistance in case of any possible emergency.</p>
<p>On June 29, the GB Disaster Management Authority issued a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925556">warning</a> of increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glof) and flash floods. The public and tourists were advised to avoid going near rivers, streams and other waterways, and avoid bathing or washing clothes in streams since the water flow can reach dangerous levels.</p>

<p>Shafiqa Gul, spokesperson for the Rescue 1122, North region, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the incident occurred due to heavy rain.</p>
<p>She said that the house collapsed due to heavy rain, burying three children and a woman underneath.</p>
<p>“Three siblings and their mother were critically injured and moved to Civil Hospital Madyan for treatment,” she said, adding that a rescue team was immediately dispatched and reached the scene as soon as the control room in Swat received information.</p>
<p>She said that according to doctors, the three children died in the accident while their mother was seriously injured.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said that there will be more monsoon rains in the province until July 25, according to a statement.</p>
<p>According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the Malakand and Hazara divisions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the southern parts of Punjab and Sindh, eastern Balochistan and parts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) were expected to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925556">receive</a> rain and thunderstorms with strong winds.</p>
<p>Rain and thunderstorms were forecast for urban centres of Punjab in the south, such as Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur and Dera Ghazi Khan, though overall weather of the province was expected to remain partly cloudy and humid.</p>
<p>According to the PDMA, Punjab will receive a fourth wave of monsoon rains until July 25, which the authority says is “slightly more powerful”.</p>
<p>“Rain has been forecast in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiat, Attock, Chakwal, Mandi Bahauddin, Hafizabad, Gujarat, Jhelum and Gujranwala,” the statement read. “Rain is also expected in Lahore, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Narowal, Toba Tek Singh, Jhang, Sargodha and Mianwali,” its statement read.</p>
<p>“Rain is also predicted in Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar and Multan.”</p>
<p>Punjab PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia announced that due to the heavy rain, there is a high possibility of increased water flow in rivers.</p>
<p>“A flood alert has been issued for rivers and canals in Punjab,” the statement quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>The PDMA warned that there is a possibility of increased flow in the Ravi, Jhelum, Sutlej and Chenab rivers, while stating that water flow in the Indus River was measured at 420,000 cusecs at the Taunsa barrage.</p>
<p>The Flood Forecasting Division showed that by 6pm, water flow at the Taunsa barrage stood at 383,456 cusecs.</p>

        <figcaption class="media__caption  ">A screenshot from the Flood Forecasting Division shows water flows in rivers. — FFD</figcaption>
    </figure></p>
<p>“In the Indus River, there is a low-level flood at Tarbela, Kala Bagh and Chashma,” the PDMA said.</p>
<p>The PDMA DG said that on the instructions of the Punjab chief minister, an alert has been issued to all administrations across the province.</p>
<p>“Deputy commissioners have been instructed to remain in the field, while Section 144 should be imposed along the banks of rivers and canals,” Kathia said, instructing police to increase patrols along waterways.</p>
<p>The DG added: “All relevant departments, including Wasa, Rescue 1122 and district administrations, should be on alert. The drainage of standing water from low-lying areas must be ensured, as must the deployment of machinery and staff at choke points.”</p>
<p>Kathia further ordered that disposal stations be kept functional, while urging people in private housing to ensure adequate drainage. He warned that those unable to ensure drainage would face action.</p>
<p>He also urged the public to take precautionary measures amid heavy rain, such as keeping away from electric pylons and appliances during a storm and avoiding houses made from mud or in dilapidated condition.</p>
<p>So far, 123 people have been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925094">killed</a> and 462 injured since June 25 as the province received record rainfall, triggering urban flooding which inundated residential areas, the PDMA said last week. Of these, 71 deaths were reported in the past two days alone.</p></p>

            <p><p>The seat-adjustment arrangement between the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and opposition arrangement came through in the Senate elections in the province on Monday — with the treasury winning six and the opposition bagging five seats, according to unofficial results.</p>
<p>The treasury and the joint opposition alliance had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925325">agreed</a> on a seat-sharing formula under which six seats would go to the treasury, which has 92 members in the KP Assembly, and five seats to the opposition, which is 53-strong.</p>
<p>On Sunday, it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925557">emerged</a> that what initially shaped up to be a three-way contest — among PTI, PTI “dissidents” and opposition lawmakers — turned out to be almost a two-way match after the size of PTI’s “disgruntled” faction was effectively reduced to just one candidate.</p>
<p>PTI’s Murad Saeed, Faisal Javed, Mirza Afridi and Noorul Haq Qadri were elected as senators on general seats, according to the unofficial results.</p>
<p>Murad Saeed received 26 votes, Mirza Afridi and Faisal Javed both bagged 22, and Noor-ul-Haq Qadri 21.</p>
<p>PTI’s Azam Swati was elected on a technocrat seat with 89 votes. Similarly, PTI’s Rubina Naz became a senator on a women’s seat with 89 votes.</p>
<p>Federal Minister for Gilgit Baltistan and Kashmir Affairs and States and Frontier Regions Amir Muqam’s son Niaz Ahmed reached the upper house by with 18 votes on a general seat.</p>
<p>PPP’s Talha Mehmood bagged a Senate seat with 18 votes. PPP’s Rubina Khalid was elected as a senator on women’s seat with 52 votes.</p>
<p>JUI-F’s Attaul Haq won on a general seat and the party’s Dilawar Khan on a technocrat seat to become members of the upper house with 18 and 54 votes, respectively.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Twenty-five MPAs-elect of the KP opposition were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925431">sworn</a> into office after KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi administered their oaths.</p>
<p>The oath-taking issue has risen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1831068">once again</a> after the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925091/ptis-senate-poll-campaign-beset-by-political-wrangling">redistribution</a> of reserved seats in the wake of a verdict by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench that effectively took away the seats from the PTI and declared other political parties eligible for them.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) finally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922230">announced</a> the schedule for the long-overdue Senate elections in KP, setting July 21 as the polling date.</p>
<p>The much-delayed but suspenseful exercise saw elections on 11 seats — seven general and two each reserved for women, ulema and technocrats.</p>
<p>Currently, the ruling coalition has 54 members in the 96-member Senate — 10 short of the two-thirds majority (64 seats).</p>
<p>A separate election for the seat vacated by Senator Sania Nishtar is scheduled for July 31.</p>
<p>According to an ECP statement, the Senate elections in KP were delayed due to an incomplete electoral college. The schedule was announced two days after 25 reserved seats — originally allocated to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — were redistributed among parties, including PML-N, PPP, JUI-F, PTI-P and ANP.</p>
<p>The elections were earlier postponed in April 2024, exacerbating political uncertainty in the province. Polling for another Senate seat — vacated after the death of Professor Sajid Mir — will also take place on July 21.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925569">by-election</a> on a vacant Senate seat in Punjab was won by PML-N’s Hafiz Abdul Kareem with 243 votes, according to official results from the ECP.</p>
<p>The PML-N had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913415">nominated</a> the emir of the Markazi Jamiat Ahle Hadith, as its candidate for the seat, which fell vacant after the demise of Professor Mir.</p>
<p>The total available votes were 368, with 345 polled votes, of which valid votes were 342, while three were rejected.</p>
<p>In a speech after his victory, Kareem thanked God and mentioned that he was grateful to PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif</p>
<p>“I thank Mian Nawaz Sharif, who always remained loyal to Jamiat Ahle Hadith,” Kareem said.</p>
<p>He added that he was also deeply grateful to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, whom he credited for his victory.</p>
<p>“She left work in the flood-affected areas and cast her vote for me,” Kareem said.</p></p>

            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday stated that Pakistan is targeting using 60 per cent renewable energy by 2030 during his address to the General Debate of the Ministerial Segment of the UN High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) in New York, according to a statement from the Foreign Office (FO).</p>
<p>Pakistan assumed the UNSC Presidency for the month of July 2025, making it the country’s eighth term on the Security Council as a non-permanent member. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026. The presidency involves a focus on multilateralism, peaceful dispute resolution, and regional cooperation.</p>
<p>According to the FO, Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and outlined key policy measures driving growth, climate resilience and economic reform in his address.</p>
<p>“The compounding effects of the pandemic, the food, fuel, and finance crises, as well as intensifying climate impacts, have reversed hard-won development gains and deepened inequalities,” the FM said in his speech.</p>
<p>“Despite these challenges, Pakistan remains fully committed to achieving the 2030 Agenda. Our national development strategies, such as Uraan Pakistan, are aligned with the SDGs.”</p>

<p>The FM also highlighted initiatives such as the Benazir Income Support Programme and the ‘Living Indus’ and ‘Recharge Pakistan’ initiatives for climate adaptation and renewable energy, the FO’s statement read.</p>
<p>Dar also “emphasised the role of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) in aligning foreign direct investment with Pakistan’s development priorities, particularly in sectors critical to sustainable growth”.</p>
<p>“While national efforts are essential, these cannot succeed in isolation. As the Secretary-General has rightly emphasised, deep reform of the international financial architecture is critical for implementing the SDGs,” the FM continued.</p>
<p>“Developing countries need scaled-up access to concessional and grant-based resources, meaningful debt relief, and scaled-up climate finance in order to bridge the SDG Financing Gap.”</p>

<p>During his visit, Dar met with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres at the UN headquarters, according to a statement from the FO.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the FM reaffirmed Pakistan’s “unwavering and resolute commitment to multilateralism and the central role of the UN in addressing the most pressing global challenges”, the statement read.</p>
<p>According to the FO, the secretary general appreciated Pakistan’s presence and initiatives at the UNSC.</p>
<p>Dar emphasised that Pakistan was fully committed to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, especially the need to advance peace through dialogue and diplomacy.</p>
<p>He further stated Pakistan’s commitment to peace was underscored by the high-level debate on multilateralism and peaceful settlement of disputes and the meeting on UN-OIC cooperation, under Pakistan’s Presidency of the UNSC.</p>

<p>“The deputy prime minister/foreign minister emphasised issues of critical national and regional importance to Pakistan, particularly the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, violation of the Indus Waters Treaty and externally sponsored terrorism in Pakistan,” the FO stated.</p>
<p>“He stressed the imperative of a just settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council. The DPM/FM lauded the secretary general’s leadership and sincere efforts for de-escalation of recent tensions between Pakistan and India.”</p>
<p>Dar also reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering support for Palestinian statehood, an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and firm opposition to Israeli plans for annexation in the occupied West Bank.</p>
<p>The two men also exchanged views on the need for promoting concessional financing to support development and climate goals, especially for developing countries and mobilising enhanced international support for debt relief and liquidity solutions for the Global South.</p>
<p>“The DPM/FM emphasised that the secretary general’s ‘UN80’ initiative offered a critical opportunity to strengthen the three pillars of the United Nations to promote international peace and security, sustainable development and human rights worldwide,” the statement read, referring to the UN marking its 80th anniversary this year.</p>
<p>According to the statement, Dar welcomed the appointment of a UN special envoy on Islamophobia and expressed readiness to support global efforts to combat religious intolerance.</p>
<p>Earlier, the FO reported that Dar arrived in New York to attend high-level signature events of Pakistan’s UN Security Council (UNSC) Presidency, including a conference on Palestine.</p>
<p>“During the visit, he will lead high-level signature events under Pakistan’s Presidency of the UN Security Council, hold bilateral and multilateral meetings in New York and Washington, DC, and represent Pakistan at the International Conference on the two-state solution, co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and France,” the FO said.</p>

<p>According to a July 19 <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/curtain-raiser-deputy-prime-ministerforeign-ministers-visit-to-the-united-states-to-attend-high-level-signature-events-of-pakistans-security-council-presidency" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> issued by the FO, Dar will attend a high-level conference on the “Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution”, to express Pakistan’s strong commitment and unwavering support for the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>The conference was originally planned for June but was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917074">postponed</a> due to the Iran-Israel war, which also led to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917150">rescheduling</a> of Dar’s visit. According to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/13/macron-not-expected-to-attend-un-summit-on-two-state-solution-for-palestine-and-israel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Guardian</a></em>, the moot will now be held on July 28 and 29.</p>
<p>Since October 8, Israeli strikes have killed more than 58,000 Palestinians in Gaza. Pakistan has consistently raised its voice for the people of Palestine, calling for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921570/dont-be-a-bystander-pakistan-tells-unsc">urged</a> the UNSC not to remain “a bystander” amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>
<p>Aside from the Palestine conference, Dar is also set to chair a high-level briefing of the UNSC, focused on enhancing cooperation between the UN and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).</p>
<p>“The meeting is being held as part of Pakistan’s efforts to strengthen collaboration between the OIC and the UN for maintenance of international peace and security,” the FO statement said.</p>
<p>Dar is expected to have several other bilateral engagements with his counterparts, as well as senior UN officials, during his stay. He will also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925550">meet</a> US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on July 25.</p></p>
