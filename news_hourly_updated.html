                <h2>Pakistan unveils first govt-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Crypto and Blockchain and CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council, Bilal Bin Saqib, has unveiled the country‚Äôs first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.</p>
<p>Saqib was recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913419">appointed</a> as Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Blockchain and cryptocurrency, with the status of a minister of state. He has been on a tour of the United States seeking investment in Pakistan crypto markets.</p>
<p>He made the announcement about the reserve after delivering a keynote address before an elite audience including United States Vice President, JD Vance, Eric Trump, and Donald Trump Jr, at Bitcoin Vegas 2025 in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan is no longer defined by its past. It is being reborn as a forward-looking hub of digital innovation ‚Äî powered by its youth, sharpened by necessity, and led by a new generation of tech statesmen,‚Äù said Saqib, in a statement issued by his office.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not just here as a minister,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here as the voice of a generation ‚Äî a generation that is online, on-chain, and unstoppable.‚Äù</p>
<p>In his keynote speech, Saqib announced the establishment of a national bitcoin wallet, ‚Äúholding digital assets already in state custody ‚Äî not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signaling long-term belief in decentralised finance.‚Äù</p>
<p>He also thanked President Donald Trump for his role as a peacemaker in the recent India-Pakistan conflict and for his commitment to crypto adoption.</p>
<p>He revealed that the government had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913238">allocated</a> 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity in first phase for bitcoin mining and AI data centres, opening doors to sovereign miners, tech firms, and clean energy partners around the world.</p>
<p>The statement noted Pakistan having over 40 million crypto wallets and one of the ‚Äúlargest and most active freelancer economies in the world‚Äù.</p>
<p>It added that Saqib was leading the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912539">creation</a> of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) ‚Äî a regulatory body designed to empower builders, protect investors, and formalise digital finance frameworks for the future.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBoth Pakistan and bitcoin have suffered from bad PR,‚Äù Saqib declared. ‚ÄúBut if you look past the headlines, you‚Äôll see something else: talent, resilience, and vision.‚Äù</p>
<p>He called on global crypto builders to come and invest in Pakistan. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre building something real ‚Äî come build it in Pakistan. Come build wallets for the unbanked. Come tokenise land. Come scale your mission with our youth and our unstoppable grit.‚Äù</p>
<p>During his keynote, Saqib delivered a ‚Äúblueprint for the future of emerging markets in Web3 that positions Pakistan as a tech-forward, youth-powered, and opportunity-rich nation ready to lead,‚Äù the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif appointed Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) CEO Saqib as his special assistant on blockchain and cryptocurrency, with the status of a minister of state.</p>
<p>On February 25, the finance ministry had announced it was considering establishing a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897897">National Crypto Council</a> to adopt emerging digital currencies in line with global trends. It later appointed Saqib as chief executive officer of the PPC.</p>
<p>According to a press release, Saqib will now be responsible for developing a comprehensive, FATF-compliant regulatory framework for digital assets, launching bitcoin mining initiatives, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, finance, and land records.</p>
<p>Additionally, he will also facilitate ‚Äúlicensing and oversight of virtual asset service providers (VASPs)‚Äù and champion ‚Äúinvestor protection and Web3 ecosystem growth‚Äù in the country.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the government has announced the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913342">allocation</a> of 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the first phase of a national initiative to power bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.</p>
<p>According to the Finance Division, the ambitious initiative was part of a broader strategy to ‚Äúmonetise surplus electricity, create high-tech jobs, attract billions of dollars in foreign direct investment, and generate billions of dollars for the government‚Äù.</p></p>

                <h2>Elon Musk to exit US government role after rare break with Trump</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Billionaire Elon Musk on Wednesday announced he was leaving his role in the US government, which was intended to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891574">reduce</a> federal spending, shortly after his first major break with US President Donald Trump over his signature spending bill.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President Donald Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,‚Äù he <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1927877957852266518" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on his social media platform X.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

<p>The South African-born tech tycoon had said Trump‚Äôs bill would increase the deficit and undermine the work of Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892119">fired</a> tens of thousands of people.</p>
<p>Musk ‚Äî who was a constant presence at Trump‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892999">side</a> before <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901662">pulling back</a> to focus on his Space X and Tesla businesses ‚Äî also complained that DOGE had become a ‚Äúwhipping boy‚Äù for dissatisfaction with the administration.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,‚Äù Musk said in an interview with <em>CBS</em> News, an excerpt of which aired late Tuesday.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúOne Big, Beautiful Bill Act‚Äù ‚Äî which passed the US House last week and now moves to the Senate ‚Äî offers sprawling tax relief and spending cuts and is the centrepiece of his domestic agenda.</p>
<p>But critics warn it will decimate health care and balloon the national deficit by as much as $4 trillion over a decade.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA bill can be big, or it can be beautiful. But I don‚Äôt know if it can be both. My personal opinion,‚Äù Musk said in the interview, which will be aired in full on Sunday.</p>
<p>The White House sought to play down any differences over US government spending, without directly naming Musk.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Big Beautiful Bill is NOT an annual budget bill,‚Äù Trump‚Äôs Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said on Musk‚Äôs social network, X, after the tech titan‚Äôs comments aired.</p>
<p>All DOGE cuts would have to be carried out through a separate bill targeting the federal bureaucracy, according to US Senate rules, Miller added.</p>

<p>But Musk‚Äôs comments represented a rare split with the Republican president whom he helped propel back to power, as the largest donor to his 2024 election campaign.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#whipping-boy" id="whipping-boy" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòWhipping boy‚Äô</h2>
<p>Trump tasked Musk with cutting government spending as head of DOGE, but after a feverish start, Musk announced in late April he was mostly stepping back to run his companies again.</p>
<p>Musk complained in a separate interview with the <em>Washington Post</em> that DOGE, which operated out of the White House with a staff of young technicians, had become a lightning rod for criticism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDOGE is just becoming the whipping boy for everything,‚Äù Musk told the newspaper at the Starbase launch site in Texas ahead of Space X‚Äôs latest launch on Tuesday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSomething bad would happen anywhere, and we would get blamed for it even if we had nothing to do with it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Musk blamed entrenched US bureaucracy for DOGE‚Äôs failure to achieve all of its goals ‚Äî although reports say his domineering style and lack of familiarity with the currents of Washington politics were also major factors.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realised,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.‚Äù</p>
<p>Musk has previously admitted that he did not achieve all his goals with DOGE even though tens of thousands of people were removed from government payrolls and several departments were gutted or shut down.</p>
<p>Musk‚Äôs own businesses suffered in the meantime.</p>
<p>Protesters against the cost-cutting targeted Tesla dealerships while arsonists even torched a few of the electric vehicles, and the firm‚Äôs profits slumped.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPeople were burning Teslas. Why would you do that? That‚Äôs really uncool,‚Äù Musk told the <em>Post</em>.</p>
<p>Musk has also been focusing on Space X after a series of fiery setbacks to his dreams of colonising Mars ‚Äî the latest of which came on Tuesday when its prototype Starship <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913851">exploded</a> over the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>The tycoon last week also said he would pull back from spending his fortune on politics, having spent around a quarter of a billion dollars to support Trump.</p></p>
