                <h2>Govt has decided to enhance water storage capacity due to India’s actions: PM Shehbaz</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday said that the government has decided to enhance the country’s water storage capacity, given India’s designs to weaponise water.</p>
<p>India in April held the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">abeyance</a> following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence.  The treaty allocates the Indus Basin’s six rivers between the two countries: India gets the eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas, Sutlej), while Pakistan receives nearly 80 per cent of the water from the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab).</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">termed</a> any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.  The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in Hague also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921230">ruled</a> India cannot unilaterally suspend or hold the IWT in abeyance.</p>
<p>During a visit to the National Emergencies Operations Centre today, the prime minister referred to the PCA’s order, emphasising that India had no authority to suspend the IWT unilaterally.</p>
<p>“But the enemy has certain evil designs against Pakistan and wants to take steps against the waters treaty. For that, the government has decided that we will build our water storage.”</p>
<p>He said the government would build a “non-controversial water storage capacity” by utilising resources such as the Diamer Bhasha dam and others.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said there was a clear clause in the 1991 water accord between the provinces to build on water capacity.</p>
<p>“We will build this capacity with our own resources in the next few years. There is a critical role of the National Disaster Management Authority in this.”</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The prime minister directed that weather warnings and calamity threats should be regularly issued through phone messages in collaboration with the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority.</p>
<p>The prime minister recounted the disastrous impacts of the catastrophic floods in 2022. He said that Pakistan was unfortunately among the countries on the world map which could be hit by natural disasters such as cloudbursts, even though it had hardly any contribution to the greenhouse effect.</p>
<p>During the year 2022, Pakistan had suffered more than any country in the world, he noted. More than 1,700 lives were lost, vast stretches of farmland were washed away, homes and infrastructure were damaged, and the national exchequer suffered losses of Rs30 billion, according to government estimates.</p>
<p>The prime minister further said that glacial melting due to heat waves also demanded the highest level of preparedness.</p>
<p>“What happened in Swat in which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920723/17-killed-as-rains-wreak-havoc-across-kp">precious lives were lost</a>, engulfed the entire nation in a pall of gloom,” he said and stressed that the stakeholders in the matter should take an honest review of the incident, directing for a formulation of a comprehensive mechanism in collaboration with the provinces to prevent such occurrences in the future.</p>
<p>The prime minister also ordered a report in this regard.</p>
<p>He opined that in the aftermath of the floods of 2022, the relevant ministers negotiated the grants and public-private partnerships for building resilient infrastructure in the country.</p>
<p>The prime minister appreciated the National Emergencies Operations Centre and expressed hope that the relevant authorities would fully utilise the resilient platform for the progress of the country’s economy and social sectors.</p>
<p>He also assured the government’s complete support in strengthening the institute and its capacity building.</p>
<p>The prime minister hoped that the facility would be connected with the provinces and could convey real-time information with interventions such as an early warning system.</p>
<p>During his visit, he was given a briefing by NDMA Chairman Lieutenant General Inam Haider Malik over the current monsoon season, the flood situation and the precautionary measures taken in this regard.</p></p>

                <h2>Trump ramps up Musk feud with deportation threat</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Donald Trump and Elon Musk reignited their bitter feud on Tuesday, with the US president threatening to deport the tech tycoon and strip federal funds from his businesses for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915301">criticising</a> Trump’s flagship spending bill.</p>
<p>The world’s richest person was Trump’s biggest political donor in the 2024 election, and became his inseparable ally during his first months back in the White House as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).</p>
<p>But the Space X and Tesla boss is now threatening to turn his riches against Trump, mulling a rival political party to challenge Republican lawmakers who vote for the president’s “One Big Beautiful Bill”.</p>
<p>Trump, 79, reacted vengefully today as he headed to the opening of a new migrant detention centre in Florida dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz”.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to take a look,” he told reporters when asked if he would consider deporting Musk, who has held US citizenship since 2002.</p>

<p>Trump also signalled that he could take aim at the huge contracts and subsidies that Musk’s Space X rocket and Starlink satellite internet businesses receive from the US government.</p>
<p>“We might have to put DOGE on Elon. You know what DOGE is? DOGE is the monster that might have to go back and eat Elon,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump added later in Florida: “I don’t think he should be playing that game with me.”</p>

<p>In reply to a post on his X social network featuring Trump’s deportation comments, Musk said on Tuesday: “So tempting to escalate this. So, so tempting. But I will refrain for now.”</p>

<p>Shares of Tesla sank around five per cent after Trump’s threats.</p>
<p>Trump had made similar comments on Monday, saying Musk was attacking the bill because he was annoyed that it had dropped measures to support the electric vehicles (EV) industry.</p>
<p>“Without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,” Trump said on his Truth Social network.</p>

<p>The tycoon and the president shared a brief but intense bromance after Trump’s return to power in January.</p>
<p>Wearing MAGA baseball hats, Musk was an almost constant presence at Trump’s side. Trump returned the favour by promoting Tesla electric vehicles when protesters targeted them for Musk’s cost-cutting drive at DOGE.</p>
<p>But they had a huge public blow-up in May as Musk criticised the spending bill and then <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914033">left the government</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#dont-bankrupt-america" id="dont-bankrupt-america" title="Permalink"></a>‘Don’t bankrupt America’</h2>
<p>Musk had kept a low profile in recent weeks but returned to the fray as the bill began its difficult path through Congress.</p>
<p>He has since posted a steady stream of posts against the bill on the X social network that he owns.</p>
<p>The billionaire’s criticisms centre on claims that the bill would increase the US deficit. He also accuses Republicans of abandoning efforts to place the US at the front of the EV and clean energy revolution.</p>
<p>“All I’m asking is that we don’t bankrupt America,” he said on social media today, accusing Republicans of supporting “debt slavery”.</p>

<p>More worrying perhaps for Trump is the way that Musk is seeking to target vulnerable Republican lawmakers ahead of the 2026 US midterm elections.</p>
<p>Musk has said he will set up his own political movement called the “America Party” if Trump’s bill passes.</p>
<p>And he has pledged to fund challengers against lawmakers who campaigned on reduced federal spending only to vote for the bill.</p>
<p>“Vox Populi, Vox Dei (the voice of the people is the voice of God) 80pc voted for a new party,” he said after launching a poll on the idea on X.</p>
