            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916481/trump-willing-to-work-on-kashmir-issue-confirms-us-state-dept' target='_blank'><strong>Trump willing to work on Kashmir issue, confirms US State Dept</strong></a>
            <p><p>US Department of State on Wednesday reiterated US President Donald Trump’s resolve to work on the Kashmir dispute, saying each step that he takes “is made to solve generational differences between countries”.</p>
<p>Donald Trump had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910785/fo-reiterates-support-for-trump-offer-to-resolve-kashmir-issue">offered</a> to work on the Kashmir issue after he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914608">brokered</a> a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after the two nations’ most intense <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military confrontation</a> in decades. In a message lauding the countries’ leaders for achieving peace, he remarked, “I will work with both of you to see if, after a ‘thousand years’, a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir.”</p>
<p>Responding to a question on the steps US plans to take in the wake of Trump’s offer, State Department’s spokesperson Tammy Bruce during a White House press briefing noted, “So, while I can’t speak to his plans, the world knows his nature, and I can’t speak to any details of what he might have in that regard,” adding that the White House would have plenty to say about the matter.</p>
<p>She further said, “[Trump] has been the only one to bring certain people to the table to have conversations that nobody thought was possible,” remaining hopeful that the Kashmir issue can also get resolved.</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t surprise anyone that he’d want to manage something like that,” said Bruce.</p>
<p>Detailing the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915359">visit</a> of a Pakistani delegation led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in response to a question, she said that the delegation met with state department officials in Washington, including Under Secretary for Political Affairs Allison Hooker.</p>
<p>She elaborated that the two parties discussed issues related to the Pak-US bilateral relationship, including counterterrorism cooperation. Hooker reiterated US support for the ongoing ceasefire.</p>
<p>“We also know that Deputy Secretary Landau met with the Indian parliamentary delegation last week, and he also reaffirmed the United States strong support of India in the fight against terrorism,” Bruce added.</p>
<p>Pakis­tan has launched a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence in the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, last week, while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump categorically claimed credit for talking India and Pakistan back from the brink of war.</p>
<p>“They don’t give me credit for anything, but nobody else could have stopped it,” he said.</p></p>

            <p><p>• Next year’s revenue target set at Rs14.13tr<br />
• Provinces’ contribution helps Centre outperform fiscal target, record lowest budget deficit in a decade<br />
• Subsidy allocations have been reduced by 14pc<br />
• Reduced debt servicing drives expenditure containment of nearly Rs2.26tr<br />
• Generous tax relief, incentives for construction sector<br />
• Fuel levy, electricity surcharges to rise next year<br />
• Tough crackdown planned on non-filers, tax evaders<br />
• Development spending squeezed to cut deficit</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Maintaining an aggressive stance on fiscal consolidation, as required by the Int­ernational Monetary Fund (IMF), Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday still managed to offer some notional relief to the salaried class in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292/budget-fy26-pakistan-targets-42pc-growth-slashes-overall-spending">federal budget</a> for fiscal year 2025-26, along with incentives for the real estate and construction sectors, in an effort to revive the struggling industrial sector and stimulate economic growth.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, the government announced it was imposing a ‘carbon levy’ of Rs2.5 per litre on petrol, diesel and furnace oil in the upcoming fiscal year, to be doubled the following year. It also introduced a 5 per cent tax on large pensions, an 18pc tax on imported solar panels, and an increase in the debt servicing surcharge on electricity to finance not only interest payments, but also principal debt. Additionally, it announced the gradual elimination of tax exemptions for the tribal areas beginning this year.</p>
<p><strong>Ambitious targets</strong></p>
<p>Despite a record tax shortfall of Rs1.07 trillion recorded for the current fiscal year, the finance minister set next year’s revenue target at Rs14.13tr — an 18.7pc increase from this year’s revised estimate of Rs11.9tr, against the original budget target of Rs12.97tr. This would include approximately Rs840 billion in additional revenue measures, on top of a Rs1.39tr automatic tax increase supported by projected inflation of 7.5pc and economic growth of 4.2pc and expenditure containment of nearly Rs2.26tr (equivalent to 2pc of GDP), driven primarily by reduced debt servicing costs, and also at the expense of development and public welfare initiatives.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Not only the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), but the provincial governments, too, were unable to meet their commitment of maintaining a Rs1.22tr surplus for the current year. Still, they provided vital support to the federal government with a surplus of Rs1.01tr.</p>
<p>This contribution enabled the federal government to outperform its fiscal target and record a budget deficit of just 5.6pc of GDP (Rs6.44tr) — the lowest in a decade since FY2015-16 — compared to a higher projected deficit of 5.9pc (Rs7.28tr). This notable fiscal tightening was achieved through punishing additional taxation measures amounting to Rs2.2tr (1.8pc of GDP) alongside a reduction in expenditure as interest rates declined from a historic peak of 22pc.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the FY2025–26 budget sets an ambitious target to reduce the budget deficit to 3.9pc of GDP (Rs5.04tr), contingent upon a cash surplus of Rs1.46tr from the provinces. As a result, the primary budget surplus is projected to rise to 2.4pc of GDP, or Rs3.17tr, for the next year — up from this year’s 2.2pc of GDP (Rs2.5tr).</p>
<p><strong>Relief for select groups</strong></p>
<p>The government found sufficient fiscal space to offer some relief to the salaried class, who have been burdened by high tax rates, declining real incomes, and severe inflation over the past two years.</p>
<p>The finance minister proposed a reduction in income tax by half, to 2.5pc, on annual income between Rs600,000 and Rs1.2 million. It is pertinent to mention that there was a discrepancy in the income tax rate for the lowest taxable bracket announced by the finance minister and the tax rate mentioned in the finance bill, which was even lower at 1pc.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Clarity is awaited on this matter. Similarly, the annual tax on a salary of Rs1.2m was proposed to be reduced to Rs6,000, down from the current Rs30,000. Mr Aurangzeb added that the income tax rate for those earning up to Rs2.2m per annum would be cut to 11pc, down from the current 15pc. Similarly, the tax rate has been reduced to 23pc from 25pc for salaried income between Rs2.2m and Rs3.2m. In addition, the finance minister acknowledged that oppressive tax rates were driving highly skilled professionals to migrate, contributing to a “brain drain”. As a corrective measure, he announced a 1pc reduction in the surcharge on annual incomes exceeding Rs10m.</p>
<p>Apart from this, a 10pc increase in salaries and 7pc rise in pensions was announced for government employees. The salaries of armed forces personnel would also be increased by 25pc, including a special relief allowance in recognition of their recent heroic performance in response to Indian aggression, the finance minister said.</p>
<p>At the same time, the government introduced a generous tax relief and incentives for the construction sector, including access to cheaper mortgage financing, in a bid to revive large-scale manufacturing, which has been contracting for the past three years due to unprecedented increases in energy and borrowing costs. To this end, the finance minister announced a reduction in the withholding tax on the purchase of real estate from 4pc to 2.5pc. The next two current withholding tax rates of 3.5pc and 3pc will also be reduced to 2pc and 1.5pc respectively.</p>
<p>Additionally, a 7pc federal excise duty imposed last year on the transfer of commercial properties, plots and houses has also been proposed to be abolished.</p>
<p>As a new initiative, the budget includes a tax credit on mortgages for homes of up to 10 marla (250 square yards) and flats of up to 2,000 square feet. This is in addition to a new scheme aimed at promoting mortgage financing. The finance minister also announced a reduction in stamp duty on property purchases in Islamabad Capital Territory, from 4pc to 1pc, and expressed hope that provincial governments would follow suit by reducing heavy taxation on immovable property.</p>
<p>The government also succeeded in persuading the IMF to exempt fertilisers and insecticides from taxation for the current year, in an effort to position agriculture as the engine of economic growth.</p>
<p><strong>Tightening the net</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, the finance minister announced an increase in the tax rate on interest income from 15pc to 20pc, a move that may discourage savings. However, he clarified that this would not apply to small savers or investments in national saving schemes.</p>
<p>Similarly, digital marketplaces and online businesses are to be brought into the tax net through courier companies, it was announced. The minister also announced a 5pc income tax on pensions exceeding Rs10m per annum for pensioners under the age of 70. In a move to promote a cashless economy, non-filers will now be subject to a 1pc advance tax on cash withdrawals, up from the existing 0.6pc. Taxpaying businesses will be discouraged from making cash sales exceeding Rs200,000. Additional measures have also been introduced to encourage online transactions and digital payments.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Strict steps will be taken against non-filers. Only taxpayers who submit their wealth statements will be allowed to undertake large financial transactions, such as the purchase of vehicles, immovable properties, securities, mutual funds, or the opening of certain bank accounts.</p>
<p>Tightening the noose around unregistered traders, the finance minister proposed the freezing of bank accounts, restrictions on property transfers, and the sealing of business premises in cases of serious violations of sales tax laws, with the involvement of trade bodies. In the same vein, he also announced a notional 0.5pc reduction in the super tax for corporate firms with annual incomes between Rs200m and Rs500m.</p>
<p><strong>Improved tax collection</strong></p>
<p>The finance minister noted a rise in the tax-to-GDP ratio, which has historically been one of the weakest aspects of Pakistan’s economy, from 8.8pc in June 2024 to 10.3pc in the first nine months of the current year. This figure is projected to reach 10.4pc by June 30, 2025. Including non-tax revenue, the federal tax-to-GDP ratio has improved to 11.6pc, representing an increase of 1.2 percentage points, up from 0.8 percentage points last year. The consolidated tax-to-GDP ratio, the finance minister added, has reached 12.3pc, including a 0.7pc contribution from the provinces. “The 1.6pc of GDP increase in FBR revenue is not only the highest in Pakistan’s history, but is also rarely seen anywhere else in the world in recent times,” the minister boasted.</p>
<p><strong>Balancing the budget</strong></p>
<p>The government has set the non-tax revenue target for the next year at Rs5.15tr, slightly higher than the current year’s Rs4.9tr. This brings the total gross federal revenue (FBR plus non-tax) to Rs19.28tr, up from the current year’s original budget target of Rs17.8tr, which was later revised down to Rs16.8tr. After transferring Rs8.2tr to the provinces, the net federal revenue is estimated to be Rs11.07tr for the next year, compared to Rs9.8tr this year. This leaves a projected federal deficit of Rs6.5tr, a reduction from the current year’s budgeted Rs8.5tr, which was later revised to Rs7.44tr.</p>
<p>Subsidy allocations have been reduced by 14pc to Rs1.19tr for the next year, down from Rs1.38tr in the current year. This is primarily due to a 13pc (Rs154bn) cut in power sector subsidies. The tariff differential subsidy for ex-Wapda distribution companies has been reduced by 9.7pc (Rs27bn) to Rs249bn, from Rs276bn this year. Meanwhile, the tariff subsidy for K-Electric has been cut by 28pc (Rs49bn), to Rs125bn from Rs174bn. An even larger reduction has been applied to the tariff subsidy for Azad Jammu and Kashmir, which has been reduced to Rs74bn from Rs108bn, reflecting a cut of 31.5pc.</p>
<p>The major non-tax revenue item is expected to be the petroleum levy on POL products, projected at Rs1.47tr, which is a 26pc increase from the current year’s Rs1.16tr. An even larger contribution is anticipated from State Bank of Pakistan profits, estimated at Rs2.4tr for the next year, though this marks a slight decline from Rs2.6tr this year.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916297/economic-jargon-you-need-to-know-for-understanding-the-budget">debt servicing</a> cost for next year has been estimated at Rs8.2tr, representing an 8pc decline from actual repayments of Rs8.95tr, and 16pc lower than the original budget estimate of Rs9.78tr. Pension expenditure is expected to rise by around 4pc, reaching Rs1.06tr, up from Rs1.01tr this year. Military pensions are projected to grow by 12pc to Rs742bn, compared to a 10pc increase in civil pensions, which are expected to reach Rs243bn.</p>
<p>As a result, total current expenditure has been set at Rs16.29tr for the next year, slightly below this year’s figure of Rs16.39tr.</p>

<p>• Up to 80pc tax relief for salaried individuals earning Rs600,000-1.2m annually<br />
• Minimal relief for top salary brackets earning above Rs4.1m<br />
• 1pc surcharge reduction for income above Rs10m to curb brain drain<br />
• Super tax cut by 0.5pc for companies earning Rs200m-500m<br />
• Pensions above Rs10m to be taxed at 5pc<br />
• Cash withdrawal tax for non-filers increased to 1pc from 0.6pc</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: The government has announced sweeping <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916323/budget-fy26-relief-for-salaried-group-as-govt-goes-after-solar-panels-e-commerce">tax reforms</a> in the federal budget 2025-26, offering tax cuts of up to 80 per cent for low-income salaried individuals while limiting relief for higher earners to just 3pc. A new 5 per cent tax has also been proposed on high-value pensions exceeding Rs10 million annually.</p>
<p>The focus of the budget seems to balance sectoral rel­ief, expand tax scope, achieve equitable burden-sharing, and introducing strong enf­orcement measures. The government expects the digital taxation framework, carbon levies and tax enforcement on e-commerce and digital transactions to help Pakistan adapt to global financial regulation standards.</p>
<p>Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said tax relief measures total Rs60 billion for salaried individuals, Rs2.4bn for the corporate sector, and Rs60bn in exemptions for fertilisers and pesticides.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>To achieve the proposed tax collection target of Rs14.131 trillion, the autonomous tax growth is projected at Rs1.34tr in FY26 based on the GDP growth target of 4.2pc and inflation rate of 7.5pc.</p>
<p>With the current year’s revenue collection of Rs11.5tr and autonomous growth of Rs1.345tr, revenue collection will reach Rs12.845tr in FY26 without any new tax or enforcement measures.</p>
<p>Tied to its commitments under the International Mone­tary Fund (IMF) programme, the government introduces additional revenue measures of Rs1.05tr, including new tax measures of Rs655bn and another Rs400bn through enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>Enforcement measures</strong></p>
<p>The Finance Bill also proposes Section 114C, which introduces a framework to restrict high-value economic transactions — such as purchase of vehicles, immovable property and securities — for individuals and entities, who have not filed income tax returns or cannot justify their financial capacity through formally declared resources.</p>
<p>By mandating that, only “eligible persons” with sufficient declared assets can engage in such transactions.</p>
<p>A new Section 175AA is proposed to be inserted into the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, empowering the FBR to share tax-related information of high-risk persons with scheduled banks.</p>
<p>This includes details such as turnover, income (including taxable income) for one or more tax years, identification data (including bank account numbers) declared in income tax returns, wealth statements, financial statements, or any other document submitted to the FBR, along with data-based algorithms as may be prescribed.</p>
<p><strong>Salaried class</strong></p>
<p>The salary exemption limit has remained unc­h­anged at Rs50,000 per month. However, the government has now proposed a reduction in tax rates for annual income up to Rs3,200,000 to provide rel­ief to people in lower- and middle-income brackets. Sim­ilarly, the surcharge rate has been proposed to be reduced to 9pc from 10pc for salaried individuals only.</p>
<p>Taxpayers earning between Rs600,000 to Rs1.2m annually will now face a 1pc tax rate, down from 5pc, offering up to 80pc tax reduction.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>For annual incomes between Rs1.2m and Rs2.2m, the rate will drop to 11pc from 15pc (on the amount exceeding Rs1.2m), and the fixed sum reduced to Rs6,000 from Rs30,000. For a salary of Rs150,000 per month, this translates to a 48pc reduction in tax liability.</p>
<p>For annual salaries bet­ween Rs2.2m and Rs3.2m, the rate drops from 25pc to 23pc (on the income exceeding Rs2.2m) and the fixed sum to Rs116,000 from Rs180,000.</p>
<p>No percentage change was made for the remaining two slabs except reductions in the fixed sums.</p>
<p>Those earning between Rs3.2m and Rs4.1m per year will see their fixed tax reduced to Rs346,000 from Rs430,000, though the income exceeding Rs3.2m will still be taxed at 30pc.</p>
<p>For people earning more than Rs4.1m annually, the fixed sum has been reduced to Rs616,000 from Rs700,000, but the tax rate on income exceeding Rs4.1m will remain 35pc.</p>
<p>A 1pc surcharge reduction is proposed for individuals earning above Rs10m to discourage skilled professionals from emigrating. Meanwhile, pensioners drawing over Rs10m annually will now be taxed at 5pc.</p>
<p><strong>Other key measures</strong></p>
<p>The income tax and withholding tax exemption for the erstwhile Fata and Pata regions has been proposed to be extended to June 30, 2026.</p>
<p>Withholding tax on property purchases has been lowered across brackets — from 4pc to 2.5pc, 3.5pc to 2.5pc, and 3pc to 1.5pc — and Federal Excise Duty on commercial property transfers has been abolished (previously up to 7pc).</p>
<p>The interest income tax rate will rise from 15pc to 20pc, though national savings schemes are exempt.</p>
<p>Rent from commercial properties must be reported at a minimum of 4pc of fair market value unless proven otherwise to the commissioner.</p>
<p><strong>Digital economy</strong></p>
<p>A Digital Transactions Proceeds Levy will apply to all payments for goods or services delivered via digital platforms. Banks and courier services will act as withholding agents to capture the payment chain.</p>
<p>Withholding tax on cash withdrawals by non-filers rises from 0.6pc to 1pc. For specified services, withholding tax increases from 4pc to 6pc, excluding IT and IT-enabled services.</p>
<p>For non-specified services, a flat 15pc applies; for sportspersons, the rate increases from 10pc to 15pc. The tax rate on profit on debt has been increased from 15pc to 20pc. The dividend tax rate has been enhanced to 25pc and 15pc on dividend from mutual funds.</p>
<p>The government also proposes removing the Rs5m cap on profit from debt under the final tax regime for individuals and associations of persons  though companies will retain the adjustable tax.</p>
<p><strong>Sales tax measures</strong></p>
<p>The government also proposes an 18pc sales tax on the sales of imported solar panels.</p>
<p>Hybrid cars will also be subject to an 18pc sales tax, aligning them with petrol and diesel vehicles. A 10pc sales tax on goods will now be gradually imposed over the next five years in the sales tax-exempt provinces, i.e. ex-Fata region and Balochistan.</p>
<p>Under the proposed regime, payment intermediaries (banks, financial institutions, exchange companies, and payment gateways) will collect sales tax on digital payments, while couriers will handle tax collection for cash on delivery transactions. Additionally, the withholding tax rate is set to increase from 1pc to 2pc.</p>

            <p><p>Florence in Italy could hit 39C as hot weather sweeps continent, while parts of South Africa brace for snow</p><p>The severe thunderstorms that have been lashing parts of Europe over recent days are expected to give way to high temperatures this week. Several regions could climb to 10C (50F) above seasonal norms, with Italy braced for the full force of the heat. Florence in Tuscany is forecast to soar to a sweltering 39C on Thursday and across the weekend.</p><p>Germany, France and Belgium will also face hot weather from Wednesday, with widespread highs at least 9C above the June average. Many other parts of Europe are forecast to experience temperatures 5-7C above normal. This is the result of a high-pressure system creating a heat dome over the region, whereby sinking air compresses and warms as it descends, trapping heat near the surface.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/09/weather-tracker-storms-summer-heat-europe-south-africa">Continue reading...</a></p>
