            <p><p>Security forces killed 33 terrorists attempting to infiltrate across the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on Friday, the military’s media wing said in a statement.</p>
<p>According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), a large group of terrorists belonging to the “Indian proxy <em>Fitna al Khwaraj</em>”, were trying to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border when they were detected by the security forces in the Sambaza area of Balochistan’s Zhob district on the night of August 7 and 8.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna"><em>Fitna al Khawarij</em></a> is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>The statement added that the troops effectively engaged and thwarted their attempt to infiltrate, adding, “As a result of precise, bold and skilful engagement, thirty three Indian sponsored <em>khwarij</em> were sent to hell.”</p>
<p>A large cache of weapons, ammunition &amp; explosives was also recovered, it added.</p>
<p>“The security forces of Pakistan remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers and to eradicate the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The country ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025.</p>
<p>Last month, 30 terrorists of an “Indian proxy” outfit were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922039/30-terrorists-killed-in-north-waziristan-as-bid-to-infiltrate-via-pak-afghan-border-thwarted-ispr">killed</a> as they attempted to infiltrate through the Pak-Afghan border in Hassan Khel tehsil of KP’s North Waziristan district.</p></p>

            <p><p>Remittances from overseas Pakistani workers went up by 7.4 per cent on year-on-year basis for the month of July, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Friday.</p>
<p>Every month, millions of overseas Pakistanis send money home. These remittances are now a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920470">cornerstone</a> of Pakistan’s balance-of-payments, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904169">hitting</a> a record $4.1 billion during March alone.</p>
<p>“Workers’ remittances recorded an inflow of $3.2bn during July 2025,” a press release by the SBP read.</p>
<p>According to the data released by the bank, the inflows were mainly sourced from Saudi Arabia ($823.7 million), United Arab Emirates ($665.2m), United Kingdom ($450.4m) and the US ($269.6m).</p>
<p>Last month, SBP’s data showed that workers’ remittances <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923069/pm-pleased-as-remittances-rise-by-266pc-to-hit-record-383bn-in-fy25">increased</a> by 26.6pc to hit a record $38.3bn during the fiscal year 2025 as compared to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844949">corresponding period</a> of last year.</p>
<p>It added that the workers’ remittances went up by 7.9pc to $3.406bn in June 2025, compared to $3.158bn during the same month last year.</p>
<p>FY25 proved to be a relatively <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923214">successful year</a> for the government on the external front, with expectations of a current account surplus and the SBP exceeding its foreign exchange reserves target of $14bn by closing at $14.5bn.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Remittances played a crucial role in maintaining exchange rate stability, enabling the central bank to accumulate reserves and make partial repayments of its external debt. While official figures have not been disclosed, interbank currency dealers estimate the SBP purchased over $8bn from the banking market during the year.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854778">study</a> by the Asian Development Bank last year <a class="link--external" href="https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/979881/ewp-733-understanding-drivers-remittances-pakistan.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> that Pakistani migrants tend to remit more when economic conditions are improving back home and when there is a positive association between remittances and domestic economic activity.</p>
<p>The study’s findings indicate that domestic and abroad economic activity is positively associated with remittances to Pakistan.</p></p>

            <p><p>Balochistan government spokesman Shahid Rind on Friday said that mobile data services in the province have been suspended until August 31 over “security reasons”.</p>
<p>In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925001">worsened</a>, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419/jaffar-express-hijacking-state-media-reports-190-rescued-2nd-day-of-operation-underway-in-balochistan">attacks</a>. In February, nearly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896269/62pc-of-deaths-from-terror-attacks-in-balochistan">62 per cent</a> of the total terrorism-related deaths in the country occurred in Balochistan.</p>
<p>The move came after a notification issued by the Balochistan Home Department on Aug 6, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, ordered the immediate suspension of data services until Aug 31, citing the “peculiar law and order situation” in the province.</p>
<p>“It is, therefore, requested to please direct the concerned authorities for suspension/closure of 3G and 4G services in the entire province … to avoid any untoward incident,” the notification read.</p>
<p>“The service has been suspended because they (militants) use it for coordination and sharing information,” Rind said, according to <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>The suspension follows the government announcement from last month <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927007">banning</a> Pakistani Zaireen (pilgrims) from travelling by road from Quetta to Iran and Iraq due to national security concerns.</p>

<p>On March 11, the Pesha­war-bound Jaffar Express train became the target of an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897237/rescue-operation-for-hostages-underway-after-terrorists-attack-jaffar-express-in-balochistan">unprecedented hijacking</a>, when terrorists fired on the locomotive and took over 400 passengers hostage.</p>
<p>Media reports said that security forces had surrounded the area and launched a clearance operation to rescue all passengers. <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported that security forces had rescued 80 hostages held by the terrorists.</p>
<p>Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on March 12 that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419">clearance operation</a>, launched after the train’s unprecedented hijacking in Balochistan, ended with all 33 terrorists being killed.</p></p>
