            <p><p>• Observes things are calming down following contacts between DGMOs; NSA to lead Pakistan side during dialogue<br />
• Says Nawaz was consulted before army chief’s elevation to field marshal</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said Saudi Arabia could be the “neutral” venue for much-needed talks between Pakistan and India on critical issues.</p>
<p>The premier also said that he had consulted PML-N President Nawaz Sharif on his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912186/cabinet-approves-coas-gen-asim-munirs-promotion-to-field-marshal">decision</a> to elevate Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir to field marshal.</p>
<p>Talking to a group of TV anchors at the PM House, he said that Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism will be the key points during the dialogue with India.</p>
<p>In response to a question if there was a possibility of a third venue for talks in light of the mediation offered by US President Donald Trump, the premier ruled out the possibility of China as a neutral venue, saying India would never agree to that.</p>
<p>However, a participant told <em>Dawn</em>, the PM expressed the hope that Saudi Arabia could be the third country where both sides could agree to hold the negotiations.</p>
<p>When it was pointed out that India intends to hold dialogue on terrorism while Pakistan wants to focus on Kashmir, the PM reiterated: “Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism will be the key points during Pakistan-India talks.”</p>
<p>Regarding the appointment of COAS Gen Munir as field marshal, PM Shehbaz said: “It was my own decision to make the army chief a field marshal.”</p>
<p>Responding to a question that Nawaz Sharif had always remained opposed to giving extension to the army chief’s term in office, PM Shehbaz said he took his elder brother into confidence before taking any decision and likewise the COAS was made field marshal after consultation with the ruling party president.</p>
<p>“I always consult Nawaz Sharif before taking any key decision and that also happened in case of [elevation of] Gen Asim Munir,” he added.</p>
<p>In reply to a question that the PTI-led KP government needs to be supported in its efforts for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912005">eradicating</a> terrorism, the prime minister said Centre was already helping the province in this regard as over Rs600 billion had been released to the KP government under the Public Sector Development Programme.</p>
<p>He said that situation between Pakistan and India was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910567">de-escalating</a> after the DGMOs of the two sides made contacts with each other.</p>
<p>He said if talks were held between the two arch rivals, the National Secur­ity Adviser will lead Paki­stan’s side in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting on housing</strong></p>
<p>Presiding over a meeting on the low-cost housing, the prime minister said that affordable projects would not only make residential units accessible to the common man but would also boost national economy and create jobs.</p>
<p>He said the relevant task force, in collaboration with the ministry of fina­n­ce and banks, should soon submit recommendations for financing low-cost hou­s­ing projects, which should be included in the upcoming budget proposals.</p>
<p>He observed that sustainable growth of economy was closely linked with the development of the construction sector.</p>
<p>Ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Riaz Hussain Pirzada, Ahad Khan Cheema, Muh­a­mmad Aurangzeb, and Ali Pervaiz Malik, the FBR chairman and other senior officials attended the mee­t­ing, the PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.</p>
<p>The meeting was infor­med that the Condominium Act 2025 and amendments to the Foreclosure Law were in their final stages and after their approval it would become easier to obtain loans for the construction and ownership of homes under the low-cost housing schemes.</p>
<p>The task force briefed the meeting on the progress in initiating construction projects, particularly low-cost housing schemes.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912486/imf-yet-to-decide-on-budget-relief-request' target='_blank'><strong>IMF yet to decide on budget relief request</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Seeking effective and practical steps for the realisation of agriculture income tax and improvements in retail sector taxation, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has yet to take a position on Pakistan’s request for relief measures in the upcoming <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909569">budget</a>, due on June 2.</p>
<p>The authorities, however, have committed to meeting any revenue shortfall through reduced expenditure in the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) during the current year. An increase in the petroleum levy and the introduction of a carbon levy on petroleum and other energy products are expected to be part of the forthcoming budget, sources said.</p>
<p>Informed sources told <em>Dawn</em> that, on the directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, officials at the Ministry of Finance and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) have discussed possible relief measures with the IMF mission, which has been engaged in budget <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912130">discussions</a> since May 14. Among the proposed concessions is an average 2.5 per cent reduction in income tax rates across all salaried income slabs.</p>
<p>However, this proposal hinges on IMF staff being satisfied with the government’s revenue plan that supports the programme’s target of a 1.6pc primary budget surplus — approximately Rs2.1 trillion. An official told <em>Dawn</em> that discussions on budget targets are still ongoing and that no measures have been finalised.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Authorities pledge PSDP cuts to cover revenue gap</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Datasheets and projections, in line with the proposed budgetary framework reviewed in the first biannual review a few weeks ago, have been shared with the IMF. Responses to the Fund’s queries are currently being compiled. The official said that the IMF’s position on the proposed revenue and expenditure strategy will become clearer once its staff analyses the data through its software-based framework.</p>
<p>He added that the IMF has neither accepted nor rejected the proposed relief measures for the budget, contrary to reports in certain quarters. Formal discussions regarding budgetary proposals for the real estate sector have yet to take place.</p>
<p>The government’s “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1835356">Tajir Dost</a>” scheme for retailers, meanwhile, has failed to yield the desired results and is likely to be replaced by a more effective revenue collection strategy.</p>
<p>The IMF has also emphasised the need to reduce provincial expenditures and increase provincial revenue contributions to maintain fiscal discipline and progress towards implementing a national fiscal pact. A key priority at the provincial level, according to the Fund, should be the effective enforcement of agriculture income tax beginning September 2025.</p>
<p>The government has pledged to withhold PSDP disbursements to offset revenue shortfalls and expects additional tax revenues through the resolution of litigation cases. The Fund has already acknowledged the authorities’ commitment to pursuing resolution of outstanding legal cases — worth Rs367 billion out of a total Rs770bn under dispute. These include cases before the Supreme Court (Rs43bn), high courts in Islamabad, Sindh and Lahore (Rs217bn), and the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (Rs104bn).</p>
<p>A favorable SC ruling could effectively resolve cases involving an estimated Rs120bn, according to the IMF.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912541/china-makes-taliban-regime-islamabad-agree-on-ties-upgrade' target='_blank'><strong>China makes Taliban regime, Islamabad agree on ties upgrade</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Afghanistan on Wednesday agreed in principle to upgrade their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912365">diplomatic relations</a> by exchanging ambassadors — a key step towards normalising ties after years of strained relations between Islamabad and the Taliban administration in Kabul.</p>
<p>The understanding was reached during an informal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910314">trilateral meeting</a> of foreign ministers from Pakistan, China, and Afghanistan in Beijing. The talks were part of Beijing’s broader effort to ease regional tensions and advance connectivity through its Belt and Road Initiative.</p>
<p>“Afghanistan and Pakistan expressed clear willingness to elevate diplomatic relations and agreed in principle to exchange ambassadors as soon as possible,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a statement released by China’s foreign ministry.</p>
<p>“China welcomes this and will continue to provide assistance for the improvement of Afghanistan-Pakistan relations,” Yi said.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>China, Pakistan agree on CPEC extension to Kabul</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, Pakistan and China noted that there was an agreement on the extension of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Although no country has formally recognised the Taliban regime since its return to power in 2021, several including China, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia maintain ambassadors in Kabul. China and the UAE also host Taliban-appointed ambassadors, while Russia last month <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906189/russia-allows-taliban-to-have-ambassador-in-moscow">agreed</a> to accept a Taliban ambassador in Moscow.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Afghanistan currently only have chargés d’affaires posted to each other’s capitals.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s meeting followed a thaw in Pakistan-Afghanistan ties, which have been marred by deep mistrust, cross-border attacks, and sharp disagreements over the presence of the banned Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants operating from Afghan territory. Islamabad has long accused Kabul of harboring TTP fighters, who were blamed for a 70pc increase in attacks inside Pakistan in 2024.</p>
<p>Recent diplomatic efforts have aimed to turn the tide. In March 2025, Special Envoy for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899846">visited</a> Kabul for the first time in over a year. His mission was followed by a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905251">high-level visit</a> by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on April 19, where both sides pledged to prevent their territories from being used for terrorist activities and agreed on trade facilitation measures.</p>
<p>The trilateral meeting in Beijing further built on this momentum. China, which has strategic interests in regional stability and economic integration, hosted the gathering to help resume the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan trilateral dialogue, which had been paused since 2023.</p>
<p>The key outcomes from the Beijing meeting. besides the agreement on the appointment of ambassadors in each other’s capitals, included commitments to enhance cooperation in security and counter-terrorism, including joint action against militant groups and external interference; support for extending the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) into Afghanistan; and an understanding to formally resume the trilateral process by convening the sixth China-Afghanistan-Pakistan Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue in Kabul.</p>
<p>“Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to promoting close, cooperative ties with Afghanistan, especially in trade, transit, health, and connectivity,” Pakistan’s Foreign Office said in a statement following the meeting.</p>
<p>China emphasised that all sides must “safeguard their sovereignty, security and national dignity” and reiterated its support for regional partners pursuing development paths “suited to their national conditions.”</p>
<p>With Wednesday’s developments, Pakistan and China appear to be betting that deeper engagement and economic incentives can draw Kabul closer and temper instability in the region.</p>
<p><strong>CPEC extension</strong></p>
<p>Wang Yi noted Chinese and Pakistani support for Afghanistan’s reconstruction and development, and readiness to expand trade exchanges with Afghanistan. He further said that there was an agreement on “the extension of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to Afghanistan.”</p>
<p>The same was echoed by FO, which said, “China and Pakistan reiterated their support for extending the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan under the broader framework of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation.”</p>
<p>All three sides appeared cautiously optimistic about the progress toward normalised ties between Islamabad and Kabul.</p>
<p>“The process of normalisation will not be quick,” commented a diplomat not authorised to speak publicly, “but the fact that Islamabad and Kabul are talking again at this level and agreeing in principle on ambassadors is a significant development.”</p>
<p>For Beijing, which has maintained an ambassador in Kabul and recognised a Taliban-appointed envoy last year, the meeting reflects a strategy of “mini-multilateralism”, which is a targeted diplomatic format aimed at tackling specific regional challenges.</p>
<p>The meeting’s significance is heightened by India’s recent diplomatic overtures to the Taliban, including a call last week between Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Amir Khan Muttaqi. This comes amid growing Taliban frustration with Pakistan over refugee deportations and border closures.</p>
