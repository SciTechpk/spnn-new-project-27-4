            <p><p>At least eight security personnel were martyred in a suicide blast in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district on Saturday, according to a statement issued by the KP chief minister’s office, updating the previous toll of four injured.</p>
<p>According to the statement, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur condemned the attack, which took place in the Mir Ali area in North Waziristan, and expressed his condolences and prayers for the martyrdom of the personnel.</p>
<p>“I salute security personnel and their families who have sacrificed their lives for the country and the nation,” Gandapur was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>“Security forces have made unprecedented sacrifices to establish peace in the country and eliminate terrorism,” the CM added. “These sacrifices further raise the resolve and morale of the nation against terrorism.</p>
<p>“Everyone in the nation stands with security forces in the war against terrorism,” the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Earlier, District Police Officer (DPO) Waqar Ahmed told <em>Dawn.com</em> that four civilians were injured in the “suicide attack” carried out through a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device.</p>
<p>The attack comes days after two soldiers were martyred and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919801/two-soldiers-martyred-11-terrorists-killed-in-south-waziristan-ibo-ispr">11 terrorists</a> were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in KP’s South Waziristan district.</p>
<p>No one has so far claimed responsibility.</p>
<p>On June 15, a Frontier Corps (FC) soldier was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917345/fc-soldier-cop-martyred-in-waziristan-orakzai-attacks">martyred</a> in a targeted gun attack in Ladha tehsil of Upper South Waziristan district.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915363">14 terrorists</a> were killed in North Waziristan’s Datta Khel town during a security operation.</p>

<p>Militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in the country last month, according to data <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914847/militant-attacks-increased-to-85-in-may-pakistan-institute-for-conflict-and-security-studies">released</a> by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, which recorded 85 attacks in May compared to 81 in April.</p>
<p>The military has said India was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">using its “assets”</a> to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, with ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry detailing “irr­e­futable evidence” of an Ind­ian military personnel’s involvement.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>The country ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>

            <p><p>Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan has ordered the suspension of 26 opposition MPAs for 15 sittings of the provincial legislature after their protests disrupted the proceedings, it emerged on Saturday.</p>
<p>The members raised slogans and protested during Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920664">speech</a> in the assembly yesterday, when she responded to PTI leadership’s comments that ex-premier Nawaz Sharif — also an MNA — had been removed from the political arena.</p>
<p>According to an order issued by Malik on Friday, the suspended MPAs “became disorderly, beyond all parliamentary reasoning and practices”, including tearing the agenda papers and hurling torn pieces towards the treasury benches as well as using “offensive, abusive, and unparliamentary language and slogans”.</p>
<p>The order was issued under Rule 210 of the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.pap.gov.pk/uploads/downloads/rules_of_procedure_5.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Punjab Assembly Rules of Procedure 1997</a> (power to order withdrawal or suspension of member) and stated that the 26 MPAs violated four provisions of Rule 223.</p>
<p>These were (c) (shall not interrupt any member while speaking by disorderly expression or noises or in any other disorderly manner), (f) (shall maintain silence when not speaking in the assembly), (h) (shall not chant slogans, display banners or placards, throw and tear table documents and reports, etc), and (i) (shall not indulge in rowdy behaviour).</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The MPAs also allegedly manhandled the treasury members, blocking their way as they tried to approach the treasury benches with “threatening gestures”.</p>
<p>Malik, in his order, said he repeatedly tried to call the assembly to order, but the opposition “declined to act in accordance with the Rules and persisted with misconduct and disorder and kept challenging my orders and authority”.</p>
<p>The speaker concluded that the opposition MPAs had “disregarded [his] authority as speaker […] consistently and willfully obstructing the business of the assembly”.</p>
<p>Out of the 26 MPAs suspended, 17 were listed as belonging to the Sunni Ittehad Council, which PTI-affiliated candidates <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1816169">joined</a> last year after their party was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1805488">deprived</a> of its election symbol. At least eight others, however, were stated as PTI MPAs.</p>

He claimed SIC’s Hassan Malik had hit the minister with the budget book repeatedly, causing the Rehman to stop his address.</p>
<p>The letter by Chaudhry Amer Habib to the 10 lawmakers stated that the fine was being imposed on account of damages, as eight microphones were broken after the named individuals climbed upon the desks. It also cited a video recording of the incident.</p>
<p>The statement added that if the payment was not made within seven days, action would be taken under the <a class="link--external" href="https://punjablaws.punjab.gov.pk/uploads/articles/punjab-government-dues-recovery-ordinance-1962-pdf.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Punjab Government Dues Recovery Ordinance 1962</a>.</p>

<p>The 10 MPAs included six who have been suspended over yesterday’s session — SIC’s Tanveer Aslam, Imtiaz Mahmood and Riffat, along with PTI’s Nisar, Ismael and Aurangzaib.</p>
<p>Others were Shahbaz Ahmed, PTI’s Chaudhry Javed Kausar and Mohammad Ahsan Ali, and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen’s Asad Abbas.</p>
<p>The MPAs, the letter said, had violated Rule 223 (r), which states that a lawmaker “shall not break or harm any furniture, equipment or device installed in the chamber”.</p>

            <p><p>Pakistan is leading the Global Emerging Markets (EM) Rankings, indicating improvement in default risk, Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The current government has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900447/pakistans-economy-grew-173pc-in-2nd-quarter-says-govt">reassured</a> that the country has moved onto a path of economic recovery and growth, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916059">witnessing</a> “economic stabilisation” after a period of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1800599">turbulence and uncertainty</a>.  Some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1855270">assessments</a> by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904417">global rating agencies</a> have signalled gradual improvements in key economic indicators.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/kschehzad/status/1938913677760950388" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on X, Schehzad said, “As per the latest data posted by Bloomberg Intelligence, Pakistan stands out globally as the most improved economy in terms of reduction in sovereign default risk, as measured by CDS-implied probability.”</p>
<p>He said that the country has topped the Global Emerging Markets rankings with the “largest drop in sovereign default risk globally over the last 12 months”.</p>
<p>The statement said, “[The] default probability [went] down from 59 per cent to 47pc, a massive 1,100 basis points improvement.”</p>
<p>“This marks the sharpest decline among major emerging markets, ahead of Argentina (-7pc), Tunisia (-4pc), and Nigeria (-5pc).”</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The country’s ranking contrasted with places like Turkey, Ecuador, Egypt, and Gabon, which have seen their default risks rise, it added.</p>
<p>The statement also said that the “sharp decline in Pakistan’s risk signals renewed investor confidence” through macroeconomic stabilisation, structural reforms, successful International Monetary Fund engagement and timely debt repayments, and improved credit outlooks by S&amp;P, Fitch, and others.</p>
<p>Terming it “a resounding signal to global investors”, Schehzad said, “Pakistan is not only back on the map — it is moving forward with stability, credibility, and reform at its core.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb unveiled the <a class="link--external" href="https://finance.gov.pk/survey/chapter_25/Highlights.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25</a>, exuding confidence that Pakistan’s economy would be able to post growth of 2.7 per cent in the outgoing fiscal year for the gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>A United Nations <a class="link--external" href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/publication/world-economic-situation-and-prospects-as-of-mid-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> in May said that Pakistan was expected to experience “moderate growth, stabilising after a period of economic contraction”, with its GDP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911421">projected</a> to expand by 2.3pc in 2025.</p></p>
