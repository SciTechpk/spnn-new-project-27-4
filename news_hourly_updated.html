                <h2>SBP cuts interest rate by 100bps to 11pc</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) announced on Monday that it has decided to cut the policy rate to 11 per cent, amid trade and industry sectors advocating for a significant cut.</p>
<p>The central bank‚Äôs policy rate, after being slashed by 1,000bps from 22pc since June 2024 in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1888017">six intervals</a>, previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897015">stood at 12pc</a>.</p>
<p>April inflation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908067/inflation-hits-all-time-low-of-03pc">stood</a> at a low of 0.3pc, largely due to a high base a year ago. The reduction is also primarily attributed to lower prices of key food staples such as wheat and its derivatives, onions, potatoes and certain pulses, as well as a cut in electricity and fuel charges. These items carry significant weight in the inflation basket ‚Äî the Consumer Price Index (CPI) ‚Äî meaning minor price changes can heavily influence the overall rate.</p>
<p>According to a notification issued by the SBP today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the interest rate, noting that inflation in April turned out to be lower than expected, mainly due to a drop in prices of perishable food items and electricity and fuel charges.</p>
<p>Earlier, it noted that despite a long-term decline in inflation and real interest rates above 11pc, opinions on the central bank‚Äôs likely decision on the policy rate were divided, with trade and industry sectors advocating for a significant cut.</p>
<p>Researchers had conducted polls to gauge market sentiment, but the 0.3pc inflation in April has caused division among those who were confident there would be no change in the interest rate.</p>
<p>However, many experts <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908316">believed</a> the SBP would cut the rate by 50bps. Some have also found reasons for a likely status quo as they feel the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">war-like situation</a> between India and Pakistan has created uncertainty that may escalate prices.</p>
<p>This situation may force the central bank to adopt a cautious approach in the face of sudden shocks of higher inflation.</p>
<p>The SBP‚Äôs MPC met today to set the key interest rate for the next two months. In March, the central bank delivered a surprise by leaving its policy rate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897015">unchanged</a> in the last review, disappointing the business community.</p></p>

                <h2>Escalating tensions with India to impact Pakistan‚Äôs economic growth: Moody‚Äôs</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Global rating agency Moody‚Äôs on Monday said that escalating tensions between India and Pakistan would weigh on Pakistan‚Äôs economic growth.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> on April 22 in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe.</a></p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India‚Äôs premier <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/india-gives-army-operational-freedom-to-respond-to-pahalgam-attack">granting</a> ‚Äúoperational freedom‚Äù to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the military warning of a ‚Äúswift‚Äù response to any misadventure by New Delhi, diplomatic channels have remained <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907930/us-hopes-that-indias-response-to-pahalgam-attack-doesnt-lead-to-broader-regional-conflict-vance">engaged</a> to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.moodys.com/researchandratings/region/asia-pacific/pakistan/042004" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">note</a>, the rating agency stated: ‚ÄúSustained escalation in tensions with India would likely weigh on Pakistan‚Äôs growth and hamper the government‚Äôs ongoing fiscal consolidation, setting back Pakistan‚Äôs progress in achieving macroeconomic stability.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>On Pakistan‚Äôs economic trajectory, it said that its macroeconomic indicators had been improving, with growth gradually rising, inflationary pressure easing and foreign exchange reserves increasing amid ‚Äúcontinued progress‚Äù in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.</p>
<p>However, the agency noted that ‚Äúa persistent increase in tensions could also impair Pakistan‚Äôs access to external financing and pressure its foreign exchange reserves, which remain well below what is required to meet its external debt payment needs for the next few years‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia and Pakistan‚Äôs diplomatic relations have deteriorated,‚Äù the agency said, recalling Information Minister Attaullah Tarar‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">statement</a> that Pakistan expected a military action by India.</p>
<p>Notably, the agency warned that India‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">suspension</a> of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">1960 Indus Waters Treaty</a> could ‚Äúseverely reduce Pakistan‚Äôs water supply‚Äù.</p>
<p>In comparison, Moody‚Äôs said that the macroeconomic conditions in India would remain stable, propelled by ‚Äúmoderating but still high levels of growth amid strong public investment and healthy private consumption‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn a scenario of sustained escalation in localised tensions, we do not expect major disruptions to India‚Äôs economic activity because it has minimal economic relations with Pakistan,‚Äù it said, adding that the country accounted for less than 0.5 per cent of India‚Äôs total exports in 2024.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>However, it did stress that higher <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1888023">defence spending</a> could impact on India‚Äôs ‚Äúfiscal strength and slow its fiscal consolidation‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur geopolitical risk assessment for Pakistan and India accounts for persistent tensions, which have, at times, led to limited military responses,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>It predicted that flare-ups ‚Äúwill occur periodically‚Äù as they have throughout the neighbouring countries‚Äô post-independence history. However, they will not lead to an ‚Äúoutright, broad-based military conflict‚Äù, it added.</p></p>
