            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan was appointed as the vice chair of the UN Security Council‚Äôs (UNSC) Counter-Terrorism Committee on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The committee was established by UNSC resolution 1373 (2001), adopted unanimously on September 28, 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.</p>
<p>The committee, comprising all 15 UNSC members, is tasked with monitoring implementation of the above resolution, which requested countries to implement several measures intended to enhance their legal and institutional ability to counter terrorist activities at home, in their regions and around the world.</p>
<p>Pakistan was also appointed head of the UNSC committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011), which oversees the implementation of the sanctions measures on the Afghan Taliban.</p>
<p>In a press release, the Pakistan Mission to the UN called the appointments a ‚Äúsignificant diplomatic development‚Äù.</p>

<p>It added that Pakistan was also appointed as the co-chair of the UNSC‚Äôs Informal Working Group (IWG) on documentation (working methods) and the newly established IWG on Sanctions.</p>
<p>The IWG on documentation focuses on improving the UNSC‚Äôs working methods, transparency, efficiency and inclusiveness.</p>
<p>The IWG on Sanctions issues aims to review and enhance the design, implementation, and effectiveness of UN sanctions regimes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese appointments represent an acknowledgement of Pakistan‚Äôs active engagement with the United Nations system, including its constructive role as an elected member of the Security Council,‚Äù the press release said, adding, ‚ÄúThey are also an international recognition of Pakistan‚Äôs counter-terrorism efforts‚Äù.</p>
<p>Pakistan, it said, remained committed to working with the UN and fellow member states in advancing the principles and purposes of the UN Charter as well as playing its part in the global fight against terrorism in collaboration with its international partners.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1882311">began</a> a two-year term as a non-permanent UNSC member on the first day of the new year.</p>
<p>This marks Pakistan‚Äôs eighth term on the council, providing an opportunity to shape discussions on pivotal international issues, but also posing significant challenges.</p>

It will preside over the council in July, a key opportunity to set the agenda and foster dialogue.</p>
<p>While only permanent members hold veto power in the council, non-permanent members wield significant influence in terrorism-related sanctions committees, as decisions are made by consensus under established norms.</p>
<p>Pakistan‚Äôs term coincides with heightened tensions in conflict zones such as Gaza, held Kashmir and Syria.</p></p>

                <h2>PM Shehbaz invites opposition leader to consult on new chief election commissioner</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has invited the opposition leader for consultations on appointing the next chief election commissioner (CEC), months after the incumbent‚Äôs term expired in January, it emerged on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The constitutional deadline for the appointment of a new chief election commis¬≠sioner and two members of the Election Com¬≠mission of Pakistan (ECP)  <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897583">exp¬≠ired</a> on March 12, with no action from the government.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1866480">26th Amendment</a> allowed the CEC and the members to continue till their successors come in. As per Article 215(4) of the Constitution, the appointment of the CEC and members must be completed within 45 days.</p>
<p>In a letter dated May 16 and addressed to Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub ‚Äî seen by <em>Dawn.com</em> ‚Äî the prime minister noted that the term of the incumbent CEC, Sikandar Sultan Raja, expired on January 27 this year, adding that he was holding office in accordance with the second proviso to clause 1 of Article 215 of the Constitution (term of office of the Commissioner [and members]).</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn term of clause (2A) of Article 213 and sub-clause (b) of clause (2) of Article 218 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, three names each for the appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and two Members (i.e. for Sindh and Balochistan) are to be forwarded to the Parliamentary Committee for hearing and confirmation of any one person against each position,‚Äù the letter read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn view of the aforesaid, you are invited for a meeting for consultation, in terms of clause (2A) of Article 213 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, in order to finalize three names each for appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and Members from Sindh and Balochistan.‚Äù</p>
<p>No exact date for a meeting was given, nor were any names released about prospective CECs.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#disqualification-reference" id="disqualification-reference" title="Permalink"></a>Disqualification reference</h2>
<p>Separately, a hearing on the disqualification reference against Ayub was adjourned until July 1 as he was obligated to attend the upcoming federal budget session in parliament.</p>
<p>Last week, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Sadiq <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914430">forwarded</a> a reference seeking Ayub‚Äôs disqualification to the ECP.</p>
<p>The reference is based on an application filed by former MNA Babar Nawaz, who lost to Ayub in the 2024 general election in NA-18 (Haripur) by a margin of 82,000 votes.</p>
<p>A five-member committee chaired by the CEC presided over the hearing, with Ayub stating that he had yet to appoint counsel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe budget session will start soon and I am a member of the Finance Committee. The budget meeting will be held for two weeks,‚Äù he said, requesting time to attend the budget session and appoint a leader.</p>
<p>Sindh Election Commission member Nisar Durrani said that there is a 90-day time limit to act on the speaker‚Äôs reference. The commission granted Ayub‚Äôs request and adjourned the hearing until June 24.</p>
<p>In a separate case in which the opposition leader was accused of rigging by Babar Nawaz, the opposition leader‚Äôs lawyer sought time to submit a reply and arguments. The commission adjourned the hearing until July 1.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters following the hearing, Ayub assailed the National Assembly for sending the reference ‚Äúwithout using their brains‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe speaker did not consult me about this reference,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn the 2018 elections, I beat my opponent by 40,000 votes. He previously approached the Abbottabad High Court, but the case was dismissed.‚Äù</p></p>
