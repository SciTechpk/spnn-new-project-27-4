            </a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday issued an <a class="link--external" href="https://nwfc.pmd.gov.pk/new/daily-forecast-en.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">alert</a> for heavy rainfall in several parts of the country, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northeast Punjab, Azad Kashmir and parts of Balochistan, for the next two days.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1852031#:~:text=Monsoon%20rains%20across%20the%20region%20from%20June%20to%20September%20offer%20respite%20from%20the%20summer%20heat%20and%20are%20crucial%20to%20replenishing%20water%20supplies.%20They%20are%20also%20vital%20for%20agriculture%2C%20and%20therefore%20the%20livelihoods%20of%20millions%20of%20farmers%20and%20food%20security%20for%20South%20Asia%E2%80%99s%20nearly%20two%20billion%20people.">fall across</a> the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat. They are crucial to replenishing water supplies and agriculture, and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security. However, they also wreak havoc by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>At least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922678/19-killed-as-country-braces-for-more-rain">19 people</a> lost their lives in Balochistan, KP, and the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi due to rain-related incidents in the past two days. An alert by the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) about a possible flood-like situation in various parts of the country has prompted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to order the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to be prepared to deal with potential emergencies.</p>
<p>In its latest weather update issued today, the Met Office said, ‚ÄúMonsoon rains continue to lash Pakistan, with further downpours expected in upper parts till July 10, 2025.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRain-wind/thundershower are expected today (July 8) in Punjab, KP, Azad Kashmir, GB, northeastern and southern Balochistan and Islamabad.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Met Office added that ‚Äúheavy rainfall is also likely at isolated places in Kashmir, northeastern Punjab, Potohar region, and northeastern and southern Balochistan‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe public is urged to exercise caution and stay informed as rain continues in the coming days,‚Äù the weather agency advised.</p>
<p>The low-lying areas in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Nowshera and Peshawar are expected to be submerged due to heavy rainfall, it warned.</p>
<p>Islamabad and other areas will receive downpours with strong winds and thunderstorms, while Karachi and other areas of Sindh‚Äôs coastal belt could receive drizzling or light rainfall, it added.</p>
<p>The advisory warned against flooding in rainwater drains and local streams in Galliyat; Islamabad/Rawalpindi; Kashmir; KP‚Äôs Mansehra, Kohistan, Abbottabad, Buner, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Nowshera, Swabi and Mardan districts; Punjab‚Äôs Dera Ghazi Khan and Murree; and Balochistan‚Äôs Barkhan, Kohlu, Musakhail, Dera Bugti, Nasirabad, Sibi, Loralai, Zhob, Kalat, Khuzdar, Lasbela, Awaran, Panjgur and Turbat districts.</p>
<p>It cautioned that heavy rainfall and downpours could cause landslides, leading to roadblocks and hurdles in traffic flow in the KP districts, Murree, Galliyat and Azad Kashmir.</p>
<p>In 24 hours since 8am yesterday, several cities recorded heavy to moderate rainfall across Pakistan.</p>
<p>In Punjab, Sheikhupura received 48mm of rainfall, Lahore 75mm, Islamabad 37mm (16mm in Saidpur, 12mm in Zero Point, 9mm in Golra), Gujranwala 6mm, Murree 5mm, Faisalabad 4mm, Sialkot 2mm, and 1mm each in Mandi Bahauddin and Hafizabad, along with traces of rainfall in Toba Tek Singh, Bahawalnagar and Kasur.</p>

                <h2>Quetta ATC sends Mahrang, other BYC activists on 10-day physical remand</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Quetta on Tuesday handed Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other organisers of the group into police custody for 10 days, extending their three-month detention.</p>
<p>In March, Mahrang and other BYC members were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899608">arrested</a> for ‚Äúattacking‚Äù the Quetta Civil Hospital and ‚Äúinciting people to violence‚Äù, a day after the group faced a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899479/tear-gas-water-cannon-employed-to-disperse-baloch-yakjehti-committee-protesters-in-quetta">police crackdown</a> while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.</p>
<p>Mahrang has been held at the Hudda District Prison in Quetta under Section 3 of the <a class="link--external" href="https://pakistancode.gov.pk/english/UY2FqaJw1-apaUY2Fqa-apaUY2Npa5prZw%3D%3D-sg-jjjjjjjjjjjjj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mainte¬≠nance of Public Order</a> (MPO) ‚Äî a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order.</p>
<p>Mahrang‚Äôs counsel, Advocate Israr Baloch, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the BYC organiser and five other activists were presented before Judge Saadat Bazai, who approved the state prosecutor‚Äôs request for their 10-day physical remand.</p>
<p>The other activists were Gulzadi, Bebow Baloch, Sibghatullah Shahji, Ghaffar Baloch and Beberg Baloch. Advocate Shoaib Baloch also appeared in the court as their lawyer.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The BYC members were presented in the court in ‚Äúfour different‚Äù first information reports (FIRs) after the last <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920724/mahrangs-detention-extended-for-another-15-days">extension</a> in their MPO detention expired, Israr added.</p>
<p>Advocate Jibran Nasir, who has served as Mahrang‚Äôs counsel in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916747">case</a> last month, shared with <em>Dawn.com</em> the FIR numbers provided by Mahrang‚Äôs family of the four cases.</p>
<p>According to a BHC judgment from May provided by Nasir, the FIRs included those registered at the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899910/mahrang-other-byc-leaders-face-terror-charges?utm_source=www.dailybiscuitt.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=dr-mahrang-baloch-faces-terror-charges#:~:text=Civil%20Lines%20Police%20Station">Civil Lines</a> police station on March 19 for storming the Civil Hospital and at <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899910/mahrang-other-byc-leaders-face-terror-charges?utm_source=www.dailybiscuitt.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=dr-mahrang-baloch-faces-terror-charges#:~:text=Brewery%20Police%20Station">Brewery</a> police station on March 2 for blocking the Western Bypass Road in Quetta.</p>
<p>Mahrang was taken into custody under MPO for a period of 30 days (first term) on March 22. Thereafter, her detention was extended for an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905705">additional 30 days</a> (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April.</p>
<p>After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody last month, the provincial government issued a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920724">fourth</a> extension order, extending their imprisonment by another 15 days.</p>
<p>Referring to that, Nasir said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DL1qq4eiQOp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on Instagram: ‚ÄúAfter the state ran out of ways to exploit colonial MPO laws the liberty of the BYC leaders is now being infringed by exploiting the ATC and penal laws.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúExpect long remands, delayed hearing of bail applications, likely dismissal of bail from ATC and when bail would finally be granted, expect another arrest and transfer to another district jail in another,‚Äù the renowned rights lawyer wrote.</p>

<p>While the BYC is not listed among banned organisations by the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta), Mahrang is included on its list of <a class="link--external" href="https://nfs.nacta.gov.pk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proscribed persons</a>.</p>
<p>Constitutional petitions seeking the release of Mahrang and two other activists were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912743">rejected</a> by the Balochistan High Court (BHC) in May.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Mahrang‚Äôs sister Nadia Baloch <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916661">appealed</a> the Supreme Court in June against the BHC decision.</p>
<p>The petition alleged that her repeated unlawful det¬≠e¬≠n¬≠tion and labelling her as a ‚Äúsympathiser of militants‚Äù was a planned effort by the respondents to stop her from raising her voice for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899305">missing persons</a>.</p>
