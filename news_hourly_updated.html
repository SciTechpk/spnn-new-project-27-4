                <h2>Indian jets walked into ambush due to ‚Äòintel failure‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ Report says faulty intelligence about range of PL-15 missile gave Rafale pilots ‚Äòfalse sense of security‚Äô<br />
‚Ä¢ Pakistani officials say electronic assault on Indian communications systems reduced situational awareness</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: India‚Äôs intelligence failure was central to the hour-long air <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">battle</a> between Pakistan and India in May, which led to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909172">downing</a> of Rafale aircraft by the Pakistan Air Force‚Äôs J-10 fighters using PL-15s missiles, according to a report.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> interviews with two Indian officials and three of their Pakistani counterparts found that the performance of the Rafale wasn‚Äôt the key problem: central to its downing was an Indian intelligence failure concerning the range of the China-made PL-15 missile fired by the J-10 fighter. China and Pakistan are the only countries to operate both J-10s, known as Vigorous Dragons, and PL-15s.</p>
<p>The faulty intelligence gave the Rafale pilots a false sense of confidence that they were out of Pakistani firing distance, which they believed was only around 150km, the Indian officials said, referring to the widely cited range of PL-15‚Äôs export variant.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe ambushed them,‚Äù the PAF official said, adding that Islamabad conducted an electronic warfare assault on Delhi‚Äôs systems in an attempt to confuse Indian pilots. Indian officials dispute the effectiveness of those efforts.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Indians were not expecting to be shot at,‚Äù said Justin Bronk, air warfare expert at London‚Äôs Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think-tank. ‚ÄúAnd the PL-15 is clearly very capable at long range.‚Äù The PL-15 that hit the Rafale was fired from around 200km away, according to Pakistani officials, and even farther according to Indian officials. That would make it among the longest-range air-to-air strikes recorded.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs defence and foreign ministries did not return requests for comment about the intelligence mistakes. Delhi hasn‚Äôt acknowledged a Rafale being shot down, but France‚Äôs air chief told reporters in June that he had seen evidence of the loss of that fighter and two other aircraft flown by India, including a Russian-made Sukhoi. A top Dassault executive also told French lawmakers that month that India had lost a Rafale in operations, though he didn‚Äôt have specific details.</p>
<p><strong>Account of aerial battle</strong></p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> spoke to eight Pakistani and two Indian officials to piece together an account of the aerial battle, which marked the start of four days of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">fighting</a> between the two nuclear-armed neighbours that caused alarm in Washington. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss national security matters.</p>
<p>Not only did Islamabad have the element of surprise with its missiles‚Äô range, the Pakistani and Indian officials said, but it managed to more efficiently connect its military hardware to surveillance on the ground and in the air, providing it with a clearer picture of the battlefield. Such networks, known as ‚Äúkill chains,‚Äù have become a crucial element of modern warfare.</p>
<p>Four Pakistani officials said they created a ‚Äúkill chain,‚Äù or a multi-domain operation, by linking air, land and space sensors. The network included a Pakistani-developed system, Data Link 17, which connected Chinese military hardware with other equipment, including a Swedish-made surveillance plane, two Pakistani officials said.</p>
<p>The system allowed the J-10s flying closer to India to obtain radar feeds from the surveillance plane cruising further away, meaning the Chinese-made fighters could turn their radars off and fly undetected, according to experts. Pakistan‚Äôs military did not respond to requests for comment on this point.</p>
<p>Delhi is trying to set up a similar network, the Indian officials said, adding that their process was more complicated because the country sourced aircraft from a wide range of exporters.</p>
<p>Retired UK air marsahl Greg Bagwell, now a fellow at RUSI, said the episode didnt conclusively prove the superiority of either Chinese or Western air assets but it showed the importance of having the right information and using it.</p>
<p>The winner in this was the side that had the best situational awareness, said Mr Bagwell.</p>
<p><strong>Change in tactics</strong></p>
<p>After India in the early hours of May 7 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988">struck</a> targets in Pakistan that it called terrorist infrastructure, the PAF chief ordered his squadrons to switch from defence to attack.</p>
<p>Five PAF officials said India had deployed some 70 planes, which was more than they had expected and provided Islamabad‚Äôs PL-15s with a target-rich environment. India has not said how many planes were used.</p>
<p>Five Pakistani officials said an electronic assault on Indian sensors and communications systems reduced the situational awareness of the Rafale‚Äôs pilots.</p>
<p>The two Indian officials said the Rafales were not blinded during the skirmishes and that Indian satellites were not jammed. But they acknowledged that Pakistan appeared to have disrupted the Sukhoi, whose systems Delhi is now upgrading.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the episode, India‚Äôs deputy army chief Lt. Gen. Rahul Singh accused Pakistan of receiving live inputs from China during the battles, implying radar and satellite feeds.</p>
<p>He did not provide evidence and Islamabad denies the allegation.</p>
<p>Beijing‚Äôs air chief Lt Gen Wang Gang, however, visited Pakistan in July to discuss how Islamabad had used Chinese equipment to put together the ‚Äúkill chain for the Rafale, two PAF officials said.</p>
<p>The Pakistani military said in a statement in July that Wang had expressed ‚Äúkeen interest in learning from PAF‚Äôs battle-proven experience in Multi Domain Operations.‚Äù</p>
<p>The hour-long fight, which took place in darkness, involved some 110 aircraft, experts estimate, making it the world‚Äôs largest air battle in decades. The J-10 jets shot down at least one Rafale, <em>Reuters</em> reported in May, citing the US officials.</p>
<p>Its downing surprised many in the military community and raised questions about the effectiveness of Western military hardware against untested Chinese alternatives. Shares of Dassault, which makes the Rafale, dipped after reports that the fighter had been shot down.</p>

                <h2>Irrigation shortfall feared as Mangla‚Äôs filling slows</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ The dam is holding 4.3MAF of water against its capacity of 7.3MAF<br />
‚Ä¢ Below average inflows in Jhelum mean water in reservoir increases only a few inches each day</p>
<p>LAHORE: Despite record <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927762/punjab-pdma-issues-high-alert-amid-rising-river-levels">rainfall</a> and flooding in rivers, experts have warned of a 25 per cent water shortage in a few months due to a significant decline in Jehlum River‚Äôs inflows.</p>
<p>The drop in inflows has also slowed the filling of the Mangla Dam, one of the country‚Äôs two biggest reservoirs.</p>
<p>Inflows in the Jhelum River on Saturday dropped to 25,200 cusecs, 47 per cent less than its recorded average. On the corresponding day last year, the inflows were 39,700 cusecs.</p>
<p>The last five-year average for the day was 47,900 cusecs and 44,200 cusecs for the last 10 years.</p>
<p>Due to lesser inflows, water in the Mangla dam was only increasing a few inches each day. According to water experts, this could result in a 25pc water shortage in the coming Rabi season.</p>
<p>From Thursday to Friday, the dam‚Äôs storage only increased from 1,200.65 feet to 1,201.20 feet, 41ft below the total capacity of 1,242 feet.</p>
<p>Currently, the dam is holding 4.3 million acre feet (MAF) of water against its total live capacity of 7.3MAF.</p>
<p>The loss of 3MAF water would translate into up to 12 to 15 per cent water shortages in the coming Rabi season.</p>
<p>Adding the permanent water loss of eight to 10pc due to the reduced capacity of the Tarbela Dam ‚Äî as a result of silt accumulation ‚Äî the country is expected to suffer 20 to 25pc water loss during the next Rabi season, according to experts.</p>
<p>According to the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) data, all but one river yielded less water than they did last year.</p>
<p>The data from April 1 to July 31 showed the Indus River produced 37.20MAF water, which is 31pc higher than its 10-year average and 36pc more than last year.</p>
<p>During the same period, the Kabul River yielded 8.2MAF water, 36pc less than its 10-year average and 53pc less than last year.</p>
<p>The Chenab River nearly maintained its average yield with 10.70MAF water, still 6pc less than the 10-year average but 3pc more than last year.</p>
<p>In total, the Jehlum river produced 8.7MAF water in the last four months. It was 27pc less than the last year and 28pc less than the 10-year average.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">Tensions</a> between India and Pakistan since early May have also affected water inflows in the Mangla Dam.</p>
<p>India has stopped sharing river inflows data since April when it unilaterally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274">suspended</a> the Indus Waters Treaty.</p>
<p>Irsa Spokesman Khalid Idrees Rana has said almost half a million acre feet of water had to be released from Mangla Dam to cover for the uncertainty created by India‚Äôs decision.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn May 5, inflows in the Chenab river dropped from 35,000 cusecs to mere 5,000 within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Similarly, on May 31, it dipped from 45,000 to a paltry 7,000 cusecs,‚Äú Mr Rana added.</p>
<p>Earlier, on April 5, inflows dropped from  10,000 to 4,000 cusecs.</p>
<p>To cover for these inconsistencies and ensure smooth irrigation of crops, Irsa released additional water from the Mangla Dam, Mr Rana said, adding these factors apparently slowed the reservoir‚Äôs filling.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNormally, we get two to three late showers every monsoon, which helps Mangla dam filling,‚Äù he said, adding the downpour didn‚Äôt happen this year and there was no forecast for one in the near future.</p>
