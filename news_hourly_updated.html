                <h2>Govt slashes petrol price by Rs7.54, hikes high-speed diesel by Rs1.48</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The federal government on Thursday night slashed the price of petrol by Rs7.54 per litre while raising that of high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs1.48 per litre for the next fortnight.</p>
<p>Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws, and private vehicles, petrol has a direct impact on the budgets of middle- and lower-income households. HSD fuels heavy transport, agricultural machinery, and trains. Its price is considered highly inflationary, influencing the cost of food and other essential goods.</p>
<p>In a press release issued today, the Finance Division stated that the price of petrol was set at Rs264.61 per litre and that of HSD at Rs285.83 per litre.</p>
<p>It added that it decided on these new rates ‚Äúfollowing a review of prevailing international market trends‚Äù and upon the recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and the relevant ministries.</p>
<p>Sources had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927531">previously said</a> that after four consecutive hikes, petrol and diesel prices were expected to fall by about Rs9 and Rs3.50 per litre, owing to lower international oil prices and reduced import premiums.</p>
<p>Based on prevailing tax rates, the ex-depot price of petrol was estimated to decline by around Rs9 per litre (3.3 per cent), while HSD was expected to see a reduction of Rs3.50 per litre (1.3pc), depending on final cost calculations.</p>
<p>According to informed sources, global oil prices softened slightly over the past fortnight, while the import premium on petrol dropped by nearly one-third ‚Äî from about $9.70 to $6.75 per barrel ‚Äî as regional tensions eased.</p>
<p>The government is currently collecting about Rs98 per litre on both petrol and diesel through various levies, despite maintaining a zero rate of general sales tax (GST) on all petroleum products. This includes Rs77.01 per litre on diesel and Rs78.02 per litre on petrol and high-octane products as petroleum levy and climate support levy (CSL), of which Rs2.25 per litre is attributed to CSL alone.</p>
<p>In addition, Rs20-21 per litre is being charged as customs duty on both fuels, regardless of whether they are imported or locally refined. Distribution and dealer margins account for another Rs17 per litre.</p>
<p>Petrol and HSD remain the government‚Äôs main petroleum revenue sources, with combined monthly sales of around 700,000-800,000 tonnes. In contrast, kerosene demand stands at just 10,000 tonnes per month. The government collected Rs1.161 trillion through petroleum levy in 2024-25 and projects a 27pc increase ‚Äî reaching Rs1.470tr ‚Äî in the current fiscal year.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="http://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#ogra-slashes-lpg-price-by-rs177-per-kg" id="ogra-slashes-lpg-price-by-rs177-per-kg" title="Permalink"></a>Ogra slashes LPG price by Rs17.7 per kg</h2>
<p>Earlier, Ogra reduced the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by Rs17.7 per kilogramme.</p>
<p>Last month, Ogra <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921342">notified</a> a decrease in the price of LPG by Rs7.51 per kg or 3.1 per cent for July. The new price for 11.8kg cylinder was Rs2,750.6 for July, against Rs2,838.31 for June. It said that the LPG producer price was linked with Saudi Aramco-CP and US dollar exchange rate.</p>
<p>In a notification from the regulator today, available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, Ogra set the new consumer price for an 11.8kg cylinder at Rs2,541.36 for August, compared to Rs2,750.6 last month. The maximum consumer price for LPG per kg was set at Rs215.37.</p>
<p>These prices will go into effect on August 1 (Friday).</p>
<p>The prices ‚Äúshall be regulated as the maximum LPG price at all levels of the supply chain for indigenous as well as imported LPG‚Äù, Ogra said.</p>
<p>The notification also showed that the new producer price for an 11.8kg cylinder stood at Rs2,054.02.</p>
<p>This is the third month in a row where LPG prices have fallen, with an 11.8kg cylinder costing Rs2,892.91 in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914531">May</a>, Rs2,838.31 in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914637">June</a> and Rs2,750.6 in July.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a parliamentary panel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924523/na-body-expresses-concern-over-unregistered-lpg-bowsers">expressed concern</a> over the ‚Äúpoor regulatory environment‚Äù in the petroleum sector, observing that lives were in danger after an official disclosure that almost half of a total of 2,000 bowsers handling LPG have not been registered anywhere.</p>
<p>Of an estimated 2,000 bowsers in operation, only 800 are registered with the Department of Explosives and just 247 have licences issued by Ogra. This points to a significant oversight lapse, the participants observed.</p></p>

                <h2>Govt acting on comprehensive and effective strategy to completely eliminate terrorist outfits: PM Shehbaz</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said the government was implementing a comprehensive and effective strategy to ‚Äúcompletely eliminate‚Äù the menace posed by the proscribed <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>, <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and other terrorist outfits to the country.</p>
<p>Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.</p>
<p>In response, the government labelled the group as <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and directed use of the term <em>khariji</em> for attackers. It later <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525">designated</a> Balochistan-based groups as <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">highlight</a> India‚Äôs alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office said the premier chaired a meeting of the Steering Committee on Counter-Terrorism and Establishment of the State Writ (Harden the State) today at the PM House. The meeting was attended by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, National Security Adviser Lieutenant General Muhammad Asim Malik, PM aide Rana Sanallah, the four provincial chief secretaries and police chief, ministers and officials.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan is working on a comprehensive, effective and workable strategy to completely eliminate <em>Fitna al Hindustan</em>, <em>Fitna al Khawarij</em> and other such anti-social elements,‚Äù the statement quoted PM Shehbaz as saying.</p>
<p>He said the state was determined to eradicate and uproot the scourge of terrorism, adding that even the world recognised Pakistan‚Äôs successful operations against terrorists.</p>

<p>The prime minister said the state had adopted a ‚Äúmulti-pronged strategy‚Äù in the war against terrorism and made ‚Äúfull and effective use‚Äù of important elements such as ground operations, legislation, meaningful public communication and discouraging extremist thinking.</p>
<p>The prime minister directed the committee to ensure effective coordination between the federal and provincial governments against terrorism and to strictly implement the recommendations of the committee in this regard.</p>
<p>Lauding the role of security personnel and law enforcement agencies, he said the provincial governments, Intelligence Bureau, Ministry of Interior and Counter-Terrorism Department had taken ‚Äúvery effective steps‚Äù in the war against terrorism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith the joint actions and cooperation of all the relevant institutions, effective actions were taken against smuggling, which made it possible to prevent it,‚Äù he said, adding that preventing the issue had a positive impact on the economy.</p>
<p>The prime minister said that only a peaceful and strong state structure free from terrorism could restore the confidence of investors at the international level, adding that the government had brought substantial changes, such as the digitisation of all systems and improvement in the tax system, for this end.</p>
<p>Pointing to the performance of the Pakistan Stock Exchange, he said the record increase in its index and the improvement in the country‚Äôs global ratings indicated the economy‚Äôs stability and would restore the confidence of foreign investors.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also said that the implementation of the repatriation programme for Afghans residing illegally in the country was also continuing effectively in accordance with international laws.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir had, similarly, a day ago <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927575/coas-munir-reaffirms-resolve-to-eradicate-terrorism-warns-of-decisive-response-to-all-threats">reaffirmed</a> the military‚Äôs resolve to eradicate the menace of terrorism from the country, underscoring the nation‚Äôs preparedness to respond decisively to any external or internal threats.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations, the army chief was speaking to a group of stakeholders at the 16th National Workshop in Balochistan.</p>
<p>‚Äú[The] COAS resolutely reaffirmed Pakistan Army‚Äôs unwavering commitment to uproot the menace of terrorism and [the] inevitability of socio-economic uplift of Balochistan for national cohesion and integration,‚Äù the statement had said.</p></p>
