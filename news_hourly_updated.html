                <h2>Country‚Äôs 18th polio case of this year reported in KP‚Äôs Tank</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A newly confirmed case of polio in Khyber Paktunkhwa‚Äôs Tank district has brought the total number of polio cases in Pakistan this year to 18, the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad said on Friday.</p>
<p>Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879016">endemic</a>. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891351">challenges</a> such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation have slowed progress.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://www.endpolio.com.pk/media-room/media-releases/2649-new-polio-case-underscores-ongoing-risk-in-south-khyber-pakhtunkhwa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme confirmed that a 10-month-old boy from Union Council Mullazai in Tank district was confirmed as the 11th polio case from KP this year, bringing the country‚Äôs total number of cases in 2025 to 18. Last year, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891351">74 cases</a> were reported nationwide.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe continued detection of polio cases underscores the persistent threat to children, particularly in areas with low vaccine acceptance,‚Äù the press release said. ‚ÄúIt is crucial for communities to understand that poliovirus can re-emerge wherever immunity gaps persist.‚Äù</p>
<p>It added that every unvaccinated child remained vulnerable and could also contribute to the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The press release pointed out that the only effective protection for polio ‚Äî a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis ‚Äî was through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p>
<p>Despite ‚Äúsignificant improvements‚Äù in the quality of polio vaccination campaigns nationwide, the laboratory said that southern districts of KP remained a key area of concern due to restricted access and operational challenges in house-to-house vaccination, leaving ‚Äúthousands of children unvaccinated‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to the press release, six campaigns, including four nationwide, have each reached over 45 million children since September 2024.</p>
<p>It added that the National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) plans to conduct two nationwide and one sub-national campaign between August and December this year, as well as targeted campaigns in selected high-risk districts, to help stop transmission and protect children from the virus.</p>

<p>As part of intensified efforts to eradicate polio in South KP, the prime minister‚Äôs Focal Person on Polio Eradication, Senator Ayesha Raza Farooq and NEOC Coordinator retired Captain Anwarul Haq held a meeting with KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah in Peshawar on Tuesday to review ongoing initiatives in the province.</p>
<p>The meeting focused on ‚Äúcampaign performance, current challenges, and targeted strategies to interrupt poliovirus transmission‚Äù, particularly in high-risk southern districts of KP, including Tank.</p>
<p>Farooq emphasised the need to ‚Äúresolve persistent access barriers and ensure the uninterrupted presence and performance of frontline vaccinators in high-risk union councils‚Äù.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Anwarul Haq presented a targeted strategy to improve the quality of campaigns and strengthen routine immunisation, particularly in southern KP.</p>

<p>The press release added, ‚ÄúA special planning meeting focused on South KP is scheduled to be held at the chief secretary‚Äôs office on August 2-3.‚Äù</p>
<p>The programme called polio eradication ‚Äúa collective responsibility that requires unified efforts at all levels‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile dedicated frontline polio workers continue to deliver life-saving vaccines, it is equally critical for parents and caregivers to ensure their children receive every dose of the polio vaccine,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCommunities must play an active role by supporting vaccination efforts, dispelling misinformation, and encouraging others to protect their children through timely immunisation.‚Äù</p>

<p>In June, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918236">claimed</a> that Pakistan has witnessed a decline of over 99 per cent in polio cases, saying that polio eradication remains a top priority of the government.</p></p>

                <h2>Enduring Pak-China partnership to keep playing pivotal role in regional stability: COAS</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Friday stressed that the ‚Äúenduring partnership‚Äù between Pakistan and China will continue to play a pivotal role in regional stability.</p>
<p>Pakistan and China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/china-says-it-backs-pakistan-in-defending-sovereignty">share</a> a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors ‚Äî including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure ‚Äî with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884628">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.</p>
<p>The army chief made the remarks at the 98th anniversary of the founding of the People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) of China, which was commemorated at General Headquarters in Rawalpindi today, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7374" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> by the military‚Äôs media affairs wing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe emphasised that their enduring partnership will continue to play a pivotal role in promoting regional stability and safeguarding shared strategic interests,‚Äù said the statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).</p>
<p>China‚Äôs Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong graced the occasion as the chief guest, while Defence Attach√© Major General Wang Zhong, Chinese Embassy officials and senior military officers from the Pakistani tri-services were also present.</p>
<p>COAS Munir extended a warm welcome to the Chinese guests and congratulated the PLA on its 98th founding anniversary, lauding the army‚Äôs ‚Äúpivotal role in China‚Äôs defence, security and nation-building‚Äù, the ISPR said.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The army chief emphasised that ‚Äúdespite shifting strategic dynamics, the friendship between the two nations has remained steadfast and unshakable‚Äù, according to the press release.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe COAS underscored the strength and strategic significance of Pakistan-China relations, emphasising that the bond between the two nations is unique, time-tested, and exceptionally resilient amid evolving regional and global challenges.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Field Marshal highlighted that the Pakistan-China strategic relationship exemplifies mutual trust, unwavering support, and shared commitment,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>Concluding his address, COAS Munir ‚Äúreaffirmed that the Pakistan Army and the PLA are true brothers-in-arms‚Äù, the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>Addressing the gathering, Ambassador Zaidong expressed his sincere gratitude to the army chief for hosting the event commemorating the PLA‚Äôs 98th anniversary.</p>
<p>He acknowledged the steadfast role of the armed forces in the ‚Äúfight against terrorism and reaffirmed China‚Äôs unwavering support for and commitment to its strategic partnership with Pakistan‚Äù, according to the ISPR.</p>

<p>Today‚Äôs renewed affirmation of the strong bilateral ties comes just a week after COAS Munir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926523/chinese-leadership-lauds-pakistans-role-in-regional-peace-during-meeting-with-coas-munir">paid an official visit</a> to China, where he met with Vice President Han Zheng and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.</p>
<p>During the visit, the Chinese leadership hailed the Pakistan Army as a ‚Äúcornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor‚Äù for peace in the region.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924658">reaffirmed</a> their commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation and promoting regional peace, stability, and development.</p>
