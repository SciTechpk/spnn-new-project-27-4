            <p><p>Pakistan has called for “intervention” from global powers in resolving key issues with India amid ongoing tensions, members of a high-level delegation presenting Islamabad’s stance said on Sunday after landing in London.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Pakis­tan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">launched</a> a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent conflict with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence there. As part of its global outreach, the team has arrived in London and will also visit Brussels.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow">delegation</a> comprises former foreign ministers Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Subzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.</p>
<p>“The resistance we faced is that the Americans think that since [US] President [Donald] Trump has mediated the ceasefire, there is no need for further intervention. This was exactly our mission: to make them understand that intervention is needed,” Dastgir told <em>Geo News</em> after arriving in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>“The diplomatic delegation fulfilled its objectives,” he asserted.</p>
<p>The former MNA added: “Our ministers also put forward this stance that if India does not come to the table for talks again, then due to [the water issue] and India’s irresponsible behaviour — saying that it does not need evidence for a war — a war in the subcontinent is certain.”</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Similarly, Subzwari told <em>Geo News</em>: “We want global powers to tell India that two neighbouring nuclear states cannot move forward in such a dangerous environment. It is not just damaging for the region but for the world’s peace.”</p>
<p>Noting that the delegation began its engagements with a multilateral forum, the United Nations, the senator stressed, “Despite showing our military prowess, we have come with an invitation to peace.”</p>
<p>Rehman, a former ambassador to the US, called the meetings “very positive”.</p>
<p>“They understood our points and the risks. They all also agreed that the weaponisation of water is extremely wrong,” she said, terming India-occupied Kashmir as the “largest open-air prison after Gaza”.</p>
<p>“Whatever the Indians do, good luck to them,” the PPP leader quipped, referring to the delegations sent by New Delhi to various countries on the matter.</p>
<p>Rehman highlighted: “India’s delegation does not know what its mission is, except for maligning Pakistan. [However,] we did not go [to US] to malign India, but to tell Pakistan’s story.”</p>
<p>Senator Butt termed the response in both New York and Washington to Pakistan’s concerns on held Kashmir and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a> (IWT), which India unilaterally held <a href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home">in abeyance</a> after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909746">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir, as “fantastic”.</p>
<p>“If the Indus Waters Treaty is overlooked today, then no treaty in the future will stand any ground,” she asserted.</p>

<p>Summarising the delegation’s stance, former caretaker foreign minister Jilani stated: “Our message was that India committed aggression and that Pakistan is a peaceful country.”</p>
<p>He reiterated Islamabad’s desire for a peaceful resolution to the long-standing issues between the two nations.</p>
<p>Pakistan has appeared to be aiming to draw the US into a more proactive diplomatic role in South Asia.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called Trump a “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915520/pakistan-wants-trump-to-arrange-talks-with-india">man of peace</a>”, while Bilawal said it was “reasonable to expect that an American role in arranging a comprehensive dialogue would also be beneficial for us”.</p>

            <p><p>An Indian state riven by ethnic tensions imposed an internet shutdown and curfew after protesters clashed with security forces over the arrest of some members of a radical group, police said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Manipur in India’s northeast has been rocked by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1750880">periodic clashes</a> for more than two years between the predominantly Hindu Meitei majority and the mainly Christian Kuki community that have killed more than 250 people.</p>
<p>The latest violence was triggered on Saturday after reports of the arrest of five members, including a commander, of Arambai Tenggol, a radical Meitei group.</p>
<p>Incensed mobs demanding their release stormed a police post, set fire to a bus and blocked roads in parts of the state capital Imphal.</p>
<p>Manipur police announced a curfew in five districts, including Imphal West and Bishnupur, due to the “developing law and order situation”.</p>
<p>“Prohibitory orders have been issued by District Magistrates. Citizens are requested to cooperate with the orders,” the police said in a statement.</p>
<p>Arambai Tenggol, which is alleged to have orchestrated the violence against the Kuki community, has also announced a 10-day shutdown in the valley districts.</p>
<p>The state’s home ministry has ordered all internet and mobile data services in volatile districts to be shut off for five days in order to bring the latest unrest under control.</p>

<p>Internet services were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1778143/india-resumes-internet-ban-in-restive-manipur-after-protests">shut down for months</a> in Manipur during the initial outbreak of violence in 2023, which displaced around 60,000 people from their homes, according to government figures.</p>
<p>Thousands of the state’s residents are still unable to return home owing to ongoing tensions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875340">Long-standing tensions</a> between the Meitei and Kuki communities revolve around competition for land and public jobs.</p>
<p>Rights activists have accused local leaders of exacerbating ethnic divisions for political gain.</p></p>

            <p><p>Firefighters are currently working to put out a huge blaze that erupted in a factory in the Landhi Industrial Area in the early hours of the day, a rescue official said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, Abid Jalaluddin Sheikh, chief operating officer at Rescue 1122 Sindh, said that a fire broke out in a factory located in Landhi Export Processing Zone early Sunday morning, which spread rapidly and engulfed two other factories due to presence of combustible material there.</p>
<p>He said, “As soon as the information was received, the Fire and Rescue team of Rescue 1122 reached the spot.”</p>
<p>Rescue-1122 official Hassan Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the fire started at 4:31am.</p>
<p>According to Sheikh, a total of 12 fire brigade trucks,two snorkels and two ambulances of Rescue 1122 and the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) are present at the spot to provide full assistance to deal with any emergency situation.</p>
<p>“The rescue operation is facing difficulties due to the intensity of smoke and other difficulties, as well as the shortage of water, but Rescue 1122 is making efforts to control the fire,” he said.</p>
<p>Presently, Sheikh highlighted that firefighting operations were “in full swing and full efforts are being made to reduce the intensity of the fire because the intensity of the fire is very high”.</p>
<p>“The Rescue 1122 team is making full efforts to control this emergency situation by utilising all possible resources,” he said, adding that citizens have been requested to immediately report any emergency to 1122.</p>
<p>Fire incidents are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903361">common</a> in the metropolis due to the absence of adequate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1873091/fire-erupts-in-model-colony-warehouse-after-cylinder-blast">fire safety measures</a> in buildings.</p>
<p>Thirty shops were gutted when a huge fire erupted in a commercial building in Clifton in February.</p>
<p>Four people, including one firefighter, were affected by smoke inhalation and 12 fire tenders worked for four hours to bring the fire under control.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1816066">Last year</a>, the KMC informed the Sindh High Court that it had conducted a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1816066">fire safety audit</a> of over 265 commercial buildings, and not a single one was found to have a fire safety certificate or a no-objection certificate (NOC) issued by the fire brigade department.</p>
<p>Out of <a class="link--external" href="https://Out%20of%20265%20buildings,%20around%20155%20did%20not%20have%20fire%20alarms%20and%20smoke%20detectors%20installed,%20while%20the%20status%20of%20nine%20such%20buildings%20was%20not%20available%20in%20this%20respect,%20the%20KMC%20report%20added." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">265 buildings</a>, around 155 did not have fire alarms and smoke detectors installed, while the status of nine such buildings was not available in this respect, the KMC report added.</p>
<p>Similarly, the condition of the wiring and electric system of over 155 buildings was termed unsatisfactory. Regarding access to firefighting equipment, the report said that around 200 buildings had no or unsatisfactory firefighting equipment.</p>
