                <h2>SC‚Äôs Justice Naeem Afghan questions haste shown by NAB in auction</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: A Sup¬≠reme Court judge on Friday questioned the haste shown by National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929441">auctioning</a> six Bahria Town properties when six references against Zain Malik were still pen¬≠¬≠d¬≠ing adjudication before an accountability court, which would decide about confiscation of the properties if the accused was proved guilty.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter instituting applications for the termination of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1587548">plea bargain</a> (deal appr¬≠o¬≠¬≠ved in August 2020) betw¬≠een Zain Malik and NAB, the references against the accused have been reverted to the preliminary  stage,‚Äù observed Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, a member of the  three-judge SC bench that had taken up the appeal against the Aug 4  short order of the Islamabad High Court.</p>
<p>As the IHC in its short order <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929028">allowed NAB</a> to go ahead with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913654">auction</a> of the six attached properties, the anti-graft watchdog sold one property and received conditional bids for two other properties, at a combined value of Rs2.27 billion.</p>
<p>However, the auction of three remaining properties was shelved for want of qualifying bids.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Three-member bench to hear Bahria Town appeal on regular basis from 13th</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The SC decided that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929220">appeals by Bahria Town</a> would be fixed before any available three-judge bench of the apex court for regular hearing from Aug 13.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In its appeal, the Bahria Town contended that the IHC short order of dismissing its plea against the auction was bad in law and facts as it suffered from misreading and non-reading of the record and applicable legal provisions.</p>
<p>Both the Aug 4 order of the high court and the May 23 order of the accountability court were without lawful jurisdiction and in blatant violation of Section 88 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which does not authorise attachment of properties belonging to third parties, the SC was apprised.</p>
<p>The appellant argued that the IHC and the accountability court also failed to distinguish between the assets of the accused and those owned by a separate and independent juristic entity.</p>

                <h2>Talks between Bajaur Amn Jirga, TTP continue</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>BAJAUR: Amid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927600">talks</a> between the Bajaur Amn Jirga and terrorists for the latter‚Äôs peaceful return to Afghanistan, security officials have ruled out any compromise with anti-state elements here.</p>
<p>The seventh session of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928424">negotiation</a> between Jirga members and TTP leaders was held on Friday. Sources claimed that the terrorists, living among civilian population in Bajaur tribal district, were involved in sabotage and other crimes.</p>
<p>They said that the chief minister and security officials asked tribal elders to expel foreign terrorists, mostly Afghans, or vacate the area for one or two days for an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927454">operation</a> against terrorists.</p>
<p>While promising the continuation of operation against terrorists ‚Äúat all costs,‚Äù the chief minister and security officials called for efforts to minimise collateral damage.</p>
<p>Security sources said the government‚Äôs direct talks with terrorists or their facilitators was out of the question until the latter surrendered. They said the ongoing tribal jirga was a logical step to ensure the maximum public safety ahead of any action.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The sources, however, said both the state and residents were opposed to any compromise with terrorists. They said that the authority to conduct armed operations against terrorists rested with the state.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the seventh round of talks between Bajaur Amn Jirga members and terrorist leaders concluded in Lowi Mamund tehsil here on Friday evening.</p>
<p>Jirga head Sahibzada Haroon Rashid didn‚Äôt update the media about the outcome of the negotiations. However, there is a high likelihood of the Jirga sharing ‚Äúnew developments‚Äù with the media shortly.</p>
