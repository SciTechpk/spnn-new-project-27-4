            </a>
            <p><p>‚Ä¢ KP‚Äôs Malakand and Hazara divisions, parts of Punjab, Sindh likely to receive rain today<br />
‚Ä¢ PDMA says 135 killed in Punjab<br />
‚Ä¢ Medium to high-level flow expected in rivers from tomorrow</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Authorities are bracing for another spell of rain and thunderstorms, which are expected to hit many parts of the country from today (Monday).</p>
<p>According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the Malakand and Hazara divisions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the southern parts of Punjab and Sindh, eastern Balochistan and parts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) are likely to receive rain and thunderstorms with strong winds.</p>
<p>According to the PMD‚Äôs detailed national forecast, Islamabad may receive rain and thunderstorms at night.</p>
<p>In KP, while most districts will stay hot and humid, scattered rain with thunderstorms and gusty winds are expected in Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Malakand, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Kurram, and Waziristan.</p>
<p>Rain and thunderstorms are forecast for urban centres of Punjab in the south, such as Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan, though overall weather of the province will remain partly cloudy and humid.</p>
<p>Later at night, the rain spell is expected to reach Rawal¬≠pindi, Murree, Gali¬≠yat, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Narowal and Lahore.</p>
<p>In Sindh, where the moderate to heavy rain has alre¬≠ady been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925461/six-people-killed-during-widespread-rains-in-most-districts-of-sindh">reported</a> from some parts, several areas are bracing for more precipitation.</p>
<p>The PMD said Mir¬≠purkhas, Mithi, Tharparkar, Badin, Sujawal, Umerkot, Chhachhro, Padidan, Khair¬≠pur, Karachi, Thatta, Ghotki, Chhor, Sukkur, Kashmore, Shikar¬≠pur, Jacobabad, Larkana, Naushahro Feroze, Sanghar, Dadu, Hyderabad, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Matiari, and Shaheed Benazirabad are all expected to receive rain and thunderstorms, with heavy downpours likely in some areas.</p>

<p>In Balochistan, while most regions will remain hot and humid, the forecast includes rain and thunderstorms for Barkhan, Sibi, Kohlu, Musakhel, Killa Saifullah, Loralai, Dera Bugti, Nasirabad, Zhob, Kalat, Khuzdar, Awaran, and Lasbela.</p>
<p>For Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, partly cloudy weather with rain and thunderstorms is expected, and heavy rainfall is likely at isolated places in Kashmir.</p>
<p><strong>Rivers in high flood</strong></p>
<p>A separate alert from the country‚Äôs  Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) echoed the warning, saying that  ‚Äúmoderate to strong monsoon activity is likely to start‚Äù over the upper catchments of those same rivers after 36 hours.</p>
<p>The division specifically predicted a medium to high-level flow in the Chenab and  Jhelum rivers, along with their associated nullahs and those of the Ravi river, from July 22 to 24.</p>
<p>The Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Sunday released grim statistics, confirming 135 fatalities and 478 injuries across the province from monsoon-related incidents this year.</p>
<p>The casualties included 99 deaths from building collapses, 19 from drowning, 12 from electrocution and five from lightning strikes.</p>
<p>In response to the dire forecast, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia directed all district administrations to remain on high alert for what he termed a ‚Äúdual threat.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are facing dual threats of urban flooding in cities and flash floods in riverine areas,‚Äù Mr Kathia said, warning that heavy precipitation in upper catchment areas could cause dangerous water level rises in the Sutlej, Ravi, Chenab, Jhelum, and Indus rivers between July 22 to 24.</p>
<p>The Punjab government has also activated its compensation policy, providing financial assistance ranging from Rs 1m to Rs 5m to the families of those who lost loved ones.</p>

                <h2>Govt swings into action over Quetta ‚Äòhonour killings‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>QUETTA: A primary suspect was detained on Sunday and raids were underway for the arrest of other culprits after a gruesome video went viral, showing the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925448/viral-video-case-registered-in-couples-murder-and-suspect-arrested-says-balochistan-cm">killing</a> of a couple over ‚Äòhonour‚Äô in the Dagari area of Quetta.</p>
<p>The incident purportedly took place around Eidul Azha and has been described as an act of ‚Äòhonour killing‚Äô. In the video, a group of people can be seen killing a woman and a man, apparently for contracting a love marriage.</p>
<p>After the clip went viral on social media, a case on terrorism charges was registered on the ord¬≠ers of Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, and the Levies and the Counter-Terrorism Dep¬≠artment subsequently arr¬≠es¬≠ted one of the key suspects.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe case was registered under anti-terrorism laws‚Ä¶on behalf of the Balochistan government, as no one from the area, including the relatives or other people, submitted any application to the Levies or the CTD,‚Äù officials said, adding that efforts were underway to arrest more people.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

<p>The slain couple had reportedly married without the permission of their families and the matter was taken to the ‚Äòelders‚Äô of the area, who pronounced a death sentence.</p>
<p>Sources said the ill-fated couple, Ehsan Samalani and Bano Satakzai, were invited to the village for lunch and later taken to an abandoned place in Dagari, where they were informed about the decision of the elders.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou are allowed to shoot me, but nothing more than that,‚Äù the slain woman told the perpetrators in Brahvi before her murder.</p>
<p>She asked her killers to let her walk seven steps before shooting her. She was shot thrice apparently by her brother, followed by the killing of her partner. The bodies have yet to be recovered, further complicating the investigation.</p>
<p>The video is believed to have been filmed just before Eidul Azha, and the authorities are conducting raids to apprehend the remaining perpetrators, whose identities have reportedly been established but not made public.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe state will not remain a silent spectator to such barbarism,‚Äù said CM Bugti on X (formerly Twitter), vowing that justice would be served.</p>

<p>In a press conference at the Karachi Press Club on Sunday, Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind confirmed that the individuals seen in the video had been traced through facial recognition and Nadra data.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOne suspect is in custody, and data of all visible individuals in the video has been handed over to Nadra. We are closing in on the rest,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Mr Rind clarified that the state itself had become the complainant in the case to ensure accountability and justice, emphasising that external pressure would not be tolerated during the investigation.</p>

<p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, whose party rules Balochistan, condemned the cold-blooded killing, expressing profound grief and outrage over the incident. He said that those involved in this heinous murder are nothing less than beasts and deserve no mercy.</p>
<p>Aladdin Khilji, provincial director of Aurat Foundation and chairman of the Balochistan EVAWG Alliance (Ending Violence against Women and Girls), also condemned the act.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis video has shaken us to the core. It is a stark reminder that honour killings remain a brutal reality in Balochistan. From 2019 to 2024, 212 people have been murdered in the name of honour,‚Äù he said in a statement.</p>
