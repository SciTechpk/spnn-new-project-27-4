                <h2>SC Constitutional Bench dismisses pleas against transfer of IHC judges</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Supreme Court‚Äôs Constitutional Bench on Thursday announced its verdict in a case pertaining to the seniority and transfer of Islamabad High Court (IHC) jud¬≠ges, declaring that their transfers were not unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The bench ‚Äî headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and comprising Justices Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Shahid Bilal Hassan, Salahuddin Panhwar and Shakeel Ahmed ‚Äî took up petitions filed by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893249/ihc-judges-petition-sc-to-reclaim-seniority">five IHC judges</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898611">Karachi Bar Association</a> (KBA) and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904020/ihcba-undecided-as-sc-hears-pleas-against-judges-transfer-today">IHC Bar Association</a>, among others.</p>
<p>In February, Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar from the Lahore High Court (LHC), Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro from the Sindh High Court (SHC) and Justice Muham¬≠mad Asif from the Balochistan High Court (BHC) were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889123">transferred to the IHC</a>.</p>
<p>The controversy centres around the alteration of the judges‚Äô seniority list after these transfers as Justice Dogar was made the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889639">senior puisne judge</a>, which paved the way for his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891705">appointment</a> as the acting IHC chief justice after Justice Aamer Farooq‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891044">elevation</a> to the SC.</p>
<p>Today‚Äôs judgement was announced in a 3-2 majority ruling, with Justices Afghan and Ahmed dissenting.</p>
<p>In the short order, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, the SC noted that ‚Äúthe transfer of a judge by the president of Pakistan by means of Article 200 of the Constitution (permanently or temporarily) cannot be construed as a fresh appointment.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The order explained that exercise of powers of transfer by the president under <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912990">Article 200 of the Constitution</a> was not unregulated or unfettered.</p>
<p>Rather, it was structured on a ‚Äúfour tier formula which expounds that no judge shall be transferred except with his consent and after consultation by the president with the chief justice of Pakistan and the chief justices of both high courts‚Äù.</p>
<p>The short order emphasised that before exercising the power of transfer, certain inbuilt procedures and mechanisms had to be followed and the decision was ‚Äúwithin the sphere and realm of judiciary and not within the domain of executives‚Äù.</p>
<p>The short order added: ‚ÄúThus, for all intents and purposes, the transfer of judges by the president of Pakistan (‚Ä¶) is within the framework of the Constitution and cannot be
declared <em>ultra vires</em>.‚Äù</p>
<p>The judges further noted that the terms and conditions of transfer, including seniority, should have been taken up and mentioned by the president at the time of issuing the notification of transfer in terms of Article 200 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>The judges also said that they partially remanded the matter to the president, ‚Äúwithout upsetting the notification of transfer to determine the seniority after examining/vetting the service record of the transferee judges as soon as possible, including the question of whether the transfer is on a permanent or temporary basis‚Äù.</p>
<p>The order concluded that the seniority and transfer of judges was determined by the president by means of a notification/order and that Justice Dogar would continue in his role as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891705">acting chief justice</a> of the IHC till the seniority and nature of posting ‚Äî
permanent or temporary ‚Äî of the transferred judges were determined by the president by means of notification/order.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#dissenting-order" id="dissenting-order" title="Permalink"></a>Dissenting order</h2>
<p>In the dissenting order, authored by Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan, he said that the judges accepted the constitutional petitions.</p>
<p>The order declared the impugned notification regarding the transfer of concerned judges as ‚Äúnull, void and of no legal effect‚Äù.</p>
<p>Justice Afghan said, ‚ÄúThe permanent transfer of three Judges to IHC has been made
by the president in wrong exercise of discretion under Clause (1) of Article 200 of the Constitution.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added: ‚ÄúIt has offended Article 175A of the Constitution and has made the same redundant.‚Äù</p>
<p>The order also stated that the permanent transfer process of three Judges to the IHC was under the ‚Äúconcealment of relevant and material facts from the transferee Judges‚Äù, adding that it was also ‚Äúlacking meaningful, purposive and consensus-oriented consultation‚Äù with the chief Justices of the apex and high courts.</p>
<p>It further said that ‚Äúthe process for permanent transfer of three Judges to IHC has
been completed in an unnecessary haste.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the judges, the proportionate representation of provinces in IHC could have been achieved by ‚Äúmaking fresh appointments of judges from the provinces by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan under Article 175A of the Constitution‚Äù.</p>
<p>The dissenting note added: ‚ÄúIt [notification] is violative of Article 2A, Article 4 and Article 25 of the Constitution and it has undermined the independence of judiciary, due process and principle of equality.‚Äù</p></p>

                <h2>Pre-monsoon rains to lash country from June 20: PMD</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Thursday predicted that pre-monsoon rains will fall across the country between June 20 and 23.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1852031#:~:text=Monsoon%20rains%20across%20the%20region%20from%20June%20to%20September%20offer%20respite%20from%20the%20summer%20heat%20and%20are%20crucial%20to%20replenishing%20water%20supplies.%20They%20are%20also%20vital%20for%20agriculture%2C%20and%20therefore%20the%20livelihoods%20of%20millions%20of%20farmers%20and%20food%20security%20for%20South%20Asia%E2%80%99s%20nearly%20two%20billion%20people.">fall across</a> the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. They are also vital for agriculture, and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security for South Asia‚Äôs nearly two billion people.</p>
<p>According to a statement, ‚Äúcurrents from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal are penetrating the central and northern areas of Pakistan, while a westerly wave is expected to approach the north. Both of these weather systems are expected to arrive on June 20 (tomorrow).‚Äù</p>
<p>It added that duststorms, thunderstorms and heavy rain are expected in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit Baltistan, Murree, Galliyat, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mianwali, Sargodha, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sialkot, Narowal, Lahore, Faisalabad, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Haripur, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Malakand, Battagram, Shangla, Kohistan, Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, Nowshera, Charsadda, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Kohat, Bannu, Karak, Dera Ismail Khan, and Waziristan from June 20-23 with occasional gaps.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSimilar weather events could be expected in Zhob, Barkhan, Musakhel, Kalat, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan, Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar and Sahiwal from June 21-23, and in Sukkur, Larkana, Dadu, and Jacobabad from June 22-24.</p>
<p>PMD warned that the inclement weather ‚Äúmay damage loose structures like electric poles, trees, vehicles and solar panels‚Äù among others and advised farmers to ‚Äúmanage their crop activities keeping in view the weather conditions‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUrban flooding may occur in Lahore, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi [and] Islamabad during the forecast period,‚Äù the press release warned. ‚Äú[The] general Public, travellers and tourists are advised to take precautionary measures during the weather activity.‚Äù</p>
<p>PMD added that hot weather is likely to subside gradually during the forecast period.</p>
<p>Last month, heavy rain triggered flash floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Mohmand, South Waziristan and Upper Kohistan districts, damaging roads and agricultural land. However, no casualties were reported from any districts.</p>
<p>Heavy rainfall <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909665">triggered</a> flash floods in several areas of Halimzai tehsil in Mohmand district, including Shanikhel ,Tarikhel, Barokhel, Durbakhel and Babikhel.</p>
<p>The flood, caused by overflowing mountain streams, swept away dozens of livestock and damaged houses and link roads.</p>
<p>Last month, at least 13 civilians died and 92 others were injured as heavy rains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913072">lashed</a> several parts of Punjab.</p></p>
