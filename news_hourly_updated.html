                <h2>Enduring Pak-China partnership to keep playing pivotal role in regional stability: COAS</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Friday stressed that the ‚Äúenduring partnership‚Äù between Pakistan and China will continue to play a pivotal role in regional stability.</p>
<p>Pakistan and China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/china-says-it-backs-pakistan-in-defending-sovereignty">share</a> a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors ‚Äî including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure ‚Äî with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884628">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.</p>
<p>The army chief made the remarks at the 98th anniversary of the founding of the People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) of China, which was commemorated at General Headquarters in Rawalpindi today, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7374" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> by the military‚Äôs media affairs wing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe emphasised that their enduring partnership will continue to play a pivotal role in promoting regional stability and safeguarding shared strategic interests,‚Äù said the statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).</p>
<p>China‚Äôs Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong graced the occasion as the chief guest, while Defence Attach√© Major General Wang Zhong, Chinese Embassy officials and senior military officers from the Pakistani tri-services were also present.</p>
<p>COAS Munir extended a warm welcome to the Chinese guests and congratulated the PLA on its 98th founding anniversary, lauding the army‚Äôs ‚Äúpivotal role in China‚Äôs defence, security and nation-building‚Äù, the ISPR said.</p>

<p>The army chief emphasised that ‚Äúdespite shifting strategic dynamics, the friendship between the two nations has remained steadfast and unshakable‚Äù, according to the press release.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe COAS underscored the strength and strategic significance of Pakistan-China relations, emphasising that the bond between the two nations is unique, time-tested, and exceptionally resilient amid evolving regional and global challenges.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Field Marshal highlighted that the Pakistan-China strategic relationship exemplifies mutual trust, unwavering support, and shared commitment,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>Concluding his address, COAS Munir ‚Äúreaffirmed that the Pakistan Army and the PLA are true brothers-in-arms‚Äù, the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>Addressing the gathering, Ambassador Zaidong expressed his sincere gratitude to the army chief for hosting the event commemorating the PLA‚Äôs 98th anniversary.</p>
<p>He acknowledged the steadfast role of the armed forces in the ‚Äúfight against terrorism and reaffirmed China‚Äôs unwavering support for and commitment to its strategic partnership with Pakistan‚Äù, according to the ISPR.</p>

<p>Today‚Äôs renewed affirmation of the strong bilateral ties comes just a week after COAS Munir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926523/chinese-leadership-lauds-pakistans-role-in-regional-peace-during-meeting-with-coas-munir">paid an official visit</a> to China, where he met with Vice President Han Zheng and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.</p>
<p>During the visit, the Chinese leadership hailed the Pakistan Army as a ‚Äúcornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor‚Äù for peace in the region.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924658">reaffirmed</a> their commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation and promoting regional peace, stability, and development.</p>

                <h2>Sindh High Court suspends order removing KE CEO</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Friday suspended an order by the provincial ombudsman for protection against harassment of women removing K-Electric (KE) Chief Executive Officer Moonis Alvi from his position over allegations of sexual harassment.</p>
<p>A day prior, the ombudsman <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927799">ordered</a> the removal of KE CEO Alvi after finding him guilty of workplace harassment.</p>
<p>Alvi, along with other KE employees, was accused of workplace harassment by the company‚Äôs former chief marketing and communication officer, Mahreen Aziz Khan, read the order issued by provincial ombudsman retired Justice Shahnawaz Tariq.</p>
<p>According to a petition Alvi filed with the SHC today ‚Äî available with <em>Dawn.com</em> ‚Äî his lawyers argued that Khan has neither levelled any allegations of ‚Äúharassment of a sexual or physical nature‚Äù before the ombudsman, nor presented any evidence of gender discrimination within KE.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere was no allegation that the petitioner, being in a position of authority, sought out any sexual favour, nor any gender based discrimination was alleged or could be made out as several women are holding high-level positions within the organisation,‚Äù the petition read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the circumstances, the findings in the impugned order are flimsy, not sustainable and completely disproportionate. No hostile work environment was alleged or proved as a result of gender based discrimination nor as a result of harassment.‚Äù</p>
<p>The plea also noted: ‚ÄúThe learned provincial ombudsman did not have jurisdiction over the affairs of a trans-provincial organisation such as KE and so also did not have jurisdiction to take cognisance on a complaint filed by an ex-employee.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a court order issued today and seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, the SHC ruled that since KE is a ‚Äútrans-provincial entity/establishment‚Äù, the provincial ombudsman has no jurisdiction to act upon the complaints.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHas placed on record the earlier order passed by this bench on [July 29] in CP No D-3589/2025, wherein it is, inter alia, stated that the court has held in reported Judgements ‚Ä¶ that in case of trans-provincial establishment/entity, the federal ombudsman is competent to look into such complaints,‚Äù the order read.</p>
<p>The order added that the petitioner‚Äôs lawyers noted that KE was classed as a trans-provincial entity in a 2015 judgement. The bench stated that the ‚Äúcontention raised requires consideration‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIssue notices to the respondents as well as learned advocate general Sindh and DAG (deputy attorney general) for [August 8]. Till the next date of hearing, [the] operation of the impugned decision will remain suspended,‚Äù the order read.</p>
<p>It, however, ordered Alvi to pay a Rs2.5 million penalty to the court.</p>
<p>In her application, Khan had accused Alvi, KE Chief People Officer Rizwan Dallia, Chief of Security retired Colonel Wahid Asghar and Member of the Board of Directors and Chairman Board HR Committee Khalid Rafi, of ‚Äúcausing harassment, intimidation and mental agony‚Äù.</p>
<p>The ombudsman‚Äôs order said that Alvi had ‚Äúcommitted harassment, created a hostile environment and caused mental agony at the workplace to [Khan] and her team‚Äù.</p>
<p>Consequently, Alvi was penalised under Section 4(4)(ii)(c) of the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, and ordered removed from his service instantly, along with a penalty of Rs2.5 million, which would be paid to Khan as compensation within 30 days of the order being passed.</p></p>
