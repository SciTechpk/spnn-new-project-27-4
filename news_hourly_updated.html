                <h2>Iran says Israel attack ‘declaration of war’ following strikes on nuclear facilities, missile factories</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Iran said Israel’s deadly strikes on its military and nuclear facilities on Friday were a “declaration of war” and called on the UN Security Council to act.</p>
<p>Israel launched widescale strikes against Iran early on Friday, saying it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders and that this was start of a “prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.”</p>
<p>Iran promised a harsh response and Israel said it was working to intercept about 100 drones launched towards Israeli territory in retaliation.</p>
<p>But around 0800 GMT (1pm PKT), Israeli media said an order to citizens to remain near protected areas had been lifted, suggesting that most or all the drones had been neutralised.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Key developments so far:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Iran says top commanders, including Hossein Salami, killed</li>
<li>Israel says military intercepting drones fired from Iran in response</li>
<li>At least 95 casualties so far, including women and children</li>
<li>Iran’s supreme leader appoints new military commanders</li>
<li>Trump urges Iran to make deal, warns of more “death and destruction”</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>In a letter to the United Nations, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the attack as a “declaration of war” and “called on the UN Security Council to immediately address this issue”, the ministry said.</p>
<p>An Israeli security source said Israeli Mossad commandos had operated deep inside the Islamic Republic before the attack and the Israeli spy agency and military had led a series of covert operations against Iran’s strategic missile array.</p>
<p>Israel also established an attack-drone base near Tehran, the source added.</p>
<p>The military said it had carried out a large-scale strike against Iran’s air defences, destroying “dozens of radars and surface-to-air missile launchers”. Iranian media and witnesses reported explosions including at the main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz.</p>
<p>Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards Corps said its top commander, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916918/who-was-hossein-salami-the-revolutionary-guards-chief-killed-in-israeli-attacks">Hossein Salami</a>, had been killed and state media reported the unit’s headquarters in Tehran had been hit. Several children were killed in a strike on a residential area in the capital, they said.</p>
<p>At least 95 people were wounded in Israel’s attack and taken to medical centres in 12 different provinces that were targeted, national emergency services spokesperson Mojtaba Khaledi told state TV.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei swiftly appointed new Revolutionary Guards and armed forces chiefs to replace those killed in targeted Israeli strikes on Friday.</p>
<p>In separate decrees, Khamenei named Mohammad Pakpour to replace Salami as commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and Abdolrahim Mousavi to replace Mohammad Bagheri as chief of the armed forces general staff.</p>
<p>A senior adviser to Khamenei was wounded during the attack, state media reported.</p>
<p>“Ali Shamkhani, an advisor to the supreme leader… was injured in today’s attack by the Zionist regime,” according to state TV.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a recorded video message: “We are at a decisive moment in Israel’s history.</p>
<p>“Moments ago Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival. This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.”</p>

<p>Khamenei said in a statement that Israel had “unleashed its wicked and bloody” hand in a crime against Iran and that it would receive “a bitter fate for itself”.</p>
<p>An Israeli military official said Israel was striking “dozens” of nuclear and military targets including the facility at Natanz in central Iran. The official claimed Iran had enough material to make 15 nuclear bombs within days.</p>

<p>The United States said it had no part in the operation, which raises the risk of a fresh escalation in tensions in the Middle East, a major oil producing region.</p>
<p>Alongside extensive air strikes, Israel’s Mossad spy agency led a series of covert sabotage operations inside Iran, <em>Axios</em> reported, citing a senior Israeli official. These operations were aimed at damaging Irans strategic missile sites and its air defence capabilities.</p>
<p>At least six nuclear scientists were killed in Israel’s attacks, media outlets in the Islamic Republic reported.</p>
<p>Iran’s <em>Tasnim</em> news agency named the six scientists including Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, who was the president of the Islamic Azad University of Iran. Fereydoun Abbasi, a former head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, was also among the scientists killed, it added.</p>
<p>Later in the day, the organisation added that most of the damage from Israeli air strikes targeting its underground uranium enrichment facility at Natanz was at ground level.</p>
<p>“Most of the damage is on the surface level,” said the organisation’s spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi, adding that there had been “no casualties” at the facility where the enrichment centrifuges are housed underground.</p>
<p>A fresh round of explosions was heard in northwestern Iran, state television reported, following Israel’s wave of early morning strikes on multiple cities.</p>
<p>“A few minutes ago, new explosions were heard in East Azerbaijan,” the broadcaster said, as the <em>Tasnim</em> news agency said an earlier wave of strikes had hit 10 sites in the province, killing at least three people.</p>

<p>The administration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has released a statement, announcing that Iran will avenge the blood of every single individual killed in Israeli strikes, <em>IRNA</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85861499/Pezeshkian-administration-Iran-will-write-the-ending-to-this" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>“With a savage regime as this,” the statement read, referring to Israel, “one shall not speak but with the language of power.”</p>
<p>“As of this moment, the Islamic Republic of Iran’s government has begun the necessary defensive, political, and legal measures to make the illegitimate Israel regret [its aggression] and will deny the Israelis a moment’s rest,” it said.</p>
<p>“The world now better understands Iran’s insistence on its right to enrichment and nuclear technology and missile power.”</p>
<p>Iran has in the past 200 years never started a war, the statement said, but will not hesitate the slightest to defend itself.</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump urged Iran to “make a deal”, warning that there will be more “death and destruction” after Israel launched deadly strikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>“There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.</p>
<p>“Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left… just do it before it’s too late,” he said.</p>
<p>Iran to make a deal over its nuclear programme, saying that there was still time for the country to prevent further conflict with Israel.</p>
<p>“There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Trump said that Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb and that the US was hoping to get back to the negotiating table, in an interview with <em>Fox News</em> after the start of the Israeli air strikes on Iran.</p>
<p>“We will see,” <em>Fox News</em> reporter Jennifer Griffin quoted Trump as saying in a post on X.</p>
<p>Trump would convene a meeting of the National Security Council on Friday morning, the White House said. He had said on Thursday an Israeli strike on Iran “could very well happen” but reiterated his hopes for a peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>The US military is planning for the full range of contingencies in the Middle East, including the possibility that it might have to help evacuate American civilians, a US official told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>Iran’s armed forces spokesperson said Israel and its chief ally the United States would pay a “heavy price” for the attack, accusing Washington of providing support for the operation.</p>
<p>While the US tried to distance itself from Israel’s military operation, an Israeli
official told public broadcaster Kan that Israel had coordinated with Washington on Iran.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States was not involved in the strikes and Tel Aviv had acted unilaterally for self-defence.</p>
<p>“We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” Rubio said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Let me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel,” he added.</p>

<p>UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said he was ready to travel to Iran to assess the situation there after Israel’s strikes hit the sprawling nuclear complex at Natanz.</p>
<p>In a statement to a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Board of Governors, Grossi said the other main enrichment centre in Iran, Fordow, was not hit and neither was another nuclear facility in Esfahan, citing Iranian authorities.</p>
<p>There are no elevated radiation levels at Natanz, he added.</p>
<p>“I call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid further escalation. I reiterate that any military action that jeopardizes the safety and security of nuclear facilities risks grave consequences for the people of Iran, the region, and beyond,” Grossi said in his statement.</p>
<p>“I have indicated to the respective authorities my readiness to travel at the earliest to assess the situation and ensure safety, security and non-proliferation in Iran.”</p>
<p>He did not say what the extent of the damage at Natanz was or what parts of the site were hit. The site includes a vast underground uranium enrichment plant and a smaller, above-ground pilot enrichment plant.</p>
<p>Iran is enriching to up to 60 per cent purity, close to the roughly 90pc of weapons grade, at the pilot plant, but it is producing smaller quantities of that material there than at Fordow, a site dug into a mountain that military experts have said would be difficult for Israel to destroy through bombardment.</p>
<p>“Despite the current military actions and heightened tensions, it is clear that the only sustainable path forward — for Iran, for Israel, the entire region, and the international community — is one grounded in dialogue and diplomacy to ensure peace, stability, and cooperation,” Grossi said.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Grossi said that nuclear facilities “must never be attacked”.</p>
<p>The UN nuclear watchdog said that Iranian authorities told it that no increase in radiation levels have been observed at the Natanz uranium enrichment site following Israeli strikes.</p>
<p>“Iranian authorities have informed the IAEA… that no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a post on X, after earlier confirming that the facility was “among targets” of the strikes.</p>
<p>It added that Iran’s only nuclear power plant in the southern port city of Bushehr had not been targeted.</p>
<p>However, Iran’s atomic energy organisation confirmed in a statement that its  nuclear facility in Natanz had been damaged, but investigations have not shown any radioactive or chemical contamination outside the site.</p>
<p>“The attack has damaged several parts of the facility. Investigations are ongoing to assess the extent of damages,” the statement said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Israel’s neighbouring country Jordan’s military said it intercepted drones and missiles that had violated the kingdom’s airspace.</p>
<p>“Royal Air Force aircraft and air defence systems intercepted on Friday morning a number of missiles and drones that entered Jordanian airspace,” a military statement said.</p>
<p>Air raid sirens sounded in the Jordanian capital after Israel’s attack on Iran, while the public security directorate urged people to stay at home.</p>
<p>“Adhere to the guidelines and stay in your homes,” said an announcement on loudspeakers in Amman.</p>
<p>Jordan had earlier said it would not allow its airspace to be violated and vowed not to become a “battleground” in any regional conflict. “Jordan has not and will not allow any violation of its airspace, reaffirming that the Kingdom will not be a battleground for any conflict,” government spokesperson Mohammad Momani told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>The government meanwhile condemned Israel’s attack, with foreign ministry spokesperson Sufian Qudah warning of “the consequences of such escalatory actions”.</p>
<p>Jordan also called the attack “a blatant violation of the sovereignty of a United Nations member state and a clear breach of international law and the UN Charter”.</p>
<p>Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport was closed until further notice, and Israel’s air defence units stood at high alert for possible retaliatory strikes from Iran.</p>
<p>“Following the pre-emptive strike by the State of Israel against Iran, a missile and UAV (drone) attack against the State of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate time frame,” Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.</p>
<p>Israeli military Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir said tens of thousands of soldiers had been called up and “prepared across all borders”.</p>
<p>“We are amidst a historic campaign unlike any other. This is a critical operation to prevent an existential threat, by an enemy who is intent on destroying us,” he said.</p>
<p>Israeli Minister Gideon Saar was holding “marathon of calls” with counterparts around the world regarding Israel’s attack on Iran, the foreign ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Pakistan was among several countries and international actors which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916907/world-reacts-to-israeli-strike-on-iran-over-nuclear-activity">condemned</a> Israel’s strikes, with the Foreign Office calling it “unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel.”</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned “in the strongest possible terms today’s unprovoked attack on Iran by Israel.”</p>
<p>“I convey my deepest sympathies to the Iranian people on the loss of lives in this attack. This grave and highly irresponsible act is deeply alarming and risks further destabilising an already volatile region,” he <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/CMShehbaz/status/1933418673362120803" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a post on X.</p>
<p>“We urge the international community and the United Nations to take urgent steps to prevent any further escalation that could imperil regional and global peace.”</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on X that a 24/7 Crisis Management Unit has been created at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ensure the safety and security of Pakistani nationals in Iran.</p>
<p>“Pakistan Embassy in Tehran has also been directed to provide all facilitation to community members/Zaireens. The Embassy’s hotline number is (0098)-2166941388,” he said in a post on X.</p>

<p>The National Assembly also unanimously passed a resolution against Israel’s attack on Iran, which was jointly presented by the government and opposition.</p>
<p>The attacks triggered sharp falls in stock prices in Asian trade on Friday, led by a selloff in US futures, while oil prices jumped as investors scurried to safe havens such as gold and the Swiss franc.</p>
<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned any military escalation in the Middle East, said deputy UN spokesperson Farhan Haq.</p>
<p>“The Secretary-General asks both sides to show maximum restraint, avoiding at all costs a descent into deeper conflict, a situation that the region can hardly afford,” Haq said.</p>

<p>Qatar Airways  said it had temporarily cancelled flights to Iran and Iraq “due to (the) current situation in the region,” the airline said in a statement.</p>
<p>German airline Lufthansa also said it had suspended all flights to and from Tehran.</p>
<p>“Lufthansa Group flights to and from Tehran will be suspended until further notice due to the current situation,” the company said in an emailed statement, adding it would also avoid Iranian, Iraqi and Israeli airspace for now.</p>
<p>Air France said it was suspending its flights to and From Tel Aviv “until further notice” and was “closely monitoring the situation in the Middle East in real time,” a spokesman for the French airline told <em>AFP</em>, adding that “the safety of its customers and crews is its absolute priority.”</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, Iraq also closed its airspace. “The ministry of transport closes Iraqi airspace and suspends air traffic at all Iraqi airports,” the <em>Iraq News Agency</em> reported.</p>

<p>A US official said those talks were still scheduled to proceed despite the Israeli attack.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said on Friday that it was forced to act based on new intelligence information showing that Iran was “approaching the point of no return” in the development of a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>“In recent months, this program has accelerated significantly, bringing the regime significantly closer to obtaining a nuclear weapon,” it said in a statement, without disclosing the purported evidence.</p>
<p>A source familiar with US intelligence reports said there had been no recent change in the US intelligence assessment that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and that Khamenei had not authorised the restarting of the nuclear weapons programme that was shuttered in 2003.</p>

            <p><p>An Air India flight from Phuket in Thailand to India’s capital New Delhi received an onboard bomb threat on Friday and made an emergency landing on the island, airport authorities said.</p>
<p>All 156 passengers on flight AI 379 had been escorted from the plane, in line with emergency plans, an Airports of Thailand official said.</p>
<p>The aircraft took off from Phuket airport bound for the Indian capital at 9:30am (7:30am PKT) on Friday, but made a wide loop around the Andaman Sea and landed back on the southern Thai island, according to flight tracker <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/ai379" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Flightradar24</a></em>.</p>

<p>The incident follows the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916728/">crash</a> of an Air India flight in Ahmedabad on Thursday shortly after takeoff, in which more than 265 people were killed.</p>
<p>AOT did not provide details on the bomb threat. Air India did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Indian airlines and airports were inundated with hoax bomb threats last year, with nearly 1,000 hoax calls and messages received in the first 10 months, nearly 10 times that of 2023.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#blackbox-found-of-crashed-air-india-787-india-considering-grounding-fleet" id="blackbox-found-of-crashed-air-india-787-india-considering-grounding-fleet" title="Permalink"></a>Blackbox found of crashed Air India 787; India considering grounding fleet</h2>
<p>Investigators recovered a black box recorder from the crash site on Friday of a London-bound passenger jet that ploughed into a residential area of India’s Ahmedabad city, killing at least 265 people on board and on the ground.</p>
<p>The Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner had issued a mayday call shortly before it crashed around lunchtime on Thursday after lifting barely 100 metres (330 feet) from the ground.</p>
<p>One man on board the plane, which was carrying 242 passengers and crew, miraculously survived Thursday’s fiery crash, which left the tailpiece of the aircraft jutting out of the second floor of a hostel for medical staff from a nearby hospital.</p>
<p>“Initially, I too thought that I was about to die, but then I opened my eyes and realised that I was still alive,” survivor Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, a British citizen, told national broadcaster <em>DD News</em> from his hospital bed.</p>
<p>The nose and front wheel of Air India flight 171 landed on a canteen building where students were having lunch, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Deputy Commissioner of Police Kanan Desai said that 265 bodies had been counted so far, which suggested that at least 24 people were killed on the ground. The toll could rise further as more body parts are recovered.</p>
<p>“The official number of deceased will be declared only after DNA testing is completed”, Home Minister Amit Shah said in a statement late on Thursday. DNA samples will be taken from family members of the dead who live abroad, he said.</p>
<p>Air India said there were 169 Indian passengers, 53 British, seven Portuguese, and a Canadian on board the flight bound for London’s Gatwick airport, as well as 12 crew members.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the devastated neighbourhood on Friday and was also pictured by survivor Ramesh’s bedside.</p>
<p>Ramesh, who suffered burns and other injuries, said: “Everything happened in front of me, and even I couldn’t believe how I managed to come out alive from that.”</p>
<p>“Within a minute after takeoff, suddenly… it felt like something got stuck… I realised something had happened, and then suddenly the plane’s green and white lights turned on.”</p>
<p>The Indian government is also considering grounding Air India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916742/787-dreamliner-boeings-flagship-long-distance-plane">Boeing 787</a> fleet, Indian <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/india-may-ground-boeing-787-8-fleet-after-ahmedabad-tragedy-sources-952092" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">broadcaster</a> <em>NDTV</em> reported earlier on Friday, a day after one of the airline’s aircraft of the same make crashed in Ahmedabad city, killing more than 240 people.</p>
<p>The fleet will likely be grounded for a safety review, <em>NDTV</em> reported, citing sources.</p></p>
