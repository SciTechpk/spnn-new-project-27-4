            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif termed India’s occupation of Kashmir the “defining conflict” of South Asia as Pakistan marked six years on Tuesday since New Delhi deprived the held region of its special autonomy.</p>
<p>Pakistan is observing Youm-i-Istehsal (Exploitation Day) today to mark the sixth anniversary of India revoking Kashmir’s special autonomy and to show solidarity with Kashmiris.</p>
<p>On Aug 5, 2019, India’s Narendra Modi-led government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1498227">stripped</a> the Muslim-majority territory of its special status by repealing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1763985">Article 370</a> of the constitution, splitting the former state into two territories directly ruled by New Delhi.</p>
<p>“India’s illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir remained the defining conflict of the South Asia region, and the driver of India’s continued rogue behaviour,” PM Shehbaz said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-says-kashmir-dispute-resolution-key-pillar-of-pakistans-foreign-policy-calls-for-reversing-indian-unilateral-actions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The premier also recalled the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">India-Pakistan conflict</a>, noting: “India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">unprovoked aggression</a> against Pakistan in May 2025, and its swift and comprehensive <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">military defeat</a> are only the latest evidence of the urgent need for the international community to ensure that the resolution of the Kashmir dispute becomes a global priority.</p>
<p>“The will and aspirations of the Kashmiri people, in accordance with UN Security Council <a class="link--external" href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/111955/?ln=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resolutions</a>, are the only path forward,” he stressed.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz noted that a “just resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was a key pillar of Pakistan’s foreign policy”.</p>
<p>The prime minister reiterated “strongest condemnation” of India’s illegal and unilateral actions to alter the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898092">demographic structure</a> and political landscape of India-occupied Kashmir (IoK).</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He also flayed India’s efforts to silence genuine Kashmiri leaders as part of the “wider hegemonic and extremist agenda” that informed its illegal occupation of the disputed region.</p>
<p>“The imprisonment of Kashmiri leaders and activists, including <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1202138">Shabbir Ahmed Shah</a>, Muhammad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1869419">Yasin Malik</a> and Masarrat Alam Bhatt, will never dim the resolve of our Kashmiri sisters and brothers,” he asserted.</p>
<p>Urging the international community to play a role in halting human rights crimes in IoK and reversing the 2019 action, the premier reaffirmed Pakistan’s “unflinching” stance, moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in his statement, President Asif Ali Zardari also referred to the recent conflict with India, emphasising that “this year’s ‘Youm-e-Istehsal’ assumes greater significance”.</p>
<p>“While the resounding success of the ‘<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a>’ is a matter of great pride for the people of Pakistan, the day also underscores the need for a settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people, for a lasting peace in South Asia,” the president said.</p>

<p>He highlighted that Indian authorities had taken a number of steps, aimed at changing the IoK’s demographic structure and political landscape, during the last six years.</p>
<p>“These measures include gerrymandering of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1688423">electoral constituencies</a>, allowing addition of non-Kashmiris to electoral rolls, issuance of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1577106">domicile certificates</a> to outsiders, granting more powers to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924441/opp-calls-for-held-kashmir-governor-to-step-down">lieutenant governor</a> in administrative matters, and introduction of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home">new laws</a> on ownership of land and property,” he noted.</p>
<p>“The Kashmiri people are confronted with the danger of becoming a disempowered community in their own land. The genuine leadership of the Kashmiri people remains behind bars. The intimidation of innocent people, arbitrary detentions, and the so-called ‘cordon and search’ operations have become a matter of routine,” Zardari said.</p>
<p>To mark Youm-i-Istehsal, a rally was taken out from Parliament House to D-Chowk in Islamabad to express solidarity with Kashmiris.</p>

<p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar underscored that Kashmir was an internationally recognised dispute, and its future cannot be determined through internal legislation or court rulings, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/05-08-2025/dpm-urges-india-to-end-oppression-in-iiojk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>

<p>He condemned such moves as “unacceptable and provocative”.</p>
<p>India’s top court is also set to hear a petition tomorrow that seeks directives to the federal government to restore the statehood of the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-plea-to-restore-statehood-of-jammu-and-kashmir-on-august-8-101754371898782.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hindustan Times</a></em> reported, citing <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/supreme-court-to-hear-plea-to-restore-statehood-of-jammu-kashmir-on-august-8-299893" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Live Law</a></em>.</p>

<p>The foreign minister reaffirmed Islamabad’s desire for friendly relations with all neighbouring countries and its preference for dialogue and diplomacy over confrontation.</p>
<p>However, he warned that Pakistan’s armed forces and its people were “fully capable of delivering a resolute response to any act of aggression, as demonstrated” during the May conflict.</p>
<p>Addressing the rally, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar noted that the bonds between Kashmiris and Pakistan were “eternal which can never be broken by any Indian conspiracy”.</p>
<p>Recalling that bodies of Kashmiri icons, such as <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1282425">Burhan Wani</a>, were wrapped in the “colour of Pakistan’s flag, which was a manifestation of Kashmiris love and affection for Pakistan”.</p>
<p>Also mentioning the India-Pakistan conflict, Tarar asserted that the “victory in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> has boosted the morale of Kashmiri masses”.</p>

<p>In its session today, the National Assembly passed a unanimous resolution, condemning “all forms of Indian state violence and coercive tactics aimed at erasing the identity, culture, and political aspirations of the Kashmiri people, which have failed and will continue to fail”.</p>
<p>The lower house of the parliament reiterated that “Pakistan will never compromise on the right of the Kashmiri people to self-determination as guaranteed under international law and UN resolutions”, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/05-08-2025/na-reaffirms-support-for-kashmiris-right-to-self-determination" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>

<p>The resolution stressed that the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was “not an internal matter of India but a global issue requiring a just resolution in accordance with UNSC resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people”.</p>
<p>It called upon the global community to “stand for justice, not silence, in the face of Indian oppression and human rights abuses” in IoK.  The NA declared that “from Srinagar to Islamabad, the heart beats as one for the freedom and dignity of Kashmir”, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> added.</p>
<p>The NA affirmed that Pakistan’s moral, political and diplomatic support for the Kashmiri people remained “unshakable and enduring”, and committed to continue raising the Kashmir issue at every regional and international forum.</p>
<p>The House demanded the immediate implementation of all relevant UNSC resolutions, which call for a free and impartial plebiscite.</p>

<p>It added: “The armed forces of Pakistan fully support the legitimate and ongoing struggle of the Kashmiri people for their inalienable right to self-determination, as enshrined in international law and UN Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p>“The continued illegal occupation of IIOJK by Indian security forces — characterised by an unrelenting military siege, systemic human rights violations, and demographic engineering — constitutes a grave breach of international norms and remains a matter of deep concern.</p>
<p>The armed forces “pay solemn tribute to the martyrs of IIOJK and reiterate their enduring commitment to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Kashmiri people in their just and rightful struggle for freedom”.</p>

            <p><p>Israel’s cabinet could authorise on Tuesday a complete military takeover of Gaza for the first time in two decades, media reported, despite international pressure for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927380/israeli-fm-rejects-international-pressure-for-gaza-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> to ease <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928548/46-dead-in-gaza-as-starvation-rises-and-aid-access-remains-limited">appalling conditions</a> in the besieged Palestinian territory.</p>
<p>Israel has been facing growing international criticism over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1876811">Amnesty International</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879714">Human Rights Watch</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897646">experts</a> already declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is leaning towards an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1928695">expanded offensive</a> and taking control of the entire enclave after 22 months of offensive against Hamas, Israeli <em>Channel 12</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.mako.co.il/news-politics/2025_q3/Article-36843dbbf297891027.htm?pId=173113802" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>A senior Israeli source told <em>Reuters</em> on Monday that more force was an option following the collapse of indirect ceasefire talks with Hamas.</p>
<p>Seizing the entire territory would reverse a 2005 decision by Israel to pull settlers and military out of Gaza while retaining control over its borders — a move right-wing parties blame for Hamas gaining power there.</p>
<p>It was unclear, however, whether a potential full takeover of Gaza would entail a prolonged occupation or a short-term operation aimed at dismantling Hamas and freeing hostages.</p>
<p>Israel’s coalition government is regarded as one of the most right-wing in its history, with the cabinet including parties that seek to annexe both Gaza and the West Bank and encourage Palestinians to leave their homeland.</p>
<p>The country’s military has throughout the conflict pushed back against the idea of Israel trying to fully occupy Gaza and establish military rule there, which would require it to take over long-term governance.</p>
<p>The military has also struggled with manpower issues as the offensive has dragged on, with reservists being repeatedly called up and putting a strain on capabilities.</p>
<p>Israel’s military campaign has devastated the tiny, crowded enclave, killing more than 60,000 people according to Palestinian health authorities. The conflict was triggered by a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1779807">Hamas attack</a> on October 7, 2023, when gunmen stormed the border from Gaza, killing more than 1,200 people and seizing around 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies.</p>
<p>The conflict has forced nearly all of Gaza’s over 2 million people from their homes and caused what a global hunger monitor called last week an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927376">unfolding famine</a>.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>That has caused widespread international anger and prompted several European countries to say they would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927699">recognise</a> a Palestinian state next month if there was no ceasefire.</p>
<p>Inside Gaza on Tuesday, Israeli gunfire and strikes killed at least 13 Palestinians, local health authorities said, including five people in a tent in Khan Younis and three aid seekers near Rafah in the south.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#tank-push" id="tank-push" title="Permalink"></a>Tank push</h2>
<p>Israeli tanks pushed into central Gaza earlier on Tuesday but it was not clear if the move was part of a larger ground offensive.</p>
<p>Palestinians living in the last fifth of the territory, where Israel has not yet taken military control via ground incursions or orders for civilians to leave, said any new move to occupy the area would be catastrophic.</p>
<p>“If the tanks pushed through, where would we go, into the sea? This will be like a death sentence to the entire population,” said Abu Jehad, a Gaza wood merchant, who asked not to be named in full.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>A Palestinian official close to the talks and mediation said Israeli threats could be a way to pressure Hamas to make concessions at the negotiation table.</p>
<p>“It will only complicate the negotiation further, at the end, the resistance factions will not accept less than an end to the war, and a full withdrawal from Gaza,” he told <em>Reuters</em>, asking not to be named.</p>
<p>Israel said it would allow merchants to import goods. A source in Gaza told <em>Reuters</em> some trucks had already entered carrying chocolates and biscuits for a merchant.</p>
<p>It is hoped that essential items such as children’s milk, fresh meat and fruits, sugar, and rice could be allowed in, which would alleviate scarcity and drive down prices of what is available in the markets.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said last week he was working with the Israeli government on a plan that would effectively end the conflict in Gaza.</p>
<p>But Israeli officials have also floated ideas, including expanding the offensive and annexing parts of Gaza.</p>
<p>The failed ceasefire talks in Doha had aimed to clinch agreements on a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921634">US-backed proposal</a> for a 60-day truce, during which aid would be flown into Gaza and half of the hostages Hamas is holding would be freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israel.</p>
<p>The Israeli military was expected on Tuesday to present alternatives that include extending into areas of Gaza where it has not yet operated, according to two defence officials.</p></p>

<p>Every year, Shia Muslims from Pakistan travel by land route to Karbala in Iraq via Iran to take part in Arbaeen rituals during the Islamic month of Safar. Arbaeen marks the end of a 40-day mourning period following Ashura, the anniversary of Imam Hussain’s martyrdom in the Battle of Karbala.</p>
<p>Late last month, the government announced that Pakistani Zaireen (pilgrims) would be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927007">barred</a> from travelling by road to Iran and Iraq for Arbaeen due to security concerns.  The decision immediately drew flak from the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927487">Sindh government</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927719">senators</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927338/pti-raps-overland-travel-ban-on-arbaeen-pilgrims">PTI</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927195">PPP</a>, while Iran <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926827">advised</a> pilgrims to secure an e-visa for the pilgrimage by August 7.</p>
<p>Speaking in the NA today, the defence minister acknowledged that the ban was enforced due to serious security concerns, particularly because of the threat of terrorist attacks targeting pilgrim convoys.</p>

<p>“To mitigate these risks, the federal government has authorised the Balochistan government to operate direct flights from Quetta, allowing pilgrims to safely travel by air to their destinations,” he said.</p>
<p>“Iran has so far allowed one such flight; we are pressing them to start frequent flight operations as well.”</p>
<p>Arrangements had also been made for onward transportation of pilgrims from airports in Iran and Iraq to their intended sites, he said.</p>
<p>“Advertisements had been published over the past four days inviting private carriers to operate on the route, and all licensed private airlines had been allowed to provide services,” he told the NA.</p>
<p>“Chartered flights have also been approved to maximise the number of pilgrims able to travel safely.”</p>
<p>He urged potential operators and the market to take full advantage of the permissions granted, while acknowledging that these measures were aimed at offering maximum facilities while avoiding the security hazards of road travel.</p>
<p>Asif further said that the matter was discussed during the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928404">visit</a> of the Iranian president to Pakistan, adding that Iran had allowed an additional flight to facilitate the movement of Pakistani pilgrims.</p>
<p>“I want to assure the House and the people across Pakistan that the government is fully committed to ensuring safe, comfortable, and timely transportation for all Arbaeen pilgrims,” he said.</p></p>
