                <h2>Netanyahu nominates Trump for Nobel Peace Prize</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he has nominated Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, presenting the US president with a letter he sent to the prize committee.</p>
<p>The move comes as Israel continues its onslaught on Gaza, which has so far killed 57,523 Palestinians. Last year, the UN-backed International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1874034">issued</a> arrest warrants for Netanyahu, citing allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court said he, along with ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, ‚Äúintentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival‚Äù, including food, water, medicine, fuel, and electricity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs forging peace as we speak, in one country, in one region after the other,‚Äù Netanyahu said at a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922520">dinner</a> with Trump at the White House.</p>

<p>Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514">nominations</a> from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years and has made no secret of his irritation at missing out on the prestigious award.</p>
<p>The Republican has complained that he had been overlooked by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">mediating role</a> in conflicts between India and Pakistan, as well as Serbia and Kosovo.</p>
<p>In 2024, he <a class="link--external" href="https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/trump-grumbles-about-obama-s-nobel-peace-prize-and-claims-he-deserved-it-more/ar-AA1sVZiM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">insisted</a> that he was more deserving of a Nobel than ex-president Barack Obama, and complained how it was unfair that ‚Äúanybody else‚Äù but him would have been honoured with one.</p>
<p>In June, Pakistan had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514/govt-to-recommend-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize-for-decisive-diplomatic-intervention-in-india-pakistan-crisis">decided</a> to formally recommend Trump for the coveted prize, given his role in de-escalating the India-Pakistan conflict when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">US mediation</a>.</p>
<p>However, as the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">joined</a> Israel‚Äôs war with Iran and launched attacks on three Iranian nuclear facilities, Pakistani lawmakers, activists, authors and ex-diplomats criticised the move. A resolution was also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919467#:~:text=In%20the%20resolution,in%20the%20region.%E2%80%9D">submitted</a> in the Senate by the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl to rescind the decision but led to no tangible outcome as Pakistan had not officially submitted the nomination.</p>
<p>Trump has also demanded credit for ‚Äúkeeping peace‚Äù between Egypt and Ethiopia and brokering the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements aiming to normalise relations between Israel and several Arab nations.</p>
<p>He campaigned for office as a ‚Äúpeacemaker‚Äù who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging more than five months into his presidency.</p></p>

                <h2>Texas flood toll passes 100 as more bodies recovered</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The death toll from catastrophic flooding in Texas rose to more than 100 on Monday, as rescuers continued their grim search for people swept away by torrents of water.</p>
<p>Among the dead were at least 27 girls and counsellors who were staying at a youth summer camp on a river when disaster struck over the Fourth of July holiday weekend.</p>
<p>Forecasters have warned of more flooding as rain falls on saturated ground, complicating recovery efforts involving helicopters, boats, dogs and some 1,750 personnel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is still a threat of heavy rain with the potential to cause flooding,‚Äù Texas Governor Greg Abbott said in a statement Monday, with the number of victims expected to rise still.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump confirmed he planned to visit Texas on Friday, as the White House slammed critics claiming his cuts to weather agencies had weakened warning systems.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBlaming President Trump for these floods is a depraved lie, and it serves no purpose during this time of national mourning,‚Äù Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday.</p>
<p>She said the National Weather Service, which <em>The New York Times</em> reported had several key roles in Texas unfilled before the floods, issued ‚Äútimely and precise forecasts and warnings.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Trump has described the floods that struck in the early hours of Friday as a ‚Äú100-year catastrophe‚Äù that ‚Äúnobody expected.‚Äù The president, who previously said disaster relief should be handled at the state level, has signed a major disaster declaration, activating fresh federal funds and freeing up resources.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#tragedy" id="tragedy" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòTragedy‚Äô</h2>
<p>At least 104 flood-related deaths were reported across central Texas.
Kerr County, through which the Guadalupe River runs, was the hardest hit, with at least 84 people killed including 28 children, according to the local sheriff‚Äôs office.</p>
<p>The toll includes 27 who had been staying at Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian camp that was housing about 750 people when the floodwaters struck.
Camps are a beloved tradition in the long US summer holidays, with children often staying in woods, parks and other rural areas.</p>
<p>Texas Senator Ted Cruz described them as a chance to make ‚Äúlifetime friends ‚Äî and then suddenly it turns to tragedy.‚Äù</p>
<p>But some residents were questioning the absence of more robust flood-warning systems in this region of south and central Texas ‚Äî where such deluges are so frequent that it is known colloquially as ‚ÄúFlash Flood Alley.‚Äù</p>
<p>Experts stress the NWS sent out timely forecasts, and climate scientist Daniel Swain pinned the problem on a failure of ‚Äúwarning dissemination.‚Äù San Antonio mother Nicole Wilson‚Äî  who almost sent her daughters to Camp Mystic ‚Äî launched a petition on Change.org urging Governor Greg Abbott to approve a modern warning network.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFive minutes of that siren going off could have saved every single one of those children,‚Äù she told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>At a candlelight vigil in San Antonio on Monday night, Texans gathered to pray for the victims of the floods and voice lingering fears.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was pretty shocked on the gravity of the situation and how big it was, and I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily expect that our rivers would rise so quickly,‚Äù said Rebeca Gutierrez, 29.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHopefully there‚Äôs preventative efforts happening in similar areas to make sure nothing to this degree happens.‚Äù</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#two-story-building" id="two-story-building" title="Permalink"></a>Two-story building</h2>
<p>In a terrifying display of nature‚Äôs power, the rain-swollen waters of the Guadalupe River reached treetops and the roofs of cabins as girls at the camp slept.</p>
<p>Blankets, teddy bears and other belongings were caked in mud. Windows in the cabins were shattered, apparently by the force of the water.</p>
<p>Volunteers were helping search through debris from the river, with some motivated by personal connections to the victims.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre helping the parents of two of the missing children,‚Äù Louis Deppe, 62, told <em>AFP</em>. ‚ÄúThe last message they got was ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre being washed away,‚Äô and the phone went dead.‚Äù</p>
<p>Months‚Äô worth of rain fell in a matter of hours on Thursday night into Friday, and rain has continued in bouts since then.</p>
<p>The Guadalupe surged around 26 feet (eight meters) ‚Äî more than a two-story building ‚Äì in just 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Flash floods occur when the ground is unable to absorb torrential rainfall.
Human-driven climate change has made extreme weather events such as floods, droughts and heat waves more frequent and more intense in recent years.</p></p>
