            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924143/pti-protests-aim-to-destabilise-country-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>PTI protests aim to destabilise country: Sanaullah</strong></a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Monday criticised the PTI for seeking dialogue with the establishment instead of talking with politicians, suggesting the party only wanted to “destabilise the country with protests”.</p>
<p>His statement came as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, a day prior, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923918">called</a> on state institutions to engage in dialogue with the PTI but demanded that they hold themselves accountable. Gandapur and the PTI’s top leadership were on a visit to Lahore to formally launch a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923856/pti-brass-gathers-in-lahore-to-kick-start-aug-5-movement">movement</a> to seek the release of party founder Imran Khan and devise a strategy for its nationwide protest, which will reach its crescendo on August 5 — marking two years since the ex-premier was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a>.</p>
<p>Since Imran’s incarceration in several cases, which he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1890696#:~:text=He%20claimed%20that%20four%20convictions%20against%20him%20were%20politically%20motivated">claims</a> are politically motivated, his party’s relationship with the government and the establishment has turned <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832432">sour</a>. The PTI has held several <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875003/day-of-clashes-in-islamabad-ends-in-pti-protesters-retreat">protests</a> over the last year, most of which escalated into <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1857709">violence</a> after facing state repression.</p>
<p>Sanaullah said that Gandapur’s words made it clear that the PTI wanted to “destabilise the country, right after Marka-i-Haq” (referring to the recent Pakistan-India escalation) and the government’s “success in economic revival, which lent Pakistan an opportunity for stability”.</p>
<p>“Besides this, it is unknown what other agenda they have,” he added.</p>
<p>Referring to the planned 90-day and August 5 protests, Sanaullah said, “If they remain peaceful, then it’s fine (…) it is their democratic right. But if they take the law into their own hands and attempt to destabilise the country (…) then the law will take its due course.”</p>
<p>He added that this destabilisation “has been their (PTI’s) agenda from the beginning”, referring to the party demonstrating outside the International Monetary Fund (IMF) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1821812">offices</a> against their granting of an emergency <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845536">loan</a> to Pakistan.</p>
<p>He dismissed the notion that the government, despite being relatively stable now, would consider being more generous in negotiations for Imran’s release, saying that “it had nothing to do with generosity and that the case was proceeding according to the rules of the court.”</p>
<p>He pointed out how it was the PTI’s own stance in previous negotiations that Imran’s release would not be discussed, as the PTI founder himself expressed the desire to be acquitted on his own merit.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>According to Sanaullah, the government was ready to hold talks with the PTI on other issues, but he said that according to the party’s recent calls for negotiations, it “does not want dialogue with the government, but with the establishment”.</p>
<p>“They are not willing to sit down with either political parties or politicians to solve issues,” he said. “They are still stuck on their own agenda, seeking the establishment’s help to put them back into power. They are not ready for political dialogue.”</p>
<p>Asked what counter-demands the government might hold in negotiations, he said, “We have only one wish, one effort, one fight: the revival of Pakistan’s economy and its success, such that every citizen’s wellbeing is ensured and it is included on the map of the world as a welfare state.”</p>
<p>Sanaullah added that the government was ready to sit with the PTI and other parties for talks to ensure the stability required for this effort if they were willing to cooperate.</p>
<p>“It is in everybody’s mutual interest, the opposition and government’s, and everybody should agree on a ‘charter of economy’ on certain basic matters,” he said. “We are ready for any understanding or agreement in this regard.”</p>
<p>The previous day, on <em>Geo News’</em> programme “Naya Pakistan”, Sanaullah had questioned the PTI’s intention of holding negotiations alongside heavy protesting, saying, “If they want to talk, then what is the need for the 90 days, the August 5 [protests] and the march towards Lahore?”</p>
<p>However, he stated that the PTI would be granted legal permission to protest by the local administration if they remained peaceful.</p>
<p>“If they move towards violence, the law will take its course,” he added.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924157/gb-environment-agency-recommends-5-year-ban-on-hotel-construction-near-hunza-lakes' target='_blank'><strong>GB environment agency recommends 5-year ban on hotel construction near Hunza lakes</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency has recommended a five-year ban on the construction and expansion of hotels on three famous lakes in Hunza, it emerged on Monday.</p>
<p>Last month, the GB administration <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917714">imposed</a> a fine of Rs1.5 million on a hotel for allegedly dumping sewage waste into Attabad Lake.</p>
<p>The development came a day after a foreign tourist and vlogger named George Buckley posted a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DK89E5soiTM/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> on his Instagram page, claiming that sewage water was being pumped out by the hotel into the Attabad Lake.</p>
<p>In a letter addressed to the Hunza deputy commissioner dated July 1, available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, the agency recommended an “Immediate halt to new hotel constructions in central Hunza lacking proper wastewater systems and a five-year moratorium on all hotel-related construction and expansion in central Hunza, Duikar, Attabad, and Borit Lake[s]”.</p>
<p>The letter also called for a complete ban on construction along the banks of Borit Lake, with strict regulation of boating and its notification as an eco-tourism destination to protect its ecological function.</p>
<p>The recommendations state that environmental problems are becoming critical due to hotels built on the culturally important lakes of Attabad, Duiker, and Borit in central Hunza.</p>
<p>According to the letter, a recent investigation into improper disposal of sewage by hotels had revealed facts of unorganised and shoddy construction and also identified shortcomings such as inadequate wastewater discharge systems and construction defects.</p>
<p>The report said that this unregulated and unsupervised development is compromising public health, freshwater resources, and sustainable development of the tourism sector, and is causing destruction to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>It further stated that the sewage disposal system of hotels is outdated, ineffective and low capacity, resulting in water channels and the Hunza River being directly polluted.</p>
<p>The report has diclosed that when the drinking water was tested in this poor situation, sewage contamination was confirmed, posing the risks of typhoid, dysentery and hepatitis.</p>
<p>According to the report, the widespread use of diesel-powered generators by hotels is also causing air pollution, which is posing a respiratory hazard to tourists. It added that this practice is contrary to the concept of a clean, environmentally friendly place.</p>
<p>The report also shed light on the situation of Duiker Lake. Due to the uncontrolled construction of hotels, the environment at this lake is rapidly deteriorating.</p>
<p>The agency expressed fear that inadequate sewage and poor human waste disposal arrangements are damaging the fragile mountain environment of the area.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The report recommends a five-year ban on all new construction and hotel expansion around Attabad Lake to help protect water quality, maintain ecological balance, and protect it from natural disasters, especially floods and landslides, as well as ensure the constant availability of clean drinking water.</p>
<p>The agency recommends that boating and tourist activities in the lake should be restricted for this purpose. The report says that the lake is a protected area under Section 172 of the Forest Act 2019. It is an important habitat for migratory and endangered bird species.</p>
<p>“However, boating activities here are creating a disturbing situation for nesting and movement of birds in this place, which is seriously damaging the international importance and ecological functions of the lake,” the letter said.</p>
<p>The GB-EPA called for a transition to eco-friendly, community-based tourism is urgently needed. This model ensures:</p>
<p>“With responsible tourism policies, Hunza can become a global benchmark for sustainable mountain tourism,” the letter said.</p></p>

            <p><p>A preliminary investigation into the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916728">crash</a> of an Air India Boeing 787 passenger jet last month that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923062/toll-of-air-india-disaster-rests-at-260-as-focus-turns-to-crash-report">killed</a> 260 people raises additional questions about the incident, and the investigation is far from over, Air India’s CEO said in a memo on Monday.</p>
<p>The preliminary investigation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923703/air-india-crash-report-shows-pilot-confusion-over-engine-switch-movement">report</a> released by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Saturday depicted confusion in the cockpit shortly before the crash of the Boeing.</p>
<p>In a staff memo reviewed by <em>Reuters</em>, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson said the report had “triggered a new round of speculation in the media … Unsurprisingly, it provided both greater clarity and opened additional questions.”</p>
<p>He added: “The preliminary report identified no cause nor made any recommendations, so I urge everyone to avoid drawing premature conclusions as the investigation is far from over.”</p>
<p>The memo said the preliminary report found no mechanical or maintenance faults and that all required maintenance had been carried out.</p>
<p>The Boeing 787 Dreamliner bound for London from the Indian city of Ahmedabad began to lose thrust and sink shortly after takeoff. All but one of the 242 people on board and 19 others on the ground were killed.</p>
<p>According to the AAIB report, in the flight’s final moments, one pilot was heard on the cockpit voice recorder asking the other why he cut off the fuel.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>“The other pilot responded that he did not do so,” the report said. It added that the plane’s engine two <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923703/air-india-crash-report-shows-pilot-confusion-over-engine-switch-movement#:~:text=declined%20further%20comment.-,Fuel%20switches,-Experts%20have%20said">fuel cutoff</a> switches flipped almost simultaneously, but did not say how.</p>
<p>The preliminary report suggested no immediate action for Boeing or General Electric, whose engines were fitted on the aircraft.</p>
<p>Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA), which represents Indian pilots at the Montreal-based International Federation of Air Line Pilots’ Associations, has rejected any presumption of pilot error and called for a “fair, fact-based inquiry”.</p>
<p>“The pilots had passed their mandatory pre-flight breathalyser and there were no observations pertaining to their medical status,” Campbell said in his memo.</p>
<p>ALPA India, another pilots’ body with 800 members, also accused the probe agency of “secrecy” surrounding the investigation, saying “suitably qualified personnel” were not involved in it.</p>
<p>“We feel that the investigation is being driven in a direction presuming the guilt of pilots and we strongly object to this line of thought,” ALPA India president Sam Thomas said in a statement issued on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA) said it was “deeply disturbed by speculative narratives… particularly the reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide.”</p>
<p>“There is absolutely no basis for such a claim at this stage,” it said in a statement on Sunday, adding, “it is deeply insensitive to the individuals and families involved.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“To casually suggest pilot suicide without verified evidence is a gross violation of ethical reporting and a disservice to the dignity of the profession,” it said.</p>
<p>The ICPA was referring to a number of aviation experts suggesting engine fuel control switches can only be moved deliberately and manually.</p>
<p>The commanding pilot of the Air India plane was Sumeet Sabharwal, 56, who had a total flying experience of 15,638 hours and, according to the Indian government, was also an Air India instructor. His co-pilot was Clive Kunder, 32, who had 3,403 hours of total experience.</p>
<p>Air India has come under heightened scrutiny on multiple fronts following the crash.</p>
<p>On July 4, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923703/air-india-crash-report-shows-pilot-confusion-over-engine-switch-movement#:~:text=Aviation%20Safety%20Agency-,said,-last%20week%20it">said</a> it would investigate budget unit Air India Express, after a <em>Reuters</em> report revealed the airline failed to promptly replace engine parts on an Airbus A320 as mandated, and falsified records to indicate compliance.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#us-faa-boeing-notify-fuel-switch-locks-are-safe-document-sources-say" id="us-faa-boeing-notify-fuel-switch-locks-are-safe-document-sources-say" title="Permalink"></a>US FAA, Boeing notify fuel switch locks are safe, document, sources say</h2>
<p>The US Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing have privately issued notifications that the fuel switch locks on Boeing planes are safe, a document seen by <em>Reuters</em> showed, and four sources with knowledge of the matter said.</p>
<p>The FAA’s Continued Airworthiness Notification on July 11 came after a preliminary report into the crash, which raised questions over engine fuel cutoff switches.</p>
<p>The FAA’s notification to Civil Aviation Authorities, seen by <em>Reuters</em>, said: “although the fuel control switch design, including the locking feature, is similar on various Boeing airplane models, the FAA does not consider this issue to be an unsafe condition that would warrant an Airworthiness Directive on any Boeing airplane models, including the Model 787.”</p>
<p>When asked for comment, the FAA said it did not have anything to add beyond the notification.</p>
<p>Boeing also referred to the FAA notification in a Multi-Operator-Message sent to the airlines in the past few days, which said the planemaker is not recommending any action, two of the sources with direct knowledge said.</p>
<p>When asked for comment, Boeing referred <em>Reuters</em>’ questions to the FAA.</p>
<p>The preliminary investigation report into the crash referred to a 2018 FAA advisory, which recommended, but did not mandate, operators of several Boeing models, including the 787, to inspect the locking feature of the fuel cutoff switches to ensure it could not be moved accidentally.</p>
<p>The report said Air India had said it had not carried out the FAA’s suggested inspections, as the FAA 2018 advisory was not a mandate. But it also said maintenance records showed that the throttle control module, which includes the fuel switches, was replaced in 2019 and 2023 on the plane involved in the crash.</p>
<p>The report noted “all applicable airworthiness directives and alert service bulletins were complied with on the aircraft as well as engines.”</p>
<p>ALPA India, in a letter posted on X, said the preliminary investigation report referred to the 2018 FAA advisory “concerning the fuel control switch gates, which indicates a potential equipment malfunction.”</p>

<p>Two US safety experts said on Saturday they backed ALPA India’s request to be observers in the probe, but said the investigation report did not suggest a bias toward pilot error.</p>
<p>John Cox, a pilot and former ALPA US representative, said AAIB’s report seemed objective and fair.</p></p>
