                <h2>Pakistan tests launch of 120km Fatah missile: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan on Monday conducted a successful training launch of a Fatah Series surface-to-surface missile with a range of 120 kilometres as part of ongoing ‚ÄúEx Indus‚Äù, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7275" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>The test launch comes amid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908387">heightened tensions</a> between nuclear powers Pakistan and India in the wake of New Delhi‚Äôs aggressive measures in the wake of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile‚Äôs advanced navigation system and enhanced accuracy,‚Äù the ISPR statement read.</p>

<p>The training launch was witnessed by senior officers of the army , as well as officers, scientists and engineers from Pakistan‚Äôs strategic organisations, the military‚Äôs media wing said.</p>
<p>The chairman joint chiefs of staff committee and the army chief congratulated the participating troops, scientists, and engineers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey expressed complete confidence in the operational preparedness and technical proficiency of [the] Pakistan Army to thwart any aggression against the territorial integrity of Pakistan,‚Äù the ISPR added.</p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari congratulated scientists and engineers, as well as the nation, on the successful test of the Fatah missile, according to a post on X by the PPP.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe president appreciated the efforts of the security forces, scientists and engineers to strengthen the country‚Äôs defense.</p>
<p>‚Äú[He] reiterated national commitment to ensure national security and defence.‚Äù</p>

<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the efforts of the chairman joint chiefs of staff, the army chief, and the scientists and engineers involved in preparation for the launch, according to a statement from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe success of the training launch clearly shows that Pakistan‚Äôs defence is in strong hands.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prime minister expressed satisfaction over the professional capabilities of the Pakistan Army and its full preparedness for national defense,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the ISPR said that Pakistan had conducted a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908176">successful training launch</a> of the Abdali Weapon System, a surface-to-surface missile with a range of 450km.</p>
<p>In May last year, the army <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1833760">conducted a test-launch</a> of Fatah-II guided rocket system which had a range of 400 kilometres.</p>
<p>The guidance system makes this rocket a precision weapon enhancing its lethality and efficacy, while the trajectory mode and terminal guidance technology enables it to evade the enemy‚Äôs anti-ballistic missile systems.</p>

            </a>
            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday said that a recent attack in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam was an attempt to ‚Äúdivert attention‚Äù from India‚Äôs internal challenges and its cross-border terrorism.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India, without investigation or evidence, implied ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack%20were%20brought%20out">cross-border linkages</a>‚Äù of the att¬≠a¬≠¬≠¬≠c¬≠kers. Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">firmly</a> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315/pahalgam-attack-fm-dar-throws-down-gauntlet-to-india-asks-for-evidence-of-allegations-against-pakistan">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> as it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an incursion and India‚Äôs premier granting ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">operational freedom</a>‚Äù to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war">military</a> warning of a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907785/any-military-misadventure-by-india-will-be-met-with-swift-resolute-notch-up-response-coas">swift</a>‚Äù response to any misadventure by New Delhi, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907930/us-hopes-that-indias-response-to-pahalgam-attack-doesnt-lead-to-broader-regional-conflict-vance">diplomatic channels</a> have remained engaged to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>Addressing the Regional Dialogue 2025 in Islamabad today, organised by the Institute of Regional Studies, Dar said Pakistan believed the Pahalgam attack was part of an effort to ‚Äúdivert attention‚Äù from India‚Äôs internal challenges, adding that it could be ‚Äúself-choreographed‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe believe that what has happened is to divert attention ‚Äî I am talking of Pahalgam ‚Äî from India‚Äôs internal challenges, state-sponsored terrorism, the ongoing human rights violations in the Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir, and to gain narrow domestic political objectives,‚Äù Dar said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget that there are some by-elections coming in the next few months in India,‚Äù he added, referring to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907658">upcoming polls in Bihar</a> in October.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis brinkmanship carries consequences that extend far beyond India‚Äôs borders,‚Äù the deputy PM warned, calling India‚Äôs actions ‚Äúunilateral, politically-motivated and highly provocative‚Äù.</p>
<p>He noted: ‚ÄúThere appears to be a calculated and premeditated attempt to escalate regional tensions, following a familiar pattern ‚Äî level allegations against Pakistan without evidence, use inflammatory rhetoric, incite war hysteria and use this as a pretext for aggression and unilateral actions.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a reference to the Indian government, Dar stressed that regional and international peace and security could not be ‚Äúsacrificed at the altar of narrow electoral gains‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is a dangerous political game and gamble, putting at stake the lives of millions in the region,‚Äù the foreign minister highlighted. However, he also reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to regional peace: ‚ÄúWe will support all efforts towards de-escalation.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnalysts say this could be another ploy. It might have been self-choreographed,‚Äù echoing Pakistani leaders‚Äô previous statements of the Pahalgam attack being a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906207">false flag operation</a>‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHow can an FIR (first information report) be registered in 10 minutes at a police station where you need at least 45 minutes to reach? [‚Ä¶] Come on. Nobody‚Äôs a fool,‚Äù Dar quipped.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInternational dignitaries are talking [to] both sides. Few of them ‚Äî great friends ‚Äî suggested to me, ‚ÄòCan you try and help the perpetrators be caught?‚Äô I said ‚Äòcome on, do you know the distance where it happened and where‚Äôs the Line of Control? 230 kilometres.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI cannot find the word abeyance in any international treaties‚Äô dictionary. The word suspension is there.‚Äù</p>

<p>The two discussed matters of bilateral importance, with a particular focus on the ongoing situation between Pakistan and India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.</p>

<p>It said Pakistan would specifically highlight the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty by India.</p></p>
