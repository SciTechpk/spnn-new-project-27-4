            <p><p>Iran said on Monday that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">US attack</a> on its nuclear sites expanded the range of legitimate targets for its armed forces and called US President Donald Trump a “gambler” for joining Israel’s military campaign against the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>Since Trump joined Israel’s campaign by dropping massive <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842#:~:text=The%20US%20strikes%20included%2014%20bunker%2Dbuster%20bombs%2C%20more%20than%20two%20dozen%20submarine%2Dlaunched%20Tomahawk%20missiles%20and%20over%20125%20military%20aircraft%2C%20the%20top%20general%20added.">bunker-buster bombs</a> on Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday morning, Tehran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate.</p>
<p>But while it has continued to fire missiles at Israel, it has yet to take action against the United States itself, either by firing at US bases or by targeting the 20 per cent of global oil shipments that pass near its coast at the mouth of the Gulf.</p>
<p>“Mr Trump, the gambler, you may start this war, but we will be the ones to end it,” Ebrahim Zolfaqari, spokesperson for Iran’s Khatam al-Anbiya central military headquarters, <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/RT_com/status/1937038083595354557" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Monday in English at the end of a recorded video statement.</p>

<p>Iran and Israel traded another wave of air and missile strikes on Monday as the world braced for Tehran’s response.</p>
<p>Trump’s administration has repeatedly said that its aim is solely to destroy Iran’s nuclear programme, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919269/all-eyes-on-iran-after-trump-pulls-the-trigger-on-bunker-busters#:~:text=oil%20and%20gas.-,%E2%80%98Not%20at%20war%20with%20Iran%E2%80%99,-Defence%20Secretary%20Hegseth">not to open a wider war</a>.</p>
<p>But in a social media post on Sunday, Trump openly spoke of toppling the hardline clerical rulers who have been Washington’s principal foes in the Middle East since Iran’s 1979 revolution.</p>
<p>“Its not politically correct to use the term, ‘Regime Change,’ but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldnt there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!” he wrote.</p>

<p>Experts surveying commercial satellite imagery said it appeared that the US attack had severely damaged the site of Iran’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842#:~:text=Iranian%20media%20confirmed%20that%20part%20of%20the%20Fordow%20plant%2C%20as%20well%20as%20the%20Isfahan%20and%20Natanz%20nuclear%20sites%2C%20were%20attacked.">Fordow</a> nuclear plant, built inside a mountain, and possibly destroyed it and the uranium-enriching centrifuges it housed, although there was no independent confirmation.</p>
<p>Trump called the strike a “<a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114730186433008075" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bullseye!!!</a>”.</p>
<p>“Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran,” he wrote. “The biggest damage took place far below ground level.”</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#more-israeli-strikes" id="more-israeli-strikes" title="Permalink"></a>More Israeli strikes</h2>
<p>Israel’s airstrikes on Iran have met little resistance from Iranian defences since Israel launched its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">surprise attack</a> on June 13, killing many of Iran’s top <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">commanders</a>.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said on Monday that about 20 jets had conducted a wave of strikes against military targets in western Iran and Tehran overnight. In Kermanshah, in western Iran, missile and radar infrastructure was targeted, and in Tehran a surface-to-air missile launcher was struck, it said.</p>
<p>Iranian news agencies reported air defences had been activated in central Tehran districts, and Israeli air strikes had hit Parchin, the location of a military complex southeast of the capital.</p>
<p>Iran says more than 400 people have been killed in the Israeli attacks, mostly civilians, but has released few images of the damage since the initial days of the bombing. Tehran, a city of 10 million people, has largely emptied, with residents fleeing to the countryside to escape attacks.</p>
<p>Iran’s retaliatory missile strikes on Israel have killed 24 people, all civilians, and injured hundreds, the first time a significant number of Iranian missiles have ever penetrated Israeli defences.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said a missile launched from Iran in the early hours of Monday had been intercepted by Israeli defences. Air raid sirens blared overnight in Tel Aviv and other parts of central Israel.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#limited-retaliation" id="limited-retaliation" title="Permalink"></a>Limited retaliation</h2>
<p>Beyond those missiles, Iran’s ability to retaliate is far more limited than a few months ago, since Israel inflicted defeat on Iran’s most feared regional proxy force, Hezbollah in Lebanon, whose downfall was swiftly followed by that of Iran’s most powerful client ruler, Syria’s Bashar al-Assad.</p>
<p>Iran’s most effective threat to hurt the West would probably be to restrict global oil flows from the Gulf. Oil prices spiked on Monday at their highest since January. But they have not yet shot up to crisis levels, indicating that traders see a path out of the conflict that avoids serious disruption.</p>
<p>Brent crude futures were down 0.5pc to $76.64 a barrel as of 8:30am GMT (1:30pm PKT), after briefly jumping above $80 at the opening.</p>
<p>Iran’s parliament has approved a move to close the Strait of Hormuz that leads into the Gulf, which would require approval from the Supreme National Security Council, a body led by an appointee of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>
<p>Attempting to strangle the strait could send global oil prices skyrocketing, derail the world economy and invite conflict with the US Navy’s massive Fifth Fleet that patrols the Gulf from its base in Bahrain.</p>
<p>“It’s economic suicide for them if they do it. And we retain options to deal with that,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.</p>
<p>As Tehran weighed its options, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi was expected to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow today. The Kremlin has a strategic partnership with Iran, but also close links with Israel.</p>
<p>Speaking in Istanbul yesterday, Araqchi said his country would consider all possible responses and there would be no return to diplomacy until it had retaliated. <em>TASS</em> news agency later quoted him as saying Iran and Russia were coordinating their positions.</p></p>

            <p><p>Former foreign minister and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Monday said India has the option to either share water fairly or “we will deliver water to us from all six (Indus river system) rivers”.</p>
<p>Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">unilaterally suspended</a> its participation in the 1960 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a> (IWT), which governs the usage of the Indus river system, on April 23, shortly after 26 civilians were killed in India-held Kashmir. Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack. The latter has denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. The accord remains dormant despite a ceasefire agreed upon by the two nuclear-armed neighbours last month following their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">worst fighting</a> in decades.</p>
<p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Saturday had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918691/india-will-never-restore-indus-waters-treaty-with-pakistan-amit-shah">slammed</a> Indian Home Minister Amit Shah’s “brazen disregard” for international agreements after the latter said New Delhi would never restore the IWT with Pakistan.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Speaking in the National Assembly during a session on the federal budget, Bilawal said, “India has two options: share water fairly, or we will deliver water to us from all six rivers.”</p>
<p>“The attack on <em>Sindhu</em> [Indus River] and India’s claim that the IWT has ended and it’s in abeyance, firstly, this is illegal, as the IWT is not in abeyance, it is binding on Pakistan and India, but the threat itself of stopping water is illegal according to the UN charter,” the former foreign minister said.</p>
<p>He continued that if India decides to follow through on the threat, we will have to wage war again.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He added that hopefully Pakistan won’t have to, but if it does have to, it is in the position to defeat India the same way it just did.</p>
<p>Bilawal further told lawamkers that peace between the two nuclear neighbours is impossible without cooperation, especially in counterterrorism efforts. “If India and Pakistan refuse to talk, and if there is no coordination on terrorism, then violence will only intensify in both countries,” he warned.</p>
<p>He said India was weaponising terrorism for political purposes. “India seeks to exploit terrorism as a political tool to harm Pakistan’s international standing,” he said, adding that during his diplomatic visits to the United Kingdom and European Union as foreign minister, it became evident that India had lobbied hard to reverse Pakistan’s progress on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) front.</p>
<p>“At a time when Pakistan had successfully moved from the FATF grey list to the white list, India made every effort to drag us back to the grey list using false narratives and diplomatic pressure,” he said. “But thanks to our Foreign Office, the prime minister, and his team, those efforts failed. Once again, Pakistan won — and India lost.”</p>
<p>Bilawal also urged renewed dialogue between Pakistan and India to curb regional instability. He added, “We are fighting not only for the public of Pakistan but also of India as well.”</p>
<p>He strongly criticised what he called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dangerous doctrine of escalation. “Under Modi’s new ‘abnormal’, any terrorist incident in India becomes an automatic pretext for launching hostilities against Pakistan,” Bilawal warned.</p>
<p>He questioned what would happen if Pakistan were to adopt the same policy. “We suffer from terrorist attacks ten times more than India, many of which are traced back to Indian funding or involvement. Should we then adopt a policy of automatic retaliation, too? That would mean surrendering our future to the will of terrorists.</p>
<p>“That might be Modi’s vision, but it is not ours. We will not let terrorists dictate regional peace,” he declared.</p>
<p>Last week, addressing a crowd of supporters, Bilawal had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918592/kashmir-now-a-global-issue-says-bilawal">said</a> that New Delhi must accept the IWT. Pakistan’s narrative had prevailed, not only in diplomatic circles, but also across international media, he claimed.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915727">condemned</a> India’s unilateral suspension of the IWT, describing it as a “blatant violation and act of water aggression”, and warned that Pakistan would give a befitting response in line with decisions made at the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting held on April 24.</p></p>

• Iranian envoy hints at retaliatory strikes on American bases</strong></p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: An emergency meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) will be held today (Monday) to discuss the regional situation after the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842/trump-says-irans-key-nuclear-facilities-obliterated-by-us-airstrikes">airstrike on three nuclear facilities</a> in Iran.</p>
<p>The NSC, chaired by the prime minister and comprising the top brass of both civil and military leadership, is the highest forum for security deliberations.</p>
<p>Sources in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) told <em>Dawn</em> that the NSC meeting will be held on Monday evening. Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir will also attend the meeting.</p>
<p>The field marshal, who recently returned from a trip to the US, will brief the committee on the details of his meeting with US President Donald Trump.</p>
<p><strong>Pakistan condemns strikes</strong></p>
<p>The US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, which came four days after COAS Munir’s meeting with Trump, have been condemned by Pakistan.</p>
<p>In a phone call with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Prime Minister Shehbaz condemned the US attack and Israeli aggression.</p>
<p>“The prime minister conveyed Pakistan’s condemnation of the US attacks, which followed Israel’s unprovoked and unjustified aggression over the past eight days,” said an official press release issued by the PMO.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The PM reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering solidarity with the people and government of Iran and expressed condolences on the loss of lives.</p>
<p>He expressed concerns that the US struck facilities that were under the protection of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
<p>“These attacks constituted a serious violation of international law and the IAEA statute,” he added.</p>
<p>While noting Iran’s right to self-defence, as enshrined under Article 51 of the UN Charter, Prime Minister Shehbaz stressed the need for swift dialogues and called diplomacy “the only viable path forward”. He also called for urgent collective efforts to de-escalate the situation, and said Pakistan was ready to play a constructive role in this regard. According to the PMO, President Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan’s support of Iran.</p>
<p>He thanked the prime minister and people of Pakistan for standing in solidarity with Iran.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, the Foreign Office also condemned the US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>“We are gravely concerned at the possible further escalation of tensions in the region,” the Foreign Office spokesman said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The attacks “violate all norms of international law,” the spokesperson said, adding Iran has the right to defend itself under the UN Charter.</p>
<p>“Any further escalation of tensions will have severely damaging implications for the region and beyond.”</p>
<p>The FO urged all parties to “adhere to international law” and hold dialogues to resolve the crises.</p>
<p><strong>‘Iran can hit US bases’</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Dr Reza Amiri Moghadam has said his country could target US facilities and interests in the region.</p>
<p>While addressing a press conference here at the National Press Club on Sunday, Mr Moghadam said the US has a “presence in the region” and that Iran “will see that where we hit the US”.</p>
<p>Responding to a question about US bases in the region, the ambassador said it was shameful that the US has military facilities in Muslim states.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>However, he added that Iran “does not want to bring any other Islamic state into this war”.</p>
<p>Asked about the damages during the US airstrike on Iran’s nuclear sites, he said Iran has the capability to make a nuclear arsenal but the country was using the technology for energy and medical purposes.</p>
<p>“Our nuclear technology is not a physical thing but it’s in the minds of our nuclear scientists, so therefore the US strikes have not made any significant harm to our nuclear programme,” he added.</p>
<p>He also appreciated Pakistan’s support for Iran during the conflict.</p>
<p><strong>President worried</strong></p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari also expressed concern over the escalating tensions in the Middle East.</p>
<p>In a statement on Sunday, the president urged all parties involved in the conflict to exercise maximum restraint and to choose the path of peace , dialogue and diplomacy to ensure enduring peace and stability in the region.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>President Zardari also called upon the international community to play its part in de-escalating the crisis in the interest of regional stability as well as the well-being of its people.</p>
