            <p><p>The United Nations Security Council on Tuesday unanimously adopted a Pakistan-sponsored resolution that called for the peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar opened the UNSC session as he was presiding over the UNSC Open Debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes”.</p>
<p>This is the first of the two signature events of Pakistan in its capacity as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921308">president</a> of the UNSC for July.</p>
<p>The UNSC unanimously adopted the Pakistan-sponsored resolution urging all nations to utilise effectively mechanisms for peaceful settlement of disputes, such as negotiation, mediation, arbitration, judicial settlement or other peaceful means.</p>

<p>The Foreign Office (FO) said the adoption of the resolution on “Strengthening Mechanisms for Peaceful Settlement of Disputes” was a noteworthy development since it was an “important contribution to the promotion of international peace and security through the use of preventive diplomacy, conflict prevention measures and dispute resolution by peaceful means”.</p>
<p>It added that the resolution sought to strengthen mechanisms for peaceful settlement of disputes, as envisaged in Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter and urged member states to utilise peaceful means for settling disputes.</p>
<p>“The resolution called upon the member states to take necessary measures for the effective implementation of Security Council resolutions for peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>
<p>“Member states and the United Nations have been encouraged to explore ways and means to prevent disputes from escalating, including but not limited to timely diplomatic efforts, mediation, confidence-building and facilitation of dialogue at the international, regional and subregional levels. The resolution calls for enhancing efforts by all regional and subregional organisations for peaceful settlement of disputes and to strengthen cooperation between these organisations and the United Nations.”</p>
<p>The FO said that as an active UNSC member, Pakistan sought to contribute to the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security, including through peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>
<p>“The adoption of Pakistan-sponsored resolution would serve as an important instrument to achieve these goals for peace and security at the regional and global level.”</p>

<p>Earlier, the FO said the signature event reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering belief in multilateralism and the UN Charter principle of peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>
<p>It said FM Dar would also hold bilateral meetings with the Saudi minister of economy and planning, UK minister for Africa, the United Nations, Commonwealth and Multilateral, as well as Thailand’s foreign minister on the sidelines.</p>
<p>He would also give an interview to a foreign media outlet and attend a reception hosted by Pakistan Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad for selected UN ambassadors and senior UN officials.</p>

<p>Speaking at the UNSC session, FM Dar said, “We call for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.”</p>
<p>He added that Israel’s latest onslaught in Gaza had killed over 58,000 Palestinians — mostly women and children. “The humanitarian situation is dire, with civilians bearing the brunt of the violence and deprivation,” Dar said.</p>
<p>“Today’s debate is both timely and urgent. Multilateralism is not merely a diplomatic convenience; it is the need of the hour. Peaceful settlement of disputes is not just a principle; it is the lifeline of global stability,” Dar continued.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>On the issue of Kashmir, Dar said that the final disposition of the dispute has to be made in line with the relevant UNSC resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>“No cosmetic measures can serve as a substitute for the fundamental and inalienable right to self-determination of the Kashmiris as guaranteed by the relevant UNSC resolutions,” Dar said.</p>
<p>Dar also spoke about India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, saying, “It is most unfortunate and regrettable that India has chosen to illegally and unilaterally hold this treaty in abeyance on baseless grounds, with the intention of withholding the flow of water to 240 million people of Pakistan, who rely on it for their livelihood and survival.”</p>
<p>The Deputy PM said, “Let this debate serve as a collective reaffirmation of our faith in multilateralism, a recommitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes, and a solemn promise to those who look to this Council not for words, but for action.”</p>

<p>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also addressed the council on this occasion, followed by statements of other member states.</p>
<p>Guterres said that the “horror” facing Palestinians in Gaza under Israeli military attack was unprecedented in recent years.</p>
<p>“We need look no further than the horror show in Gaza — with a level of death and destruction without parallel in recent times,” he said in a speech.</p>
<p>Guterres said ramped-up Israeli operations meant “devastation is being layered upon devastation” with the Gaza Strip’s humanitarian system in its “last gasp”.</p>
<p>He commended FM Dar for convening the debate and for utilising the council’s presidency to put forward a resolution urging all members to make full use of the tools in collective pursuit of global peace.</p>
<p>“This is needed now more than ever. The architects of the United Nations Charter recognised that the peaceful resolution of disputes is the lifeline when geopolitical tensions escalate, when unresolved disputes fuel the flames of conflict and when states lose trust in each other,” the UN chief said.</p>
<p>“Around the world, we see an utter disregard for, if not outright violations of, international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law, international humanitarian law, and the UN Charter itself, without any accountability.</p>
<p>“These failures to uphold international obligations are coming at a time of widening geopolitical divides and conflicts” with staggering costs measured in human lives, shattered communities, and lost futures, Guterres said.</p>
<p>Diplomacy, he said, may not have always succeeded in preventing conflicts, violence and instability, but it still held the power to stop them.</p>

            <p><p>The federal government on Tuesday welcomed a Sargodha Anti-Terrorism Court’s (ATC) sentencing of Leader of Opposition in Punjab Assembly (PA) Malik Ahmed Khan Bhachar to 10 years in prison over a case related to the nationwide riots on May 9, 2023, hailing it as a positive step.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, military installations and state-owned buildings were vandalised as PTI supporters protested the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">arrest</a> of ex-premier Imran Khan — who was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1752306">released</a> later but has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a> in various <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885852">cases</a> since August 2023. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including the party’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1774736">top leadership</a>, were arrested.</p>

<p>Addressing a press conference today in Islamabad, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said: “Today, the Sargodha ATC issued an order and we welcome it … I think it is a very positive step as justice has been upheld.”</p>
<p>He said the verdict “fulfils all requirements of justice” and followed due process since the entire trial proceedings were carried out legally. “The decision announced is in accordance with the law and the Constitution,” Malik said.</p>
<p>The state minister said Bhachar, PTI MNA Ahmed Chattha and former MNA Bilal Ejaz were sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment each in a case related to the riots.</p>
<p>“When you take the law into your own hand, whether you’re an MNA or MPA or opposition leader … the [status] doesn’t matter, as the law is equal for everyone and will come into force.”</p>
<p>Malik hoped that other May 9-related cases would be decided soon as well.</p>
<p>Assailing the PTI, he alleged that the riots were “carefully curated” via “planning” to precisely attack over 200 locations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bachar said in a post on X that he would not abandon his support of Imran.</p>

<p>PTI MNA Asad Qaiser condemned the sentences, alleging that “neither was any transparent or legal procedure followed in the case, nor was any credible witness presented. The demands of justice were grossly violated.”</p>
<p>He said in a post on X that the party would challenge the “biased decision” in the high court.</p>

<p>Terming the decision “outright injustice”, the party’s South Punjab wing said, “The truth is that the establishment’s role in this entire process is evident to all, and nothing called justice remains.</p>
<p>“These punishments are not only vengeful actions but also an insult to the country’s democracy, judiciary, and people, and now the people will no longer stay silent!” the statement read.</p>

<p>Today’s conviction follows a recent tussle between the PML-N’s Punjab government and the PTI, after PA Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920792">suspended</a> 26 opposition MPAs and sought their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1923447">disqualification</a> for their “unparliamentary conduct”.</p>
<p>However, days ago, in a significant step towards de-escalation of political tensions, Ahmad formally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925367">rejected</a> the disqualification petitions following <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924877/punjab-assembly-talks-progress-but-pti-stands-firm-on-suspensions">negotiations</a> between the government and the opposition.</p>
<p>A notification by the assembly secretariat today said the 26 PTI lawmakers stood restored as MPAs.</p>
<p>The notification, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, said that the earlier order to suspend the provincial assembly members was withdrawn. The order listed the names of the 26 PTI MPAs.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday warned of a heightened risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as over 200 stranded tourists were rescued from GB’s Diamer district as heavy floods battered the region.</p>

The flood-related death toll in the region rose to five today, after four lost their lives and 15 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719">went missing</a> yesterday in Diamer’s Babusar area.</p>
<p>In its alert, the PMD warned that the prevailing weather conditions increased the risk of Glofs, flash floods and landslides in vulnerable glaciated regions of GB and KP.</p>
<p>It forecast that the wet spell was likely to continue and could affect GB and KP in the current week, adding that scattered rain and thunderstorms, with isolated heavy falls, were expected in both regions.</p>

<p>The death toll in GB since yesterday currently stands at five, according to Diamer District Commissioner Attaullah Kakar.</p>
<p>GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said in a statement: “More than 200 rescued tourists have been shifted to Chilas and provided shelter in hotels and guest houses.”</p>
<p>He added that the tourists were now able to contact their families after being stranded for hours.</p>
<p>DC Kakar detailed that rescue operations were still underway to look for missing tourists, while four of the five deceased have been identified.

<p>According to DC Kakar, the Force Command Northern Areas (FCNA) of the Pakistan Army has been providing medical assistance and food to stranded tourists on Babusar via helicopters.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Diamer administration declared a state of emergency along Thack-Babusar Road, suspending all tourist movement between Zero Point and Babusar Top.</p>
<p>A notification by Diamer District Magistrate Ataur Rehman, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, said all travellers “should be stopped at both ends” of the road until further notice.</p>
<p>“All tourists and local residents are strongly advised to evacuate to designated safe zones immediately and to avoid any travel on Babusar Road until its complete rehabilitation,” the notification read.</p>
<p>An emergency control room was also established that will operate “round the clock”. It can be contacted at 05812-920181 and 05812-930037. The district magistrate also ordered six companies to dispatch at least two excavators each to the Babusar area to assist in road rehabilitation and retrieval of bodies, if any.</p>
<p>Muhammad Ali, a local social worker, told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “Thirty vehicles were swept away by the floods, and most people have been rescued by the locals.”</p>
<p>Shahabuddin, a resident of Chilas, said the local people provided food and accommodation to some stranded tourists in Babusar’s Thak area of Babusar and were also assisting the rescue operation.</p>
<p>All doctors and paramedical staff of the Chilas District Headquarters Hospital were called on an emergency basis, according to a notification issued by medical superintendent Dr Abdul Mobin.</p>

<p>The NDMA advised citizens to avoid travelling to mountainous areas and directed authorities to remain alert in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>On June 26, the GB Disaster Management Authority issued a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">warning</a> of increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glof) and flash floods. The public and tourists were advised to avoid going near rivers, streams and other waterways, and avoid bathing or washing clothes in streams since the water flow can reach dangerous levels.</p>
<p>In KP, the tourism department established a flood emergency response unit and appointed six focal persons for different areas of the province.</p>
<p>A notification issued by the department’s secretary Abdul Samad today, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, said that the unit was in the office of KP Culture and Tourism Authority with the helpline number 1422.</p>

<p>Separately, rescue efforts were underway after a retired army officer and his daughter went missing after the car they were in was swept away by the rainwater drain in Rawalpindi, according to the police.</p>
<p>Retired Colonel Ishaq Qazi, aged approximately 62–64 years and a resident of Defence Housing Authority Phase 5, “left his home along with his daughter, aged around 25 years, in a grey Honda City vehicle”, said a statement by Islamabad’s Sihala police station.</p>
<p>“Due to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain,” it added.</p>
<p>A search operation by the police, Rescue 1122, DHA Phase 5 staff and a team of divers was underway, the statement said. A car bumper was recovered later as the search went on.</p>
<p>A video showed a man steering the vehicle in accumulated floodwater, with a person in the back waving their hand out. The car took a short, sharp slide downwards, after which it got swept away in the water, as some people gathered on a nearby bridge.</p>

<p>Over 61 per cent of nationwide deaths were caused by house-collapse incidents. Monsoon rains so far have damaged 826 houses and led to the deaths of 203 livestock.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the agency told <em>AFP</em> that the heavy rains usually start later in the monsoon season.</p>
<p>“Such death tolls are usually seen in August, but this year the impact has been markedly different,” she said.</p>
