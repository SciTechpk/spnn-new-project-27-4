                <h2>Govt draws five potential buyers for PIA</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>In its efforts to sell its struggling flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), the government has received expressions of interest from five parties, including business groups and a military-owned firm, the Privatisation Ministry said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The bids were submitted ahead of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913616">June 19 deadline</a> to acquire up to 100 per cent of PIA, which has accumulated over $2.5 billion in losses in roughly a decade. Still, following major restructuring, it posted its first <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903037">operating profit</a> in 21 years in the 2024-25 fiscal year.</p>
<p>The sale is seen as a test of Pakistan‚Äôs ability to shed loss-making state firms and meet conditions of a $7bn International Monetary Fund <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">bailout</a>. It would be the first major privatisation in nearly two decades.</p>
<p>Eight parties submitted their expression of interest, but only five of them provided documents of qualification, the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Among the five groups is a consortium of major industrial firms: Lucky Cement Ltd, Hub Power Holdings Ltd, Kohat Cement Co Ltd and Metro Ventures.</p>
<p>Another is led by investment firm Arif Habib Corp Ltd and includes fertiliser producer Fatima Fertiliser Co Ltd, private education operator The City School, and real estate firm Lake City Holdings.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917610/fauji-fertiliser-submits-expression-of-interest-for-pia-purchase">Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd</a>, a military-owned conglomerate, Pakistani airline Air Blue Ltd and a consortium including Bahria Foundation, domestic carrier Serene Air and US-based Equitas Capital LLC also submitted documents.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe government will review the documents and give qualified parties access to data for due diligence,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#full-divestment" id="full-divestment" title="Permalink"></a>Full divestment</h2>
<p>Once a leading global airline, PIA <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884402">resumed</a> European flights in January after a four-year EU ban linked to safety concerns, and is seeking UK clearances, seen as key to its turnaround. Industry insiders say the winning bidder is expected to partner with a foreign airline to run operations.</p>
<p>A previous attempt to sell the airline failed as a $36 million bid from real estate firm Blue World City fell short of the $305m floor price, with concerns over debt, staffing, and limited control.</p>
<p>This time, the government is offering full divestment, has scrapped the sales tax on leased aircraft, and is providing limited protection from legal and tax claims. Around 80pc of the airline‚Äôs debt has been transferred to the state.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre targeting Rs86bn in privatisation proceeds this year,‚Äù Privatisation Minister Muhammad Ali told <em>Reuters</em>. ‚ÄúFor PIA, in the last round of bidding, 15pc of the proceeds were going to the government, with the rest staying within the company.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said bidders would be pre-qualified in early July, with due diligence lasting two to two-and-a-half months, with final bidding and negotiations expected in the fourth quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>Officials hope the sale will revive the stalled privatisation drive. Other planned deals include the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903689">Roosevelt Hotel</a> and several power firms by mid-2026.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFrom the Roosevelt Hotel, we‚Äôre expecting over $100m as [the] first payment during this year,‚Äù said Ali.</p></p>

                <h2>Pre-monsoon rains to lash country from June 20: PMD</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Thursday predicted that pre-monsoon rains will fall across the country between June 20 and 23.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1852031#:~:text=Monsoon%20rains%20across%20the%20region%20from%20June%20to%20September%20offer%20respite%20from%20the%20summer%20heat%20and%20are%20crucial%20to%20replenishing%20water%20supplies.%20They%20are%20also%20vital%20for%20agriculture%2C%20and%20therefore%20the%20livelihoods%20of%20millions%20of%20farmers%20and%20food%20security%20for%20South%20Asia%E2%80%99s%20nearly%20two%20billion%20people.">fall across</a> the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. They are also vital for agriculture, and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security for South Asia‚Äôs nearly two billion people.</p>
<p>According to a statement, ‚Äúcurrents from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal are penetrating the central and northern areas of Pakistan, while a westerly wave is expected to approach the north. Both of these weather systems are expected to arrive on June 20 (tomorrow).‚Äù</p>
<p>It added that duststorms, thunderstorms and heavy rain are expected in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit Baltistan, Murree, Galliyat, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mianwali, Sargodha, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sialkot, Narowal, Lahore, Faisalabad, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Haripur, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Malakand, Battagram, Shangla, Kohistan, Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, Nowshera, Charsadda, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Kohat, Bannu, Karak, Dera Ismail Khan, and Waziristan from June 20-23 with occasional gaps.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSimilar weather events could be expected in Zhob, Barkhan, Musakhel, Kalat, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan, Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar and Sahiwal from June 21-23, and in Sukkur, Larkana, Dadu, and Jacobabad from June 22-24.</p>
<p>PMD warned that the inclement weather ‚Äúmay damage loose structures like electric poles, trees, vehicles and solar panels‚Äù among others and advised farmers to ‚Äúmanage their crop activities keeping in view the weather conditions‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUrban flooding may occur in Lahore, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi [and] Islamabad during the forecast period,‚Äù the press release warned. ‚Äú[The] general Public, travellers and tourists are advised to take precautionary measures during the weather activity.‚Äù</p>
<p>PMD added that hot weather is likely to subside gradually during the forecast period.</p>
<p>Last month, heavy rain triggered flash floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Mohmand, South Waziristan and Upper Kohistan districts, damaging roads and agricultural land. However, no casualties were reported from any districts.</p>
<p>Heavy rainfall <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909665">triggered</a> flash floods in several areas of Halimzai tehsil in Mohmand district, including Shanikhel ,Tarikhel, Barokhel, Durbakhel and Babikhel.</p>
<p>The flood, caused by overflowing mountain streams, swept away dozens of livestock and damaged houses and link roads.</p>
<p>Last month, at least 13 civilians died and 92 others were injured as heavy rains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913072">lashed</a> several parts of Punjab.</p></p>
