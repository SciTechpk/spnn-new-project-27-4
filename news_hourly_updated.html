                <h2>New York poised for first Muslim mayor as Cuomo concedes to Mamdani</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old state lawmaker and self-described democratic socialist, was poised on Tuesday to win New York City‚Äôs Democratic mayoral primary in a surprising upset over former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p>
<p>In brief remarks to supporters, Cuomo, 67, who had been seeking a political comeback four years after resigning amid sexual harassment allegations, said he had called Mamdani to congratulate him.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTonight is his night,‚Äù Cuomo said while conceding the race to Mamdani.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--twitter  "><span>
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
        <a href="https://twitter.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1937728420156174626"></a>
    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Mamdani, who entered the campaign as a virtual unknown, was ahead of Cuomo 43.5 per cent to 36.4pc with nearly 95pc of ballot scanners reporting, according to the city‚Äôs elections board. Nine other Democratic candidates trailed far behind.</p>
<p>The outcome will not be final until next week, due to New York‚Äôs ranked-choice system that allows citizens to pick up to five candidates in order of preference.</p>
<p>But Mamdani‚Äôs lead in Tuesday‚Äôs preliminary results appeared too large for Cuomo, or any other candidate, to overcome, particularly since the third-place finisher on Tuesday, City Comptroller Brad Lander, encouraged his supporters to list Mamdani second.</p>
<p>The race was seen as an early read on the direction Democrats believe the party should take five months into Republican President Donald Trump‚Äôs tumultuous second term.</p>
<p>Their differences were clear: Cuomo, a moderate backed by the establishment who served a decade as governor, or Mamdani, a progressive newcomer who promised a break with the past.</p>
<p>Mamdani will likely be the favourite in November‚Äôs general election in a city where Democrats dominate. The current mayor, Democrat Eric Adams, will also appear on the November ballot as an independent, but a series of corruption scandals and his perceived ties to Trump have weakened his standing.</p>
<p>The Republican candidate is Curtis Sliwa, a radio host best known as the founder of the Guardian Angels anti-crime patrol, who lost to Adams in 2021.</p>
<p>For some voters, Mamdani represented a chance to usher in a new era for the party.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs time for somebody young, a person of colour, something different,‚Äù Ignacio Tambunting, a 28-year-old actor, told a <em>Reuters</em> reporter outside a polling station in Manhattan after putting Mamdani atop his ballot.</p>
<p>Another voter, Leah Johanson, said she listed Mamdani first even though she was concerned he was too liberal. But she did not rank Cuomo.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo. God, no,‚Äù said Johanson, 39, who voted on Tuesday in Queens, where Mamdani lives. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna vote for a man who is credibly accused of molesting women.‚Äù</p>
<p>Cuomo has denied the harassment accusations, which he has characterised as ill-conceived attempts to be affectionate or humorous.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#self-described-democratic-socialist" id="self-described-democratic-socialist" title="Permalink"></a>Self-described democratic socialist</h2>
<p>Born in Uganda to a family of Indian descent, Mamdani, who would be the city‚Äôs first Muslim mayor, has a history of pro-Palestinian activism.</p>
<p>He was elected to a state assembly seat in New York‚Äôs Queens borough and has garnered the support of US Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, two prominent progressives.</p>
<p>Cuomo accused Mamdani of lacking the experience required, while Mamdani attacked Cuomo over the harassment allegations.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Cuomo, who emerged as a vocal critic of Trump during his first term as president, won the endorsements of former President Bill Clinton and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.</p>
<p>In ranked voting, the last-place candidate is eliminated after each round, and their votes are redistributed to the second choice marked on the ballots of their supporters. The process is repeated until one candidate achieves 50pc of the total.</p>
<p>Mamdani seems likely to expand his lead when the additional counts are conducted, after he and Lander endorsed one another and urged their supporters to rank the other as their second choice.</p>
<p>Lander, who was the first choice on 11.6pc of ballots counted on Tuesday, made national headlines last week when he was briefly <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reutersconnect.com/all?search=all%3AL1N3SK0XL&amp;linkedFromStory=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">detained</a> while escorting a defendant out of an immigration court.</p></p>

                <h2>US strikes failed to destroy Iran‚Äôs nuclear sites, intelligence report says</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>US airstrikes did not destroy Iran‚Äôs nuclear capability and only set it back by a few months, according to a preliminary US intelligence assessment, as a shaky <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919798">ceasefire</a> brokered by US President Donald Trump took hold between Iran and Israel.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, both Iran and Israel signaled that the air war between the two nations had ended, at least for now, after Trump publicly scolded them for violating a ceasefire he announced at 5am GMT (10am PKT).</p>
<p>As the two countries lifted civilian restrictions after 12 days of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">war</a> ‚Äî which the US joined with an attack on Iran‚Äôs uranium-enrichment facilities ‚Äî each sought to claim victory.</p>
<p>Trump said over the weekend that the US deployment of 30,000-pound bombs had ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842#:~:text=The%20US%20strikes%20included%2014%20bunker%2Dbuster%20bombs%2C%20more%20than%20two%20dozen%20submarine%2Dlaunched%20Tomahawk%20missiles%20and%20over%20125%20military%20aircraft%2C%20the%20top%20general%20added.">obliterated</a>‚Äù Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme.</p>
<p>But that claim appeared to be contradicted by an initial assessment by one of his administration‚Äôs intelligence agencies, according to three people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>One of the sources said Iran‚Äôs enriched uranium stocks had not been eliminated, and the country‚Äôs nuclear programme, much of which is buried deep underground, may have been set back only a month or two.</p>
<p>Iran says its nuclear research is for civilian energy production.</p>
<p>The White House said the intelligence assessment was ‚Äúflat out wrong‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to the report, which was produced by the Defence Intelligence Agency, the strikes sealed off the entrances to two of the facilities, but did not collapse underground buildings, said one of the people familiar with its findings.</p>
<p>Some centrifuges still remained intact after the attacks, the <em>Washington Post</em> said, citing an unnamed person familiar with the report.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs administration told the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday that its weekend strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities had ‚Äúdegraded‚Äù Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme, short of Trump‚Äôs earlier assertion that the facilities had been ‚Äúobliterated‚Äù.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that the attack on Iran had removed the threat of nuclear annihilation and was determined to thwart any attempt by Tehran to revive its weapons programme.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have removed two immediate existential threats to us: the threat of nuclear annihilation and the threat of annihilation by 20,000 ballistic missiles,‚Äù Netanyahu said. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said his country had successfully ended the war in what he called a ‚Äúgreat victory,‚Äù according to Iranian media.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian also told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that Tehran was ready to resolve differences with the US, according to official news agency <em>IRNA</em>.</p>
<p>Israel launched the surprise air war on June 13, attacking Iranian nuclear facilities and killing top military <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">commanders</a> in the worst blow to the Islamic Republic since the 1980s war with Iraq.</p>
<p>Iran, which denies trying to build nuclear weapons, retaliated with barrages of missiles on Israeli military sites and cities.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#great-victory" id="great-victory" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòGreat victory‚Äô</h2>
<p>Israel‚Äôs military lifted restrictions on activity across the country at 8pm local time (10pm PKT), and officials said Ben Gurion Airport, the country‚Äôs main airport near Tel Aviv, had reopened.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs airspace likewise will be reopened, state-affiliated <em>Nournews</em> reported.</p>
<p>A White House official said Trump brokered the ceasefire deal with Netanyahu, and other administration officials were in touch with the Iranian government.</p>
<p>The truce appeared fragile: Both Israel and Iran took hours to acknowledge they had accepted the ceasefire and accused each other of violating it.</p>
<p>Trump scolded both sides but aimed especially stinging criticism at Israel, telling the close US ally to ‚Äúcalm down now.‚Äù</p>
<p>He later said Israel called off further attacks at his command.</p>
<p>Israel‚Äôs defence minister, Israel Katz, said he told his US counterpart, Pete Hegseth, that his country would respect the ceasefire unless Iran violated it.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian likewise said Iran would honour the ceasefire as long as Israel did, according to Iranian media.</p>
<p>Whether the Israel-Iran truce can hold is a major question given the deep mistrust between the two foes. But Trump‚Äôs ability to broker a ceasefire showed Washington retains some leverage in the volatile region.</p>
<p>Israeli armed forces chief of staff Eyal Zamir said a ‚Äúsignificant chapter‚Äù of the conflict had concluded but the campaign against Iran was not over. He said the military would refocus on its war against Hamas in Gaza.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs military command also warned Israel and the US to learn from the ‚Äúcrushing blows‚Äù it delivered during the conflict.</p>
<p>Iranian authorities said 610 people were killed in their country by Israeli strikes and 4,746 injured. Iran‚Äôs retaliatory bombardment killed 28 people in Israel, the first time its air defences were penetrated by large numbers of Iranian missiles.</p>
<p>Oil prices plunged and stock markets rallied worldwide in a sign of confidence inspired by the ceasefire, which allayed fears of disruption to critical oil supplies from the Gulf.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#ceasefire-violations" id="ceasefire-violations" title="Permalink"></a>Ceasefire violations?</h2>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Trump admonished Israel with an obscenity in an extraordinary outburst at an ally whose air war he had joined two days before by dropping massive bunker-buster bombs on Iran‚Äôs underground nuclear sites.</p>
<p>Before departing the White House en route to a Nato summit in Europe, Trump told reporters he was unhappy with both sides for the ceasefire breach but particularly frustrated with Israel, which he said had ‚Äúunloaded‚Äù shortly after agreeing to the deal.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to get Israel to calm down now,‚Äù Trump said. Iran and Israel had been fighting ‚Äúso long and so hard that they don‚Äôt know what the f*** they‚Äôre doing.‚Äù</p>

<p>Netanyahu‚Äôs office acknowledged Israel bombed a radar site near Tehran in what it said was retaliation for Iranian missiles fired three-and-a-half hours after the ceasefire was due to begin.</p>
<p>It did not explicitly say whether the strike on the radar site took place before or after they spoke. The Islamic Republic denied launching any missiles and said Israel‚Äôs attacks had continued for an hour-and-a-half beyond the time the truce was meant to start.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWho mediated or how it happened doesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù said Reza Sharifi, 38, heading back to Tehran from Rasht on the Caspian Sea, where he had fled with his family.</p>
