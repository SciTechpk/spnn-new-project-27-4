<p>GILGIT: Thousands of people, including foreign tourists, remai­ned stranded at multiple locations in Gilgit-Baltistan due to blocked roads, including the Karakoram Highway (KKH), due to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925831">landslides</a>. Mobile and internet services across the region were also disrupted after fibre optic cables were damaged in several areas.</p>
<p>Gilgit-Baltistan government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq confirmed that KKH is blocked at Achar Nallah in the Kohistan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Thousands of passengers, including tourists, travelling to and from GB are stranded on both sides of the highway.</p>
<p>He said that while KKH has been reopened for traffic within GB, restoration work is underway in Kohistan. The Babusar Pass Road is also blocked at several locations.</p>
<p>Mr Faraq assured that all tourists stranded on the Babusar route have been safely evacuated and search operations for missing individuals are underway. Those rescued from Babusar Pass have been brought to Chilas, where local hoteliers and government authorities have arranged complimentary accommodation.</p>
<p>The mobile and internet communication systems in the region were severely damaged, leaving the majority of residents without service for up to six hours on Wednesday. The region’s communication system relies on an optical fibre cable connecting GB with Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>According to the Special Commu­nications Organisation (SCO), recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">flash floods</a> in Babusar Valley caused significant damage to the main optical fibre cable. Emergency alternative satellite arrangements were made, but consumers faced slow mobile and internet connectivity. Mr Faraq said that work has begun to restore the communication system.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Deputy Speaker of the Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly Sadia Danish expressed concern over the safety of 40 individuals stranded in Danyore’s Manogah Nallah in Gilgit. In a statement, she urged the government to initiate a helicopter rescue operation immediately.</p>
<p>Ms Danish emphasised tha protecting human lives should remain the top priority and recognised the efforts of the provincial government, the Pakistan Army, volunteers and residents in the rescue operations during the flood emergency.</p>
<p>She also commended the generosity of residents, who opened their homes, mosques, imambargahs and hotels to shelter stranded tourists.</p>
<p>Moreover, river erosion caused the collapse of the Hotu suspension bridge in Shigar, cutting off the only access to the K2 base camp. A large number of foreign expedition members and trekkers were stranded, while eight villages were also disconnected.</p>
<p>Officials from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said that a C130 sortie will be arranged from Gilgit to Islamabad to airlift stranded travellers.</p>
<p>Stranded tourists are expected to receive airlifts free of charge on Thursday (today) in an operation overseen by Gilgit’s additional deputy commissioner.</p>
<p>GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has assured that the rescue operations will continue until all stranded people in Babusar are rescued.</p>
<p>He also declared the flood-affected areas of Thaki, Niyat, Khunra and Thor in Diamer as disaster zones. He also announced that the families of those who died in the floods at Babusar will receive death compensation under the government policy.</p>
<p>The chief minister ordered urgent measures to restore drinking water, electricity, irrigation channels and road communications in the flood-affected areas of Thor. He also visited the flood-affected areas to oversee the recovery efforts along with Adviser on Forests Haji Shah Baig and GB Minister for Agriculture Engineer Anwar.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926158/pakistani-passport-still-ranked-among-weakest-despite-improvement' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani passport still ranked among ‘weakest’ despite improvement</strong></a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: While the passports of other Asian countries have emerged as the most powerful in the world, Pakistan’s travel document continues to be ranked among the ‘weakest’ in the world, with visa-free access available to only 32 destinations.</p>
<p>According to the Henley Passport Index for 2025, Pakistan currently ranks 96th on the list — ahead of the war-torn nations of Somalia, Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Although still quite low, the country’s ranking has improved slightly; in 2024, the Pakistani passport was tied with Yemen as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847754">fourth-worst</a> in the world for the fourth consecutive year.</p>
<p>The Henley Passport Index compares the visa-free access of 199 different passports to 227 travel destinations, and ranks all the world’s passports based on the number of destinations their holders can enter without a prior visa.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Singapore, Japan and South Korea top the list; Afghanistan placed at the bottom</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If no visa is required, then that passport is given a score value of 1. The same applies if you can obtain a visa on arrival (VOA), a visitor’s permit, or an electronic travel authority (ETA) when entering the destination.</p>
<p>Where a visa is required, or where a passport holder has to obtain a government-approved electronic visa (e-Visa) before departure, a score with value of 0 is assigned. This also applies if you need pre-departure government approval for a visa on arrival.</p>
<p>The total score for each passport is equal to the number of destinations for which no visa is required.</p>
<p>Singapore occupies the top spot, with Japan and South Korea sharing second place on the index. Seven EU passports share 3rd place — Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Spain.</p>
<p>Another seven-nation Euro­pean cohort are joint 4th — Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Neth­erlands, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden. Meanwhile, New Zealand is tied for 5th place with Greece and Switzerland.</p>
<p>The UK and US have each dropped a place in the global passport rankings since January, continuing a long-term downward trend. Once the most powerful passports in the world — the UK in 2015 and the US in 2014 — they now rank 6th and 10th, respectively.</p>
<p>India has recorded the largest jump in ranking over the past six months, climbing eight places from 85th to 77th. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has made the biggest gain in visa-free access.</p>
<p>The UAE continues to be a standout among the top risers, shooting up 34 places over the last 10 years from 42nd to 8th place, making it the only big riser to break into the Top 10 in the ranking.</p>
<p>Another notable country is China, also rising 34 places from 94th to 60th since 2015 — particularly impressive considering that it has not yet gained visa-free access to Europe’s Schengen Area.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926190/public-accounts-committee-sees-bitterness-in-sugar-sector' target='_blank'><strong>Public Accounts Committee sees bitterness in sugar sector</strong></a>
            <p><p><strong>• Expresses alarm over mismanagement, loan defaults, widespread irregularities<br />
• Secretary claims production declined despite increase in cultivation area; no buffer stock exists<br />
• Minister warns mills, says hoarding won’t be tolerated; crackdown underway</strong></p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: As a nationwide crackdown on sugar hoarders is underway, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has raised serious concerns over mismanagement in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925914/political-influence-cartelisation-mainly-responsible-for-sugar-crisis-experts">sugar sector</a>, loan defaults by mills, and large-scale irregularities involving public institutions.</p>
<p>During its sitting on Wedn­esday, National Food Security Secretary Amir Mohyuddin revealed that although the area under sugarcane cultivation increased this year, overall production had declined compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Out of 82 registered sugar mills, only 79 participated in the crushing season, which typically begins in November. The secretary admitted that Pakistan currently has no buffer stock of sugar, and a summary has been sent to import 500,000 tons, of which 300,000 tons are already planned.</p>
<p>Committee members, particularly Riaz Fatyana and Junaid Akbar, criticised what they descr­ibed as a “massive sugar cartel” that manipulates supply and prices.</p>
<p>Mr Fatyana asked why 7.5 million metric tons of sugar were allowed to be exported, alleging it was done to artificially inflate local prices.</p>
<p>He also questioned the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) for issuing a Statutory Regulatory Order (SRO) that reduced the sales tax on sugar imports. “This export was designed for profiteering,” he claimed.</p>
<p>PAC Chairman Junaid Akbar Khan condemned the influence of sugar barons, stating, “These mill owners are part of every government. Why is the International Monetary Fund (IMF) silent on their profiteering?”</p>
<p>He questioned why tax exemptions were given to sugar importers while the general public was denied relief. FBR officials responded that the tax exemption was a cabinet decision and the board acted on official instructions.</p>
<p>MNA Naveed Qamar argued that the government should refrain from intervening in the sugar market. “Every time the government steps in, things get worse. Bureaucracy cannot run markets,” he said, adding that two main cartels — sugar and fertiliser — continue to operate without oversight.</p>
<p>MNA Shazia Marri demanded a report detailing how much subsidy was granted to sugar mills over the past five years and identifying the top beneficiaries. The committee also expressed dissatisfaction with the composition and transparency of the Sugar Advisory Board and directed the Ministry of Industries to attend the next meeting and clarify decisions related to sugar export and import, as the Ministry of Food Security claimed it had no access to that data.</p>
<p>But despite the government’s best efforts, the sugar crisis persists. In this backdrop, Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain warned all sugar mills that are not releasing their existing stocks and hoarding them, will not be tolerated under any circumstances.</p>
<p>In a meeting with representatives of the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) and other key stakeholders, he directed provincial governments to ensure the timely lifting of sugar from mills and to facilitate its smooth transportation to markets.</p>
<p>He stated that a nationwide crackdown is currently underway against those disrupting the sugar supply chain. Expressing serious concern over the artificial increase in sugar prices, the minister warned of strict action against hoarders.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a press release from the Ministry of National Food Security noted that sugar prices have started to decline significantly—from Rs200 per kilogram to Rs175 per kilogram—as a result of the government’s crackdown.</p>
