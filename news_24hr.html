            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514/govt-to-recommend-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize-for-decisive-diplomatic-intervention-in-india-pakistan-crisis' target='_blank'><strong>Govt to recommend Trump for Nobel Peace Prize for ‘decisive diplomatic intervention’ in India-Pakistan crisis</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Pakistani government has decided to formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” during the recent India-Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">crisis</a>.</p>
<p>The move by Pakistan was another indication of improved bilateral ties with the US.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/GovtofPakistan/status/1936159807326900577?t=_SkHHZ9STzyca0C7Nrq5_g&amp;s=19" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> shared on X, the government said the international community had “bore witness to unprovoked and unlawful Indian aggression, which constituted a grave violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, resulting in the tragic loss of innocent lives, including women, children, and the elderly”.</p>
<p>Following the Indian aggression, Pakistan “launched Operation Bunyanum Marsoos  — a measured, resolute, and precise military response”, the post read.</p>
<p>It noted that the response was executed to exercise the country’s “fundamental right to self-defence” and “carefully to re-establish deterrence”, defending its “territorial integrity while consciously avoiding civilian harm”.</p>
<p>The post further read that “at a moment of heightened regional turbulence”, President Trump “demonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi”.</p>
<p>It continued that the US president “de-escalated a rapidly deteriorating situation, ultimately securing a ceasefire and averting a broader conflict between the two nuclear states that would have had catastrophic consequences for millions of people in the region and beyond”.</p>
<p>“This intervention stands as a testament to his [Trump’s] role as a genuine peacemaker and his commitment to conflict resolution through dialogue,” it added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The government also acknowledged President Trump’s “sincere <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910785/fo-reiterates-support-for-trump-offer-to-resolve-kashmir-issue">offers</a>” to help resolve the longstanding dispute of Jammu and Kashmir between India and Pakistan — an issue that lies at the heart of regional instability.</p>
<p>“Durable peace in South Asia would remain elusive until the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Jammu and Kashmir,” it observed.</p>
<p>The government noted that President Trump’s leadership during the 2025 Pakistan-India crisis “manifestly showcases the continuation of his legacy of pragmatic diplomacy and effective peace-building”.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the post read that Pakistan remains hopeful that Trump’s “earnest efforts” will continue to contribute towards regional and global stability,  particularly in the context of ongoing crises in the Middle East, including the humanitarian <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918018">tragedy</a> unfolding in Gaza and the deteriorating <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917457/iran-state-tv-resumes-programming-after-israeli-attack-on-tehran-trump-reiterates-negotiations?_gl=1*1r5z0it*_ga*QUtLaWptVVNieFVlMFppeHc2Rl9TcWk0SW5zbHpRaGZVMjdfQnhWb3N6SHZvZHE5NjE3Mm5SQjRucVBhOUhCVQ..*_ga_C521GRS8DF*MTc1MDQ1NzIzMC40OC4xLjE3NTA0NTc5ODAuMC4wLjA.">escalation</a> involving Iran.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly said that the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours agreed to a ceasefire after talks mediated by the US, and that the hostilities ended after he urged the countries to focus on <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911719">trade</a> instead of war.</p>
<p>However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi maintained in a recent conversation with US President Donald Trump that a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after a four-day conflict in May was achieved through talks between the two militaries and not US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912153">mediation</a>, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a press <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MEAIndia/status/1935191636809761216?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>A day ago, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Munir had an interaction in Washington, DC, with prominent US think tanks and representatives of the strategic affairs institutions.</p>
<p>The army chief “underscored the immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect, shared strategic interests and economic interdependence”, ISPR <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7326" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a statement.</p>
<p>That talk followed Field Marshal Munir’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044">meeting with</a> Trump over a luncheon, becoming Pakistan’s first serving army chief to hold a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.</p>
<p>Evaluating the Pakis­tan-US partnership, Field Marshal Munir underlined the “historical convergences between the two nations, particularly in areas such as counterterrorism, regional security and economic development,” according to ISPR.</p>
<p>The army chief also highlighted Paki­stan’s “unwavering commitment to regional peace and stability, and its constructive role in fostering a rules-based international order”.</p>
<p>He also noted the “malign influence of certain regional actors in sponsoring and perpetuating terrorism as a tool of hybrid warfare”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir emphasised that Pakistan had been on the “front lines of the global war against terrorism, having rendered immense sacrifices — both human and economic — in pursuit of a safer and more secure world”.</p>
<p>During the session, COAS Munir also invited international partners to explore collaborative opportunities in various sectors to “unlock shared prosperity”.</p>
<p>He highlighted Pakistan’s “remarkable untapped potential, particularly in the domains of information technology, agriculture, and its vast and underexploited reserves in the mining and mineral sectors”, echoing topics discussed in his meeting with Trump and previous Pak-US interactions.</p>
<p>The army chief also provided a detailed exposition of Pakistan’s “balanced approach to regional and global conflicts, advocating for dialogue, diplomacy, and adherence to international law”, the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed that Pakistan continues to play a “responsible and proactive role in mitigating regional tensions and promoting cooperative security frameworks”.</p>
<p>His remarks come amid heightened tensions in the Middle East as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/israel-iran-conflict">Israel-Iran conflict</a> escalates and the US weighs possible military intervention.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Participants noted the “openness and clarity of the COAS’s perspectives and appreciated Pakistan’s consistent and principled policies”, the ISPR said.</p>
<p>“The interaction was marked by a spirit of mutual understanding and was widely regarded as a positive step towards enhancing strategic dialogue between Pakistan and the United States,” it added.</p>
<p>The interaction also provided an opportunity to articulate Pakistan’s principled stance on key regional and global issues, and to deepen understanding of Pakistan’s strategic outlook, ISPR noted.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918563/budget-2025-26-roadmap-for-liberalised-vehicle-imports-unveiled' target='_blank'><strong>Budget 2025-26: Roadmap for liberalised vehicle imports unveiled</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Restrictions on used vehicles up to five years old to be lifted from Sept<br />
• Age limit to be fully removed from July 2026; quality standards to remain mandatory<br />
• 40pc regulatory duty to end by 2029  • Panel sends its proposals to Senate</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb informed a parliamentary committee on Friday that restrictions on commercial imports of used vehicles up to five years old will be lifted from September, in line with an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910172">International Monetary Fund conditio</a>n and as part of a tariff strategy to gradually phase out overprotected sectors.</p>
<p>As of July 1, 2026, the age limit for importing used cars and vehicles will be lifted entirely. However, while age restrictions will end, strict compliance with quality standards will remain mandatory.</p>
<p>Although the matter was not listed on the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue’s agenda, the minister disclosed the government’s four-year roadmap for used vehicle imports, which aims to align tax treatment for used and new vehicles.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The committee meeting was chaired by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla.</p>
<p>The committee concluded its morning session by addressing pending agenda items, while the evening session focused on finalising recommendations to be presented in the Senate on Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>Used vehicle imports</strong></p>
<p>The finance minister announced that Pakistan will resume commercial imports of used vehicles up to five years old, signalling a major shift in trade policy. He noted that the move could enhance the competitiveness of the auto sector and increase access to imported vehicles for the middle class, as the country fulfils its global fiscal obligations and adapts to evolving domestic demand.</p>
<p>Currently, commercial imports are restricted, even for cars that are just a month old. Under the Baggage Rules, only vehicles up to three years old — and up to five years for categories other than cars — are permitted for import by overseas Pakistanis under certain conditions.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Commerce ministry officials briefed the Senate committee that by the first quarter (July-September) of the new fiscal year, the government will issue a notification allowing commercial imports of used vehicles up to five years old.</p>
<p>These imports will be subject to a 40 per cent regulatory duty in addition to existing duties and taxes on new vehicles. From July 1, 2026, this duty will be gradually reduced: to 30pc in 2026, 20pc in 2027, 10pc in 2028, and fully eliminated by July 1, 2029. There will be no restrictions on importing any type of used vehicles, including heavy bikes.</p>
<p>It remains unclear whether the additional regulatory duty will apply to cars and other vehicles up to five years old imported under the Baggage Rules — specifically the Transfer of Residence and Gift schemes. Currently, the Baggage Rules permit the import of cars up to three years old and other vehicles up to five years old, subject to certain conditions.</p>
<p>It was clarified that vehicles brought in under the baggage scheme will require a minimum overseas residency of 700 days to qualify for exemptions.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Commerce, imports of used vehicles will continue to be subject to environmental and quality standards. However, from July 2026, while the age limit will be lifted for commercial imports, quality requirements will remain in force.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Currently, new car imports attract high duties and taxes. As part of ongoing tariff reforms, these levies will be reduced over the next five years, eventually capping at a maximum of 15pc. By the end of this period, the phased reduction of duties on new vehicles and the gradual removal of additional regulatory duties on used vehicles will be aligned.</p>
<p><strong>Public Finance Management Act</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the parliamentary committee rejected the finance ministry’s proposed amendments to the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), arguing that existing legislation already empowers institutions through parliament.</p>
<p>The ministry was directed to return with a formal draft of the revisions.</p>
<p>Finance ministry officials disclosed that when funds were requested from the Port Qasim Authority, the request was denied and the ministry was advised to contact the relevant department. A follow-up letter received no reply.</p>
<p>During proceedings, Senator Anusha Rahman sought clarification on the terms “surplus profit” and “idle cash”. Officials explained that surplus profit refers to annual financial gains, while idle cash denotes unutilised funds held in accounts during the fiscal year.</p>
<p>Senator Rahman recommended that companies be included within the scope of the PFMA alongside autonomous bodies — a suggestion the ministry accepted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the FBR provided an update on ongoing customs reforms to the committee.</p>
<p>The Member Customs Operations rep­orted that customs duties have been red­u­ced on 35pc of tariff lines, while new duty slabs of 5pc, 10pc and 15pc are being proposed to replace the existing 3pc, 11pc and 16pc tiers.</p>
<p>Additionally, duties will be eliminated on 916 more tariff lines, raising the total number of zero-rated lines to 3,117.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918605/pakistan-gets-20bn-in-external-assistance' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan gets $20bn in external assistance</strong></a>
            <p><p>• Surpasses target for FY25 in first eleven months<br />
• Includes $6.89bn in fresh inflows; rest are rollovers from China, Saudi Arabia and UAE</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan secured nearly $20bn in foreign loans and grants during the first 11 months (July-May) of 2024-25, surpassing the annual target of $19.2bn set for the fiscal year ending June 30.</p>
<p>Almost half of this amount comprised legacy rollovers from China, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, while fresh loans and grant inflows totalled $6.89bn — about 9pc lower than the same period last fiscal year.</p>
<p>According to the Economic Affairs Division’s (EAD) <a class="link--external" href="https://www.ead.gov.pk/SiteImage/Misc/files/2025/Report%20May%2C%202025_merged.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">monthly report</a> on Foreign Economic Assistance (FEA) released on Friday, the total FEA during July-May stood at $6.89bn, compared to $7.55bn in the corresponding period of last year, against a target of $19.4bn for 2024-25 and $17.6bn last year.</p>
<p>This figure does not include approximately $2bn received from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910966">two tranches</a> under the ongoing $7bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF), which is recorded separately by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).</p>
<p>Including rollovers and IMF disbursements, total external assistance reached $20bn during the 11-month period. This comprised $3bn each in rollovers from <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1876913">Saudi Arabia</a> and China, and $2bn from the UAE. Pakistan’s total annual rollover portfolio from these three countries stands at approximately $12.7bn in the form of safe deposits and loans, leaving net international reserves (NIR) at around $3bn.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The EAD noted that inflows of foreign economic assistance dropped by 8.7pc to $6.89bn, largely due to delays in the IMF programme, which caused many commercial lenders to remain cautious. In comparison, inflows during the same period last year totalled about $9bn, including IMF funds.</p>
<p>In May alone, the EAD reported inflows of $797m, up from $576m in April, $555m in March, $237m in February, and $830m in January.</p>
<p>Of the $6.89bn received, around $3.9bn was allocated for budgetary support or programme loans, while $2.98bn was directed toward project financing. During the same period last year, project aid stood at $2.56bn and programme loans at $4.99bn.</p>
<p>Multilateral lenders contributed $3.37bn in the first 11 months of 2024-25, compared to $3.14bn last year. Bilateral disbursements declined sharply to $487m, down 45pc from $889m in the same period last year.</p>
<p>The EAD reported receiving approximately $903m from foreign commercial lenders based in the UAE, indicating a slight rebound from last year when commercial financing had nearly dried up. However, this is well short of the $3.8bn target set for the year, reflecting the continued impact of the delayed IMF programme, challenging economic conditions, and associated credit rating concerns.</p>
<p>The government had also aimed to raise $1bn through international bonds and projected $9bn in inflows from China and Saudi Arabia, including a $5bn time deposit from Saudi Arabia and $4bn in SAFE deposits from China. These funds are vital to bridging Pakistan’s external financing gap under the IMF programme.</p>
<p>In addition, Pakistan received $1.77bn from overseas Pakistanis via Naya Pakistan Certificates, up from $1.05bn in the same period last year. The Asian Development Bank disbursed $1.39bn during the period, up from $766m a year earlier, while the World Bank contributed $1.23bn.</p>
