<p>After months of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917469/fact-check-trump-netanyahu-viral-comments-about-pakistan-on-iran-israel-clash-are-fake">attacking</a> Gaza ‚Äî flattening homes, targeting hospitals, and starving a besieged population ‚Äî Israel expanded its assault by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">launching</a> wide-scale air strikes against Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences on June 13, killing top commanders, scientists and civilians. A day earlier, President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">said</a> US air strikes  ‚Äútotally obliterated‚Äù Iran‚Äôs main nuclear sites, as Washington joined <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919362/we-will-end-this-war-iran-warns-gambler-trump">Israel‚Äôs war</a> with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.</p>
<p>The strikes on Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities, which came four days after Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917868">meeting</a> with Trump and a day after the government said it decided to formally recommend Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize for his role during the recent conflict with India, were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919259/pakistan-backed-security-council-resolution-seeks-immediate-de-escalation">condemned</a> by Pakistan. A meeting of the NSC,  the highest forum for security deliberations comprising the civil and military top brass, was subsequently convened.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif chaired the meeting, with Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir also attending the important moot, and reviewed the evolving regional situation following the Israeli aggression against Iran.</p>

<p>Sources in the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office had told <em>Dawn</em> that Field Marshal Munir would brief the committee on the details of his meeting with Trump.</p>
<p>A press release from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office said: ‚ÄúThe committee strongly condemned Israel‚Äôs acts of aggression and expressed regret that these military attacks coincided with a constructive negotiation process between Iran and the US. These reckless actions have escalated tensions, threatening to ignite a wider conflict and diminishing the opportunities for dialogue and diplomacy. The NSC reaffirmed Iran‚Äôs right to self-defence as enshrined in the UN Charter.‚Äù</p>
<p>The committee members also conveyed their condolences to the Iranian government and people on the loss of innocent lives and offered prayers for the recovery of those injured.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile reiterating Pakistan‚Äôs stated position, the NSC expressed grave concern over the potential for further escalation after the attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan on June 22 which violated the resolutions of the International Atomic Energy Agency, relevant international law and the UN Charter.‚Äù</p>
<p>The committee members also reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs close engagement with relevant parties in the situation and endorsed the government‚Äôs readiness to continue efforts and initiatives aimed at promoting regional peace and stability.</p>
<p>The NSC called on all relevant parties to resolve the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy in line with the UN Charter, underscoring the need to adhere to international human rights and humanitarian laws.</p>

<p>The US president had stepped up his rhetoric against Iran since Israel first struck the country, repeating his insistence that it could never have a nuclear weapon. Tehran has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a> the claim, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p>
<p>Condemning the US attacks as a violation of international law, Iran said it was ‚Äúresolved to defend Iran‚Äôs territory, sovereignty, security and people by all force‚Äù. It also responded with a volley of missiles at Israel that wounded scores of people in Tel Aviv.</p></p>

                <h2>Pakistan extends airspace ban for Indian airlines until July 23</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) on Monday announced that the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912849">airspace ban</a> on Indian airlines was extended until July 23.</p>
<p>New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating last month‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam. Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">strongly denied</a> the allegations and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>. As the situation turned into a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military confrontation</a> between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>On April 24, Pakistan‚Äôs top brass had announced a series of measures, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284/trade-ties-and-flights-off-limits-as-pakistan-retaliates-to-indias-moves">closure</a> of its airspace to all India-owned or Indian-operated airlines with immediate effect, as it retaliated against New Delhi‚Äôs slew of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">aggressive measures</a> against the country.</p>
<p>A revised notice to airmen (NOTAM) issued by the PAA today said, ‚Äú[The] airspace closure for India has been extended for one month.‚Äù</p>
<p>The statement said that the airspace will remain closed until July 23.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPAA maintains [the] ban on Indian airlines‚Äô passenger and military aircraft from using Pakistan‚Äôs airspace,‚Äù it further said, adding that all Indian registered or leased aircraft will remain under the ban.</p>
<p>The two neighbouring nations closed their airspaces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909304">multiple times</a> during the hostilities last month. Pakis¬≠tan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910187">reopened</a> its airspace for all types of flig¬≠hts on May 10 after the ceasefire was announced.</p></p>
