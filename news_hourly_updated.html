                <h2>PHC grants protective bail to PTI‚Äôs Shibli Faraz, Zartaj Gul</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Peshawar High Court (PHC) granted protective bail to PTI leaders Shibli Faraz and Zartaj Gul Wazir on Wednesday until August 11.</p>
<p>The ECP on Tuesday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928901">disqualified</a> Faraz as the Senate opposition leader, Omar Ayub as the National Assembly equivalent, then-MNAs Wazir and Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza, and other PTI lawmakers following their convictions in cases related to the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan‚Äôs arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">attacking</a> the Lahore corps commander‚Äôs residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.</p>
<p>An anti-terrorism court in Faisalabad last week <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">senten¬≠ced</a> over PTI 100 leaders and workers to jail terms of up to 10 years in connection with the riots. Faraz, Zartaj Gul and Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan were among those awarded rigorous imprisonment.</p>
<p>A two-judge PHC bench comprising Justices Arshad Ali and Farah Jamshed conducted a hearing for Faraz and Gul‚Äôs bail applications.</p>
<p>The bench granted them protective bail till August 11 and directed them to appear before the concerned high court by that date and file their appeals.</p>
<p>Faraz and Ayub also submitted writ petitions to the PHC contesting the ECP‚Äôs disqualification order.</p>
<p>A day prior, Ayub lambasted the ATC‚Äôs ‚Äúbogus verdict‚Äù in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/OmarAyubKhan/status/1952737607013576874" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X, saying that he would contest it and the ECP‚Äôs disqualification in court.</p>
<p>He also posted a video of himself at the PHC with other PTI leaders and lawyers, saying the court had given him a few days and bail would be granted to him on filing his appeal.</p>

                <h2>Pakistan Mart in Dubai set to boost ‚Äòglobal footprint‚Äô of exports</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A Pakistan Mart will be established in Dubai to boost the ‚Äúglobal footprint‚Äù of exports, state media <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/06-08-2025/pakistan-uae-to-establish-pakistan-mart-in-dubai" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The UAE is one of Pakistan‚Äôs largest <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884644">trading partners</a> in the Middle East and a major source of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884404#:~:text=while%20the%20UAE%20recorded%20the%20highest%20growth%20at%2054pc%2C%20with%20inflows%20totalling%20%243.58bn.">remittances</a>, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media about the project, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan called it a ‚Äúgame changer for Pakistani trade boost‚Äù.</p>
<p>He was quoted as saying, ‚ÄúThe Pakistan Mart will facilitate Pakistani traders, enabling them to export their products to regions across the world.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe initiative is spearheaded by the National Logistics Corporation of Pakistan and the DP World company of UAE,‚Äù the report added.</p>
<p>Last month, trade with the UAE showed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925706">upward trend</a>. Pakistan‚Äôs key export items to the UAE include rice, bovine meat, cotton garments, mangoes, and guavas.</p>
<p>Exports increased 1.87 per cent to $2.121 billion in FY25 from $2.082bn last year. In FY24, exports to the UAE had surged 41.15pc, largely due to increased shipments to Dubai. Imports from the UAE rose 25.75pc to $7.958bn in FY25 from $6.328bn a year ago.</p>
<p>Overall, the country‚Äôs trade deficit with the Middle East widened by 7.37pc to $13.974bn in FY25 from $13.014bn a year ago, primarily due to a sharp increase in petroleum imports.</p></p>
