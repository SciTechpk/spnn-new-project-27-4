                <h2>Youm-i-Istehsal: PM notes India‚Äôs occupation of Kashmir ‚Äòdefining conflict‚Äô in South Asia</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif termed India‚Äôs occupation of Kashmir the ‚Äúdefining conflict‚Äù of South Asia as Pakistan marked six years on Tuesday since New Delhi deprived the held region of its special autonomy.</p>
<p>Pakistan is observing Youm-i-Istehsal (Exploitation Day) today to mark the sixth anniversary of India revoking Kashmir‚Äôs special autonomy and to show solidarity with Kashmiris.</p>
<p>On Aug 5, 2019, India‚Äôs Narendra Modi-led government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1498227">stripped</a> the Muslim-majority territory of its special status by repealing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1763985">Article 370</a> of the constitution, splitting the former state into two territories directly ruled by New Delhi.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir remained the defining conflict of the South Asia region, and the driver of India‚Äôs continued rogue behaviour,‚Äù PM Shehbaz said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-says-kashmir-dispute-resolution-key-pillar-of-pakistans-foreign-policy-calls-for-reversing-indian-unilateral-actions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The premier also recalled the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">India-Pakistan conflict</a>, noting: ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">unprovoked aggression</a> against Pakistan in May 2025, and its swift and comprehensive <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">military defeat</a> are only the latest evidence of the urgent need for the international community to ensure that the resolution of the Kashmir dispute becomes a global priority.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe will and aspirations of the Kashmiri people, in accordance with UN Security Council <a class="link--external" href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/111955/?ln=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resolutions</a>, are the only path forward,‚Äù he stressed.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz noted that a ‚Äújust resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was a key pillar of Pakistan‚Äôs foreign policy‚Äù.</p>
<p>The prime minister reiterated ‚Äústrongest condemnation‚Äù of India‚Äôs illegal and unilateral actions to alter the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898092">demographic structure</a> and political landscape of India-occupied Kashmir (IoK).</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He also flayed India‚Äôs efforts to silence genuine Kashmiri leaders as part of the ‚Äúwider hegemonic and extremist agenda‚Äù that informed its illegal occupation of the disputed region.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe imprisonment of Kashmiri leaders and activists, including <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1202138">Shabbir Ahmed Shah</a>, Muhammad <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1869419">Yasin Malik</a> and Masarrat Alam Bhatt, will never dim the resolve of our Kashmiri sisters and brothers,‚Äù he asserted.</p>
<p>Urging the international community to play a role in halting human rights crimes in IoK and reversing the 2019 action, the premier reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúunflinching‚Äù stance, moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in his statement, President Asif Ali Zardari also referred to the recent conflict with India, emphasising that ‚Äúthis year‚Äôs ‚ÄòYoum-e-Istehsal‚Äô assumes greater significance‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile the resounding success of the ‚Äò<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a>‚Äô is a matter of great pride for the people of Pakistan, the day also underscores the need for a settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people, for a lasting peace in South Asia,‚Äù the president said.</p>

<p>He highlighted that Indian authorities had taken a number of steps, aimed at changing the IoK‚Äôs demographic structure and political landscape, during the last six years.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese measures include gerrymandering of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1688423">electoral constituencies</a>, allowing addition of non-Kashmiris to electoral rolls, issuance of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1577106">domicile certificates</a> to outsiders, granting more powers to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924441/opp-calls-for-held-kashmir-governor-to-step-down">lieutenant governor</a> in administrative matters, and introduction of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home">new laws</a> on ownership of land and property,‚Äù he noted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Kashmiri people are confronted with the danger of becoming a disempowered community in their own land. The genuine leadership of the Kashmiri people remains behind bars. The intimidation of innocent people, arbitrary detentions, and the so-called ‚Äòcordon and search‚Äô operations have become a matter of routine,‚Äù Zardari said.</p>
<p>To mark Youm-i-Istehsal, a rally was taken out from Parliament House to D-Chowk in Islamabad to express solidarity with Kashmiris.</p>

<p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar underscored that Kashmir was an internationally recognised dispute, and its future cannot be determined through internal legislation or court rulings, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/05-08-2025/dpm-urges-india-to-end-oppression-in-iiojk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>

<p>The foreign minister reaffirmed Islamabad‚Äôs desire for friendly relations with all neighbouring countries and its preference for dialogue and diplomacy over confrontation.</p>
<p>However, he warned that Pakistan‚Äôs armed forces and its people were ‚Äúfully capable of delivering a resolute response to any act of aggression, as demonstrated‚Äù during the May conflict.</p>
<p>Addressing the rally, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar noted that the bonds between Kashmiris and Pakistan were ‚Äúeternal which can never be broken by any Indian conspiracy‚Äù.</p>
<p>Recalling that bodies of Kashmiri icons, such as <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1282425">Burhan Wani</a>, were wrapped in the ‚Äúcolour of Pakistan‚Äôs flag, which was a manifestation of Kashmiris love and affection for Pakistan‚Äù.</p>
<p>Also mentioning the India-Pakistan conflict, Tarar asserted that the ‚Äúvictory in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> has boosted the morale of Kashmiri masses‚Äù.</p>

<p>In its session today, the National Assembly passed a unanimous resolution, condemning ‚Äúall forms of Indian state violence and coercive tactics aimed at erasing the identity, culture, and political aspirations of the Kashmiri people, which have failed and will continue to fail‚Äù.</p>
<p>The lower house of the parliament reiterated that ‚ÄúPakistan will never compromise on the right of the Kashmiri people to self-determination as guaranteed under international law and UN resolutions‚Äù, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/05-08-2025/na-reaffirms-support-for-kashmiris-right-to-self-determination" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>

<p>The resolution stressed that the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was ‚Äúnot an internal matter of India but a global issue requiring a just resolution in accordance with UNSC resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people‚Äù.</p>
<p>It called upon the global community to ‚Äústand for justice, not silence, in the face of Indian oppression and human rights abuses‚Äù in IoK.  The NA declared that ‚Äúfrom Srinagar to Islamabad, the heart beats as one for the freedom and dignity of Kashmir‚Äù, <em>Radio Pakistan</em> added.</p>
<p>The NA affirmed that Pakistan‚Äôs moral, political and diplomatic support for the Kashmiri people remained ‚Äúunshakable and enduring‚Äù, and committed to continue raising the Kashmir issue at every regional and international forum.</p>
<p>The House demanded the immediate implementation of all relevant UNSC resolutions, which call for a free and impartial plebiscite.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is leaning towards an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1928695">expanded offensive</a> and taking control of the entire enclave after 22 months of offensive against Hamas, Israeli <em>Channel 12</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.mako.co.il/news-politics/2025_q3/Article-36843dbbf297891027.htm?pId=173113802" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>A senior Israeli source told <em>Reuters</em> on Monday that more force was an option following the collapse of indirect ceasefire talks with Hamas.</p>
<p>Seizing the entire territory would reverse a 2005 decision by Israel to pull settlers and military out of Gaza while retaining control over its borders ‚Äî a move right-wing parties blame for Hamas gaining power there.</p>
<p>It was unclear, however, whether a potential full takeover of Gaza would entail a prolonged occupation or a short-term operation aimed at dismantling Hamas and freeing hostages.</p>
<p>Israel‚Äôs coalition government is regarded as one of the most right-wing in its history, with the cabinet including parties that seek to annexe both Gaza and the West Bank and encourage Palestinians to leave their homeland.</p>
<p>The country‚Äôs military has throughout the conflict pushed back against the idea of Israel trying to fully occupy Gaza and establish military rule there, which would require it to take over long-term governance.</p>
<p>The military has also struggled with manpower issues as the offensive has dragged on, with reservists being repeatedly called up and putting a strain on capabilities.</p>
<p>Israel‚Äôs military campaign has devastated the tiny, crowded enclave, killing more than 60,000 people according to Palestinian health authorities. The conflict was triggered by a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1779807">Hamas attack</a> on October 7, 2023, when gunmen stormed the border from Gaza, killing more than 1,200 people and seizing around 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies.</p>
<p>The conflict has forced nearly all of Gaza‚Äôs over 2 million people from their homes and caused what a global hunger monitor called last week an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927376">unfolding famine</a>.</p>

<p>That has caused widespread international anger and prompted several European countries to say they would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927699">recognise</a> a Palestinian state next month if there was no ceasefire.</p>
<p>Inside Gaza on Tuesday, Israeli gunfire and strikes killed at least 13 Palestinians, local health authorities said, including five people in a tent in Khan Younis and three aid seekers near Rafah in the south.</p>

<p>Israeli tanks pushed into central Gaza earlier on Tuesday but it was not clear if the move was part of a larger ground offensive.</p>
<p>Palestinians living in the last fifth of the territory, where Israel has not yet taken military control via ground incursions or orders for civilians to leave, said any new move to occupy the area would be catastrophic.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf the tanks pushed through, where would we go, into the sea? This will be like a death sentence to the entire population,‚Äù said Abu Jehad, a Gaza wood merchant, who asked not to be named in full.</p>

<p>A Palestinian official close to the talks and mediation said Israeli threats could be a way to pressure Hamas to make concessions at the negotiation table.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt will only complicate the negotiation further, at the end, the resistance factions will not accept less than an end to the war, and a full withdrawal from Gaza,‚Äù he told <em>Reuters</em>, asking not to be named.</p>
<p>Israel said it would allow merchants to import goods. A source in Gaza told <em>Reuters</em> some trucks had already entered carrying chocolates and biscuits for a merchant.</p>
<p>It is hoped that essential items such as children‚Äôs milk, fresh meat and fruits, sugar, and rice could be allowed in, which would alleviate scarcity and drive down prices of what is available in the markets.</p>

<p>US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said last week he was working with the Israeli government on a plan that would effectively end the conflict in Gaza.</p>
<p>But Israeli officials have also floated ideas, including expanding the offensive and annexing parts of Gaza.</p>
<p>The failed ceasefire talks in Doha had aimed to clinch agreements on a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921634">US-backed proposal</a> for a 60-day truce, during which aid would be flown into Gaza and half of the hostages Hamas is holding would be freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israel.</p>
<p>The Israeli military was expected on Tuesday to present alternatives that include extending into areas of Gaza where it has not yet operated, according to two defence officials.</p></p>
