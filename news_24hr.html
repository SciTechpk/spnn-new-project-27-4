            <p><p>Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) on Sunday dismissed “incorrect and misleading” media reports about an eight-day closure of Islamabad International Airport, clarifying the exact date and time of the planned shutdown.</p>
<p>A statement by PAA Spokesperson Saifullah Khan said, “According to the Notams issued, due to air activities ahead of Independence Day on August 14, arrival and departure flights will be suspended for only two hours on specific days and times.”</p>
<p>From August 6-9 and August 11-14, the airport will be shut from 11am-1pm PST.</p>
<p>On August 9 and 11, the airport will also be shut from 8-10pm.</p>
<p>“Apart from these brief interruptions, all flights at the airport will continue as usual,” the statement said, advising passengers to contact their airline for the latest information on their schedule.</p>
<p>The government has said that this year’s Independence Day would be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922864/govt-announces-independence-day-to-be-celebrated-under-theme-of-marka-i-haq">celebrated</a> under the banner of “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a>” (Battle of Truth) — the period of conflict with India in May — to demonstrate the nation’s resilience, progress and pride.</p>

<p>While discussing the activities of the scheduled celebrations, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal stressed that every sector and official in charge should ensure that all universities and schools observe the day in the same format. The same was advised for provincial celebrations and celebrations abroad in collaboration with the Overseas Ministry.</p>
<p>During the four-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">conflict</a> between Pakistan and India, flight disruptions left hundreds of passengers <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909570">stranded</a> at the country’s major airports, including Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Sialkot airports.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defence informed the National Assembly on Friday that the PAA <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929682">lost</a> Rs4.1 billion from April 24 to June 30 due to the closure.</p>
<p>PAA also issued a schedule for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920506/lahore-airport-closure-scheduled-to-avoid-bird-strikes">temporary</a> runway closure at Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International airport owing to bird activity. The closure will be in effect daily from 5am to 8am, starting July 1 until September 15.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929966/self-amusement-chinese-expert-spurns-indias-claims-on-downing-pakistani-jets' target='_blank'><strong>‘Self-amusement’: Chinese expert spurns India’s claims on downing Pakistani jets</strong></a>
            <p><p>China’s former defence attache in South Asia Cheng Xizhong on Sunday spurned India’s much-delayed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929745/defence-minister-rubbishes-indian-air-chiefs-comical-claims-of-downing-6-pakistani-aircraft-in-may-conflict">claim</a> that it had shot down six Pakistani aircraft during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">May conflict</a>, terming it “self-amusement”.</p>
<p>Having faced <a class="link--external" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/05/09/fighter-jets-india-pakistan-attack/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">international coverage</a> of its own craft being <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downed</a> by Pakistan and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927416">scathing criticism</a> from the opposition, India’s Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh — three months after the conflict — claimed yesterday that his country had shot down five Pakistani fighter jets and one other military aircraft during those clashes.</p>
<p>While Pakistan had already <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909901#:~:text=Pakistani%20defe%C2%ADnses%20detected%20and%20enga%C2%ADged%20the%20threats%20instantly">denied</a> that India downed any of its aircraft, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929745/defence-minister-rubbishes-indian-air-chiefs-comical-claims-of-downing-6-pakistani-aircraft-in-may-conflict">swiftly rubbished</a> Singh’s “belated assertions” yesterday.</p>
<p>Commenting on the matter today, Cheng said India’s allegations lacked strong evidence and have been “widely questioned by the international community, being considered groundless”, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/foreign-correspondent/chinese-expert-rubbishes-indian-air-force-chiefs-groundless-claim/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Singh’s remarks were “comical, implausible and unconvincing”. “We may call it self-amusement,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Pakistan said it downed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915722">six</a> Indian planes during the conflict. India’s highest-ranking general has also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914500/indian-military-confirms-fighter-jets-shot-down-by-pakistan">acknowledged</a> that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft.</p>
<p>“The Indian side has not presented any evidence, such as photos of the wreckage of the fighter jets, radar monitoring data, etc, while the Pakistani side had previously presented a large amount of relevant evidence of shooting down the Indian fighter jets,” Cheng noted.</p>
<p>The defence expert believed that everything should be based on sufficient evidence.</p>
<p>He highlighted that now, more than three months have passed since the India-Pakistan clash. New Delhi has never produced any evidence to prove that it had shot down Pakistani fighter jets, Cheng highlighted.</p>
<p>“In contrast, the Pakistan side immediately provided a detailed technical report to international media after the clash ended,” he added.</p>
<p>The Chinese expert also cited “confirmations from world leaders, senior Indian politicians, and foreign intelligence assessments that India suffered heavy losses of multiple aircraft”.</p>
<p>“It is thus evident that no Pakistani fighter jet was hit or destroyed by the Indian side. On the contrary, the Pakistani side shot down six Indian fighter jets and destroyed S-400 air defence positions, among other achievements, which is an indisputable fact,” he added.</p>
<p>Professor Cheng is currently a senior research fellow at the Chinese think tank <a class="link--external" href="http://charhar.china.org.cn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Charhar Institute</a> and has also served as a former United Nations senior military observer, according to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d3d774d31597a4e32457a6333566d54/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CGTN</a></em>.</p>
<p>In his claims yesterday, the Indian Air Force (IAF) chief did not mention the type of Pakistan’s fighter jets that he insisted were taken down.</p>
<p>Asif, responding to Singh, stated that “not a single Pakistani aircraft was hit or destroyed” by India. He declared that Pakistan took out six Indian jets, S-400 air defence batteries and unmanned aircraft of India while “swiftly putting several Indian airbases out of action”.</p>
<p>Former envoy to the United States Dr Maleeha Lodhi also termed Singh’s claim “laughable”, quipping that it took him “several months to count the planes to make this ridiculous assertion!”</p>
<p>Criticism also echoed from within India. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera cast his doubts, saying: “The question we have after today’s information … when we had such a strong army and we were advancing, then under whose pressure did you stop Operation Sindoor?”</p>
<p>New Delhi had previously claimed it had downed “<a class="link--external" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/india-shot-down-high-tech-jets-of-pakistan-confirms-air-marshal-bharti-938212" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a few planes</a>”, refusing to go into the specifics of it. US President <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925193">Donald Trump</a> has echoed the figure of “five jets” shot down during the military confrontation, albeit without specifying which side’s craft he was referring to.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#indias-loss-of-jets-affirmed-globally" id="indias-loss-of-jets-affirmed-globally" title="Permalink"></a>India’s loss of jets affirmed globally</h2>
<p>France’s air chief, General Jerome Bellanger, has previously said that he has seen evidence of the loss of three Indian fighters, including a Rafale. The IAF has not commented on those claims.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Days after the air combat, <em>The Washington Post</em>, based on visual evidence analysed by experts, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910110">reported</a> that at least two French-made Indian fighter aircraft were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force (PAF).</p>
<p>India’s defence attache to Indonesia, Indian Navy Captain Shiv Kumar, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921034/indian-defence-attache-claims-paf-downed-indian-fighter-jets-because-of-political-leaderships-constraints">acknowledged</a> in June that the PAF downed Indian fighters, according to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://thewire.in/security/iaf-lost-fighter-jets-to-pak-because-of-political-leaderships-constraints-indian-defence-attache" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Wire</a></em>.</p>
<p>India’s intelligence failure was central to the hour-long air battle with Pakistan, which led to the downing of Rafale aircraft by the PAF’s J-10 fighters using PL-15 missiles, according to a <em>Reuters</em> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928400">report</a>.</p>
<p>In a press briefing two days after the May 7 air combat, Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Aura­n­g­zeb Ahmed, the deputy chief of operations of Pakistan Air Force (PAF), shared the locations where five Indian jets were downed — four along the Line of Control and one near Bathinda in northwest India. He also disclosed that one of the Indian jets was downed by Pakistani air defence systems.</p>
<p>According to a <em>Dawn</em> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909901">report</a>, which cited PAF officials, India’s three Rafales, one Su-30MKI and one MiG-29 were downed within a 40-minute span. Not a single Pakistani jet crossed the border or engaged in close combat.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Describing the engagement as a textbook case of modern aerial warfare, AVM Aurangzeb had said Pakistan had tracked over 70 Indian aircraft — including 14 Rafales — using its Electro­mag­netic Operational Environ­ment and responded with a concentrated and pre-planned defensive counter-air strategy.</p>
<p>“Our side deployed 42 high-tech aircraft,” the PAF officer said. He noted that while India remained on its side of the border and launched air-to-ground we­a­pons, Pakistani defe­nces detected and enga­ged the threats instantly.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929973/over-600-pilgrims-briefly-hospitalised-due-to-chlorine-gas-leak-in-iraqs-karbala' target='_blank'><strong>Over 600 pilgrims briefly hospitalised due to chlorine gas leak in Iraq’s Karbala</strong></a>
            <p><p>More than 600 pilgrims in Iraq were briefly hospitalised with respiratory problems after inhaling chlorine as a result of a leak at a water treatment station, authorities said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The incident took place overnight on the route between the two Shia holy cities of Najaf and Karbala, located in the centre and south of Iraq, respectively.</p>
<p>This year, several million Shia Muslim pilgrims are expected to make their way to Karbala, which houses the shrines of the revered Imam Husain and his brother Abbas.</p>
<p>There, they will mark the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1369782">Arbaeen</a> — the 40-day period of mourning during which the community commemorate the death of Husain, grandson of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</p>
<p>In a brief statement, Iraq’s health ministry said that “621 cases of asphyxia have been recorded following a chlorine gas leak in Karbala”.</p>
<p>“All have received the necessary care and left the hospital in good health,” it said.</p>
<p>Security forces charged with protecting pilgrims meanwhile said the incident had been caused by “a chlorine leak from a water station on the Karbala-Najaf road”.</p>
<p>Much of Iraq’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926654">infrastructure</a> is in disrepair due to decades of conflict and corruption, with adherence to safety standards often lax.</p>
<p>In July, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924763">a massive fire</a> at a shopping mall in the eastern city of Kut killed more than 60 people, many of whom suffocated in the toilets, according to authorities.</p></p>
