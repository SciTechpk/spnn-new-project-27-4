                <h2>Trump warns he will ‚Äòsubstantially‚Äô raise tariffs on India over Russian oil purchases</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Monday he will substantially raise tariffs on India over its purchases of Russian oil.</p>
<p>Trump last week said he would <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927587">impose</a> a 25 per cent tariff on goods imported from India and added that the world‚Äôs fifth-largest economy would also face an unspecified penalty, but gave no details. Later, Trump mou¬≠nted a sharp attack and said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.‚Äù</p>
<p>Over the weekend, two Indian government sources told <em>Reuters</em> that India will keep purchasing oil from Russia despite Trump‚Äôs threats. In turn, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928504/top-trump-aide-accuses-india-of-financing-russias-war-in-ukraine">accused</a> India of effectively financing Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine by purchasing oil from Moscow.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114971053091282290" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on Truth Social today, Trump assailed New Delhi for buying Russian oil and then selling it.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia is not only buying massive amounts of Russian oil, they are then, for much of the oil purchased, selling it on the open market for big profits,‚Äù Trump wrote. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBecause of this, I will be substantially raising the tariff paid by India to the USA,‚Äù the US president wrote.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Responding to the threat, India‚Äôs Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) issued a statement claiming that the US and the European Union ‚Äútargeted‚Äù New Delhi for purchasing Russian oil after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict,‚Äù the statement read. ‚ÄúThe US at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy market stability.‚Äù</p>
<p>The MEA highlighted in its statement that the very nations criticising India were engaging in trade with Russia themselves, adding that the goods exchanged include energy, fertilisers, mining products, chemicals, iron and steel and machinery and transport equipment.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhere the United States is concerned, it continues to import from Russia uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for its electric vehicle industry, fertilisers, as well as chemicals,‚Äù the MEA statement added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn this background, the targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable. Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security.‚Äù</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927843">India</a>, the world‚Äôs third-largest oil importer, is the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854116">biggest buyer</a> of seaborne Russian crude, a vital revenue earner for Russia as it wages war in Ukraine for a fourth year.</p>
<p>The US levy on India exceeds those agreed by some other nations in deals with the Trump administration. For example, the tariff on Vietnam is set at 20pc and on Indonesia at 19pc, with levies of 15pc on Japanese and European Union exports.</p>
<p>Last week, Trump said Washington had reached a trade deal with India‚Äôs arch-rival Pakistan that Islamabad said would lead to lower tariffs on its exports.</p>
<p>Since India‚Äôs short but deadly conflict with Pakistan in May, New Delhi has been unhappy about Trump‚Äôs closeness with Islamabad and has protested, casting a shadow over trade talks.</p>
<p>Despite former public displays of bonhomie between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has taken a slightly harder stance against the US in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the India-Pakistan ceasefire he announced on social media on May 10, but India disputes his claim that it resulted from his intervention and trade threats.</p>
<p>By declaring the Indian economy dead in the water, Trump has put Modi and his party in a bind. Until recently, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was canvassing support for the US president‚Äôs election. Its supporters were holding special prayers and muttering mystical chants for Trump‚Äôs victory. There was at least one temple created where a sculptured image of Trump was worshipped.</p>
<p>But Trump has ignored the lavish praise and called out India‚Äôs energy imports from Russia and its tariff regime as non-negotiable.</p>
<p>The Indian government said it was trying to figure out a response by consulting all the ‚Äústakeholders‚Äù, a euphemism for angry businesses whose hopes were riding on Modi‚Äôs daring ability to play both sides of the street.</p>
<p>That appears to have hit a dead-end.</p></p>

                <h2>FM Dar, Rubio hold second phone call since US visit amid improving bilateral ties</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday held his second phone call with United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926640">visiting</a> Washington and an improvement in bilateral ties.</p>
<p>There has been a surge in relations between the US and Pakistan, with both nations inking a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927783">trade deal</a> last week in which Washington lowered tariffs on Islamabad to 19 per cent, while tapping the latter‚Äôs oil reserves. The positive signals, which began emanating soon after President Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration, seem to be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928556">turning into full-blown bonhomie</a>.</p>
<p>From acknowledging Pakistan‚Äôs counterterror cooperation in the arrest of an Islamic State-Khorasan operative to claiming credit for stopping a nuclear war in South Asia, the country has perhaps featured more in this US president‚Äôs day-to-day media interactions than any past ‚Äòcommander-in-chief‚Äô.</p>
<p>In a post on X today, the Foreign Office (FO) stated that the two top diplomats had their most recent interaction over the phone.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe two leaders discussed a range of bilateral matters and exchanged views on current regional and international issues,‚Äù the FO stated. ‚ÄúBoth sides agreed to remain in contact and continue cooperation on areas of mutual interest.‚Äù</p>

<p>FM Dar had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926640">met</a> US Secretary of State Marco Rubio last month and discussed trade, investment, counterterrorism cooperation and the clash between India and Pakistan in May, according to officials from both countries.</p>
<p>The meeting ‚Äî the first such engagement between the foreign ministers of the two countries in three years ‚Äî was considered a breakthrough in diplomacy between Pakistan and the US. Secretary Rubio had recognised Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúunparalleled sacrifices‚Äù in the fight against terrorism and described Islamabad as a ‚Äúconstructive actor‚Äù in efforts to ensure regional stability.</p>
<p>The two had subsequently talked again on July 28 after their ‚Äúproductive meeting‚Äù and discussed key bilateral matters, including tariffs, as well as regional &amp; global issues of mutual interest.</p>
