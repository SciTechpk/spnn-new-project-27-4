            <p><p>• PML-N withdraws candidate in favour of JUI-F’s nominee on minority seat<br />
• ANP’s Shahida Waheed wins draw on women seat</p>
<p>PESHAWAR: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Thursday withdrew its candidate in favour of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) for a seat reserved for non-Muslims, paving the way for JUI-F to become the largest opposition party in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly with 18 lawmakers.</p>
<p>As a result, JUI-F’s candidate Gorpal Singh will now be notified as MPA-elect on the said seat by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Awami National Party (ANP) candidate Shahida Waheed was declared the winner through a draw against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Parliamentarians (PTI-P) candidate for a seat reserved for women. She will also be notified by the ECP as MPA-elect.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Both developments took place at the office of Provincial Election Commissioner (PEC) Saeed Gul in Peshawar on Thursday, where senior party leaders were present.</p>
<p>PML-N provincial president Amir Muqam and JUI-F’s Maul­ana Attaur Rehman attended the event along with their respective candidates, Gorsaran Lal and Gorpal Singh. The PML-N delegation formally withdrew its candidate in support of JUI-F’s nominee.</p>
<p>Similarly, delegations of ANP, led by MPA Nisar Baz and candidate Shahida Waheed, and PTI-P, led by MPA Arbab Waseem and candidate Somi, were also present for the draw. Following the draw, ECP officials declared Ms Waheed the winner.</p>
<p>Both PML-N and JUI-F were allo­­t­ted one seat each, reserved for non-Muslims, on the basis of the seven general seats won by each of them. The ECP had decided to allot the remaining seat through a draw.</p>
<p>Similarly, both ANP and PTI-P were awarded one seat each reserved for women and the remaining seat had to be allotted through a draw between candidates of these parties.</p>
<p>Following the notifications, JUI-F and PML-N will each hold nine of the total 26 reserved seats for women in the KP Assembly. PPP holds five, while ANP and PTI-P will now hold two and one, respectively.</p>
<p>For the four seats reserved for non-Muslims, JUI-F will hold two, while PML-N and PPP will have one each.</p>
<p>The opposition now <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920722/opposition-will-swell-to-52-in-kp-assembly">holds</a> a total of 52 lawmakers in the KP Assembly, including 18 MPAs of JUI-F, 17 of PML-N, 10 of PPP, four of ANP, and three of PTI-P. Presently, Dr Ibadullah of PML-N is the leader of the opposition in the KP Assembly. PTI-backed lawmakers maintain their tally of 92 members.</p>

                <h2>Lightning strikes kill 33 people in eastern India</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Lightning strikes during monsoon storms in eastern India this week killed at least 33 people and injured dozens, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The deaths in Bihar occurred during fierce storms between Wednesday and Thursday, a state disaster management department statement said, with the victims mostly farmers and labourers working in the open.</p>
<p>More heavy rain and lightning are forecast for parts of the state.</p>
<p>Bihar state’s disaster management minister, Vijay Kumar Mandal, told <em>AFP</em> that officials in vulnerable districts had been directed to “create awareness to take precautionary steps following an alert on lightning”.</p>
<p>The state government announced compensation of 4 million rupees ($4,600) to the families of those killed by lightning.</p>
<p>At least 243 died by lightning in 2024 and 275 the year earlier, according to the state government.</p>
<p>India’s eastern region, including Bihar, is prone to annual floods that kill dozens and displace hundreds of thousands of people during the peak monsoon season.</p></p>
