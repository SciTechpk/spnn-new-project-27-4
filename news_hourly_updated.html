                <h2>State Bank keeps monetary policy rate unchanged at 11pc</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept its policy rate unchanged on Wednesday at 11 per cent.</p>
<p>The central bank‚Äôs policy rate, after being slashed by 1,000bps from 22pc since June 2024 in seven intervals, was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908601">cut to 11pc</a> in May. The bank had kept the rate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917488">unchanged</a> on June 16 as well.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927245">Pakistan Business Forum</a> (PBF) had claimed that both interest and exchange rates were being kept artificially high without economic justification, and appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to ensure a correction to support growth and stability.</p>
<p>The PBF also criticised the current interest rate of 11pc, calling it unjustifiable given that the Consumer Price Index-based inflation had dropped to 4pc. It urged the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to reduce the policy rate to at least 9pc in its upcoming monetary policy announcement scheduled for July 30.</p>

                <h2>KP seeks confidence over Bajaur military operation, vows to lift curfew</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has opposed the newly launched <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927454/curfew-imposed-as-forces-launch-operation-sarbakaf-in-bajaur">military operation</a> in Bajaur unless it is taken into confidence by the Centre and has vowed to lift a three-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927438/curfew-imposed-as-3-day-operation-against-militants-begins-in-bajaur-official">curfew</a> imposed in the district‚Äôs 16 areas yesterday.</p>
<p>Security forces backed by gunship helicopters and artillery launched ‚ÄòOperation Sarbakaf‚Äô against terrorists in the Lowi Mamund tehsil on Tuesday. Tribal elders in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1842401">Bajaur</a> and some <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925049">other</a> KP districts have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1119721">long opposed</a> any military operation, citing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1892832">concerns</a> over displacement.</p>
<p>Although not confirmed officially by security forces, sources said that at least four terrorists were killed, around 12 were wounded, and about 10 were captured alive in different areas of the Lowi Mamund tehsil. Locals also claimed that a child was among two civilians who died, and eight others, including two minors and a woman, were wounded in clashes between security forces and terrorists.</p>
<p>Chairing a PTI parliamentary party meeting in Peshawar late last night, Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur said: ‚ÄúWe are not in favour of any military operation without the provincial government being taken into confidence.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>He lamented that the ‚Äúrelationship of confidence between our army and our public‚Äù was eroding due to the ‚Äúmartyred civilians and collateral damage in Bajaur‚Äù, adding that the lack of trust was failing the country‚Äôs fight against terrorism.</p>
<p>The meeting vowed that the recent curfew in parts of Bajaur would be revoked today. However, an official announcement for that is yet to be made.</p>
<p>It was decided that further course of action regarding an operation would be announced after the matter was debated in the KP Assembly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are standing with our public. We will go to every extent for our public,‚Äù CM Gandapur vowed. ‚ÄúWe cannot ruin our soil for those decisions that are imposed on us without our consultation.‚Äù</p>
<p>The meeting made several decisions regarding the ongoing security situation and its future actions to address the concerns raised by the people.</p>
<p>CM Gandapur ordered all deputy commissioners not to impose any curfew without permission from the KP home department, regardless of ‚Äúany kind of situation‚Äù. He also decided to transfer the powers of imposing Section 144, under which a curfew is put in place, to the department.</p>

<p>The PTI meeting further decided to revoke the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1505809">KP Actions (in aid of civil power) Ordinance 2019</a>, with legislation for that expected to be introduced in Friday‚Äôs KP Assembly session.</p>
<p>The ordinance provided legal cover to several detention centres set up during military operations ‚Äî similar to two <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/643667/new-regulations-give-legal-cover-to-detentions-in-tribal-areas">2011 regulations</a> imposed in the tribal areas.</p>
<p>The gathering also approved the decisions taken at a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926456/gandapur-rails-against-good-taliban-bad-taliban-distinction">multi-party conference</a> (MPC) held last week, wherein Gandapur opposed a renewed military offensive to eradicate militancy in the region and vowed to take action against all armed outfits.</p>
<p>Further, the KP CM said he would meet with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir to discuss the province‚Äôs law and order situation.</p>
<p>Speaking on a series of jirgas <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927149/kp-govt-says-cm-in-contact-with-administration-over-tirah-shooting#:~:text=would%20be%20organised%2015%20days%20after%20that%20to%20devise%20a%20strategy%20to%20implement%20the%20MPC%E2%80%99s%20declaration">planned</a> in the upcoming week, the chief minister said: ‚ÄúIn the next 10 days, we will hold multiple jirgas, each of two districts, after which a grand jirga of all stakeholders in terrorism-ridden areas will be convened.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn view of the decisions made in the jirgas, policies will be re-evaluated,‚Äù he said, adding that the government will convey the reassessment to ‚Äúthose responsible for protecting the borders‚Äù.</p>
<p>The KP CM claimed that soldiers who sacrificed their lives were ‚Äúnot rewarded properly due to wrong policies‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe have repeatedly said to review these policies.‚Äù</p>

<p>Meanwhile, PTI MPA Anwar Zeb Khan said protesters were gathering at Bajaur‚Äôs Umary Chowk to demonstrate against the ‚Äúunannounced operation‚Äù.</p>
<p>Pictures shared by him of the purported protest showed hundreds of men gathered on a street.</p>

<p>The gathering follows yesterday‚Äôs protest by residents of War Mamund tehsil against the operation, where they demanded that authorities ensure the safety of civilians during the operation.</p>
<p>Besides Zeb, MPAs Dr Hamidur Rehman and Mohammad Nisar Khan; former MNA Gul Zafar Khan; and MNA Mubarakzeb Khan, the prime minister‚Äôs special assistant on tribal districts, have condemned the operation and the curfew in the area.</p>
<p>Former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan also expressed concerns over the operation‚Äôs launch and urged authorities to stop it immediately.</p>

<p>The Awami National Party also condemned the military action, with party chief Senator Aimal Wali Khan and provincial president Mian Iftikhar Hussain questioning its legality.

<p>The chief minister also presided over a separate meeting to review the law and order situation in the wake of the Bajaur operation.</p>
<p>CM Gandapur was briefed on the situation by the relevant officials, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KPChiefMinister/status/1950272557401456763" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from his office.

<p>Compensation of Rs2.5m was also announced for those injured during the ‚Äúincident‚Äù.</p>
<p>The KP chief secretary and Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed were among various officials present during the meeting.</p>

<p>The reported incident comes just days after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927004">seven protesters</a> were shot dead and 16 others were injured in Khyber district‚Äôs Tirah Valley.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had condemned the ‚Äúfiring on peaceful citizens by <em>khawarij</em>‚Äù ‚Äî a term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). However, according to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927004#:~:text=Security%20personnel%20guar%C2%ADding%20the%20installation%20reportedly%20opened%20fire%20to%20control%20the%20crowd%2C%20according%20to%20sources.">sources</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926949#:~:text=some%20of%20the%20protesters%20alleged%20that%20the%20forces%20at%20the%20gates%20fired%20at%20them">protesters</a>, security personnel guar¬≠ding the installation reportedly had opened fire to control the crowd.</p>
