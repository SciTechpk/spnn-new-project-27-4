            <p><p>Security forces have eliminated another three terrorists attempting to infiltrate via the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Balochistan’s Zhob district, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The military’s anti-infiltration <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929546/security-forces-kill-33-terrorists-in-balochistans-zhob-district-ispr">operation</a>, which began on the night of August 7, has so far killed 50 terrorists.</p>
<p>“On night [of] 10/11 August 2025, a deliberate sanitisation operation was conducted in surrounding areas of Sambaza along [the] Pakistan-Afghanistan border,” the Inter-Services Public Relations said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7388" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>“During the conduct of the operation, three more Indian sponsored <em>khawarij</em> were hunted down and successfully neutralised. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed <em>khawarij</em>,” the ISPR added.</p>

<p>“The security forces remain committed to secure the nation’s frontiers and thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Pakistan,” the military reaffirmed.</p>
<p>Just a day ago, the US State Department <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930224/us-state-department-designates-bla-majeed-brigade-as-foreign-terrorist-organisations">designated</a> the banned so-called Balo­chistan Liberation Army (BLA) and its combat wing, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349">Majeed Brig­ade</a>, as a Foreign Terr­­orist Organisation.</p>
<p>The US said the move, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925093/pakistan-seeks-listing-of-majeed-brigade-as-terror-group">long-desired</a> by Pakistan, demonstrated its commitment to countering terrorism, while <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1930323/us-designates-bla-as-foreign-terrorist-outfit#:~:text=cooperation%20and%20international%20coordination">signalling</a> strengthened cooperation and international coordination in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">broke</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>The country <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">ranked second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930287/us-tariff-on-indian-rice-opens-market-for-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>US tariff on Indian rice opens market for Pakistan</strong></a>
            <p><p>WASHINGTON: The 50 per cent tariff <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929231">imposed</a> by the Trump administration on Indian goods, including basmati rice, has reshaped trade flows in the United States, providing Pakistan an opportunity to expand its share in the American aromatic rice market.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s basmati rice exports have witnessed steady growth in recent years. According to the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan (REAP), the country exported approximately 772,725 tonnes of basmati rice in FY24, generating $876.9m — up from 595,120 tonnes worth $650.4m in the previous fiscal year. The average export price per tonne also increased from $1,092.93 to $1,134.86.</p>
<p>Data from Volza’s Global Trade platform shows that between November 2023 and October 2024, the United States accounted for 24pc of Pakistan’s total basmati exports through 1,519 shipments. Italy and the United Kingdom followed with shares of 14pc (908 shipments) and 11pc (716 shipments), respectively.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Together, these three markets consumed nearly 49pc of Pakistan’s basmati rice exports. Pakistan currently exports basmati rice to over 110 countries, with other key destinations including Australia, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Canada, the Netherlands, and Germany.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Basmati exports rose 35pc in FY24 to 772,725 tonnes, earning $876.9m</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), rice imports in the US have grown steadily over the past three decades — from 7pc of the domestic market in 1993/94 to over 25pc by 2022/23. Over 60pc of these imports consist of aromatic varieties from Asia, mainly jasmine from Thailand and basmati from India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>While the US produces some aromatic rice domestically, these differ in quality and aroma from their Asian counterparts. The USDA projects continued growth in demand for aromatic rice imports in the coming years.</p>
<p>The tariff dispute emerged from US punitive measures targeting India’s trade and energy ties with Russia, resulting in broad tariffs on several Indian exports, including basmati rice, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. Although some sectors later received exemptions, basmati rice remained subject to the full 50pc tariff. In contrast, Pakistani basmati rice continues to face a lower <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927992">tariff</a> of 19pc, giving it a distinct pricing advantage in the US market.</p>
<p>Indian media reports suggest that the tariff hike could reduce India’s basmati exports to the US by 50-80pc, with prices climbing to nearly $1,800 per metric tonne. Pakistani basmati, by comparison, remains priced at around $1,450 per metric tonne, making it more competitive for US importers and retailers.</p>
<p>Retailers across the US are already reporting increased interest in Pakistani basmati rice. Khan Mohammed, a salesman at Super Halal grocery in Springfield, Virginia, noted: “Pakistani rice is already popular.</p>

            <p><p>KARACHI: A judicial magistrate was on Monday informed that a dumper driver booked and arrested for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929946">killing</a> two siblings in an accident on Rashid Minhas Road a day before did not possess a heavy transport vehicle (HTV) licence.</p>
<p>The investigating officer of the case brought the suspect before Judicial Magistrate (Central) Farman Ali Tager and sought his custody for 14 days for interrogation.</p>
<p>He informed the court that as per initial inquiry the suspect did not possess a licence to drive a heavy vehicle. He said he only had the licence to drive light transport vehicles (LTV) and that too had expired in 2016.</p>
<p>The IO asked for more time to get information regarding the owner of the dumper — involved in the accident — as well as need to verify the documents of the suspect.</p>
<p>After hearing the IO, the court remanded him in police custody for two days and directed him to submit a progress report at the next hearing.</p>
<p><strong>Body formed to probe arson attacks</strong></p>
<p>A high-powered committee was formed to investigate arson attacks, where miscreants torched seven dumpers after the fatal accident.</p>
<p>According to an order issued by Karachi police chief Javed Alam Odho, DIG-West Irfan Ali Baloch will head the team comprising Central SSP Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi, West SSP Tariq Illahi Mastoi and Investigation SSP Anam Tajjamul.</p>
