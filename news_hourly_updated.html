                <h2>Political parties vow joint front in case of Indian offensive</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: All mainstream political parties, except PTI, on Sunday vowed that Pakistan would give a robust response to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907663">India</a> if it resorted to any ‚Äòmisadventure‚Äô against the backdrop of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam incident</a>, in which 26 civilians were gunned down.</p>
<p>The political leaders made this pledge during an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908387/dg-ispr-says-armed-forces-ready-to-give-befitting-reply-to-enemys-aggression-state-media">in-camera briefing</a> by the civil and military leadership on Sunday, in which the army spokesperson apprised the mainstream political parties about the latest situation in the region and the preparedness of the country‚Äôs armed forces to avert any misadventure by the neighbouring country.</p>
<p>The in-camera briefing was given by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar. However, the main opposition party, PTI, did not attend the huddle.</p>
<p>A source privy to the huddle proceedings told <em>Dawn</em> that the political parties were of the view that they stood by the armed forces to foil any attempt by India to spoil regional peace. Before the briefing, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the main objective of the huddle was to get feedback from the political forces in light of tensions with India.</p>

<p>Participants told India wanted to divert water, intensify Kashmir oppression using Pahalgam</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another source told <em>Dawn</em> that the participants were briefed about how India ‚Äúprepared and implemented its false flag operation‚Äù in Pahalgam. The meeting was informed that India could not sell its narrative to the world and that Pakistan‚Äôs stance had emerged stronger in the aftermath of the attack. The participants were also apprised of the preparedness of the armed forces to foil any kind of misadventure by India.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Senator Muhammad Abdul Qadir, who attended the briefing, said that the meeting was informed about how and why India conducted the attack in Pahalgam. Senator Qadir said, as per information shared with the political leaders, the primary objective of the operation was to further divert Indus water, intensify aggression in held Kashmir, and camouflage Indian terrorism with the help of the Afghan Taliban.</p>
<p>With the help of video clips, the participants were given a briefing about Indian involvement in terrorism in Pakistan, especially Balochistan, he added.</p>
<p>PPP leaders Raja Pervez Ashraf, Qamar Zaman Kaira, and Shazia Marri; PML-N‚Äôs Barrister Aqeel and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Tallal Chaudhry; PM‚Äôs aide Pervez Khattak; MQM-P‚Äôs Farooq Sattar; and Kashmiri leader Shah Ghulam Qadir, among others, were in attendance.</p>
<p>Tension between the two nuclear states escalated soon after the Pahalgam attack in which 26 tourists were killed on April 22.</p>
<p>Soon after the attack, India blamed Pakistan for being involved in the attack. On the other hand, Pakistan termed the attack a false flag operation by India and called for a neutral probe.</p>

                <h2>India bans X accounts of Imran, Bilawal</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: India has blocked access to X accounts of former prime minister Imran Khan and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari amid <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908387/dg-ispr-says-armed-forces-ready-to-give-befitting-reply-to-enemys-aggression-state-media">rising tensions</a> between the two countries, Indian media reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>Users accessing both accounts in India see a mes¬≠sage stating the acco¬≠unts were withheld ‚Äúin response to a legal demand‚Äù.</p>
<p>PPP condemned India‚Äôs move to block the account of the party chairman. In a statement on Sunday, a PPP spokesperson said India‚Äôs action was a retaliation for Mr Bhutto-Zar¬≠dari‚Äôs ‚Äúunequivocal and bold stance on the Pahalgam incident‚Äù which he had presented before the international community.</p>
<p>The press release issued by the Bilawal House media cell said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was afraid of Mr Bhutto-Zardari. ‚ÄúIt also proves that India is an undemocratic country and its prime minister is an extremely cowardly person,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>Mr Bhutto-Zardari‚Äôs narrative on the Pahalgam attack ‚Äúunsettled the Indian prime minister‚Äù, the PPP spokesperson said, adding that it was Mr Bhutto-Zardari who first exposed the ‚ÄúButcher of Gujarat‚Äù before the world, and he would continue to hold up a mirror to Mr Modi‚Äôs war-mongering mindset.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> on April 22, the Indian government has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907281">blocked</a> a number of social media accounts belonging to the Pakistan government, news channels, content creators, film stars, sportspersons  and journalists. The accounts were blocked on YouTube, X and Instagram.</p>
<p>X, formerly Twitter, has been banned in Pakistan since February 2024.</p>
