                <h2>1 survivor, over 200 killed as Air India plane crashes after take-off in Ahmedabad</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>One person survived as over 200 people were killed when an Air India plane bound for London with 242 people on board crashed minutes after taking off from the western city of Ahmedabad on Thursday, authorities said, in the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.</p>
<p>The plane came down in a residential area, crashing onto a medical college hostel outside the airport during lunch hour. It was headed for Gatwick Airport, south of the British capital.</p>
<p>City police chief GS Malik told <em>Reuters</em> that 204 bodies had been recovered from the crash site. There were no reports of survivors being found, and the <em>Indian Express</em> newspaper <a class="link--external" href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ahmedabad-plane-crash-live-updates-air-india-flight-boeing-london-passengers-death-casualties-rescue-2739697-2025-06-12" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> all 242 on board had perished, citing police.</p>
<p>The majority of the people on board are feared dead, a top official in the Directorate General of Civil Aviation <a class="link--external" href="https://theprint.in/india/ahmedabad-air-india-plane-crash-many-feared-dead-bodies-being-retrieved/2655314/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>The Print</em>. Malik similarly <a class="link--external" href="https://apnews.com/live/air-india-plane-crash-ai171-ahmedabad-london#00000197-63f5-d617-a597-7ffdd4f60000" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the same to the <em>Associated Press</em>, saying: “It appears there are no survivors.”</p>
<p>He later <a class="link--external" href="https://aninews.in/news/national/general-news/one-survivor-found-in-air-india-plane-crash-ahmedabad-police20250612193315/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> Indian news agency <em>ANI</em> that there was one survivor who was under treatment.</p>
<p>Malik said the bodies recovered could include both passengers and people killed on the ground.
Relatives had been asked to give DNA samples to identify the dead, state health secretary Dhananjay Dwivedi said.</p>
<p>“The building on which it has crashed is a doctors’ hostel … we have cleared almost 70 per cent to 80pc of the area and will clear the rest soon,” a senior police officer told reporters.</p>
<p>Air India said the Boeing 787-8 aircraft was carrying 242 passengers and crew members, adding that the injured were being taken to the nearest hospitals.</p>

<p>The fatal crash tarnishes the Dreamliner jet’s safety record and could muddy Boeing’s efforts to rebuild trust related to safety and ramp up production under new Chief Executive Officer Kelly Orthberg.</p>
<p>Shares of Spirit AeroSystems, a key supplier, and GE Aerospace, which makes engines for the jet, also fell about 4pc each.</p>
<p>Boeing’s shares were down about 8pc at $196.75 in premarket trading.</p>
<p>“It’s a knee-jerk reaction [to the incident] and there’s revised fears of the problems that plagued Boeing aircraft and Boeing itself in recent years,” said Chris Beauchamp, analyst at IG Group.</p>

                <h2>PM Shehbaz discusses regional peace, bilateral ties with UAE leadership</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday met with the United Arab Emirates leadership to discuss regional peace and stability and explore ways to deepen bilateral ties during his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916522/pm-shehbaz-set-to-embark-on-uae-visit-discuss-global-issues-fo">official day-long visit</a> to the emirates.</p>
<p>Over the last few months, UAE has expressed commitment to strengthening its long-standing partnership with Pakistan and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1883758">announced</a> a $2 billion debt rollover soon after.  In April, the two nations <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905670">signed</a> and exchanged multiple memoranda of understanding (MoU) to further strengthen the bonds between the people of both nations.</p>
<p>The premier arrived in Abu Dhabi earlier today, where he was welcomed by the UAE’s National Security Adviser, Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, <em>The Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-shehbaz-in-abu-dhabi-on-daylong-uae-visit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>During a high-level meeting with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, PM Shehbaz discussed bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual interest and reaffirmed commitment to further enhance cooperation in key areas, state media <em>PTV</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvnews/urdunewsdetail/8043" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>“Both leaders expressed satisfaction over the positive trend of bilateral relations and the ongoing progress at all levels,” it added.</p>
<p>They agreed to maintain close communication and continue working together to advance the shared goals of regional peace and prosperity, the report said.</p>
<p>It added, “PM [Shehbaz] reiterated the invitation to the President of the UAE to visit Pakistan soon.”</p>
<p>The premier’s delegation included Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, and Special Assistant to the PM Tariq Fatemi.</p>
<p>In a statement <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/CMShehbaz/status/1933192236327469206" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on X, PM Shehbaz said that he was “delighted” to meet with Al-Nahyan, thanking him for the UAE’s “vital role in easing recent tensions” with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911260">India</a>.</p>
<p>“We reaffirmed our shared commitment to peace, stability, and prosperity in the region,” he said. “Our deep-rooted ties built on trust and brotherhood, continue to grow stronger, especially in trade and investment. “I look forward to welcoming His Highness to Pakistan soon.”</p>

<p>The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the Middle East and a major source of remittances, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.</p></p>
