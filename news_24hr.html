            <p><p>At least six people were killed and 12 others were injured when a bus overturned and fell into a ditch near Makli in Sindh’s Thatta district on Sunday morning, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>According to the Edhi rescue service, the bus overturned near the Thatta Bypass, following which a rescue team reached the site of the incident and transported the injured to a hospital.</p>
<p>“The bodies of the six victims were initially taken to a mortuary in Orangi Town,” the service said in a statement, adding that they were later transported to Edhi’s morgue in Karachi’s Sohrab Goth.</p>
<p>The bus was carrying a group of picnickers from Karachi to Keenjhar Lake when it overturned while taking a sharp turn, killing six passengers and injuring dozens others, state-owned <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>“Local authorities and rescue teams were quick to respond, reaching the crash site within minutes. The injured were rushed to Karachi hospitals, with several reported to be in critical condition,” it said.</p>
<p>In another incident, at least one person was killed and several others, including women and children, were critically injured when a passenger bus overturned on the Gambat National Highway in Sindh’s Khairpur district.</p>
<p>According to <em>APP</em>, the incident took place while the bus was en route from Karachi to Swabi. Rescue teams, along with local police, reached the incident site and rushed the injured to nearby hospitals for medical aid.</p>

<p>Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah expressed deep sorrow over the loss of lives in the bus accidents, according to a statement issued by his spokesperson Abdul Rashid Channa.</p>
<p>Expressing sympathy with the Makli incident victims, he issued directives to the Thatta deputy commissioner (DC) to ensure the provision of immediate medical assistance to the injured. The chief minister further told him to immediately contact their families and fully cooperate.</p>
<p>Expressing sorrow over the Khairpur coach accident, CM Murad issued similar instructions to the Khairpur DC to ensure medical treatment of the wounded. He urged people to drive carefully to protect precious lives.</p>
<p>Accidents are common on highways and motorways across Pakistan, caused by reckless driving, speeding, driver fatigue, and poor vehicle maintenance. Poor road conditions contribute to mishaps, while weak enforcement of traffic laws allows violations to go unchecked, worsening the situation.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, four people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924364">lost</a> their lives and another six were injured — all from the same family — after their speeding car crashed into a wall next to a drain on Hawkes’ Bay Road in Karachi’s Mauripur area.</p>
<p>South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said the family was returning from the Hawke’s Bay beach, and the accident most likely happened as a result of speeding.</p>
<p>In an incident on July 15, a collision between a trailer and a truck left one dead and three injured near Karachi’s New Sabzi Mandi on the Super Highway.</p>
<p>On June 19, a speeding dumper truck overturned on a 4x4 vehicle on Rashid Minhas Road, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918288">killing</a> a woman and an accompanying five-year-old girl.</p>
<p>On June 11, a young man was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916541">killed</a> and his wife injured in an accident after an unknown vehicle hit their bike on the Super Highway. The same day, two boys were killed after a water tanker hit them near Abdullah College in North Nazimabad.</p></p>

            <p><p>A Federal Constabulary soldier was killed when unidentified gunmen opened fire at a forest checkpoint along the Karakoram Highway in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer district, police said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Diamer Farrukh Rasheed said in a statement, “The deceased has been identified as Muhammad Gul Sher from Dera Ismail Khan.</p>
<p>“The motive behind the attack is not yet known, and the police are investigating the case. The suspects fled with the gun of the deceased.”</p>
<p>Senior Superintendent of Police Abdul Hameed told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “Unknown assailants opened fire at the checkpoint while the deceased was on duty and his colleagues were asleep.”</p>
<p>He added that police teams were raiding nearby areas to look for the suspects. In his statement, he speculated that the case appeared to be related to terrorism, ruling out personal enmity or a timber smuggling attempt.</p>
<p>The forest checkpoint was situated at the Thore Road, primarily to inspect vehicles for wood smuggling via the road, which connects the KKH with forest areas in the district.</p>
<p>GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan condemned the attack, saying, “Firing by terrorists on state personnel is an unacceptable act.”</p>
<p>According to a statement, he directed the police to bring the perpetrators to justice and sought a report on the incident from the home department.</p>
<p>GB government spokesman Faizullah Faraq said in a separate statement that funeral prayers for the martyred soldier were offered at the Police Lines in Chilas, and preparations were underway to send the body to his hometown.</p>
<p>In 2023, at least nine people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1794671/nine-killed-as-bus-comes-under-gun-attack-in-chilas">lost</a> their lives and 21 passengers received injuries after an Islamabad-bound bus came under fire in a terrorist attack near Chilas in Diamer district of Gilgit-Baltistan.</p></p>

            <p><p>Iran has replaced air defences damaged during last month’s conflict with Israel, Iran’s <em><a class="link--external" href="https://defapress.ir/en/news/86455/damaged-air-defense-systems-were-replaced" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Defah Press</a></em> news agency reported on Sunday quoting the regular army’s deputy for operations, Rear Admiral Mahmoud Mousavi.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">conflict</a> in June, Israel’s air force dominated Iran’s airspace and dealt a heavy blow to the country’s air defences while Iranian armed forces launched successive barrages of missiles and drones on Israeli territory, <a class="link--external" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/07/05/iran-struck-five-israeli-military-bases-12-day-war/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">successfully hitting</a> strategic targets.</p>
<p>“The Zionist enemy sought to destroy Iran’s defence capabilities, and some of our defence systems were damaged in this war; But with the efforts of my comrades, the damaged systems were replaced and deployed in predetermined locations,” Mousavi said.</p>
<p>Admiral Mousavi added that Israel was not able to achieve its objectives and that the United States and NATO helped Tel-Aviv in the war.</p>
<p>Prior to the war, Iran had its own domestically-made long-range air defence system Bavar-373 in addition to the Russian-made S-300 system. The report by <em>Defah Press</em> did not mention any import of foreign-made air defence systems to Iran in past weeks.</p>
<p>Following limited Israeli <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916920#:~:text=Hezbollah%20is%20alive%E2%80%9D.-,October%202024,-Tensions%20between%20the">strikes</a> against Iranian missile factories last October, Iran later displayed Russian-made air defences in a military exercise to show it recovered from the attack.</p>

<p>Iran, Britain, France and Germany could hold talks next week on Tehran’s nuclear programme, Iran’s semi-official <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/07/20/3358281/iran-eu3-agree-to-resume-talks-exclusive" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tasnim</a></em> news agency reported, following warnings by the three European countries that failure to resume negotiations would lead to international sanctions being reimposed on Iran.</p>
<p>“The principle of talks has been agreed upon, but consultations are continuing on the time and place of the talks. The country in which the talks could be held next week has not been finalised,” <em>Tasnim</em> reported, quoting a source informed on the matter.</p>
<p>The report on possible talks comes a few days after the foreign ministers of the so-called E3 nations, as well as the European Union’s foreign policy chief, held their first call with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi since Israel and the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">attacked</a> Iranian nuclear facilities a month ago.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The three European countries, along with China and Russia, are the remaining parties to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1212928">2015 nuclear deal</a> reached with Iran — from which the United States withdrew in 2018 —that lifted sanctions on the Middle Eastern country in return for restrictions on its nuclear programme.</p>
<p>The E3 have said they would restore UN sanctions on Tehran via the so-called “snapback mechanism” by the end of August if nuclear talks that were ongoing between Iran and the US before the Israel-Iran air war do not resume or fail to produce concrete results.</p>
<p>“If EU/E3 want to have a role, they should act responsibly, and put aside the worn-out policies of threat and pressure, including the ‘snap-back’ for which they lack absolutely [any] moral and legal ground,” Araqchi said earlier this week.</p>
<p>The snapback mechanism can be used to restore UN sanctions before the UN Security Council resolution enshrining the deal expires on October 18.</p>
<p>Prior to the Israel-Iran war, Tehran and Washington held <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">five rounds</a> of nuclear talks mediated by Oman but faced major stumbling blocks such as uranium enrichment in Iran, which Western powers want to bring down to zero to minimise any risk of weaponisation.</p>
<p>Tehran maintains its nuclear programme is solely meant for civilian purposes.</p></p>

It is not clear to the aides whether the destruction has already been carried out, but said they had been told that it was set to occur by the end of July.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/18/trump-administration-destroy-contraceptives-usaid-africa">Continue reading...</a></p>
