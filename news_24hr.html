            <p><p><strong>• Following meeting of top Indian leaders, media from across the border has been speculating about possible change in disputed region’s status<br />
• Foreign minister says internationally recognised dispute can’t be settled through amendments to local laws</strong></p>
<p>KARACHI: Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has expressed the apprehension that India is likely to make occupied Jammu a separate state, adding that any such move would be in violation of international conventions and UN Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p>He expressed the fear while addressing a rally at Islamabad’s D-Chowk on Tuesday, held to mark six years since India unilaterally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1498227">changed</a> the special status of occupied Kashmir and bifurcated the region into the union territories of Jammu and Kash­mir, and Ladakh.</p>
<p>The move allowed the BJP government in New Delhi to control the disputed region through its lieutenant governor.</p>
<p>In recent days, the Indian media has been reporting a plan by the BJP government to give the occupied region of Jammu the status of a state.</p>
<p><em>The Hindustan Times</em> reported that a meeting of top Indian government functionaries, including the president, prime minister and home minister, took place recently, leading to speculation about an impending move on the region’s statehood.</p>
<p>The paper quoted a senior BJP leader as saying that statehood for Jammu and Kashmir was “a promise that the government has already made… and it will be done when the time is right”.</p>
<p>However, he refused to comment on speculation that a decision will be taken in the next few days.</p>
<p>Amid the speculation, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said in a post on X: “I’ve heard every possible permutation &amp; combination about what to expect in J&amp;K tomorrow so let me stick my neck out and say nothing will happen tomorrow — fortunately nothing bad will happen but unfortunately nothing positive will happen either.”</p>

<p>Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated into two union territories after the Indian parliament, on August 5, 2019, passed the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill and abrogated Articles 370 and 35 (A) that gave special powers to the region.</p>
<p><strong>‘Subservient govt’</strong></p>
<p>In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr Dar said that New Delhi may take another rash step in the next few hours, or days. He called the Aug 5, 2019, measures India’s attempt to “usurp Kashmir”.</p>
<p>“India revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and took it under the direct control of New Delhi,” he said, adding that the move was further <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1796946">consolidated</a> by the Supreme Court’s decision in 2023, which gave “stamp of approval” to the con­troversial decision. Mr Dar said Jammu and Kashmir was an internationally recognised dispute and it can’t be settled through amendments in local laws.</p>
<p>In the last six years, he said, the BJP government had amended local laws governing Kashmir; the powers of the lieutenant governor have been increased and the delimitation of the region’s legislative assembly changed to “influence the representation of Muslims in Kashmir”.</p>
<p>He said non-Kashmiris have been allowed to obtain domicile, purchase properties and become part of the voter list.</p>
<p>“All these steps were taken to make Kashmir a separate state and form a government in Srinagar which is subservient to New Delhi.” “This is unacceptable to Pakistan and its people,” the foreign minister warned.</p>

            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday dismissed petitions filed against the planned <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913654">auction</a> of five Bahria Town properties in Rawalpindi and one in Islamabad, enabling the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to proceed with the sale, scheduled for Aug 7.</p>
<p>Shortly after the issuance of a short order by the division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Asif, NAB Rawalpindi announced fresh auction of six properties of Bahria Town at NAB office in Islamabad’s Sector G-6/1.</p>
<p>The properties are being auctioned after Malik Riaz was declared an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1803717">absconder</a> in the £190 million Al-Qadir Trust case.</p>
<p>Reacting to the development, Bahria Town Chairman Malik Riaz Hussain said they were willing to participate in any arbitration and implement its decision, if they are granted a chance to “return to serious dialogue and a dignified solution”.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MalikRiaz_/status/1952732889071673567" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on his official X account, he claimed government agencies had been exerting unprecedented pressure over the past few months, which included the arrest of dozens of staff members, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918907/nab-freezes-457-properties-over-btk-land-scam">freezing</a> of the company’s bank accounts, seizure of vehicles and other stringent measures, which had paralysed all of the Bahria Town’s operations across the country.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">

<p>“The situation has reached a point where we are being forced to completely shut down all Bahria Town activities across Pakistan,” said the statement attributed to Malik Riaz.</p>
<p>“Trillions of rupees of investment by millions of Pakistanis in Bahria Town from Karachi to Lahore and Islamabad have been frozen,” he claimed.</p>

<p><strong>Court proceedings</strong></p>
<p>Representing Bahria Town in court, senior lawyer Farooq H. Naik earlier argued that NAB’s auction notice was “illegal, deceptive, and issued with mala fide intent”.</p>
<p>He said the properties were being wrongfully targeted as Bahria Town was not a party to a plea bargain agreement. He said Bahria Town was also not named as an accused in any reference related to the £190 million case. He warned that the auction would set a dangerous precedent, undermining due process and investor confidence.</p>
<p>However, NAB prosecutor Rafay Maqsood contended that Bahria Town’s chairman and his son Ali Riaz defaulted on payments after entering into a plea bargain under the £190 million settlement. As a result, NAB initiated steps to recover the outstanding amount under Section 33E of the NAB Ordinance, 1999, by auctioning the pledged properties.</p>
<p>Mr Maqsood said the petitioners approached the IHC after a trial court had dismissed a similar plea. He said the high court had initially stayed the auction on June 12, the same day when the sale was scheduled. Subsequently, NAB filed an application to vacate the stay against the auction.</p>
<p>Bahria Town’s legal team had consistently argued that the company was not involved in the £190 million corruption case, which originated from a 2019 settlement between the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) and Malik Riaz.</p>
<p>With the verdict now issued, the auction will go ahead as planned on Aug 7.</p>
<p><strong>Auction tomorrow</strong></p>
<p>After the vacation of the stay order issued by the IHC against the auction in June, the NAB announced the auction of the six properties on Thursday.</p>
<p>According to the anti-graft watchdog, successful bidders would have to pay 5pc of the value of the properties on the auction day, 10pc in a month and remaining 85pc in three months.</p>
<p>In a notification issued on Tuesday, NAB listed the six properties including corporate offices on Plots 7-D (having estimated value of Rs871m) and 7-E (estimated value of Rs881m) in Bahria Town’s Phase-II, Rawalpindi; Rubaish Marquee and Lawn in Islamabad (Rs488m), Arena Cinema (Rs1.1bn), Bahria Town International Academy (Rs1.07bn) and Safari Club (Rs1.2bn), in Bahria Town, Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>The accountability watchdog also filed a reference against Malik Riaz, some Sindh politicians and others in February over the transfer of land to Bahria Town.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928963/main-opposition-leaders-booted-from-parliament' target='_blank'><strong>Main opposition leaders ‘booted’ from parliament</strong></a>
            <p><p>• ECP disqualifies nine lawmakers, including leaders of opposition in Senate and NA, after May 9 convictions<br />
• Barrister Ali Zafar slams ‘disqualification spree’, says decision ignores ‘final judicial determination’<br />
• Commission reverses Muzaffargarh by-poll order after LHC ruling</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Following their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">conviction</a> by an anti-terrorism court in May 9 cases, the Election Commission of Pakistan on Tuesday disqualified nine lawmakers, including opposition leaders in the National Assembly and the Senate.</p>
<p>This latest move, described by a PTI leader as a ‘disqualification spree’ by the commission, takes the number of lawmakers ousted in less than two weeks to over a dozen.</p>
<p>Those sent home on Tuesday included NA Opposition Leader Omar Ayub, Senate Opposition leader Shibli Faraz, MNAs Zartaj Gul, Rai Haider Ali Khan, and Rai Hassan Nawaz Khan. Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza — a key PTI ally — was also disqualified, besides three Punjab MPAs Muhammad Ansar Iqbal, Junaid Afzal Sahi, and Rai Muhammad Murtaza Iqbal.</p>
<p>One-third of the nine lawmakers disqua­lified by the ECP hail from Faisalabad.</p>
<p>A notification issued by the commission confirmed their disqualification and declared their seats vacant, on which by-elections will likely be held.</p>
<p>Last week, an anti-terrorism court in Faisalabad sentenced 108 individuals to 10 years of imprisonment for their involvement in the May 9 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1752003">riots</a> sparked by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">arrest</a> of Imran Khan in a corruption case.</p>
<p>On the other hand, PTI parliamentary leader in the Senate Barrister Syed Ali Zafar slammed what he called a ‘disqualification spree’ and said the recent wave of “illegal moves” targeting specific PTI lawmakers was without any procedural consistency or final judicial determination.</p>
<p>“This raises the spectre of selective accountability and institutional overreach by the ECP, whose constitutional role is to be an impartial arbiter in electoral matters — not a substitute trial or appellate court,” he said, claiming such actions were “politically motivated and legally unsustainable”.</p>
<p>He was of the opinion that the ECP had violated due process and fair trial guaranteed under Article 10A of the Constitution. According to Senator Zafar, disqualification under Article 63(1)(h) takes place if a person has been convicted of an offence involving moral turpitude and sentenced to more than two years, unless a period of five years has elapsed since release.</p>
<p>“Clearly, the conviction must be final and not sub judice. A mere trial court conviction does not attain finality if an appeal is pending before a higher court,” he said. He recalled that the Supreme Court in the Mohammad Nawaz Sharif v. ECP case (2018) held that disqualification under Article 63(1)(h) required that the conviction must have attained finality.</p>
<p>“Unless a conviction is upheld by the highest appellate forum, the ECP cannot assume the disqualification has materialised. In addition, Article 10A guarantees fair trial — the essential ingredient of which is that a person retains the presumption of innocence until all remedies are exhausted.”</p>
<p>If the ECP begins to disqualify persons based on non-final convictions or FIRs/investigations, it amounts to pre-judging guilt, which is unconstitutional, he said, adding that the election watchdog had no original jurisdiction to determine disqualification. He said the ECP was an administrative/quasi-judicial body under Article 218(3) and relevant statutes and could act only after a final conviction or declaration was passed by a competent court.</p>
<p>Barrister Zafar said the “use of ECP to target politicians before their legal process was complete undermines the democratic order and judicial independence” and puts at risk public confidence in constitutional institutions.</p>
<p>According to the senator, “The legal framework, constitutional interpretation by the Supreme Court, and principles of natural justice all require that convictions must be final (i.e., all appeals decided) and disqualifications under Article 62(1)(f) must be based on a judicial declaration.”</p>
<p>It may be noted that before these nine lawmakers, Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Malik Ahmad Bhachar, MNA Abdul Latif from Chitral, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, and MNA Mohammad Ahmed Chattha had already been disqualified in the last week of July.</p>
<p>On July 15, Jamshed Dasti was also disqualified over “fake academic credentials”.</p>
<p>The commission had also announced a schedule for a by-election on the seat it had declared vacant following his disqualification, which it had to reverse on Tuesday in light of a Lahore High Court order.</p>
<p>“Pursuant to the order dated 30th July, 2025, passed by the Honourable Lahore High Court…the election programme for the conduct of by-election in NA-175 Muzaffargarh-l…is hereby suspended till further order of the Honourable Lahore High Court, Lahore in the above titled case,” a notification issued by the ECP read.</p>
