            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918382/coas-munir-stresses-potential-for-broader-multidimensional-ties-with-us-built-on-mutual-respect' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir stresses potential for ‘broader, multidimensional’ ties with US built on mutual respect</strong></a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir has stressed the “immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect” with the United States, the military’s media wing said on Friday.</p>
<p>COAS Munir is on a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917414">five-day</a> official visit to the US, where he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093/trump-coas-munir-talk-counterterrorism-and-trade-in-cordial-meeting-ispr">met with</a> President Donald Trump over luncheon, becoming the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044/army-chief-joins-trump-for-historic-white-house-lunch">first</a> serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. National Security Advisor Lt Gen <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907660/in-a-first-isi-chief-made-national-security-adviser">Muhammad Asim Malik</a> — also the intelligence chief — has accompanied Gen Munir.</p>
<p>COAS Munir held an interaction in Washington DC with prominent US think tanks and representatives of the strategic affairs institutions, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7326" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>Senior scholars, analysts, policy experts and representatives of leading international media outlets were also part of the “comprehensive and candid exchange”, ISPR added.</p>
<p>The army chief “underscored the immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect, shared strategic interests, and economic interdependence”, the statement said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Evaluating the Pakistan-US partnership, Gen Munir underlined the “historical convergences between the two nations, particularly in areas such as counterterrorism, regional security and economic development”.</p>
<p>In his remarks, the army chief also highlighted Pakistan’s “unwavering commitment to regional peace and stability, and its constructive role in fostering a rules-based international order”.</p>
<p>The army chief also noted the “malign influence of certain regional actors in sponsoring and perpetuating terrorism as a tool of hybrid warfare”, the statement added.</p>
<p>He mentioned this as he alluded to the details and analysis of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566">Marka-i-Haq</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910729/operation-bunyanum-marsoos-11-soldiers-martyred-78-wounded-while-defending-pakistan">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a> during the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186">conflict</a> with India and “elaborated on Pakistan’s perspective on terrorism”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir emphasised that Pakistan had been on the “front lines of the global war against terrorism, having rendered immense sacrifices — both human and economic — in pursuit of a safer and more secure world”.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has repeatedly <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a> that Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911617#:~:text=which%20lost%2090%2C000%20lives%20and%20over%20%24150%20billion%20economic%20losses">lost</a> 90,000 valuable lives and incurred $150 billion worth of economic losses over the past few decades.</p>
<p>During the session, COAS Munir also invited international partners to explore collaborative opportunities in various sectors to “unlock shared prosperity”.</p>
<p>He highlighted Pakistan’s “remarkable untapped potential, particularly in the domains of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915901">information technology</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1871762">agriculture</a>, and its vast and underexploited reserves in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903248">mining</a> and mineral sectors”, echoing topics discussed in his meeting with Trump and previous Pak-US interactions.</p>
<p>The army chief also provided a detailed exposition of Pakistan’s “balanced approach to regional and global conflicts, advocating for dialogue, diplomacy, and adherence to international law”, the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He reaffirmed that Pakistan continues to play a “responsible and proactive role in mitigating regional tensions and promoting cooperative security frameworks”. The statement comes amid heightened tensions in the Middle East amid the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/israel-iran-conflict">Israel-Iran war</a> as the US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918216/how-trump-a-self-proclaimed-peacemaker-embraced-israels-campaign-against-iran">weighs</a> whether to intervene militarily or not.</p>
<p>Participants, the ISPR said, noted the “openness and clarity of the COAS’s perspectives and appreciated Pakistan’s consistent and principled policies”. “The interaction was marked by a spirit of mutual understanding and was widely regarded as a positive step toward enhancing strategic dialogue between Pakistan and the United States,” it added.</p>
<p>The interaction also provided an opportunity to articulate Pakistan’s principled stance on key regional and global issues, and to deepen understanding of Pakistan’s strategic outlook, the military’s media wing noted. It reflected the country’s “commitment to transparent diplomacy, international engagement, and the pursuit of peaceful coexistence through principled and proactive dialogue”.</p></p>

            <p><p>A suspect was arrested in yet another case of child pornography in Punjab’s Muzaffargarh, Police said on Friday.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915195">claimed</a> to have dismantled an international child exploitation network operating out of a so-called gaming club in Muzaffargarh, where children aged six to 10 were lured, abused and filmed for the sake of selling their videos on the dark web.</p>
<p>“Several children were sexually abused and filmed in Sardarabad village,” a police statement said today.</p>
<p>The matter came to light when one of the victims contacted the police. According to the statement, the suspect had been blackmailing the children using compromised videos.</p>
<p>A first information report (FIR) of the incident was lodged at Saddar police station in Muzaffargarh district under section 292 (sale, distribution, and public exhibition of obscene material) and section 355 (assault or criminal force with intent to dishonour a person) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p>
<p>According to the FIR, a boy was sexually abused and filmed by his older brother’s former employer when he went to collect his brother’s pending wages. The older brother had previously worked for the suspect as an animal caretaker.</p>
<p>The statement added that the Sadar police station has arrested the suspect, while the victims were being contacted for legal action.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, the punishment for sexually abusing a minor can range from seven years to life imprisonment, while rape of a child carries the death penalty or life term. Laws such as the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2016 and the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1540094">Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Act, 2020</a> were enacted to address <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1851068">rising</a> cases of abuse, strengthen penalties, and ensure timely action. Offences related to child pornography are punishable by up to 14 years in prison, along with hefty fines.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Despite existing laws, cases of child sexual abuse continue to surface across the country.</p>
<p>As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908682/over-3350-child-abuse-cases-reported-across-pakistan-in-2024-report">reported</a> from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the year 2024, according to the civil society report ’<a class="link--external" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BiZQB4r46gbIYR88plzov08iuLzJ606_/view" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cruel Numbers 2024’</a> by Sahil that was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.</p>
<p>These included reported cases of child sexual abuse, abduction, missing children, and child marriages. It shows that nine children were abused per day during the year. A gender-divide analysis indicates that out of the total reported cases, 1,791 (53 per cent) victims were girls and 1,573 (47pc) boys.</p>
<p>In April, Punjab police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903749">arrested</a> five suspects for their alleged involvement in the gang rape of a child in Muzaffargarh, according to an official statement.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918412/eu-bars-chinese-firms-from-major-state-medical-equipment-contracts' target='_blank'><strong>EU bars Chinese firms from major state medical equipment contracts</strong></a>
            <p><p>The European Union on Friday banned Chinese firms from government medical device purchases worth more than five million euros ($5.8 million) in retaliation for limits Beijing places on access to its own market.</p>
<p>The latest salvo in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879450">trade tensions</a> between the 27-nation bloc and China covers a wide range of healthcare supplies, from surgical masks to X-ray machines, that represent a market worth 150 billion euros in the EU.</p>
<p>“Our aim with these measures is to level the playing field for EU businesses,” the bloc’s trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said. “We remain committed to dialogue with China to resolve these issues.”</p>
<p>In response, China accused the EU of “double standards”.</p>
<p>“The EU has always boasted that it is the most open market in the world, but in reality, it has gradually moved towards protectionism”, foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said at a regular press briefing.</p>
<p>“Under the guise of fair competition (the EU) actually carries out unfair competition, which is a typical case of double standards.”</p>
<p>The European Commission said in a statement the move was in “response to China’s longstanding exclusion of EU-made medical devices from Chinese government contracts.”</p>
<p>Brussels said just under 90 per cent of public procurement contracts for medical devices in China “were subject to exclusionary and discriminatory measures” against EU firms.</p>
<p>In addition to barring Chinese firms from major state purchases, “inputs from China for successful bids” would also be limited to 50pc, it said.</p>
<p>Over the last three years, Brussels and Beijing have come into conflict in a number of economic sectors, including electric cars, the rail industry, solar panels and wind turbines.</p>
<p>The decision on medical devices comes at a time of heightened trade tensions with President Donald Trump’s United States, which has imposed customs surcharges on imports from all over the world, including Europe.</p>
<p>The EU has decided to take a tougher stance on trade in recent years, adopting a vast arsenal of legislation to better defend its businesses against unfair competition.</p>
<p>In April 2024, the commission opened an investigation into Chinese public contracts for medical devices, the first under a new mechanism introduced by the EU in 2022 to obtain better access to overseas state purchases.</p>
<p>China, on the other hand, accuses Europe of protectionism.</p>
<p>After a year of negotiations, the commission, which manages trade policy on behalf of the 27 member states, said it had failed to make any progress with China.</p>
<p>“The measure seeks to incentivise China to cease its discrimination against EU firms and EU-made medical devices and treat EU companies with the same openness as the EU does with Chinese companies and products,” Brussels said.</p></p>

Many Zambians have raised the issue of this looting for years, but have met coordinated resistance. Consequently, Zambia’s treasury loses billions of dollars in revenue. These losses are driven by well-known multinationals working in concert with certain insiders close&nbsp;to the Zambian state.</p><p>Your editorial also says: “The US decision to cut $50m a year in aid to Zambia … is dreadful, and the reason given, corruption, rings hollow.” Alas, I disagree and wish to place this in context.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/ordinary-zambians-lose-out-twice-to-global-looting-and-local-corruption">Continue reading...</a></p>
