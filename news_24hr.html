            <p><p>At least two more people died in a rain-related incident in Punjab on Saturday, taking the province’s death toll for the past four days to 14, according to rescue officials and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).</p>
<p>Monsoon rains across the region offer respite from the summer heat and are vital for agriculture and food security. Weather-related <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1497024">incidents</a> are common during the season, but experts say climate change is increasing their frequency and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1852031">severity</a>.</p>
<p>Two people died while four were wounded in a roof collapse incident reported at 3:20am in the Abbas Nagar area of Lahore’s Shahdara Town, Rescue 1122 said in a statement today.</p>
<p>It noted that the house was single-storied and the roof was made of mud. The bodies were taken to Shahdara Hospital, where some of the injured were also taken, while others wounded were brought to Mayo Hospital.</p>

<p>From Wednesday to Friday, 25 incidents were reported in various cities, which rose to 28 today, a statement by the PDMA spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Most of the cases involved wall and roof collapses due to torrential rains, accounting for nine out of 12 lives lost during the four-day period, according to the report.</p>
<p>In Kasur, two children died from a roof collapsing while another two lost their lives in a wall collapse incident. One child each died in roof collapse incidents in Okara, Bahawalnagar and Faisalabad.</p>
<p>In Wazirabad, a wall collapsing killed a man and a child, along with injuring a woman and another minor.</p>
<p>In Jhelum, the PDMA report said, two men “drowned in a rainwater nullah”. A recent report <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920476#:~:text=In%20Jhelum%2C%20two%20persons%20died%20after%20a%20loader%20rickshaw%20fell%20into%20a%20storm%20drain%20on%20an%20inundated%20road.">detailed</a> that a loader rickshaw fell into a storm drain on an inundated road.</p>
<p>The PDMA report also mentioned a lightning incident <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920476#:~:text=lightning%20strike%20while%20working%20in%20fields%20in%20Khanewal">in Khanewal</a> that took the life of a man.</p>

            <p><p>At least four people were injured in an attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district on Saturday, police said.</p>
<p>Reports of the scale and casualties of the incident are still being verified by <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>District Police Officer (DPO) Waqar Ahmed told <em>Dawn.com</em> that four civilians were injured in the “suicide attack” carried out through a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device.</p>
<p>The attack comes days after two soldiers were martyred and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919801/two-soldiers-martyred-11-terrorists-killed-in-south-waziristan-ibo-ispr">11 terrorists</a> were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in KP’s South Waziristan district.</p>

<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>The country ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>
