                <h2>PTI protests aim to destabilise country: Sanaullah</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister‚Äôs Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Monday criticised the PTI for seeking dialogue with the establishment instead of talking with politicians, suggesting the party only wanted to ‚Äúdestabilise the country with protests‚Äù.</p>
<p>His statement came as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, a day prior, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923918">called</a> on state institutions to engage in dialogue with the PTI but demanded that they hold themselves accountable. Gandapur and the PTI‚Äôs top leadership were on a visit to Lahore to formally launch a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923856/pti-brass-gathers-in-lahore-to-kick-start-aug-5-movement">movement</a> to seek the release of party founder Imran Khan and devise a strategy for its nationwide protest, which will reach its crescendo on August 5 ‚Äî marking two years since the ex-premier was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a>.</p>
<p>Since Imran‚Äôs incarceration in several cases, which he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1890696#:~:text=He%20claimed%20that%20four%20convictions%20against%20him%20were%20politically%20motivated">claims</a> are politically motivated, his party‚Äôs relationship with the government and the establishment has turned <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832432">sour</a>. The PTI has held several <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875003/day-of-clashes-in-islamabad-ends-in-pti-protesters-retreat">protests</a> over the last year, most of which escalated into <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1857709">violence</a> after facing state repression.</p>
<p>Sanaullah said that Gandapur‚Äôs words made it clear that the PTI wanted to ‚Äúdestabilise the country, right after Marka-i-Haq‚Äù (referring to the recent Pakistan-India escalation) and the government‚Äôs ‚Äúsuccess in economic revival, which lent Pakistan an opportunity for stability‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBesides this, it is unknown what other agenda they have,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Referring to the planned 90-day and August 5 protests, Sanaullah said, ‚ÄúIf they remain peaceful, then it‚Äôs fine (‚Ä¶) it is their democratic right. But if they take the law into their own hands and attempt to destabilise the country (‚Ä¶) then the law will take its due course.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that this destabilisation ‚Äúhas been their (PTI‚Äôs) agenda from the beginning‚Äù, referring to the party demonstrating outside the International Monetary Fund (IMF) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1821812">offices</a> against their granting of an emergency <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845536">loan</a> to Pakistan.</p>
<p>He dismissed the notion that the government, despite being relatively stable now, would consider being more generous in negotiations for Imran‚Äôs release, saying that ‚Äúit had nothing to do with generosity and that the case was proceeding according to the rules of the court.‚Äù</p>
<p>He pointed out how it was the PTI‚Äôs own stance in previous negotiations that Imran‚Äôs release would not be discussed, as the PTI founder himself expressed the desire to be acquitted on his own merit.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>According to Sanaullah, the government was ready to hold talks with the PTI on other issues, but he said that according to the party‚Äôs recent calls for negotiations, it ‚Äúdoes not want dialogue with the government, but with the establishment‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey are not willing to sit down with either political parties or politicians to solve issues,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey are still stuck on their own agenda, seeking the establishment‚Äôs help to put them back into power. They are not ready for political dialogue.‚Äù</p>
<p>Asked what counter-demands the government might hold in negotiations, he said, ‚ÄúWe have only one wish, one effort, one fight: the revival of Pakistan‚Äôs economy and its success, such that every citizen‚Äôs wellbeing is ensured and it is included on the map of the world as a welfare state.‚Äù</p>
<p>Sanaullah added that the government was ready to sit with the PTI and other parties for talks to ensure the stability required for this effort if they were willing to cooperate.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is in everybody‚Äôs mutual interest, the opposition and government‚Äôs, and everybody should agree on a ‚Äòcharter of economy‚Äô on certain basic matters,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are ready for any understanding or agreement in this regard.‚Äù</p>
<p>The previous day, on <em>Geo News‚Äô</em> programme ‚ÄúNaya Pakistan‚Äù, Sanaullah had questioned the PTI‚Äôs intention of holding negotiations alongside heavy protesting, saying, ‚ÄúIf they want to talk, then what is the need for the 90 days, the August 5 [protests] and the march towards Lahore?‚Äù</p>
<p>However, he stated that the PTI would be granted legal permission to protest by the local administration if they remained peaceful.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf they move towards violence, the law will take its course,‚Äù he added.</p></p>

            <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924133/cybercrime-agency-raids-illegal-call-centre-in-islamabad-arrests-five-foreign-nationals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <h2>Cybercrime agency raids illegal call centre in Islamabad, arrests five foreign nationals</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) conducted a successful raid last night on an illegal call centre in Islamabad and arrested five foreign nationals, according to a press release issued on Monday.</p>
<p>The NCCIA press release stated that more than 60 people were working at the call centre, of which five foreign nationals were arrested during the raid.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn addition to these arrests, the NCCIA will take further legal action against those who provided facilities and security to these individuals,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>A spokesperson reiterated the agency‚Äôs resolve to continue its operations against all such illegal activities that amount to a violation of the country‚Äôs laws.</p>
<p>A first information report (FIR) was registered on Sunday by complainant Aamir Azeem Abbasi regarding a ‚Äútask-based scam resulting in financial loss‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to the FIR, a reliable source informed that a criminal gang was operating a call centre located in Sardar Plaza, G-10 Markaz, Islamabad.</p>
<p>An inquiry concluded that the call centre activities were carried out ‚Äúwith active connivance of each other by impersonating as representatives of a fake and dubious online earning company.‚Äù</p>
<p>The FIR further stated ‚Äúulterior motives to extort money, contact persons of different nationalities and lure them into a dubious easy-money-making scheme.‚Äù</p>
<p>Equipment used in the execution of the digital scam was found and taken into possession by NCCIA Islamabad.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe accused persons could not present any lawful justification‚Äù and confessed to working as a gang to perform electronic fraud via extortion and impersonation.‚Äú</p>
<p>The gang used internet downloaded and AI-generated photos and fake personas to ‚Äúinitiate conversations with isolated or vulnerable individuals through social media such as Facebook, Telegram and WhatsApp through victim hunting.‚Äù</p>
<p>The operation, per the FIR, was a multi-tier set-up consisting of scammers that chat with victims initially, Telegram receptionists who receive collated information on the victims to lure them in for more advanced tasks, finance managers, who managed crypto accounts for receiving fraudulent funds generated via local and international scams, and ‚Äúkillers‚Äù, who reside in foreign countries like Cambodia and empty victims‚Äô bank accounts under the pretext of online earning.</p>
<p>The FIR concluded that the accused gang extorted ‚Äúhuge amounts of money from local Pakistani as well as international victims by accessing their confidential information and misusing such data for extorting money. This fraudulent money is layered via cryptocurrency wallets.‚Äù</p>
<p>The raid follows a similar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922894/149-arrested-for-online-fraud-in-raid-on-factory-in-faisalabad">incident</a> last week where the NCCIA claimed to have arrested 149 persons, including 48 Chinese and nationals of some other countries, for their alleged involvement in online fraud during a raid on a factory in Faisalabad.</p>
<p>Days after the arrest, a Faisalabad special court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923236/87-online-scam-suspects-on-physical-remand-in-faisalabad">allowed</a> a five-day physical remand of 87 suspects, including 18 women, allegedly involved in various cybercrimes, and sent 62 others to the district jail on a 14-day judicial remand, on the request of the NCCIA.</p>
<p>Last month, 18 suspects believed to be involved in a high-profile online scam were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920408/online-loan-scam-gang-busted-18-remanded-in-nccia-custody">arrested</a> and produced before a Karachi court. A judicial magistrate remanded them into the custody of the NCCIA for interrogation.</p>
<p>In May, the NCCIA, in coordination with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Dutch police, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911691">arrested</a> 21 suspects involved in cybercrime operations and digital fraud worth millions of dollars in Multan and Lahore.</p></p>
