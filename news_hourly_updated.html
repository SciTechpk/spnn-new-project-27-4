                <h2>Pakistan signs UN pact to conserve marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan on Monday signed a United Nations (UN) agreement aimed at conserving marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, the Foreign Office (FO) said.</p>
<p>In 2015, Pakistan‚Äôs seabed territory <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1170986">grew</a> by about 50,000 square kilometres after a UN body accepted Islamabad‚Äôs claim for extension of sea limits.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar signed the ‚ÄúAgreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction‚Äù (<a class="link--external" href="https://www.un.org/bbnjagreement/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BBNJ Agreement</a>) at the UN Headquarters in New York.</p>
<p>The BBNJ pact is the third implementing agreement under the <a class="link--external" href="https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/legal/pages/unitednationsconventiononthelawofthesea.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UN Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> (Unclos), which was adopted in 1982 and entered into force in 1994.</p>

<p>Pakistan signing the BBNJ agreement ‚Äúreflects on its commitment to multilateral cooperation and protection and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction‚Äù, the FO noted in a <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/pakistan-signs-agreement-under-unclos-on-the-conservation-and-sustainable-use-of-marine-biological-diversity-of-areas-beyond-national-jurisdiction-bbnj-agreement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>The BBNJ agreement was adopted on 19 June 2023 by an intergovernmental conference.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan played a leading role in the negotiations to finalise the treaty,‚Äù the FO highlighted in a post on X.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs chair of the Group of 77 and China during the two main sessions, Pakistan, representing developing countries, endeavoured to promote equity, in line with the principle of the common heritage of humankind.‚Äù</p>

<p>The FO statement recalled that Pakistan ‚Äúconsistently advocated for fair benefit-sharing, capacity-building, and technology transfer‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to the UN, the BBNJ agreement addresses four main issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Marine genetic resources, including the fair and equitable sharing of benefits</li>
<li>Measures such as area-based management tools, including marine protected areas</li>
<li>Environmental impact assessments</li>
<li>Capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Unclos, under which the BBNJ pact falls, <a class="link--external" href="https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/legal/pages/unitednationsconventiononthelawofthesea.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lays down</a> a ‚Äúcomprehensive regime of law and order for the world‚Äôs oceans, establishing rules for the allocation of states‚Äô rights and jurisdiction in maritime spaces, the peaceful use of the oceans and the management of their resources‚Äù.</p>

<p>In 2020, experts found ‚Äúamazing wildlife‚Äù, well-diversified bird fauna, rich marine habitat and dozens of species of corals at <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1596694">Astola Island</a> in Balochistan.</p></p>

                <h2>At least 27 dead, mostly children, in Bangladesh air force jet crash</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least 25 children were among the 27 dead pulled from scorched buildings after a Bangladesh Air Force jet on a training mission <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925645">crashed</a> into a college and school campus in Dhaka, officials said on Tuesday, with 88 people being treated in hospital.</p>
<p>The F-7 BGI aircraft crashed soon after it took off at 1:06pm (12:06pm PKT) on Monday from the airbase in Kurmitola in the capital on a routine training mission. The military said the plane experienced a mechanical failure.</p>
<p>Visuals showed rescue workers scouring the charred buildings for debris as distressed family members surrounded the site.</p>
<p>Sayedur Rahman, special assistant to the chief adviser on health, told reporters that 27 people had died and 88 were admitted to hospital with burn injuries. Those dead included 25 children, a teacher and the pilot.</p>
<p>The <a class="link--external" href="https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/govt-declares-state-mourning-tomorrow-3944571" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">government announced</a> a day of mourning, with flags at half-mast and special prayers at all places of worship.</p>
<p>The F-7 BGI is the final and most advanced variant in China‚Äôs Chengdu J-7/F-7 aircraft family, according to Jane‚Äôs Information Group. Bangladesh signed a contract for 16 aircraft in 2011 and deliveries were completed by 2013.</p>
<p>The incident comes as neighbour India is still grappling with the world‚Äôs worst aviation disaster in a decade after an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916728">Air India plane crashed</a> into a medical college hostel in Ahmedabad last month, killing 241 of the 242 people on board and 19 on the ground.</p></p>
