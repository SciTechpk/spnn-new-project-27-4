                <h2>Trump says Iran‚Äôs key nuclear facilities ‚Äòobliterated‚Äô by US airstrikes</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>US President Donald Trump said US air strikes on Sunday ‚Äútotally obliterated‚Äù Iran‚Äôs main nuclear sites, as Washington joined Israel‚Äôs war with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.</p>
<p>Condemning the US attacks as a violation of international law, Iran <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/IRIMFA_EN/status/1936675016365515052" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> it was ‚Äúresolved to defend Iran‚Äôs territory, sovereignty, security and people by all force‚Äù.</p>
<p>The US president had stepped up his rhetoric against Iran since Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">first struck</a> Iran on June 13, repeating his insistence that it could never have a nuclear weapon. Tehran has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a> the claim, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p>
<p>Israel had launched wide-scale air strikes against Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences, killing top <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">commanders</a>, scientists and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918702">hundreds</a> others. Both countries have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918048/iran-israel-trade-fresh-air-attacks-as-trump-weighs-us-involvement">traded</a> wave after wave of devastating strikes since then.</p>
<p>In a televised address to the nation from the White House earlier today, Trump warned that the United States would go after more targets if Iran did not make peace quickly.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The intervention by a US president who had vowed to avoid another ‚Äúforever war‚Äù in the region threatens to dramatically widen the conflict, with Iran having said it would retaliate if Washington got involved.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success,‚Äù said Trump, adding that they targeted the crucial underground nuclear enrichment plant of Fordo along with facilities at Natanz and Isfahan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIran‚Äôs key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace,‚Äù said Trump.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump on the strikes, saying that ‚Äúthe awesome and righteous might of the United States will change history‚Äù.</p>

<p>Not long after, sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and explosions were heard from Jerusalem as Iranian state TV announced a fresh salvo of missiles launched.</p>
<p>Tehran said there were ‚Äúno signs of contamination‚Äù after the US attacks and Saudi regulators said ‚Äúno radioactive effects were detected‚Äù in the Gulf region.</p>

<p>US B-2 bombers were involved in the strikes, a US official told <em>Reuters</em>, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<p>Trump did not say what kind of US planes or munitions were involved.</p>
<p>Tehran had threatened reprisals on US forces in the Middle East if Trump attacked.</p>

<p>It said the US actions ‚Äî ‚Äúcarried out in collusion with the genocidal Israeli regime‚Äî once again laid bare the depth of depravity that governs American foreign policy and revealed the extent of hostility harboured by the US ruling establishment against the peace-seeking and independence-loving people of Iran‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe world must not forget that it was the United States that, in the midst of a diplomatic process, betrayed diplomacy by supporting the genocidal and lawbreaking Israeli regime to impose a war of aggression on the Iranian nation,‚Äù the ministry said.</p>

<p>Iran called for an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to condemn this ‚Äúcriminal act of aggression‚Äù.</p>
<p>It also urged the UN‚Äôs International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which it accused of ‚Äúevident bias in favour of warmongering parties‚Äù, to ‚Äúcarry out its legal responsibility‚Äù as Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities were under the agency‚Äôs safeguards and monitoring.</p>
<p>It highlighted that the US attacks violated the UN Charter and UNSC‚Äôs <a class="link--external" href="https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/en/content/2231/background" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Resolution 2231</a> from 2015 on Iran‚Äôs nuclear issue, also terming it a ‚Äúdevastating blow‚Äù to the global non-proliferation system.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSilence in the face of such blatant aggression would plunge the world into an unprecedented level of danger and chaos,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>Pakistan also condemned the US attacks, saying it was ‚Äúgravely concerned at the possible further escalation of tensions in the region‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe reiterate that these attacks violate all norms of international law and that Iran has the legitimate right to defend itself under the UN Charter,‚Äù a <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by the Foreign Office said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe unprecedented escalation of tension and violence, owing to ongoing aggression against Iran, is deeply disturbing. Any further escalation of tensions will have severely damaging implications for the region and beyond,‚Äù it warned.</p>
<p>It stressed that ‚Äúrecourse to dialogue, diplomacy, in line with the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, remains the only viable pathway to resolve the crises in the region‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe emphasise the imperative need to respect civilian lives and properties and immediately bring the conflict to end. All parties must adhere to international law, particularly International Humanitarian Law,‚Äù the statement asserted.</p>

<p>Trump had said on Thursday that he would decide ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918331#:~:text=a%20White%20House%20spokesperson%20said%20the%20president%20would%20make%20a%20decision%20on%20whether%20to%20attack%20Iran%20%E2%80%9Cwithin%20two%20weeks%E2%80%9D">within two weeks</a>‚Äù whether to join Israel‚Äôs campaign, in a move that many saw as a window of diplomatic opportunity.</p>
<p>But the Republican‚Äôs decision to strike Iran came far sooner.</p>
<p>Flanked by Vice President JD Vance, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump said that future attacks would be ‚Äúfar greater‚Äù unless Iran reached a diplomatic solution.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRemember, there are many targets left,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Trump, however, made no mention of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917243">regime change</a>, despite having warned last week that Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was an ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917651">easy target</a>‚Äù.</p>
<p>The raid on the Iranian nuclear sites was carried out by <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/b-2-bombers-moving-guam-amid-middle-east-tensions-us-officials-say-2025-06-21/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">B-2 stealth bombers</a> that dropped so-called ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918152/read-why-israel-wants-us-bunker-busters-to-hit-irans-fordow-nuclear-site">bunker buster bombs</a>‚Äù, along with submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles, US media <a class="link--external" href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/live-updates/israel-iran-live-updates?id=122881565&amp;entryId=123075528" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>

<p>Iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons and says its programme is for civilian purposes only. The IAEA last week Tehran was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914610">in breach</a> of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years.</p>
<p>However, a US intelligence assessment found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was ‚Äúyears away from producing one‚Äù, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917691/us-assessment-finds-iran-years-away-from-nuclear-weapon-refutes-israeli-claims">report</a> from <em>CNN</em> released on Tuesday said.</p>
<p>Israel, which is not a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.</p>
<p>Pictures posted by the White House showed Trump in a red ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù cap meeting with top national security officials in the Situation Room, shortly before the strikes were announced.</p>

<p>After the address, Trump warned Iran against ‚Äúany retaliation‚Äù.</p>
<p>Iran and other armed groups have previously attacked US military bases in the region, including in Iraq.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs Houthi allies in Yemen had yesterday threatened to resume their attacks on US vessels in the Red Sea if Washington joined the war.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#maga-split" id="maga-split" title="Permalink"></a>MAGA split</h2>
<p>Trump spoke to Netanyahu after the attacks, while the United States also gave key ally Israel a ‚Äúheads up‚Äù before the strikes, a senior White House official told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs President Masoud Pezeshkian had warned yesterday of a ‚Äúmore devastating‚Äù retaliation should Israel‚Äôs nine-day bombing campaign continue.</p>
<p>Iran denies seeking an atomic bomb, and on Saturday, Pezeshkian said its right to pursue a civilian nuclear program ‚Äúcannot be taken away ‚Ä¶ by threats or war‚Äù.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs Revolutionary Guard, meanwhile, announced earlier today that ‚Äúsuicide drones‚Äù had been launched against ‚Äústrategic targets‚Äù across Israel.</p>

<p>The issue has opened a split in Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù movement, with many key Republican supporters calling on Trump to avoid embroiling the United States in another foreign war.</p>

<p>Democrats have also assailed him.</p>
<p>Leading US Democrat Hakeem Jeffries said Trump risked US ‚Äúentanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East‚Äù, while others have accused him of bypassing Congress to launch a new war.</p>

                <h2>Water level in Khanpur Dam drops to critically low level</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>TAXILA: The water level in Khanpur Dam has fallen to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917068">critically low level</a>, just eight feet above the dead level, raising alarms about a looming crisis for its civic beneficiaries of Rawalpindi and Islamabad.</p>
<p>Water supply for irrigation purposes to both KP and Punjab had already been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912223">suspended</a> around a month ago.</p>
<p>According to Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the reservoir level stood at 1918 feet on Saturday which is significantly below the conservation level of 1980 feet and alarmingly close to the dead level of 1910 feet. The inflow into the dam has declined to just 29 cusecs while the outflow is being maintained at 106 cusecs.</p>

<p>With the plummeted water level, water sports activities in the dam have declined to the lowest level of the year. During high temperatures the dam becomes a favourite tourist destination. Wapda authorities said presently civic agencies of Islamabad and Rawalpindi were receiving only 50 cusecs of water, which was also at the risk of being halted.</p>

<p>Khanpur Dam reaches optimal levels during and after the monsoon season. However, changing weather patterns, prolonged dry spells and glacial melt mismanagement have resulted in erratic inflows. In June last year, the reservoir level stood around 1935 feet, with more than double the current inflow.</p>
<p>Officials were however hopeful that the onset of monsoon rains later this month will help replenish the dam‚Äôs reserves.</p>
<p>On the other hand, hydrologists blame climate variability, poor catchment management and increased urban demand for the current state of water stress. ‚ÄúThis is not just a seasonal anomaly, it is a structural problem that needs long-term planning,‚Äù said an irrigation department official.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908900">Khanpur Dam</a> is a primary source of drinking water for Islamabad and Rawalpindi, in addition to irrigating agricultural lands in Haripur district and parts of Punjab. With water storage levels hitting a historic low for mid-June, residents may soon experience interrupted supply, reduced water pressure and increased dependence on tankers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWater shortages are already being felt in low-lying areas, where supply hours have been reduced,‚Äù said an official of the Capital Development Authority (CDA). ‚ÄúWe may have no choice but to initiate emergency water conservation protocols if the situation doesn‚Äôt improve in the next two weeks.‚Äù</p>
<p>Authorities have appealed to the public to reduce water consumption and avoid unnecessary wastage. Water-intensive activities such as car washing, lawn watering and unnecessary pipeline flushing are being discouraged. At the same time, government agencies are under pressure to review water release protocols and launch public awareness campaigns.</p>
