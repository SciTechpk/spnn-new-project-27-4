                <h2>India doubling down on proxy war after clear defeat by Pakistan, says COAS Munir</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir said on Thursday that India was doubling down on its ‚Äúnefarious agenda‚Äù against Pakistan through the use of proxies after facing a ‚Äúmanifest defeat‚Äù in the recent military conflict between the two countries.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">US-brokered ceasefire</a> for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>A day ago, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923063/dg-ispr-brands-indian-nsa-ajit-doval-chief-architect-of-terrorism-in-pakistan">accused</a> Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval of being the ‚Äúchief architect‚Äù of terrorism in Pakistan. According to the ISPR chief, India provided funding, planning, intelligence and technical support to terrorist groups within Pakistan, such as <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>.</p>
<p>Similarly, Field Marshal Munir said, while chairing the 271st Corps Commanders‚Äô Conference (CCC) at the General Headquarters (GHQ) today, ‚ÄúFollowing its manifest defeat in direct aggression against Pakistan, post-Pahalgam incident, India is now doubling down to further its nefarious agenda through its proxies of <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>.‚Äù</p>
<p>In July last year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349">designated</a> the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em>, while mandating all institutions to use the term <em>khariji</em> (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.</p>
<p>In May this year, the government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525">designated</a> all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as <em>Fitna-al-Hindu¬≠stan</em> ‚Äî a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">new phrase</a> aimed at framing India‚Äôs alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>
<p>A statement from the ISPR said the CCC participants offered prayers for the martyrs of recent terrorist attacks by ‚ÄúIndian-sponsored proxies‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTaking stock of recent successes against terrorist proxies, forum resolved that blood of our martyrs will not go waste and the safety and security of people of Pakistan remain topmost priority for the armed forces of Pakistan. Forum strongly asserted that it is imperative to take decisive and holistic actions at all levels against the Indian-backed and sponsored proxies.‚Äù</p>

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The ISPR said the forum also noted the Indian military‚Äôs ‚Äúbaseless insinuations to offset its comprehensive defeat‚Äù, in an apparent reference to the deputy Indian army chief alleging last week that China gave Islamabad ‚Äúlive inputs‚Äù on key Indian positions during the conflict.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInvoking third parties in what is unmistakably a bilateral military confrontation reflects a disingenuous attempt at bloc politics aimed at falsely projecting India‚Äôs self-assigned role as a net security provider to accrue benefits in a region that is visibly growing disillusioned with Indian hegemonic ambitions and Hindutva-driven extremism,‚Äù the ISPR quoted Field Marshal Munir as saying on the matter.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>The army brass also conducted a holistic review of the prevailing internal and external security dynamics, with particular emphasis on the recent developments in the Middle East and Iran, noting the ‚Äúgrowing propensity for ‚Äòuse of force‚Äô as a preferred policy tool‚Äù, saying it warranted ‚Äúpersistent development of self-reliant capabilities as well as national unity and resolve‚Äù.</p>
<p>The forum‚Äôs members were further briefed on the military‚Äôs ongoing drive with quick adaptation towards the ‚Äúevolving threat spectrum and changing character of war‚Äù. The army chief also appreciated the leadership of the Pakistan Navy and the Pakistan Air Force for ‚Äúfurther strengthening tri-services synergy‚Äù.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir also shared details of the country‚Äôs ‚Äúproactive and successful‚Äù diplomatic manoeuvres, including recent visits to Iran, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where he had accompanied Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>‚ÄúForum was also briefed on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918044">historic and unique visit</a> of the COAS to US, where meetings with top-tier leadership afforded an opportunity to share first hand Pakistan‚Äôs objective perspective on bilateral, regional and extra-regional developments.‚Äù</p>
<p>The ISPR said that in his concluding remarks, the army chief expressed ‚Äúfull confidence in the operational readiness of Pakistan Army against complete threat spectrum‚Äù.</p></p>

They are crucial to replenishing water supplies and agriculture, and therefore, the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security. However, they also wreak havoc by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>At least nine people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923183/11-killed-as-rains-continue-to-batter-punjab-balochistan">lost their lives</a> and many others sustained injuries as heavy monsoon rains lashed Lahore on Wednesday.
