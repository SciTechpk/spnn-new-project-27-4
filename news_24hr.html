            <p><p>The Israeli military seized the Gaza-bound aid ship Madleen on Monday, towing it to Israel, the Foreign Ministry said, adding the activists will be deported to their countries.</p>
<p>The British-flagged yacht Madleen, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, had departed from Sicily on June 1 and had hoped to reach Gaza later in the day, when the interception occurred, the group said on its Telegram account.</p>
<p>Among those on board the boat are Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament. The yacht is carrying a small shipment of humanitarian aid, including rice and baby formula.</p>

<p>The ministry said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/IsraelMFA/status/1931877539871338775" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on X that the vessel “is safely making its way to the shores of Israel. The passengers are expected to return to their home countries”.</p>
<p>It said earlier that “the maritime zone off the coast of Gaza is closed to unauthorised vessels under a legal naval blockade, consistent with international law”.</p>
<p>“Humanitarian aid is delivered regularly and effectively via different channels and routes and is transferred through established distribution mechanisms,” it added.</p>
<p>The FFC said <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/GazaFFlotilla/status/1931887513918202240" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earlier</a> on Monday that Israeli soldiers had kidnapped the activists who were on the Madleen.</p>
<p>Israeli forces boarded the charity vessel attempting to reach the Gaza Strip in defiance of an Israeli naval blockade, the FFC had said earlier in the day.</p>

<p>The Israeli military had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>The United Nations’ special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, has supported the FFC operation and urged other boats to challenge the Gaza blockade.</p>
<p>“Madleen’s journey may have ended, but the mission isn’t over. Every Mediterranean port must send boats with aid &amp; solidarity to Gaza,” she wrote on X.</p>
<p>“As the Madleen was reportedly intercepted and seized by Israeli forces in int’l waters, the UK gov must urgently seek full clarification and secure the immediate release of the vessel &amp; its crew,” she <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/FranceskAlbs/status/1931884302880346302" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a separate post.</p>

<p>The Gaza Freedom Flotilla had also said that quadcopters surrounded the Madleen and were “spraying it with a white paint-like substance”, <em>Al Jazeera</em> reported.</p>
<p>Huwaida Arraf, the co-founder of the International Solidarity Movement, which is supporting the FFC, <a class="link--external" href="https://aje.io/p6b8m7?update=3762491" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>Al Jazeera</em> that some people on board reported that their “eyes were burning” after the white substance was dropped on the aid boat.</p>
<p>The Israeli Foreign Ministry posted a video on X showing the Israeli Navy communicating with the Madleen over a loudspeaker, urging it to change course, shortly before the FFC confirmed that Israeli forces had boarded the Gaza-bound aid ship.</p>
<p>“The maritime zone off the coast of Gaza is closed to naval traffic as part of a legal naval blockade,” a soldier said. “If you wish to deliver humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, you are able to do so through the (Israeli) port of Ashdod.”</p>
<p>The organisers of the Madleen’s voyage said on Saturday that they had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916004/madleen-ship-set-to-arrive-in-palestinian-waters-in-24-hours-eu-lawmaker">reached</a> Egyptian waters and were nearing Gaza, where the Israeli invasion of Gaza entered its 21st month.</p>
<p>The Madleen, a sailing boat operated by the FFC, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915389">left</a> Italy on June 1 with the stated aim of delivering humanitarian aid and breaking the Israeli blockade on the Palestinian territory.</p>
<p>“Israel will not allow anyone to break the naval blockade of Gaza, which is aimed at preventing weapons from reaching Hamas — a murderous terrorist group holding our hostages and committing war crimes,” Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said.</p>
<p>“Israel will act against any attempt to break the blockade or support terror groups — by sea, air or land,” he added.</p>
<p>The coalition responded in a statement on X, saying it expected “interception and an attack from Israel at any moment” and calling for the governments of those on board to protect them.</p>
<p>The post added that the Madleen is 160 nautical miles from Gaza and that jamming “briefly disrupted our location, but our tracker is functioning again”.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, activists aboard the vessel have said they will continue their journey “until the last minute”.</p>
<p>“We’ll stay mobilised until the last minute — until Israel cuts the internet and networks,” European parliament member Rima Hassan told <em>AFP</em> from the boat. “There are twelve of us civilians on board. We are not armed. There is only humanitarian aid.”</p>
<p>Hassan voiced concern over the lack of official response from countries whose citizens are part of the crew.</p>
<p>“No state has responded. The message being sent is that Israel is being allowed to act with impunity, without any guarantee of protection for us,” she added.</p>
<p>In a post on X, Hassan said that the activists have “less than 24 hours” before they are detained by Israeli authorities.</p>
<p>“When we are no longer able to communicate with you, I’m counting on you to continue the mobilisation that has been so valuable to us throughout this journey,” she wrote.</p>

<p>Nationals of Germany, France, Brazil, Turkey, Sweden, Spain and the Netherlands are on the boat.</p>
<p>“We’re not scared of them,” said German human rights activist Yasemin Acar, also on board. “The message they have been sending us, that we cannot come closer, is not making us step back.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, French Minister for Foreign Trade and French Nationals Abroad Laurent Saint-Martin said that France was obliged to ensure “consular protection” for its nationals aboard the Madleen.</p>
<p>“The six French citizens on this boat are entitled to consular protection,” he told a state TV channel.</p>
<p>On May 27, Israel began <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913671/un-calls-for-gaza-crossings-opening-calls-ghf-a-distraction">implementing</a> a controversial plan to distribute aid through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, bypassing UN oversight. Palestinians have denounced the move as a coercive tactic to force displacement from northern to southern Gaza.</p>
<p>Gaza’s Government Media Office said the death toll from the American-Israeli aid distribution sites had risen to 125, with 736 wounded and nine missing since May 27.</p>
<p>According to the office, 13 people were killed and 153 injured on Sunday alone in two separate incidents near those locations.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the health ministry in Gaza said that the overall toll for the Gaza invasion had reached 54,880, the majority being civilians. The UN considers these figures reliable.</p>
<p>The conflict was sparked by Hamas’s October 7, 2023 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1779807">attack</a> on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an <em>AFP</em> tally of official figures.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25, the pre-budget document, containing the details of major socio-economic achievements during the outgoing fiscal year 2024-25, will be launched today.</p>
<p>The survey will be presented by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, according to a press release issued by the Ministry of Finance on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Economic Survey serves as a vital document ahead of the annual federal budget, offering detailed insights into the country’s socio-economic performance over the outgoing fiscal year.</p>
<p>According to the Annual Plan Coordination Committee (APCC), whose recommendations were endorsed by the National Economic Council (NEC), Pakistan’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate for the fiscal year 2024–25 has been recorded at 2.7 per cent while the target for GDP growth in the next fiscal year has been set at 4.2pc.</p>
<p>The NEC also noted that remittances witnessed a strong increase of 30.9pc from July 2024 to April 2025, and for the first time, the current account balance remained in surplus during this period.</p>
<p>The survey will also highlight improvements in fiscal indicators, including a reduction in the fiscal deficit to 2.6pc of GDP. The primary balance recorded a surplus of 3pc of GDP, reflecting a more disciplined fiscal approach.</p>
<p>Owing to improved economic fundamentals and proactive monetary policy measures, the policy interest rate was gradually reduced to 11pc. Meanwhile, credit to the private sector grew significantly, with loans amounting to Rs681 billion disbursed between July 2024 and May 2025.</p>
<p>The survey will highlight trends, achievements, and challenges across major sectors including agriculture, manufacturing, industry, services, energy, information technology and telecommunications, capital markets, health, education, transport, and communication.</p>
<p>Additionally, the survey will shed light on developments in social protection programmes, environmental sustainability, and infrastructure.</p>
<p>The document will also present updated data on critical economic indicators such as inflation, trade and balance of payments, public debt, population growth, employment levels, and climate change impacts. By offering a consolidated view of these indicators, the survey aims to inform public debate and policy planning in the lead-up to the new fiscal year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the NEC emphasised that recent signs of “economic stabilisation” were the result of coordinated efforts by the federal and provincial governments.</p>
<p>It stated that the country has now moved onto a path of economic recovery and growth, with the agriculture sector played a particularly important role in strengthening national reserves and supporting economic expansion.</p>
<p>“A comprehensive strategy is currently being formulated to ensure a steady and sustainable increase in agricultural productivity in the coming years,” it said.</p>
<p>In terms of development spending, a total outlay of Rs3,483bn has been approved for the Annual National Development Programme (ANDP) for 2024–25. Of this amount, Rs1,100bn was allocated for federal development initiatives, while Rs2,383bn was utilised by provincial governments for their respective projects.</p></p>

            <p><p>A fire that broke out at a factory in Landhi on Sunday has been almost brought under control after more than 24 hours of firefighting efforts, according to a Rescue 1122 spokesperson.</p>
<p>Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassan Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the “fire has been brought under control to a large extent”, however, more time is required to completely control the blaze.</p>
<p>“There are flames burning in the affected factories. It may take more time to fully control the fire and complete the cooling process,” he said.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said rescue teams are still present on the third day of Eid and continuously engaged in extinguishing the fire.</p>
<p>The fire, which erupted in a factory in the export processing zone in Landhi, caused part of a factory building to collapse, leaving five people injured.</p>
<p>“The injured include 45-year-old Aslam, 30-year-old Hamza, 20-year-old Ayaz, 43-year-old Sajid Mahmood and 53-year-old Mohsin,” Khan said. “They have been transported to Civil Hospital.”</p>
<p>Earlier, Khan told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the fire broke out at 4:31am, meaning that it has been burning for over 24 hours.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em> earlier, Abid Jalaluddin Sheikh, chief operating officer at Rescue 1122 Sindh, said that the fire broke out early on Sunday morning, spreading rapidly and engulfing two other factories due to the presence of combustible material.</p>
<p>He said, “As soon as the information was received, the Fire and Rescue team of Rescue 1122 reached the spot.”</p>
<p>According to Sheikh, a total of 12 fire brigade trucks,two snorkels and two ambulances of Rescue 1122 and the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) are present at the spot to provide full assistance to deal with any emergency situation.</p>
<p>“The rescue operation is facing difficulties due to the intensity of smoke and other difficulties, as well as the shortage of water, but Rescue 1122 is making efforts to control the fire,” he said.</p>
<p>Sheikh highlighted that firefighting operations were “in full swing and full efforts are being made to reduce the intensity of the fire because the intensity of the fire is very high”.</p>
<p>“The Rescue 1122 team is making full efforts to control this emergency situation by utilising all possible resources,” he said, adding that citizens have been requested to immediately report any emergency to 1122.</p>
<p>Fire incidents are <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903361">common</a> in the metropolis due to the absence of adequate <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1873091/fire-erupts-in-model-colony-warehouse-after-cylinder-blast">fire safety measures</a> in buildings.</p>
<p>Thirty shops were gutted when a huge fire erupted in a commercial building in Clifton in February.</p>
<p>Four people, including one firefighter, were affected by smoke inhalation and 12 fire tenders worked for four hours to bring the fire under control.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1816066">Last year</a>, the KMC informed the Sindh High Court that it had conducted a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1816066">fire safety audit</a> of over 265 commercial buildings, and not a single one was found to have a fire safety certificate or a no-objection certificate (NOC) issued by the fire brigade department.</p>
<p>Out of <a class="link--external" href="https://Out%20of%20265%20buildings,%20around%20155%20did%20not%20have%20fire%20alarms%20and%20smoke%20detectors%20installed,%20while%20the%20status%20of%20nine%20such%20buildings%20was%20not%20available%20in%20this%20respect,%20the%20KMC%20report%20added." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">265 buildings</a>, around 155 did not have fire alarms and smoke detectors installed, while the status of nine such buildings was not available in this respect, the KMC report added.</p>
<p>Similarly, the condition of the wiring and electric system of over 155 buildings was termed unsatisfactory. Regarding access to firefighting equipment, the report said that around 200 buildings had no or unsatisfactory firefighting equipment.</p></p>
