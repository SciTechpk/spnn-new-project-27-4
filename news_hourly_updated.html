                <h2>Country‚Äôs 18th polio case of this year reported in KP‚Äôs Tank</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A newly confirmed case of polio in Khyber Paktunkhwa‚Äôs Tank district has brought the total number of polio cases in Pakistan this year to 18, the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad said on Friday.</p>
<p>Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879016">endemic</a>. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891351">challenges</a> such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation have slowed progress.</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://www.endpolio.com.pk/media-room/media-releases/2649-new-polio-case-underscores-ongoing-risk-in-south-khyber-pakhtunkhwa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme confirmed that a 10-month-old boy from Union Council Mullazai in Tank district was confirmed as the 11th polio case from KP this year, bringing the country‚Äôs total number of cases in 2025 to 18. Last year, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891351">74 cases</a> were reported nationwide.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe continued detection of polio cases underscores the persistent threat to children, particularly in areas with low vaccine acceptance,‚Äù the press release said. ‚ÄúIt is crucial for communities to understand that poliovirus can re-emerge wherever immunity gaps persist.‚Äù</p>
<p>It added that every unvaccinated child remained vulnerable and could also contribute to the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The press release pointed out that the only effective protection for polio ‚Äî a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis ‚Äî was through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p>
<p>Despite ‚Äúsignificant improvements‚Äù in the quality of polio vaccination campaigns nationwide, the laboratory said that southern districts of KP remained a key area of concern due to restricted access and operational challenges in house-to-house vaccination, leaving ‚Äúthousands of children unvaccinated‚Äù.</p>
<p>According to the press release, six campaigns, including four nationwide, have each reached over 45 million children since September 2024.</p>
<p>It added that the National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) plans to conduct two nationwide and one sub-national campaign between August and December this year, as well as targeted campaigns in selected high-risk districts, to help stop transmission and protect children from the virus.</p>

<p>As part of intensified efforts to eradicate polio in South KP, the prime minister‚Äôs Focal Person on Polio Eradication, Senator Ayesha Raza Farooq and NEOC Coordinator retired Captain Anwarul Haq held a meeting with KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah in Peshawar on Tuesday to review ongoing initiatives in the province.</p>
<p>The meeting focused on ‚Äúcampaign performance, current challenges, and targeted strategies to interrupt poliovirus transmission‚Äù, particularly in high-risk southern districts of KP, including Tank.</p>
<p>Farooq emphasised the need to ‚Äúresolve persistent access barriers and ensure the uninterrupted presence and performance of frontline vaccinators in high-risk union councils‚Äù.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Anwarul Haq presented a targeted strategy to improve the quality of campaigns and strengthen routine immunisation, particularly in southern KP.</p>

<p>The press release added, ‚ÄúA special planning meeting focused on South KP is scheduled to be held at the chief secretary‚Äôs office on August 2-3.‚Äù</p>
<p>The programme called polio eradication ‚Äúa collective responsibility that requires unified efforts at all levels‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile dedicated frontline polio workers continue to deliver life-saving vaccines, it is equally critical for parents and caregivers to ensure their children receive every dose of the polio vaccine,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCommunities must play an active role by supporting vaccination efforts, dispelling misinformation, and encouraging others to protect their children through timely immunisation.‚Äù</p>
<p>It directed citizens to the Sehat Tahaffuz Helpline at 1166 for information, as well as the Polio Helpline on WhatsApp at 0346-7776546.</p>

<p>In June, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918236">claimed</a> that Pakistan has witnessed a decline of over 99 per cent in polio cases, saying that polio eradication remains a top priority of the government.</p></p>

                <h2>Militant attacks see slight rise in July, says think tank</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan witnessed a slight uptick in militant violence in July after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921445">brief decline</a> last month, according to the latest monthly security report released by the Islamabad-based think tank Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss) on Friday.</p>
<p>In June, there were a total of 78 militant attacks across the country, resulting in at least 100 fatalities, including 53 security personnel, 39 civilians, six militants, and two members of peace committees, the organisation said in a press statement.</p>
<p>These attacks injured 189 people, comprising 126 security personnel and 63 civilians ‚Äî marking an eight per cent decrease in attacks, a 12pc drop in fatalities, and 4pc increase in injuries compared to May 2025.</p>
<p>Friday‚Äôs report documented 82 militant attacks across the country during July, resulting in 101 fatalities and 150 injuries. According to a Picss statement, those killed in militant attacks included 47 civilians, 36 security personnel, and 18 militants. Among the injured were 90 civilians, 52 security personnel, seven militants, and a member of a peace committee.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecurity forces intensified their counter-militancy operations, killing 106 militants and arresting 69 suspected operatives during the same period,‚Äù the statement read, noting that these operations also claimed the lives of seven civilians.</p>
<p>Picss noted that the country saw the lowest monthly toll in actions initiated by security forces, with only one of them losing their life. However, 36 security personnel were killed in militant attacks in July.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn total, militant attacks and subsequent security operations accounted for 215 deaths in July, comprising 124 militants, 54 civilians, and 37 security personnel, while 199 people were injured, including 107 civilians, 56 security personnel, 35 militants, and one peace committee member,‚Äù the think tank said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe militants also kidnapped at least 14 individuals during the month.‚Äù</p>
<p>A comparative analysis by Picss showed a 5pc rise in militant attacks compared to June 2025. However, fatalities among security forces dropped by 32pc, while civilian deaths increased by 21pc. Militant casualties surged by 49pc.</p>
<p>The report highlighted that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including its tribal districts, remained the epicentre of militancy, accounting for 53 of the 82 attacks recorded nationwide.</p>
<p>Balochistan followed with 28 attacks, while no militant incidents were reported from Punjab, Sindh, Azad Kashmir or the Islamabad Capital Territory. However, one attack was recorded in the Diamer district of Gilgit-Baltistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.</p>
<p>The government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349">labelled</a> the TTP as <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and directed the use of the term <em>khariji</em> for attackers. It later <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525">designated</a> Balochistan-based groups as <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">highlight</a> India‚Äôs alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.</p>
<p>A day earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the government was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927838">implementing</a> a comprehensive and effective strategy to ‚Äúcompletely eliminate‚Äù the menace posed by the proscribed <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>, <em>Fitna-al-Khawarij</em> and other terrorist outfits to the country.</p>
<p>According to a statement from his office, the prime minister said the state had adopted a ‚Äúmulti-pronged strategy‚Äù in the war against terrorism and made ‚Äúfull and effective use‚Äù of important elements such as ground operations, legislation, meaningful public communication and discouraging extremist thinking.</p>
<p>He directed the Steering Committee on Counter-Terrorism and Establishment of the State Writ to ensure effective coordination between the federal and provincial governments against terrorism and to strictly implement their recommendations.</p>
<p>In March, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075">ranked second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45pc from 2024 to 1,081.</p></p>
