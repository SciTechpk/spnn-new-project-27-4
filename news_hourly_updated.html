                <h2>KP govt says CM ‚Äòin contact‚Äô with administration over Tirah shooting</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Monday said Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur was ‚Äúin contact‚Äù with the relevant administration over the incident of protesters being shot in Khyber district‚Äôs Tirah Valley.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927004">Seven people</a> were shot on Sunday after a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926949">demonstration</a> outside the Brigade Headquarters in Bagh-Maidan Markaz against the death of a minor girl in a mortar strike in Tirah‚Äôs Zakhakhel.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the ‚Äúfiring on peaceful citizens by khawarij‚Äù ‚Äî a term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). However, according to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927004#:~:text=Security%20personnel%20guar%C2%ADding%20the%20installation%20reportedly%20opened%20fire%20to%20control%20the%20crowd%2C%20according%20to%20sources.">sources</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926949#:~:text=some%20of%20the%20protesters%20alleged%20that%20the%20forces%20at%20the%20gates%20fired%20at%20them">protesters</a>, security personnel guar¬≠ding the installation reportedly had opened fire to control the crowd.</p>
<p>Besides the seven killed, at least 16 others also received bullet injuries, sources said. There has been no official statement from the local administration or the military about the mortar strike or Sunday‚Äôs killings.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe chief minister is in constant contact with the relevant administration,‚Äù CM Gandapur‚Äôs public relations adviser, Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, said in a statement today.</p>
<p>He said the KP chief minister was ‚Äúmonitoring‚Äù the Tirah incident himself. ‚ÄúThe KP government is extremely saddened over the incident,‚Äù Saif added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe provincial government is standing side by side with the affected families in this moment of sorrow and grief,‚Äù the official asserted.</p>

<p>Saif also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926565/saif-blasts-parties-boycotting-mpc-says-militancy-shared-challenge">again</a> slammed the KP opposition parties for not attending a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926456/gandapur-rails-against-good-taliban-bad-taliban-distinction">multi-party conference</a> (MPC) held last week over the security situation in the province, stressing that the moot had been organised ‚Äúto prevent such incidents‚Äù.</p>
<p>The statement recalled that the provincial government will be holding a series of jirgas with tribal elders next week, including one in Peshawar. This is also based on the MPC‚Äôs decision to convene a jirga comprising elders, parliamentarians and stakeholders from each district.</p>
<p>According to CM Gandapur, a grand jirga, whose members will be nominated by the first jirga, would be organised 15 days after that to devise a strategy to implement the MPC‚Äôs declaration.</p>

<p>On Sunday, hundreds of tribesmen had brought the body of a girl, who they claimed was killed in a mortar strike in the Darbar locality of Peer Mela in Zakhakhel a day earlier, to the Brigade Headquarters.</p>

<p>Sources and eye-witnesses said the situation turned violent when an angry mob, comprising mostly young men, ignored calls by local elders to remain calm.</p>
<p>They first torched an excavator parked outside Brigade Headquarters, then tried to force open its main gate, following which security personnel guar¬≠ding the installation reportedly opened fire to control the crowd, according to sources.</p>
<p>However, in a statement from his office, PM Shehbaz said TTP terrorists were behind the incident as he expressed his grief over the ‚Äúmartyrdom of innocent and peaceful civilians‚Äù. The statement, carried by state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/27-07-2025/pm-expresses-grief-over-deaths-of-civilians-in-tirah-valley" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> and <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-expresses-grief-over-martyrdom-of-innocent-citizens-in-firing-in-tirah-valley/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">APP</a></em>, did not mention any protest.</p>
<p>He directed the authorities to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe nefarious designs of terrorists cannot shake our resolve,‚Äù the premier asserted, reaffirming the government‚Äôs commitment to eliminate terrorists and terrorism.</p>

<p>The injured were transported to the Frontier Corps Hospital in Shah Kas Jamrud, Dogra Hospital in Bara and Hayatabad Medical Complex in Peshawar. One of the injured is said to be in critical condition.</p>
<p>Following the incident, security officials met with a delegation of Tirah elders at Brigade Headquarters and announced compensation for the victims on their demand. The KP government has also announced separate Rs10 million for the deceased and Rs2.5m for the injured.</p>
<p>Security officials said the local sector commander met with the Tirah elders and assured them of his full support in meeting their legitimate demands.</p>

<p>Residents in Peer Mela have claimed that mortar shelling by security forces has so far killed at least three persons over the last 10 days.

            </a>
            <p><p>The Babusar Highway was partially reopened on Monday as the search for missing people continued after heavy rains last week prompted flash floods in Gilgit-Baltistan.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925719">devastating impacts</a> of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">heat¬≠¬≠waves</a>, erratic weat¬≠her patterns and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924660">glacial melting</a> have triggered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a> and intense floods across the region.</p>
<p>On July 21, floods swept across GB, causing landslides and leaving many <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926193">stranded</a>, and damaging more than <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926487">500 houses</a>, roads and other infrastructure.

<p>In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said: ‚ÄúThe Babusar-Naran Highway has been reopened for one-way traffic.‚Äù</p>
<p>He noted that heavy machinery was used to reopen it, while work for complete restoration was underway. He also advised passengers to be cautious and avoid unnecessary travel.</p>
<p>Faraq further said, ‚ÄúSeveral families, including five members of a TV anchor‚Äôs family, have contacted the government about the missing people and appealed for help in the search.‚Äù</p>
<p>The wallet of the TV anchor Shabana Liaquat was found among the flood debris, which also included her and her child‚Äôs student cards, he added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe provincial government has enlisted the help of Pakistan Army sniffer dogs to search for those buried under the rubble,‚Äù the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Separately, the National Highway Authority (NHA) initiated swift road restoration operations in northern areas after orders by Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/road-restoration-underway-in-northern-areas-on-federal-ministers-orders/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">APP</a></em> reported.</p>

<p>Aleem said that key highways, including the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad (N-15) and Skardu-Jaglot Road, were blocked due to landslides and cloudburst. ‚ÄúNHA teams have cleared multiple obstruction points, ensuring partial restoration of traffic and improved accessibility for travellers,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The minister described the 242-kilometre-long N-15 as a ‚Äúcritical route for tourism and regional connectivity‚Äù, which was blocked at various locations.</p>
<p>According to officials, landslides along the route were successfully cleared, while restoration work from Naran to Babusar Top and Chilas was ongoing, he added.</p>
<p>Communication Secretary Ali Sher Mehsud and NHA chairman were present on-site to oversee the restoration activities, the report said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are committed to restoring all major highways at the earliest,‚Äù Mehsud said, adding that travel towards Kaghan and Naran had resumed.</p>
<p>NHA managed to clear 20 out of 25 landslide-affected points on the Skardu-Jaglot Road.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo maintain pace, NHA has placed all field officers on 24-hour alert, cancelled staff leave and activated its emergency response plan across Gilgit-Baltistan. Heavy machinery remains operational across the region to tackle any further disruptions,‚Äù the report added.</p>

<p>According to the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC), rain was expected in Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, and Shigar areas of GB, as well as in Muzaffarabad, Neelum Valley, and Bagh in Azad Jammu and Kashmir during the forecast period.</p>
