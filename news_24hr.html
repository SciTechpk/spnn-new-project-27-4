            <p><p>The Afghan government under the Taliban has called for “mutual respect and constructive engagement” with Pakistan and China, according to a statement issued by its interior ministry.</p>
<p>The statement was issued after special envoys of Pakistan and China, Mohammad Sadiq and Yue Xiaoyong, met Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul. The trilateral forum was established in 2017, with earlier meetings held in Beijing and the Afghan capital.</p>
<p>“Minister of Interior Khalifa Sirajuddin Haqqani emphasised the importance of strengthening regional ties, stating that, from the Islamic Emirate’s perspective, the advancement of economic and political relations, as well as regional understanding, can be achieved through mutual respect and constructive engagement,” the Afghan interior ministry said.</p>
<p>It added that the special envoys of China and Pakistan reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening good neighbourly relations and fostering cooperation with Afghanistan based on mutual engagement. They also agreed that the sixth round of the trilateral dialogue between the foreign ministers would be held in Kabul, continuing the established mechanism.</p>
<p>Separately, in a post on X, Ambassador Sadiq said: “The meeting aimed to follow up on the fifth trilateral dialogue between the foreign ministers of the three countries, held in Islamabad; prepare for the upcoming sixth ministerial round; and strengthen three-way political and economic cooperation.”</p>
<p>“The delegations emphasised their commitment to good neighbourly relations, regional stability, mutual respect, and constructive engagement as foundations for stronger ties,” he added.</p>

<p>Separately, the Afghan Foreign Ministry said that Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi held a meeting in Kabul with the Pakistani and Chinese special envoys and their accompanying delegations.</p>
<p>In a statement, the ministry said the meeting “focused on following up on the agenda of the fifthth round of the Afghanistan-China-Pakistan Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue”.</p>
<p>The fifthth round, which was held in Islamabad in May 2023, had “stressed on the need of not allowing any individual, group or party, including the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) etc., to use their territories to harm and threaten regional security and interests, or conduct terrorist actions and activities”.</p>
<p>Kabul’s trilateral meeting on May 10 decided that the sixth round of the Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue would be convened in Kabul, with preparatory measures also to be undertaken for the forthcoming meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Afghanistan’s neighboring countries.</p>
<p>However, no date was announced for the trilateral meeting. “Underscoring the importance of political and economic relations with both countries, FM Muttaqi expressed hope for continued progress in these areas,” the statement added.</p>
<p>In a post on X, Ambassador Sadiq said the meeting provided the occasion for convergence of views on economic and security cooperation as well as regional stability.</p>

<p>Earlier, the Chinese and Pakistani envoys also met Afghan Commerce Minister Nooruddin Azizi. According to the ministry, the meeting aimed at strengthening and developing trade relations, attracting investment, and launching joint projects between Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China.</p>
<p>The meeting discussed key issues including the establishment of joint industrial parks in Afghanistan, the establishment of special economic zones, the launch of joint export processing centres, the holding of trilateral trade fairs, the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprise support centers in Afghanistan, and the facilitation of banking relations between the three countries were discussed and exchanged.</p>
<p>Azizi expressed gratitude for the presence of high-ranking representatives of Pakistan and China and emphasised the importance of joint and mutual cooperation, the statement said.</p>
<p>“The policy of the Islamic Emirate is economy-oriented, and we organise and implement programs to attract foreign investment based on this policy, taking into account common interests,” it quoted Azizi as telling the special envoys.</p>
<p>The Afghan minister officially invited his Pakistani and Chinese counterparts to visit Afghanistan to deepen discussions and expand cooperation.</p></p>

            <p><p>Lakki Marwat police on Sunday thwarted a kidnapping bid by terrorists in the Landewa Gorabai area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with three people rescued, two terrorists killed and a cop injured in the rescue operation, according to a senior police official.</p>
<p>Faced with <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901722/militant-attacks-in-march-surged-to-highest-level-since-2014">increasing</a> attacks by militants, especially in KP and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896269">Balochistan</a>, security forces have also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889375">intensified</a> counterterrorism operations.</p>
<p>Khanzala Khan, spokesperson to Bannu regional police officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan, told <em>Dawn.com</em> that terrorists attempted to abduct three locals in the Landewa Gorobai area of Lakki Marwat.</p>
<p>“Local police immediately launched a search operation after receiving information about the incident,” Khan said. “During the operation, the police had a face-to-face encounter with the terrorists.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that terrorists opened fire on the police team, with a policeman sustaining a minor injury.</p>
<p>“However, the police and the DSP (Deputy Superintendent of Police) present at the scene fought bravely and pushed the terrorists back,” Khan said, adding that police recovered the three abductees. “Three terrorists were injured in the encounter and taken to the mountains by their companions. Two terrorists were killed on the spot.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that Lakki Marwat District Police Officer Jawad led a search operation to trace the escaped terrorists.</p>
<p>“Local peace committees cooperated fully with the police,” Khan added.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">ranked</a> second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>
<p>However, a significant improvement was seen in Pakistan’s internal security landscape in April 2025, “as both militant attacks and resultant casualties dropped sharply compared to March”, according to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907799/internal-security-landscape-sees-significant-improvement-in-april-compared-to-march-picss">data</a> released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.</p></p>

            <p><p>The Supreme Court of Pakistan is set to hear the appeal against Zahir Jaffer’s death sentence in the Noor Mukadam murder case on May 13, according to its latest cause list, it emerged on Sunday.</p>
<p>Noor, 27, was found <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1636267">murdered</a> at a residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4 on July 20, 2021. A first information report (FIR) was registered later the same day against Zahir Jaffer, who was arrested from the site of the murder.</p>
<p>In February 2022, a district and sessions judge convicted Jaffer of murdering Mukadam, handing him the death penalty along with 25 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs200,000. His household staff, Iftikhar and Jameel — co-accused in the case — were each sentenced to 10 years in prison, while all other suspects, including Jaffer’s parents and TherapyWorks employees, were acquitted.</p>
<p>According to the cause list available on the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s <a class="link--external" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/online-case-status/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>, “the hearing on the appeal against Jaffer’s death sentence will be held on May 13.”</p>
<p>Justice Hashim Kakar will head a three-member bench, comprising Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, that will hear the case.</p>
<p>Noor’s father, Shaukat Muqaddam’s appeal against the acquittal of Jaffer’s father, Zakir Jaffer, is also set for hearing.</p>
<p>The appeals of the convicted co-accused in the case will also be heard.</p>
<p>According to the FIR registered by her father at the time of the murder, he had discovered that his daughter had been “brutally murdered with a sharp-edged weapon and beheaded”.</p>
<p>In March 2023, the Islamabad High Court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1741974">upheld</a> the death sentence for Jaffer and also converted his 25-year jail term into another death penalty.</p>
<p>In April 2023, an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1747988">appeal</a> in the Supreme Court was filed against the IHC decision to uphold the death sentence.</p>
<p>Last year, Noor’s father had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1867225">urged</a> the SC to take up the murder case pending for more than one and a half years in the top court.</p>
<p>Mukadam, a former diplomat, had addressed a press conference to mark the birth anniversary of his slain daughter and demanded swift justice from the top court.</p></p>
