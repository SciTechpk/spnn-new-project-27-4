            <p>For the first time in 30 years, in 2024, some of the world's biggest spenders on aid and development cut funding. Now aid organizations in the Middle East are forced to seek new, potentially more demanding, donors.</p>

            <p><p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday reiterated their commitment to working together with each other for the country‚Äôs sake.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the Presidency said the two held a meeting today at the President House.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe meeting involved discussions on the country‚Äôs political, economic, and security situation. The state of law and order in the country and measures against terrorism were also discussed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prime minister briefed the president on the government‚Äôs measures to improve the economy. Both leaders reiterated their commitment to work together for the country‚Äôs stability, development, and prosperity,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>The meeting was also attended by Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Law  Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Interior  Minister Mohsin Naqvi and PM‚Äôs Adviser on Political and Public Affairs Rana Sanaullah.</p>

<p>The meeting comes in the wake of growing speculation about the upcoming 27th constitutional amendment and it being claimed that President Zardari may soon step down, potentially paving the way for the army chief to assume the country‚Äôs presidency.</p>
<p>The reports on social media claim that work is underway to replace the current parliamentary system with a presidential form of government. Some reports also claim that President Zardari has set one condition for his exit ‚Äî a key role for his son Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in the new dispensation.</p>
<p>Naqvi said earlier this month that there were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922412/dar-naqvi-allay-fears-over-breach-in-coalition">no plans</a> to remove President Zardari and dismissed the reports about any such move.</p>

<p>He had to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923413/mohsin-naqvi-rubbishes-reports-about-presidential-system">dismiss the reports again</a> last week, claiming that the country was shifting to a presidential system and that Field Marshal Asim Munir would replace Zardari as head of state.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are fully aware of who is behind the malicious campaign targeting President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the chief of army staff (COAS). I have categorically stated that there has been no discussion ‚Äî nor does any such idea exist ‚Äî about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency,‚Äù Naqvi had posted on X.</p>
<p>He said the president enjoyed a strong and respe¬≠ctful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces. ‚ÄúI know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.‚Äù</p>

                <h2>Gujranwala court dismisses post-arrest bail plea of Ahmadi man held for ‚Äòdistributing Muharram Niaz‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A Gujranwala court on Tuesday dismissed the post-arrest bail petition of an Ahmadiyya community member, who was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922568/ahmadi-man-in-gujranwala-arrested-in-blasphemy-case-for-distributing-free-food-on-ashura-police">arrested on blasphemy charges</a> for distributing Niaz (free food and drinks) on the 10th of Muharram (Youm-i-Ashur).</p>
<p>The first information report (FIR) against the suspect was lodged with the Satellite Town police station in Punjab‚Äôs Gujranwala city on the complaint of a Hafizabad Road resident under Section 298(C) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), which criminalises certain acts by members of the Ahmadi community, including calling themselves Muslims or referring to their faith as Islam.</p>
<p>In the FIR, the complainant said the incident took place on July 6 at 4:30pm when he saw the suspect distributing free food and drink during Muharram, ‚Äúposing as a Muslim‚Äù. The Ahmadi man was subsequently arrested and sent on judicial remand.</p>
<p>Gujranwala Judicial Magistrate Sidra Gul Nawaz presided over a hearing for the man‚Äôs post-arrest bail plea today.</p>
<p>The court order, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, said that the suspect was ‚Äúfound guilty‚Äù during the investigation and ‚Äúsufficient material has come on record connecting him with the commission of the offence‚Äù, adding that a large silver cooking pot with chicken biryani was recovered from him.</p>
<p>It also pointed out that the offence under Section 298(C) was related to matters concerning the religious sentiments of a particular community and carried ‚Äúserious repercussions for law and order‚Äù.</p>
<p>Thus, the order said that as a ‚Äúnecessary corollary‚Äù of the above, the post-arrest bail plea was dismissed.</p>
<p>PPP Senator Sherry Rehman had condemned the Ahmadi man‚Äôs arrest and expressed hope that the government would annul the FIR.</p>
<p>Last month, the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915235">asked</a> the Punjab police chief to prevent the Ahmadiyya community from observing Islamic rituals on the occasion of Eidul Azha and take action against its members if found violating the law.</p>
<p>In a letter, the LHCBA said that the followers of other religions and sects ‚Äî especially the Ahmadis ‚Äî are neither legally nor religiously permitted to use Islamic symbols and practices.</p>
<p>In March, the Human Rights Com¬≠¬≠mission of Pakistan (HRCP) said it had observed a growing trend of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895896/mob-led-attacks-on-ahmadis-growing-says-hrcp">mob-led attacks</a> on homes of families belonging to religious minorities, as well as their places of worship.</p>
<p>The HRCP also spoke of Ahmadis‚Äô ‚Äúarbitrary detention‚Äù, ‚Äúdesecration of their graves‚Äù and the ‚Äúvulnerability of Hindu and Christian women‚Äù to forced conversion.</p>
<p>The <a class="link--external" href="https://hrcp-web.org/hrcpweb/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2025-Under-siege-EN.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>, titled Under Siege: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2023-24, said over 750 persons were in prison on charges of blasphemy, as of October last year. It documented at least four faith-based killings, three of which targeted the Ahmadi community.</p>
<p>One of the key findings of the report said that disinformation on social media sparked most of the registered blasphemy cases.</p>
<p>HRCP observed an ‚Äúincreasing weaponisation of blasphe¬≠¬≠my laws against Ahmadis‚Äù, with cases often initiated by law enforcement officials themselves.</p></p>
