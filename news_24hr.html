            <p><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday unveiled Pakistan’s annual federal budget in a charged National Assembly session, outlining ambitious proposals to drive 4.2 per cent economic growth in the coming fiscal year while cutting back on overall spending and tightening tax measures.</p>

<p>As the session — chaired by NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq — commenced, opposition lawmakers erupted into anti-government slogans.</p>
<p>Starting his speech, the finance minister said the budget 2025-26 was being presented at a “historic moment” marked by national unity and resolve, referencing the recent Pakistan-India conflict.</p>
<p>“The spirit with which we protected our national sovereignty, we need to ensure our financial security the same way,” he maintained, continuing his speech through the noisy session.</p>
<p>“Pakistan has now achieved economic stability and is moving towards a Pakistan that is prosperous.”</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#budget-outlay" id="budget-outlay" title="Permalink"></a>Budget outlay</h2>
<p>The federal budget for fiscal year 2026 has a total outlay — the sum of expenditures and net lending of funds — of Rs17.573 trillion, representing a 6.9 per cent decrease from the previous year’s budget.</p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; padding: 89.29% 0px 0px; overflow: hidden;"></div>

<p>The government has proposed Rs16,286bn for current expenditure in the FY26 budget, a 5.33pc decrease from the previous year.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>Interest payments, or debt servicing, have contracted by 16 per cent to Rs8,207bn, yet continue to consume almost half of the total budget outlay and becoming, like in the last few years, the government’s single largest expense.</p>

<p>Defence expenditure constitutes Rs2.55tr, 20.2pc higher than last year’s budget, making up 1.97pc of GDP, an increase from last year’s 1.71pc.</p>

<p>Expanding on the defence budget later during his speech, Aurangzeb stated that officers and junior-commissioned officers would get a special relief allowance from the budget “in light of the contribution of the armed forces to defending our borders”.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#tax-collection" id="tax-collection" title="Permalink"></a>Tax collection</h2>
<p>Aurangzeb said that it was unavoidable to aim for a 14pc tax-to-GDP ratio and added that achieving the national targets was “impossible without the transformation of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).”</p>
<p>The government has set an ambitious tax collection target for the FBR at Rs14,131 billion, a 9pc increase from last year’s goal.</p>

<p>Detailing that transformation, the minister listed B2B e-voicing, AI-based audit selection systems for sales and income tax, e-billing and faceless audits, and a new central control unit to centralise data collection, among other steps.</p>

<p>Expanding upon the results, he said 390,000 high-value non-filers of tax were identified through data integration, with Rs300m recovered. The minister further highlighted that there was a 100pc increase in the number of tax filers, which took the revenue to Rs105bn.</p>
<p>“For the first time, the IMF (International Monetary Fund) has acknowledged Rs389bn revenues through law enforcement,” he said.</p>
<p>Speaking on tax revenues, he said the tax-to-GDP ratio was only 8.8pc in June 2024, which was raised to 10.3pc in the first nine months of FY2025, and would reach 10.4pc by the end of June.</p>
<p>The government’s revenue was now at 11.6pc, including the provinces’ 0.8pc contributions.</p>
<p>“The FBR has increased tax-to-GDP ratio by 1.6pc, which is historic not just in Pakistan but the world,” he asserted.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb also announced tax relief measures for the salaried class, stating that the government planned to reduce the tax slabs, “balancing inflation and take-home [income]”.</p>
<p>Those earning between Rs0.6m and Rs1.2m would pay a 2.5pc tax, those with income greater than Rs1.2m and less than Rs2.5m would pay an 11pc tax, with those earning above that and till Rs3.2m would need to pay a 23pc tax.</p>
<hr />
<div class="uCalc_467989"></div>&amp;
<hr />
<p>For the corporate sector, the minister said it was being proposed to reduce the super tax rate for corporations earning between Rs200m-Rs500m annually to 5pc.</p>
<p>The finance minister proposed that Balochistan and the merged districts in KP, which “had a leeway with taxes for the past seven years”, were now to pay sales tax starting from 10pc for five years.</p>
<p>He said an 18pc tax would be applied on imported solar panels, while online businesses and digital marketplaces would also come under the tax net.</p>
<p>However, noting that the agriculture sector was the economy’s engine of growth, Aurangzeb said no further tax on fertiliser and pesticides was being mulled.</p>
<p>He warned that those committing theft in sales tax would face strict punishments, with the right to appeal. An automated risk-based income tax adjustment would be introduced to prevent the misuse of the income tax system.</p>
<p>He further said that foreign vendors from countries having no bilateral tax agreements with Pakistan could be taxed. “A 5pc tax on items from foreign vendors has been proposed.”</p>
<p>Petrol, diesel and hybrid cars that were excluded from an 18pc sales tax would now be hit with the same tax as well, the minister said.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb said that the federal government’s non-tax revenue target would be Rs5.15tr, with pure earnings of Rs11.08tr.</p>
<p>He added that the total expenditure is aimed at Rs17.58tr, out of which Rs8.21tr would be for mark-up payments.</p>
<p>Announcing measures for the construction sector, Aurangzeb said withholding tax slabs for property buying would be reduced from 4pc to 2.5pc, from 3.5pc to 2pc, and from 3pc to 1.5pc.</p>
<p>He further said that construction loans and mortgage financing for low-cost housing, as well as a tax credit on 10-marla houses and 2,000 flats, would be introduced.</p>
<p>“To promote mortgage financing we want to get on with it, guaranteer system will be introduced,” he said.</p>
<p>Expanding on the new classification system for income tax, Aurangzeb said the difference between filers and non-filers would end. Only those who file their tax returns would be able to carry out huge transactions, including the sale and purchase of cars, and bank accounts.</p>

<p>Announcing the government’s plan to create a “competitive economy”, Aurangzeb said that economic growth in the upcoming fiscal year was expected to remain 4.2pc.</p>

<p>Regarding the fiscal deficit, the government aims for a lower target of 3.9pc of the GDP — or Rs5,037bn — from last fiscal year’s target of 5.9pc. The primary surplus would be targeted at 2.4pc of the GDP.</p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; padding: 89.43% 0px 0px; overflow: hidden;"></div>
<p>The government has set an inflation target of 7.5pc for the next fiscal year.</p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; padding: 81% 0px 0px; overflow: hidden;"></div>
<p>Pakistan’s total revenue for fiscal year 2025 is budgeted at Rs19,278 billion.</p>
<p>After accounting for provincial transfers of Rs8,206 billion, the net revenue stands at Rs11,702bn, representing a 6.7pc increase from the previous year.</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#tariffs-and-debt-management" id="tariffs-and-debt-management" title="Permalink"></a>Tariffs and debt management</h2>
<p>Detailing the steps to be taken under the National Tariff Policy, Aurangzeb said additional customs duties will come to an end in four years, regulatory duties will end in five years, Customs Act’s Schedule 5 will also be eliminated in five years, and customs duty will be structured in slabs, with the maximum being 15pc.</p>
<p>“Tariff reforms will be applied step by step so that businesses can adjust and challenges are reduced. This will apply to all economic areas, including pharma, IT, telecom, textile and engineering.”</p>
<p>Quoting the World Bank, Aurangzeb informed the NA that these instruments would lower the tariffs, bringing them to the same level as Vietnam and Indonesia.</p>
<p>He then spoke about improving debt management and said: “Our economy has been stuck in debt for two decades, paying back loans. Our debt-to-GDP ratio was 74pc two years ago. But now, it is below 70pc. We will lower it further.</p>
<p>“We are diversifying debt products, the Sukuk bond has been started and launching products is being considered.”</p>
<p>The minister stressed that reforms in loss-making state-owned enterprises were underway, along with steps being taken to reduce fiscal strain and invite investment.</p>
<p>“We will complete PIA (Pakistan International Airlines) and Roosevelt Hotel transactions this year,” he asserted.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#pensions-relief-for-govt-employees" id="pensions-relief-for-govt-employees" title="Permalink"></a>Pensions, relief for govt employees</h2>
<p>On pension reforms, the minister highlighted that the increase in pensions had been “linked” to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).</p>

<p>He noted that pensioners below the age of 70 were getting over Rs100m collectively in pensions, so a 5pc tax would be applied to their income.</p>
<p>However, there would be no tax on low-to-medium income pension-earners.</p>
<p>The minister also detailed relief for federal government employees of Grades 1-20, saying they would get a 10pc pay raise. Retired government workers would get a 7pc pension hike, while disabled employees would receive a Rs6,000 convenience allowance.</p>

<p>Speaking about the digital sector, Aurangzeb noted that Pakistan’s cybersecurity ranking was rising. “There has been $3.1bn in IT exports in the year’s 10 months, which is 21.2pc more than the previous year,” he said.</p>
<p>The minister proposed raising <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916213/pakistan-becoming-regional-it-hub">IT exports</a> to $25bn in the next five years.</p>
<p>For the IT sector, he said the government had proposed Rs4.8bn for ongoing projects under the Uraan Pakistan plan. The schemes included TV modules, a Pakistan-Korea testing facility, and a printed circuit board facility.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb informed the parliament that the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority had launched a three-year plan for financing small and medium enterprises.</p>
<p>He said that under the SME risk coverage scheme, 95,000 SMEs had received Rs300bn in funding till May 2025.</p>

<p>Regarding the energy sector, the minister said that the government needed to ensure the provision of cheap energy.</p>
<p>He said that 47 schemes and Rs90.2bn were allocated to the energy sector, including Rs840m for the Tarbela 5th Extension, Rs10.9bn for the Dasu hydel project, Rs3.5bn for the 884MW Suki-Kinari Hydropower Project, and Rs35.7bn for the Momand hydel dam.</p>
<p>The allocations for other power projects included Rs4.4bn for the Allama Iqbal Industrial City grid station, Rs1.1bn for the Quaid-i-Azam Business Park, Rs1.6bn for the 100KVA and 200KVA transformers asset performance management system, Rs2.9bn for the Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO) advanced metering infrastructure, Rs1.8bn for the Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO) getting, Rs1.9bn for the Hyderabad getting, Rs2.4bn for the Peshawar getting, Rs67.2bn for the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) clean electricity scheme, Rs3bn for five energy schemes of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan, and 1.2bn for GB grids.</p>
<p>He also mentioned the Matiari-Moro-Rahim Yar Khan Transmission Line project to strengthen transmission.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#water-policy" id="water-policy" title="Permalink"></a>Water policy</h2>
<p>Referring again to the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916097/pakistan-agreed-to-ceasefire-despite-having-upper-hand-on-condition-of-more-talks-with-india-bilawal">Pakistan-India conflict</a>, Aurangzeb stressed the need for the country to increase its water reservoirs and ensure water security.</p>
<p>Under the 2018 National Water Policy, he mentioned the goals of 10m-acre increase in water storage, 35pc reduction in water waste and 30pc increase in water-use efficiency.</p>
<p>He detailed that Rs133bn would be allocated for projects, Rs34bn for investment and Rs2bn for 15 key schemes, detailing the breakdown for various dams.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#other-sectors" id="other-sectors" title="Permalink"></a>Other sectors</h2>
<p>Aurangzeb said the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909828/hec-wb-start-review-of-higher-education-development-project">Higher Education Commission (HEC)</a> would be receiving Rs39.5bn for 170 projects, of which Rs38.5bn would be set aside for the provinces.</p>
<p>To bridge the illiteracy gap, the minister said Rs9.8bn will be allocated for 11 new Daanish Schools — four in Balochistan, three in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, three in GB and one in Islamabad.</p>
<p>He added that electric wheelchairs, laptops and other audiovisual aids would be distributed under the programme.</p>
<p>Speaking about the agricultural sector, which comprises 34pc of the economy, Aurangzeb said Rs2.64bn were earned in FY24-25, adding that the National Seed Policy 2025 and the National Agri Technology Policy 2025 had been “nearly approved”.</p>
<p>“Genetic improvement and post-harvest processes will be focused on,” he said, adding that a total of 1,000 agriculture graduates had been sent to China on government-funded programmes. He also announced five new livestock schemes.</p>
<p>The minister also spoke about the carbon levy that the government has been mulling for “fuel-consuming vehicles”, adding that there would be different tiers based on engine capacity.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb highlighted that the levy was not just to reduce pollution but to also encourage reducing fuel consumption.</p>
<p>According to Aurangzeb, the civil administration expenditure would be Rs0.97tr and power and other sectors Rs1.19bn.</p>
<p>The finance czar said that there was a 31pc <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903338">reduction in electricity prices</a>, as well as 50pc reduction in prices for protected consumers.</p>
<p>Mentioning the privatisation of distribution companies, he said: “Professional boards have been cleared of political corruption.”</p>
<p>He mentioned the $5bn investment pledge by Reko Diq and pointed out fuel price deregulation aimed to promote competition.</p>
<p>“Gold mines in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904563">Reko Diq</a> are a key part of our future. The plan’s feasibility study was completed in January,” he noted.</p>
<p>“We expect $71bn in cash flows [as well as] $7bn in tax and $8bn in royalties,” he said, terming the project a “game changer”.</p>
<p>On the topic of overseas Pakistanis, he noted $31.2bn were remitted to Pakistan, recording a 31pc increase of $10bn.</p>
<p>He affirmed that the government was taking steps for overseas Pakistanis, including an online system, civil procedure laws to prevent fraud, a quota in chartered medical schools, and civil awards for the top 15 senders.</p>
<p>Pointing out that Pakistan was one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, the minister underscored the need for foreign assistance in mitigation, noting the IMF’s $1.3bn <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893900">climate fund</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the opposition PTI “rejected” the proposed budget, calling it an “attack on the country’s economy”.</p>
<p>“The finance minister, imported from the Netherlands, employed a very regrettable attitude while presenting the budget,” PTI Secretary General Sheikh Waqqas Akram said during a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An1zZPKpY3k" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press conference</a> in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Akram termed the proposed measures the “first unnamed budget”, rather than being presented as a “public-friendly or public-crushing” one.</p>
<p>“This desperate, frustrated finance team could not even give any name to this budget,” he added, calling the plan an “economic death gallow”.</p>
<p>MNA Zartaj Gul claimed the opposition lawmakers were not provided with copies of the “secret” budget. “The finance bill’s copies did not even come to our tables […] we now went to the [NA] office and obtained its copies,” she said, after the session.</p>
<p>She said that the economic growth for FY21-22, when ex-premier Imran Khan was largely in power, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1694024#:~:text=economic%20growth%20of%205.97%20per%20cent">was 6pc</a>, while the latter governments could “not even come close to us”.</p>

<p>Before the session, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, following a meeting of the federal cabinet, questioned the contributions made to the national exchequer by the country’s elite economic group, ahead of the presentation of the budget for FY26.</p>
<p>“Today, the federal cabinet will discuss the budget and give its approval. In the previous quarter year, the entire nation has faced these challenges. This is in no way an ordinary achievement.</p>
<p>“The sacrifices the common man has made, the burden the salaried class has borne in the previous budget. They say ‘we are salaried [class] but still gave Rs400bn to the treasury […] what have the elite and the wealthy groups contributed compared to us?’,” he added.</p>
<p>“This is a question that the elite, including me, have to answer,” the premier noted.</p>
<p>He further said, “Pakistan is standing at a point where we have to take off,” adding that the country’s stability indicators were satisfactory.</p>
<p>“Be it the inflation rate, be it the policy rate, your exports increased, your remittances have seen a quantum jump, your IT exports have increased, and they have a lot of potential to increase.”</p></p>

            <p><p>In a rather noisy National Assembly session on Tuesday, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916292/budget-fy26-pakistan-targets-42pc-growth-slashes-overall-spending">presented</a> the budget for the fiscal year 2025-2026, with a total outlay of Rs17.573 trillion and an ambitious 4.2 per cent growth target.</p>
<p>In his speech, Aurangzeb said the budget was being presented at a “historic moment”, referring to the recent Pakistan-India escalation. He stressed the need for ensuring the country’s financial security in the same way that national sovereignty was protected.</p>
<p>“Pakistan has now achieved economic stability and is moving towards a Pakistan that is prosperous,” he said.</p>
<p><em>Dawn.com</em> reached out to leading economists and analysts for their key takeaways from the budget. Here’s what they had to say:</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#an-anomaly" id="an-anomaly" title="Permalink"></a>‘An anomaly’</h2>
<p>Economist Adil Nakhoda noted that the government had reduced its outlay for the current fiscal year, which, according to him, was an anomaly. “This is likely due to the significant decline in interest payments as the government’s debt as a percentage of the gross domestic product has also declined,” he said.</p>
<p>He pointed out that the increase in defence expenditures was also anticipated.</p>
<p>“Tax collection is expected to increase. This should come via an increase in the size of the tax net rather than increasing the burden on those already in the tax net,” Nakhoda said.</p>
<p>He added that the main feature of the budget was the government’s plan to undertake tariff rationalisation. “Although tariff cuts have been announced, the important task is to ensure that they are not replaced with anti-dumping duties and countervailing duties to ensure better transparency in the process.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#short-of-structural-bold-reforms" id="short-of-structural-bold-reforms" title="Permalink"></a>‘Short of structural, bold reforms’</h2>
<p>Highlighting the positive aspects of the budget, macroeconomist Sajid Amin Javed said the rationalisation of the tariff regime was a signal of opening the economy and pushing the industry to modernise and innovate. “Bringing the customs duties and other duties to zero in the next four to five years is a good policy direction.”</p>
<p>Tax simplification, he noted, was a very important aspect, as tax filing in Pakistan was complicated for layperson. “Another good thing is eliminating the non-filer category.”</p>
<p>On the flip side, Amin pointed out that on a strategic level, “this is exactly the budget that one can expect under the International Monetary Fund” — targeting stabilisation and meeting revenue targets.</p>
<p>“Most of the policy measures regarding taxation revolve around meeting revenue targets,” he said. “I feel this is a bid to correct the existing system in bits and pieces, but the bigger reforms that are often discussed, such as bringing wholesalers and retailers, and agriculture into the tax net, there wasn’t much said on it.”</p>
<p>The macroeconomist stressed that structural reforms, which were much needed to increase the tax base, were not seen. “Overall, it seems that the budget is silent on structural reforms. Even the relief, I feel, is as expected under the IMF programme.”</p>
<p>He also highlighted some contradictions in the budget. “On the other hand, we are saying we want to formalise the economy and increase financial inclusion, but we have increased taxes on withdrawing money from banks for non-filers from 0.6pc to 1pc, which I feel may discourage financial inclusion.”</p>
<p>“Overall, I feel the budget falls short on structural and bold reforms; it is a stabilisation budget formed to meet revenue targets. One more thing I am seeing is that the objective or principle guiding the budget is the incoming IMF tranche.</p>
<p>“There is no undue relief. There is an attempt to balance the fiscal discipline,” Amin added.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#rather-unremarkable" id="rather-unremarkable" title="Permalink"></a>‘Rather unremarkable’</h2>
<p>Political economist Uzair Younus believed that the budget was rather unremarkable, and that “perhaps may be the best thing about it”.</p>
<p>“This is because what is needed at this time is for the government to maintain an even keel and not give in to the historical tendency to generate growth through fiscal expansion,” he said.</p>
<p>“At the same time, however, the budgetary exercise could have been leveraged as an opportunity to signal a shift in strategy. For those left wanting reforms, perhaps the proposed trade and tariff rationalisation program will suffice in the coming months,” Younus added.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#misplaced-priorities" id="misplaced-priorities" title="Permalink"></a>‘Misplaced priorities’</h2>
<p>“There is some positive news: fiscal consolidation,” said Ali Hasanain, an associate professor of economics at LUMS. “We have reduced the budget deficit significantly, and we have run a primary budget surplus, which means that our expenditures for this year were less than the revenue.”</p>
<p>“Our debt profile will improve over time. I believe we have already seen better debt maturities in the past year, and we are going to see that the overall interest payments have gone down. Overall, the debt is moving towards stabilisation, and we are not in as bad a debt crisis as we were previously.”</p>
<p>He noted that the big changes seen could be thought of more as accounting discipline rather than structural reforms, “which means we have reduced expenses in development spending and cut subsidies”. While structural changes were missing, there was emphasis on discipline in spending, which Hasanain said was both good and bad.</p>
<p>“Thirdly, our development spending continues to look like it has distorted priorities. For example, 30pc of development spending is on transport and 5pc-6pc on education, which shows you are following an old development plan and your priorities are misplaced.”</p>
<p>Talking about the reduced tax bill for the real estate sector, he said it went against the grain of advice by most economists and international institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. “It encourages speculative investments, and it does not improve the external sector picture.”</p>
<p>Moreover, the national tariff policy saw some serious tariff reductions, Hasanain said. He explained that Pakistan, over the last decade, had substantially increased its protection of certain industries such as auto and mobile manufacturing. The raw material for these industries was imported on cheap tariffs, and the final good was imported on expensive tariffs. “This type of industry is a road to nowhere because it doesn’t make you globally competitive, nor does it increase exports.”</p>
<p>Commenting on the overall budget, he said that it was relatively disciplined but within the status quo and political constraints. “I think structural reforms and a serious reform agenda have not manifested. When that happens, change would be seen in several areas.</p>
<p>“If they actually want to transform the country, it should be done by rethinking how the country is governed,” he added.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#hard-to-discern-any-clear-direction" id="hard-to-discern-any-clear-direction" title="Permalink"></a>‘Hard to discern any clear direction’</h2>
<p>“If the 2025-26 budget proposals are truly bold or strategic, the finance minister must clearly explain how. What elements in revenue generation or spending priorities distinguish this budget as one that addresses the structural flaws in Pakistan’s economic framework?” remarked senior journalist Afshan Subohi.</p>
<p>“If a modest 2pc-4pc reduction in income tax for salaried individuals or further trade liberalisation through reduced customs duties is being positioned as revolutionary or transformative, then, respectfully, it falls short of such claims,” she said.</p>
<p>Afshan was of the opinion that the 10pc salary increase for civil servants may be a welcome move for its recipients, but its impact was limited given the small proportion of the population it benefited.</p>
<p>“In his speech a few hours ago, the finance minister made no mention of under-taxed sectors such as wholesale, retail, or any commitment to ensure enforcement of agriculture income tax laws in provinces. While he did highlight the government’s intention to raise the tax-to-GDP ratio, he overlooked the critical issue of the imbalance between direct and indirect taxes,” she commented.</p>
<p>The journalist said that there was little to indicate any serious intent to make the tax regime more progressive by reducing reliance on indirect taxes, which disproportionally burdened poor consumers. “Whatever relief may have been offered to middle-class taxpayers is likely to be offset by the hike in Petroleum Development Levy, from Rs70 to Rs100, leading to significantly higher petrol prices.”</p>
<p>“How the budgetary measures will improve the investment climate and raise the critical investment to GDP ratio has been left for the investors to decipher. On the surface, aside from a 0.5pc reduction in the super tax and a few minor adjustments, there is little in the budget to meaningfully stimulate wealth creation or accelerate job growth,” she said.</p>
<p>Afshan criticised the finance minister’s speech, saying that it lacked a sense of transparency. “Beyond the numbers, it was hard to discern any clear direction.”</p>
<p>“While the announcement to simplify tax return forms and encourage digital filing is a welcome step, several elements were presented in a way that left audiences unclear about the substance. For instance, percentage increases were disclosed for many spending categories, but when it came to the defence budget, only the total allocation of Rs2,550bn was mentioned, conveniently omitting the percentage increase over last year.</p>
<p>“This selective disclosure raises questions about the government’s commitment to full transparency,” she added.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#this-is-not-economic-strategy-its-fiscal-handcuffing" id="this-is-not-economic-strategy-its-fiscal-handcuffing" title="Permalink"></a>‘This is not economic strategy, it’s fiscal handcuffing’</h2>
<p>“The FY26 budget is yet another disappointing example of policy driven more by debt obligations than by economic reality,” said Dr Mohammad Ahmed Zubair, former chief economist at the Planning Commission of Pakistan. “After grappling with stagflation in FY23 and FY24 — high inflation paired with weak growth — the economy has now slipped into outright stagnation in FY25: low growth, cooling inflation, rising unemployment, and shrinking consumer demand.” He added that any rational policymaker would see this as a moment for stimulus — spending boosts and tax relief to jumpstart growth.</p>
<p>“Instead, what we’re getting is a tone-deaf commitment to fiscal austerity. The government plans to slash the budget deficit from 5.6pc in FY25 to 3.9pc in FY26, and raise the primary surplus target from 2.2pc in FY25 to 2.4pc in FY26. That’s not reform — it’s retreat,” he lamented, adding that tax revenues were projected to rise a staggering 19pc, while current spending (excluding debt servicing) was targeted to rise by 8.5pc in FY26.</p>
<p>“Let’s be clear: this is not economic strategy, it’s fiscal handcuffing,” he said. “The debt servicing burden is dictating national priorities. Without a serious, coordinated fiscal compact — including debt restructuring and binding safeguards against future debt mismanagement — Pakistan will remain stuck in a vicious cycle of low growth, rising inequality, and deepening social pain.</p>
<p>“It’s time to stop pretending austerity is discipline; it’s dysfunction in disguise.”</p></p>

            <p><p>The provincial government on Tuesday said it has decided to implement strict rules to improve traffic flow and prohibit parking on Karachi’s I.I. Chundrigarh Road — often known as the city’s ‘Wall Street’ — to tighten traffic regulation enforcement and improve road safety.</p>
<p>Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah issued the instructions after receiving a briefing on traffic management in the metropolis, a statement issued by his spokesperson, Abdur Rasheed Channa, said.</p>
<p>According to the statement, parking will be prohibited on I.I. Chundrigar Road, beginning from Shaheen Complex to the Merewether Tower. CM Shah also directed the authorities concerned to ban parking for all types of vehicles from Muhammad Bin Qasim Road to Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road up to the S.M. Law College.</p>
<p>I.I. Chundrigar Road, a major road in the city’s central business district, is often referred to as Karachi’s “Wall Street”. The road is a significant financial hub, serving as the location for the Pakistan Stock Exchange, major banks, and other financial institutions.</p>
<p>The chief minister was informed by traffic police authorities that parking on pavements and main roads will be banned alike, but motorists will be allowed to park their vehicles on Railway Ground.</p>
<p>Murad said that action should be taken against traffic rules violations and illegal parking, and vehicles with fancy or illegal number plates should be confiscated.</p>
<p>CM Sindh was informed that a crackdown is underway against vehicles with unregistered or non-standard number plates, and only official number plates will be acceptable. Deputy Inspector General of Police (Traffic) Pir Muhammad Shah assured the chief minister that police were taking action to ensure the implementation of traffic rules.</p>
<p>The Sindh government had recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915821">approved</a> a set of changes, including a ban on four-seater rickshaws, mandatory third-party vehicle fitness checks, and sharp increases in traffic violation fines.</p>
<p>The government made it mandatory to acquire fitness certification for both commercial and non-commercial vehicles, and outsourcing vehicle fitness evaluations to third parties. It also decided to ban the sale of tinted windows, fancy lights, and sirens, whether online or at physical shops.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915847">Fine</a> were also imposed. For wrong-way driving, the approved fines were set at Rs200,000 for government vehicles, Rs100,000 for other four-wheelers and Rs25,000 for motorcycles.</p>
<p>Driving a vehicle without a valid licence will cost a fine of Rs25,000 for motorcyclists and Rs50,000 for car drivers. One-wheeling or drifting will result in a Rs100,000 fine for a first-time offence, going up to Rs200,000 and Rs300,000 for repeated violations, the government said.</p>
<p>These decisions were taken in the backdrop of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895007">surge</a> in traffic accidents, particularly involving <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903332">dumpers</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908095">water tankers</a> that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024.</p></p>

            <p><p>Florence in Italy could hit 39C as hot weather sweeps continent, while parts of South Africa brace for snow</p><p>The severe thunderstorms that have been lashing parts of Europe over recent days are expected to give way to high temperatures this week. Several regions could climb to 10C (50F) above seasonal norms, with Italy braced for the full force of the heat. Florence in Tuscany is forecast to soar to a sweltering 39C on Thursday and across the weekend.</p><p>Germany, France and Belgium will also face hot weather from Wednesday, with widespread highs at least 9C above the June average. Many other parts of Europe are forecast to experience temperatures 5-7C above normal. This is the result of a high-pressure system creating a heat dome over the region, whereby sinking air compresses and warms as it descends, trapping heat near the surface.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/09/weather-tracker-storms-summer-heat-europe-south-africa">Continue reading...</a></p>
