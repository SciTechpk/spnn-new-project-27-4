            <p><p><strong>• Following meeting of top Indian leaders, media from across the border has been speculating about possible change in disputed region’s status<br />
• Foreign minister says internationally recognised dispute can’t be settled through amendments to local laws</strong></p>
<p>KARACHI: Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has expressed the apprehension that India is likely to make occupied Jammu a separate state, adding that any such move would be in violation of international conventions and UN Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p>He expressed the fear while addressing a rally at Islamabad’s D-Chowk on Tuesday, held to mark six years since India unilaterally <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1498227">changed</a> the special status of occupied Kashmir and bifurcated the region into the union territories of Jammu and Kash­mir, and Ladakh.</p>
<p>The move allowed the BJP government in New Delhi to control the disputed region through its lieutenant governor.</p>
<p>In recent days, the Indian media has been reporting a plan by the BJP government to give the occupied region of Jammu the status of a state.</p>
<p><em>The Hindustan Times</em> reported that a meeting of top Indian government functionaries, including the president, prime minister and home minister, took place recently, leading to speculation about an impending move on the region’s statehood.</p>
<p>The paper quoted a senior BJP leader as saying that statehood for Jammu and Kashmir was “a promise that the government has already made… and it will be done when the time is right”.</p>
<p>However, he refused to comment on speculation that a decision will be taken in the next few days.</p>
<p>Amid the speculation, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said in a post on X: “I’ve heard every possible permutation &amp; combination about what to expect in J&amp;K tomorrow so let me stick my neck out and say nothing will happen tomorrow — fortunately nothing bad will happen but unfortunately nothing positive will happen either.”</p>

<p>Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated into two union territories after the Indian parliament, on August 5, 2019, passed the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill and abrogated Articles 370 and 35 (A) that gave special powers to the region.</p>
<p><strong>‘Subservient govt’</strong></p>
<p>In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr Dar said that New Delhi may take another rash step in the next few hours, or days. He called the Aug 5, 2019, measures India’s attempt to “usurp Kashmir”.</p>
<p>“India revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and took it under the direct control of New Delhi,” he said, adding that the move was further <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1796946">consolidated</a> by the Supreme Court’s decision in 2023, which gave “stamp of approval” to the con­troversial decision. Mr Dar said Jammu and Kashmir was an internationally recognised dispute and it can’t be settled through amendments in local laws.</p>
<p>In the last six years, he said, the BJP government had amended local laws governing Kashmir; the powers of the lieutenant governor have been increased and the delimitation of the region’s legislative assembly changed to “influence the representation of Muslims in Kashmir”.</p>
<p>He said non-Kashmiris have been allowed to obtain domicile, purchase properties and become part of the voter list.</p>
<p>“All these steps were taken to make Kashmir a separate state and form a government in Srinagar which is subservient to New Delhi.” “This is unacceptable to Pakistan and its people,” the foreign minister warned.</p>

            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday dismissed petitions filed against the planned <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913654">auction</a> of five Bahria Town properties in Rawalpindi and one in Islamabad, enabling the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to proceed with the sale, scheduled for Aug 7.</p>
<p>Shortly after the issuance of a short order by the division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Asif, NAB Rawalpindi announced fresh auction of six properties of Bahria Town at NAB office in Islamabad’s Sector G-6/1.</p>
<p>The properties are being auctioned after Malik Riaz was declared an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1803717">absconder</a> in the £190 million Al-Qadir Trust case.</p>
<p>Reacting to the development, Bahria Town Chairman Malik Riaz Hussain said they were willing to participate in any arbitration and implement its decision, if they are granted a chance to “return to serious dialogue and a dignified solution”.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MalikRiaz_/status/1952732889071673567" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on his official X account, he claimed government agencies had been exerting unprecedented pressure over the past few months, which included the arrest of dozens of staff members, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918907/nab-freezes-457-properties-over-btk-land-scam">freezing</a> of the company’s bank accounts, seizure of vehicles and other stringent measures, which had paralysed all of the Bahria Town’s operations across the country.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">

<p>“The situation has reached a point where we are being forced to completely shut down all Bahria Town activities across Pakistan,” said the statement attributed to Malik Riaz.</p>
<p>“Trillions of rupees of investment by millions of Pakistanis in Bahria Town from Karachi to Lahore and Islamabad have been frozen,” he claimed.</p>

<p><strong>Court proceedings</strong></p>
<p>Representing Bahria Town in court, senior lawyer Farooq H. Naik earlier argued that NAB’s auction notice was “illegal, deceptive, and issued with mala fide intent”.</p>
<p>He said the properties were being wrongfully targeted as Bahria Town was not a party to a plea bargain agreement. He said Bahria Town was also not named as an accused in any reference related to the £190 million case. He warned that the auction would set a dangerous precedent, undermining due process and investor confidence.</p>
<p>However, NAB prosecutor Rafay Maqsood contended that Bahria Town’s chairman and his son Ali Riaz defaulted on payments after entering into a plea bargain under the £190 million settlement. As a result, NAB initiated steps to recover the outstanding amount under Section 33E of the NAB Ordinance, 1999, by auctioning the pledged properties.</p>
<p>Mr Maqsood said the petitioners approached the IHC after a trial court had dismissed a similar plea. He said the high court had initially stayed the auction on June 12, the same day when the sale was scheduled. Subsequently, NAB filed an application to vacate the stay against the auction.</p>
<p>Bahria Town’s legal team had consistently argued that the company was not involved in the £190 million corruption case, which originated from a 2019 settlement between the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) and Malik Riaz.</p>
<p>With the verdict now issued, the auction will go ahead as planned on Aug 7.</p>
<p><strong>Auction tomorrow</strong></p>
<p>After the vacation of the stay order issued by the IHC against the auction in June, the NAB announced the auction of the six properties on Thursday.</p>
<p>According to the anti-graft watchdog, successful bidders would have to pay 5pc of the value of the properties on the auction day, 10pc in a month and remaining 85pc in three months.</p>
<p>In a notification issued on Tuesday, NAB listed the six properties including corporate offices on Plots 7-D (having estimated value of Rs871m) and 7-E (estimated value of Rs881m) in Bahria Town’s Phase-II, Rawalpindi; Rubaish Marquee and Lawn in Islamabad (Rs488m), Arena Cinema (Rs1.1bn), Bahria Town International Academy (Rs1.07bn) and Safari Club (Rs1.2bn), in Bahria Town, Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>The accountability watchdog also filed a reference against Malik Riaz, some Sindh politicians and others in February over the transfer of land to Bahria Town.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929034/new-car-levy-to-power-ev-revolution' target='_blank'><strong>New car levy to power EV revolution</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: After imposing up to three per cent tax on gross sale value of conventional local and imported vehicles, the government approved a five-year subsidy scheme on Tuesday for the rollout of 116,000 electric bikes and 3,170 electric rickshaws/loaders, with an estimated cost of around Rs100bn.</p>
<p>The scheme is part of efforts to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in Pakistan, reduce oil imports, and foster environmental sustainability. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to launch the initiative on Aug 14 formally.</p>
<p>The decision was made at a meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet, which also discussed the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911526">New Electric Vehicle Adoption Levy</a> (NEVAL). The levy is expected to generate Rs122bn, which will not only fund the subsidy scheme but also meet a key <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">condition</a> of the $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, who presided over the meeting remotely, was informed that a Rs9bn subsidy had already been earmarked for electric vehicles in the current year’s budget. To fund the scheme, the government imposed a 1pc NEVAL on local and imported vehicles up to 1300cc, 2pc on vehicles between 1,300cc and 1,800cc, and 3pc on vehicles above 1,800cc.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>ECC approves Rs100bn subsidy scheme for electric bikes, rickshaws</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first phase of the subsidy will involve the distribution of 40,000 e-bikes and 1,000 e-rickshaws/loaders. The scheme will be implemented across the country, including Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, with 219 e-bikes reserved for outstanding students. The second phase will roll out the remaining 76,000 e-bikes and 2,170 e-rickshaws/loaders.</p>
<p>The ECC highlighted that the adoption of electric vehicles was crucial not only for environmental reasons but also for reducing the country’s oil import bill and utilising excess power for productive purposes. The government’s New Electric Vehicle Policy aims to raise the number of electric vehicles to 30pc of all new vehicle sales by 2030, aligning with Pakistan’s commitments under the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>One of the main barriers to the adoption of electric vehicles is the higher upfront cost compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. To address this, the subsidy scheme will focus primarily on electric two and three-wheelers, to be implemented over the next five years.</p>
<p>The financing options will include both conventional and Islamic loans, with a maximum loan size of Rs200,000 for e-bikes and Rs880,000 for e-rickshaws/loaders. The markup rate will be set at six months KIBOR plus 2.75pc, with loan tenures of two years for e-bikes and three years for e-rickshaws/loaders.</p>
<p>The government will provide a 20pc portfolio guarantee on a first-loss basis, while the debt-to-equity ratio will be 80:20. The government will contribute a maximum of Rs50,000 for an e-bike and Rs200,000 for an e-rickshaw/loader. Additionally, the government will cover the full cost of the markup, effectively making the loans interest-free for borrowers.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>To be eligible for the subsidy, applicants must be between 18 and 65 years old for e-bikes and 21 to 65 years old for e-rickshaws/loaders. The quota for rickshaws/loaders will be allocated based on provincial population, with 10pc reserved for Balochistan.</p>
<p>A minimum of 25pc of e-bike quotas will be reserved for women, and 10pc will be set aside for individuals using e-bikes for commercial purposes, such as delivery services. For e-rickshaws/loaders, priority will be given to individuals, with any remaining quota allocated to fleet operators, capped at 30pc.</p>
<p>Applications for the scheme will be processed through a digital platform, allowing for transparent tracking and selection. If demand exceeds the provincial or segment quota, applicants will be selected through an electronic balloting system. Only shortlisted manufacturers and assemblers, approved by the Engineering Development Board (EDB) based on technical capacity and financial strength, will be eligible to participate.</p>
<p>In addition to the electric vehicle scheme, the ECC approved a supplementary grant of Rs30bn, requested by the Finance Division, to settle outstanding claims from the previous fiscal year under the Telegraphic Transfer Charges Incentive Scheme. The Finance Division was also instructed to conduct a detailed assessment of the Pakistan Remittance Initiative, with recommendations due by mid-September.</p>
