            <p><p>The army’s top brass on Friday warned India of a “sure and decisive” response should it attempt to impose war, as relations deteriorated between Islamabad and New Delhi amid rising tensions after last week’s attack in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">killed 26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907228/pakistan-is-prepared-for-anything-india-might-try">reinforcing its forces</a> and India’s premier granting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">“operational freedom”</a> to the military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">expected</a> an Indian incursion within 24–36 hours, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/pm-urges-us-top-diplomat-to-make-india-dial-down-rhetoric-act-responsibly-amid-high-tension">diplomatic channels</a> have been engaged to prevent conflict.</p>
<p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907785/any-military-misadventure-by-india-will-be-met-with-swift-resolute-notch-up-response-coas">warned</a> a day ago that “any military misadventure by India will be met with a swift, resolute, and notch-up response.”</p>
<p>A <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7271" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said the army chief presided over a special session of the Corps Commanders’ Conference (CCC) at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi today in which the military brass conducted a comprehensive review of the prevailing geo-strategic environment, with particular emphasis on the current Pakistan-India standoff and the broader regional security calculus.</p>
<p>“While reaffirming Pakistan’s abiding commitment to peace, stability, and prosperity, the forum made clear that any attempt to impose war will be responded to, surely and decisively and aspirations of people of Pakistan shall be respected at all costs,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p>“The forum reaffirmed the unflinching resolve of the Pakistan Armed Forces to uphold the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country against any aggression or misadventure,” it added.</p>
<p>The ISPR said the army’s top brass reiterated that Pakistan’s path to peace and development would not be deterred by terrorism, coercion or aggression — whether directly or through proxies.</p>
<p>“Deliberate destabilisation efforts by the Indian government will be confronted and defeated with resolve and clarity,” the statement said.</p>
<p>The ISPR said COAS Munir lauded the military’s “unwavering professionalism, steadfast morale and operational preparedness”, saying that it stood in unity with the nation to defend the homeland at all costs.</p>
<p>The army chief also highlighted the critical importance of “heightened vigilance and proactive readiness” across all fronts amid the situation.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The statement said the CCC participants expressed grave concern over the “intensification of Indian atrocities” in occupied Kashmir in the attack’s aftermath, as well as the continued targeting of innocent civilians along the Line of Control by Indian occupation forces.</p>
<p>They reiterated that such “inhumane and unprovoked acts” served only to escalate regional tensions and would be met with a “resolute and proportionate response”.</p>
<p>“The forum noted, with serious concern, India’s consistent pattern of exploitation of crises to achieve political and military objectives. They have been following a predictable template — whereby internal governance failures are externalised. These incidents have often coincided with unilateral moves by India to alter the status quo, as seen in 2019 when India similarly exploited the Pulwama incident to unilaterally alter the status quo of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, through revocation of Article 370.</p>
<p>“In the latest instance, the Pahalgam episode appears to be part of a deliberate strategy to divert Pakistan’s focus away from the western front, as well as ongoing national efforts for economic revival; the two fronts where Pakistan is decisively and sustainably gaining grounds. Such diversionary tactics aimed at providing operational breathing space to Indian terror proxies will never succeed.</p>
<p>“In the same vein, the forum expressed serious concern that India is now exploiting the Pahalgam incident to undermine the longstanding Indus Waters Treaty, seeking to usurp Pakistan’s legitimate and inalienable water rights. This constitutes a dangerous attempt to weaponise water, threatening the livelihood and sustenance of over 240 million Pakistanis and escalating strategic instability in South Asia,” the ISPR said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>It added that the CCC members also “voiced deep alarm over credible evidence of direct Indian military and intelligence involvement in orchestrating terrorist activities” inside Pakistan.</p>
<p>The ISPR said these state-sponsored actions were in blatant violation of international norms and were universally unacceptable.</p>
<p>The statement said the meeting concluded with the COAS expressing “complete confidence in the operational readiness, deterrence posture and morale of all formations and strategic forces to defend the nation across the entire threat spectrum”.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#morale-is-high-thanks-to-our-army-chief-khawaja-asif" id="morale-is-high-thanks-to-our-army-chief-khawaja-asif" title="Permalink"></a>Morale is high thanks to our army chief: Khawaja Asif</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said morale was high among the armed forces and the public under COAS Munir’s command,</p>
<p>Speaking on <em>Geo News</em> programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, the defence minister lauded the army chief for his “high resolve” following today’s corps commander meeting, calling his command “befitting”.</p>
<p>“Over the past five days, the way he (the army chief) has met troops in the various cantonments, the LoC and the working boundary has contributed to high morale among the armed forces and the people,” Asif said. “God willing, the situation will be just like the communique after the corps commander meeting.”</p>
<p>The defence minister reiterated that India’s allegations held no credibility and that Indians were turning against Modi’s narrative.</p>
<p>“After the attack, they filed an FIR and levelled allegations, raising a hue and cry,” Asif said. “Reports are emerging that there were preparations for the attack and that allegations would be made against Pakistan.</p>
<p>“Till now, there is not a shred of evidence,” he added. “They carried this out for their political gains. Otherwise, there is no credibility.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The defence minister highlighted that “no country in the world” believed India’s version of events or supported them following the incident.</p>
<p>“Nobody is believing their story, even his (Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s) people and media are not standing behind it,” Asif said, noting: “He’s a desperate man, you can expect anything from him, but this is a major defeat against the narrative he has tried to create.”</p>
<p>Asked about an interview with a former indian intelligence chief, Asif said he saw the interview and noted that his diction indicated Modi’s credibility.</p>
<p>“If you base your politics on lies on such a heightened pitch … then you will ultimately fall flat on your face, and they have,” Asif said.</p>
<p>In response to a question about the potential suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and weaponisation of water, Asif said Pakistan would pursue legal action against India’s suspension of the treaty.</p>
<p>“They can’t deny us our rights [under the treaty],” Asif said. “Based on what I know of geography, the Chenab and Jhelum flow from Kashmir. Its location does not allow for them to be diverted.</p>
<p>“Architecturally, practically, this is not possible,” the defence minister said. “This is an established treaty … violating it is not easy.”</p>
<p>Asked if any diversions of waterways counted as an act of war, Asif said, “Absolutely. If they construct any structure to divert water, then we have the right to strike it; it is an act of war.</p>
<p>“For the time being, we are approaching all fora — including the IWT — and pursuing action.”</p></p>

            <p><p>Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Shehzad on Friday said the country’s International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme was “completely on track”, noting a smooth review process despite reports that India had raised concerns with the lenders over Pakistan’s loans and sought a review.</p>
<p>Relations between the two neighbouring countries turned hostile following an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">rejected</a> the accusation and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the attack, India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274">suspended</a> the Indus Water Treaty, and the two countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907663#:~:text=PAF%E2%80%99s%20prompt%20response.-,Airspace%20concerns,-With%20tensions%20running">closed their airspace</a> to each other’s airlines.</p>
<p>Pakistan secured a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845536">$7 billion bailout programme</a> from the IMF last year and was granted a new $1.3bn <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900322">climate resilience loan</a> in March.</p>
<p>The IMF Executive Board will meet on May 9 to discuss the country’s staff-level agreement for a new arrangement, along with the first review of Pakistan’s ongoing bailout programme, the global lender said earlier this week.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em> today, Shehzad said that the programme was “completely on track” and the review was “done well”.</p>
<p>He said that they conducted “very productive meetings” with the IMF, World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other International Financial Institutions.</p>
<p>“While in the spring meetings in DC, we did about 70 meetings within (a) span of six days,” he said, adding that interest was very high for investing and supporting Pakistan as the economy turned around and raters gave a positive outlook while upgrading the ratings as well.</p>
<p>Separately, India raised concerns with the IMF on its loans to Pakistan, asking for a review, a government source told <em>Reuters</em> without elaborating.</p>
<p>The IMF and India’s finance ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment by <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>The programme is critical to the $350bn economy and Pakistan said it has stabilised under the bailout that helped it stave off a default threat.</p>
<p>The soaring tensions between the two countries have drawn global attention and calls for cooling tempers.</p>
<p>US Vice President JD Vance said <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907930/us-hopes-that-indias-response-to-pahalgam-attack-doesnt-lead-to-broader-regional-conflict-vance">yesterday</a> that Washington hoped Pakistan would cooperate with India to hunt down the assailants.</p>
<p>“And we hope, frankly, that Pakistan, to the extent that they’re responsible, cooperates with India to make sure that the terrorists sometimes operating in their territory are hunted down and dealt with,” Vance had said.</p></p>

            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday urged Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies to impress upon India to de-escalate and defuse tensions in South Asia in the wake of plummeting ties between the two countries following last week’s militant attack in occupied Kashmir, the <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.app.com.pk/national/pm-shares-developments-in-south-asia-with-kuwait-ambassador-since-pahalgam-incident/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Associated Press of Pakistan</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>The April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults on civilians in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">rejected</a> the accusation and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe.</a></p>
<p>As tensions continue to simmer in light of the attack, Pakistan on Thursday had engaged a host of friendly nations, including <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907760/pm-shehbaz-thanks-china-for-endorsing-pakistans-proposal-of-neutral-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">China</a>, to seek their support for de-escalation measures between the nuclear states and to take them into confidence regarding the ‘weaponisation’ of the Indus Waters Treaty by India.</p>
<p>A press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said PM Shehbaz continued his engagements with other countries over the current political climate in the region.</p>
<p>“He urged brotherly countries, including Saudi Arabia, to put pressure on India to reduce tensions in the region. He reiterated Pakistan’s desire for peace and stability in South Asia,” the PMO statement said of his meeting with Saudi Ambassador to Pakistan Nawaf bin Saeed Al-Maliki.</p>

<p>The premier made a similar request in a separate meeting with Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to Pakistan Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al-Zaabi. PM Shehbaz also met Ambassador of the State of Kuwait Nasser Abdulrahman Jasser.</p>
<p>While sharing Pakistan’s stance with the ambassadors on the recent situation in South Asia following the Pahalgam incident, the prime minister said that Pakistan condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.</p>
<p>“It had rendered great sacrifices in its counter-terrorism efforts over the years. This was done not only to protect Pakistan but the entire world,” the prime minister said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He outrightly rejected “baseless Indian accusations” linking Pakistan to the Pahalgam incident without any evidence and reiterated his call for a transparent and neutral international investigation into the incident.</p>
<p>Emphasising the government’s complete focus on consolidating the hard-earned economic gains of the past 15 months, the prime minister said it was “inconceivable for Pakistan to act irresponsibly to jeopardise its achievements and derail the country from the path of economic progress” or take such an action that could imperil regional peace and security.</p>
<p>The prime minister thanked the Saudi leadership and people for always standing in solidarity with Pakistan through thick and thin.</p>
<p>The Saudi ambassador thanked the prime minister for sharing his views on this important issue and said that Saudi Arabia wanted to work with Pakistan for peace and security in the region.</p>
<p>During the meeting with the UAE ambassador, the prime minister thanked the UAE for its unwavering support to Pakistan, saying it “bore testament to the historic, deep-rooted, fraternal ties between the two countries”.</p>

<p>The UAE ambassador thanked PM Shehbaz for sharing Pakistan’s position and said that the UAE would work closely with Pakistan to maintain regional peace and security.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz shared that Pakistan was reaching out to other friendly countries to present its position on the current crisis.</p>
<p>During the meeting with the Kuwait ambassador, the prime minister noted the strong, historic, brotherly relations between Kuwait and Pakistan.</p>
<p>The premier said that he looked forward to the visit of Crown Prince Sheikh Sabah Al-Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah at the earliest possible time.</p>
<p>The Kuwaiti ambassador thanked PM Shehbaz for sharing Pakistan’s position and affirmed that Kuwait shared Pakistan’s vision for regional peace and security.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907878/pakistan-presses-diplomatic-gains-as-tensions-simmer">contacted</a> Qatar’s ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani and Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong a day ago regarding the situation.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The Gulf states — traditionally viewed as friendly toward India due to strong economic ties and the presence of a large Indian diaspora — have chosen a measured, noncommittal approach amid the tensions. Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar have all issued statements emphasising de-escalation and peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>These responses were less about backing India’s position and more about protecting their own strategic interests.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also continued his engagements and held a telephonic conversation with Panama FM Javier Eduardo Martinze-Acha Vasquez.</p>
<p>Dar briefed him on the current regional situation, including India’s “inflammatory propaganda and its illegal unilateral actions against Pakistan”, including holding in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty in a clear violation of international law, according to a Foreign Office press release.</p>
<p>FM Vasquez emphasised that both sides should exercise restraint.</p>
<p>Being non-permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the two sides reaffirmed their commitment to international peace and security.</p>

<p>Dar also held a similar talk with Denmark FM Lars Løkke Rasmussen, briefing him on the evolving regional situation and the measures taken by the National Security Committee in response to India’s actions.</p>

<p>He strongly rejected India’s decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, saying it was a clear violation of treaty provisions and international law.</p>
<p>Dar underscored Pakistan’s resolve to safeguard its sovereignty and national interests, while contributing to regional peace and security.</p>
<p>Expressing concern over the escalation, FM Rasmussen emphasised the importance of both sides exercising restraint.</p>
<p>“The two leaders agreed to maintain close contact on regional and global developments, particularly at the UNSC, as non-permanent members.</p>
<p>“They also agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation, especially in areas of economy and investment, as well as promoting high-level exchanges,” the FO said.</p></p>
