            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/india-attacks-pakistans-air-bases-pakistan-retaliates' target='_blank'><strong>India attacks Pakistan’s air bases, Pakistan retaliates</strong></a>
            <p><p>Early morning missile attacks from India prompted a retaliatory response from Pakistan, which has termed its new operation against its neighbouring country as ‘Bunyan-um- Marsoos’.</p>
<p>At around 3:30am on Saturday, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has said that India has targeted the Pakistan Air Force’s (PAF) Nur Khan (Chaklala, Rawalpindi), Murid (Chakwal) and Rafiqui (Shorkot in Jhang district) air bases, adding that all assets of the air force remained safe.</p>
<p>While speaking at a press conference, he said that India was “pushing the whole region towards a dangerous war with its madness, aggression and deceit”. The DG ISPR also said that India had fired missiles at Afghanistan and used drones to conduct attacks as well.</p>
<p>The military spokesperson said that “the majority” of Indian missiles fired at PAF’s airbases were intercepted by air defence systems of the armed forces.</p>
<p>He noted that the few Indian missiles that were not intercepted and “sneaked in” have “not been able to cause any damage” to PAF’s flying assets as per the initial damage assessment reports.</p>
<p>The DG ISPR said that the air defence systems of the armed forces were able to “successfully prevent the desired objectives of India”.</p>
<p>He said the missiles and drone attacks by India on Afghanistan shortly after attacks on the territory of Indian Punjab were “part of a larger sinister plan to push the region and beyond into havoc”.</p>
<p>The DG ISPR said that the PAF has the electronic signatures of all Indian missiles, including “from where they were initiated and what was targeted”.</p>
<p>The military’s chief spokesperson assured the nation that the armed forces are “vigilant and thwarting all these cowardly acts of aggression by Indians”.</p>
<p>“These blatant acts of aggression by India actually reflect the paranoia within Indian mindset which continues to grow after failure of each of this act and the paranoia continues to also grow once it realises that they cannot break the resolve and will of the people of Pakistan which actually strengthens and further grows with each such cowardly act.”</p>
<p>He further said that this “growing frustration and paranoia” of the Indians would be “further compounded”.</p>
<p>At 4:38am, state-run <em>PTV News</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1920986800597668347" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that the Pakistani military had launched its counter-attack against Indian aggression.</p>

<p>At 5:52am, <em>PTV News</em> and <em>Radio Pakistan</em> said that the Pakistani military has destroyed a storage site of the Brahmos missiles in India’s Beas region as part of its retaliatory operation ‘Bunyan-um-Marsoos’.</p>
<p>In a statement, they reported that attacks were ongoing at more places in India.</p>
<p>The statement added that an air base in Udhampur and an airfield in Pathankot were also destroyed.</p>

<p>Federal Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan also confirmed that Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos has been launched against the “enemy”.</p>
<p>“Long live Pakistan — May Allah protect our falcons,” the minister <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/abdul_aleemkhan/status/1921005151843676521" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a post on X.</p>
<p>PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said that Pakistan had responded with precision and strategic integrity by targeting only Indian military targets tonight.</p>
<p>“In tonight’s unprovoked attack by India once again, civilian populations have been indiscriminately attacked in Pakistan,” Rehman said. “This is the clear difference.”</p>
<p>At 6:13am, <em>PTV News</em> said in a video update that the storage site of the Brahmos was destroyed.</p>

<p>At 6:50am IST (6:20am PKT), <em>The Times of India</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-pakistan-tensions-live-updates-loc-military-bases-border-airstrikes-drone-attacks-jammu-rajasthan-punjab-blackout/liveblog/121015783.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that explosion-like sounds were heard in Punjab’s Pathankot district early on Saturday morning,</p>
<p>“The blasts, reported around 5am, however, have not yet been officially acknowledged by authorities. A blackout was enforced in Pathankot on Friday night, with officials urging residents to remain indoors as a precautionary measure,” it said.</p>
<p><em>PTV News</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1921014733466906801" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> at 6:29am that Pakistani drones were active in the skies of India’s capital New Delhi.</p>
<p>Soon after, the government <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/GovtofPakistan/status/1921016805595763101" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X that Pakistan had targeted key Indian military installations in a “befitting response” as part of its retaliatory operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos’.</p>
<p>“These actions are being carried out in response to India’s initial attack, which was an assault on our homeland, people and sovereignty,” the statement said, referring to Indian missile strikes against the PAF’s three airbases.</p>
<p><em>PTV News</em> further reported at 7:13am that PAF’s JF-17 Thunder’s hypersonic missiles have destroyed India’s S-400 system in Adampur. It added that the S-400 air defence system is worth approximately $1.5 billion.</p>
<p><em>PTV News</em> also said that most Indian websites, including the BJP’s official website and the Border Security Forces (BSF), have been hacked as Pakistan’s counterattack continues.</p>
<p>Other hacked websites included the Crime Research Investigation Agency, the Mahanagar Telecommunication Company Limited, the Bharat Earth Movers Limited, All India Naval Technical Supervisory Staff Association, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, Unique Identification Authority of India.</p>
<p>“Data leaked sites include Indian Air Force, Maharashtra Election Commission and others,” the statement added. “In addition, more than 2,500 surveillance cameras have also been hacked.”</p>

<p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar spoke to <em>Geo News</em> around 7am and said that Pakistan is operating on the defensive and had no choice but to retaliate to India’s military actions.</p>
<p>“The <em>tamasha</em> [circus] that India has done in the past three days, we will not let India claim hegemony. The Pakistan Armed Forces and government are determined that this will not happen.</p>
<p>“This operation that we started today, it will all end in some way. It all depends on what India wants,” he said.</p>
<p>“Pakistan had no choice, so our civil military leadership made the decision following the attack on Nur Khan Air Base. No more patience. We are just giving them a response.</p>
<p>“We’ve exhibited a lot of patience so far. There is a threshold which we cannot go beyond, especially when it comes to hypocrisy and double standards,” he said.</p>

            <p><p>• FO slams New Delhi’s war hysteria, says Pakistan still considers Indus treaty in force<br />
• Saudi minister arrives in Islamabad with message of concern, calls for de-escalation</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: South Asia — home to nearly one-fifth of the world’s population — can ill-afford the irresponsible actions like the ones being <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">carried out</a> by India, Pakistan’s Foreign Office <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909746/unfortunate-that-indias-reckless-conduct-brought-two-nuclear-armed-states-closer-to-major-conflict-fo">said</a> on Friday.</p>
<p>At the weekly press briefing, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said: “It is most unfortunate that India’s reckless conduct has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict.”</p>
<p>His remarks came ahead of a meeting between Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir and PM Shehbaz Sharif and other top state functionaries. The Saudi official had travelled to Pakistan on Friday after completing an official visit to India.</p>
<p>According to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Riyadh’s emissary “expressed heartfelt condolences over the loss of precious civilian lives”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>He said the kingdom was deeply concerned about the current situation in South Asia, and reiterated his country’s call for de-escalation, as well as peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes between Pakistan and India, in accordance with international law and the UN Security Council’s relevant resolutions, the PMO said.</p>
<p>While discussing the prevailing situation in South Asia, the PM strongly condemned India’s missile and drone strikes against Pakistan that had resulted in the martyrdom of scores of innocent civilians, including women and children, as well as damage to civilian infrastructures.</p>
<p>He stressed that India’s unprovoked and unjustified acts of aggression had violated Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and seriously endangered regional peace and stability.</p>
<p>Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar received Adel Al-Jubeir at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and exchanged views on the evolving regional situation.</p>
<p><strong>FO briefing</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, at the weekly briefing, the FO spokesperson said that in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, the Indian leadership has “once again used the bogey of terrorism to advance its sham narrative of victimhood, jeopardising regional peace.”</p>
<p>“India’s jingoism and war hysteria should be a source of serious concern for the world,” he added.</p>
<p>The spokesperson reiterated that Pakistan rejected any attempt to link it to the attack in Pahalgam.</p>
<p>He noted that a number of countries and international organisations had called on both countries to exercise restraint over the past two weeks, and it was “highly deplorable that India did not pay heed to these calls”.</p>
<p>“The international community should hold India accountable for its irresponsible, unlawful and belligerent conduct,” he said.</p>
<p>“The assertion that Pakistan escalated the situation through the Pahalgam attack of April 22 is totally absurd. To date, India has not been able to produce any credible and verifiable evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the attack.</p>
<p>“To the contrary, the acts of aggression committed by its armed forces had the approval and support of its entire government,” he said. “Thus, it is India that has escalated the situation by violating Pakistan’s sovereignty and killing civilians.”</p>
<p>He said that “the Pakistani forces did not attack Pahalgam, but the Indian forces did attack multiple locations in Pakistan,” adding that Pakistan reserves the right to take all measures in its self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter.</p>
<p>The spokesperson noted that on April 26, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had called for a “neutral and transparent” investigation into the Pahalgam attack, yet “India chose the path of belligerence and aggression.”</p>
<p>The FO spokesperson also said Indian claims of targeting terrorists or terrorist infrastructure “are blatantly false [and] it is a matter of record that Indian strikes resulted in the martyrdom of civilians, including women and children.”</p>
<p>Mr Khan said “the current Indian dispensation is bent upon weaponising water; holding in abeyance of IWT is unilateral and illegal.</p>
<p>“Pakistan is an agrarian economy. Millions of people are dependent on the water being regulated by the treaty. The Indian decision is equivalent to an attack on the people of Pakistan and the economy.</p>
<p>“For Pakistan, the Indian announcement is of no legal consequence. The treaty remains enforced and fully binding on the parties,” he said.</p>

<p>The approval unlocks a total of $2.1bn for Pakistan, including the $1.4bn under the RSF programme, which spans 28 months and is designed to bolster the country’s resilience to climate-induced shocks.</p>
<p>In March, the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan on this new climate financing arrangement, alongside the first review of the 37-month, $7bn EFF programme that was approved in September 2024 — Pakistan’s 24th IMF-supported programme to date.</p>

<p>According to the IMF, this assistance is intended to help Pakistan build resilience and enable sustainable growth.</p>
<p>During Friday’s IMF Exe­cutive Board meeting, India abstained from the vote. Ahead of the decision, Indian officials had raised objections, alleging misuse of global funds by Pakistan — claims that Islam­abad has consistently rejected as politically motivated.</p>
<p>India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated on Thursday that New Delhi had instructed its representative at the IMF to raise concerns over Pakistan’s eligibility for international financing. He also called on international institutions, including the World Bank and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), to reassess Pakistan’s status.</p>
<p><strong>Progress in restoring stability</strong></p>
<p>Following the board discussion, Deputy Managing Director Nigel Clarke said in a statement that Pakistan had made important progress in restoring macroeconomic stability despite a challenging environment.</p>
<p>“Since the approval of the EFF, the economy continues to recover, with inflation sharply lower and external buffers notably stronger. Risks to the outlook remain elevated, however, particularly from global economic policy uncertainty, rising geopolitical tensions, and persistent domestic vulnerabilities.”</p>
<p>He said the steadfast implementation of the FY2025 budget and the passage of key fiscal reforms, notably the Agricultural Income Tax, underpinned the process of rebuilding policy making credibility.</p>
<p>“Continuing to mobilise greater revenue from undertaxed sectors and the noncompliant will make the tax system more equitable and efficient. This, combined with federal and provincial spending discipline, will strengthen sustainability, build resilience, and reduce the public sector’s crowding out of private credit.”</p>
<p>According to the IMF official’s statement, the timely implementation of power tariff adjustments had helped reduce the stock and flow of circular debt. “Meanwhile, cost-side reforms are showing early signs of success but need to be accelerated to safeguard the energy sector’s viability and improve Pakistan’s competitiveness.”</p>
<p>He also credited the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) tight monetary policy stance as being pivotal in reducing inflation to historic lows. “Monetary policy should remain appropriately tight and data-dependent to ensure inflation is anchored within the SBP’s target range. A more flexible exchange rate will facilitate the adjustment to external and domestic shocks, aiding the rebuilding of reserves.”</p>
<p>He also called for prompt action to address undercapitalised financial institutions and extolled vigilance over the financial sector are necessary for financial stability.</p>
<p>“Accelerating structural reforms will unlock Pakistan’s competitiveness, creating conditions to attract high-impact private investment. Reform priorities include reducing trade and investment barriers, advancing SOE reforms, and decisively strengthening governance and anti-corruption institutions.</p>
<p>On the new RSF, Mr Clarke said it would help reduce Pakistan’s vulnerability to extreme weather events, and enhance macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability.</p>
<p>“The reforms under the RSF aim to build resilience to natural disasters by strengthening public investment processes, supporting efficient use of scarce water resources, strengthening coordination of natural disaster response and financing, improving the information on climate-related risks, and supporting Pakistan in meeting its international commitments.”</p>
<p><strong>PM lauds economic team</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction over the IMF approval of the $1bn tranche for Pakistan, slamming India for what he described as failed underhanded tactics to sabotage the programme, APP reported.</p>
<p>In a statement issued by the PM Office, Shehbaz Sharif lauded Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal and the entire economic team for their role in securing the crucial IMF support.</p>
<p>India’s desperate moves to sabotage the IMF programme have failed, he said, adding that international financial institutions have rejected India’s false narrative. The prime minister emphasised that the approved IMF tranche would help stabilise the country’s economy and guide it towards long-term recovery.</p>
