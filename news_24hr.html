            <p><p>Karachi’s central mourning procession of Ashura commenced at Nishtar Park on Sunday amid tight security, police said.</p>
<p>Yaum-i-Ashura is observed every year on Muharram 10 with solemnity to pay homage to Imam Husain — the grandson of Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) — and other martyrs of Karbala.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Karachi Traffic Police issued a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921828">traffic plan</a> for Muharram 8 to 10, outlining the procession routes as well as alternative traffic flows.</p>
<p>Stringent security measures are being taken across the country, such as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920725/army-to-be-deployed-across-country-for-security-during-muharram">army deployment</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919931">crackdown</a> on sectarian content and hate mongers, ahead of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920308">Ashura</a> (Muharram 10), being observed today.</p>
<p>The Ashura majlis in Karachi commenced at Nishtar Park, according to an alert from the police. “The number of participants is approximately 3500 to 4000 and it is being led by Shahenshah Hussain Naqvi.”</p>
<p>Traffic has been closed from main Numaish to MA Jinnah Road up to Kharadar  Husseinia Irania Imam Bargah, with the exception of Bab-e-Urdu Chowk, Karachi traffic police said in a post on X.</p>

<p>A total of 7,004 police personnel are present for surveillance and security for the main procession.</p>
<p>Additionally, 733 NGOs, as well as senior officers of Karachi Police, and 6,271 head constables and constables are performing duty today. Expert police snipers have also been deployed alongside the main procession.</p>
<p>“Traffic police officers and personnel have been deployed to maintain traffic flow on the main procession routes and crossings, including alternative traffic routes arranged for the 10th Muharram procession, so as to keep the traffic flowing by keeping the public safe from any inconvenience,” said a statement from the office of Karachi’s additional inspector general of police.</p>
<p>“Karachi Police is providing complete security to the mourners participating in the 10th Muharram processions.”</p>
<p>The statement urged the public to keep an eye on their surroundings and immediately inform the police on Madadgar 15 of any suspicious or unusual situation.</p>
<p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid rich tribute to the sacrifice of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) and his companions, saying that Ashura gives us a message of sacrifice, truthfulness, sincere determination, and standing up for the truth.</p>
<p>In their separate messages on Yaum-i-Ashura, they urged the nation to uphold the values and principles of fortitude and courage demonstrated by the martyrs of Karbala and to exhibit perseverance in the face of trials, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>President Zardari said that Karbala is a symbol of an eternal struggle against falsehood. “This day is not only an unparalleled story of sacrifice, loyalty, and patience but also a bright lamp that shows the path of truth and righteousness in the darkness of every era.”</p>
<p>In his message, PM Shehbaz said: “Karbala teaches us that although the path of truth is difficult, it is the path that leads to the pleasure of Allah Almighty and the satisfaction of hearts and eternal prosperity.”</p>
<p>He said the message of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) is not limited to his time but is a universal message, which even today convinces us that a Muslim stands for the truth, supports the oppressed, and advocates justice in all circumstances.</p></p>

            <p><p>Elon Musk, an ex-ally of US President Donald Trump, said on Saturday he had launched a new political party in the United States to challenge what the tech billionaire described as the country’s “one-party system.”</p>
<p>The world’s richest person — and Trump’s biggest political donor in the 2024 election — had a bitter <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915756">falling out</a> with the president after leading the Republican’s effort to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891574">slash</a> spending and cut federal jobs as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).</p>
<p>Musk has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921560/trump-musk-revive-feud-over-big-beautiful-tax-cut-bill">clashed</a> with Trump over the president’s massive domestic spending <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922374">plan</a>, saying it would explode the US debt, and vowed to do everything in his power to defeat lawmakers who voted for it.</p>
<p>Now he has created the so-called America Party, his own political framework, through which to try and achieve that.</p>
<p>“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste &amp; graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” the SpaceX and Tesla boss posted on X, the social media platform that he owns.</p>
<p>“Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”</p>

<p>Musk cited a poll — uploaded on Friday, US Independence Day — in which he asked whether respondents “want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system” that has dominated US politics for some two centuries.</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#laser-focus-on-vulnerable-lawmakers" id="laser-focus-on-vulnerable-lawmakers" title="Permalink"></a>‘Laser-focus’ on vulnerable lawmakers</h2>
<p>It is not clear how much impact the new party would have on the 2026 mid-term elections, or on the presidential vote two years after that.</p>
<p>The Trump-Musk feud reignited in dramatic fashion late last month as Trump pushed Republicans in Congress to ram through his massive domestic agenda in the form of the One Big Beautiful Bill.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Musk expressed fierce opposition to the legislation and ruthlessly attacked its Republican backers for supporting “debt slavery.”</p>
<p>He vowed to launch a new political party to challenge lawmakers who campaigned on reduced federal spending only to vote for the bill, which experts say will pile an extra $3.4 trillion over a decade onto the US deficit.</p>
<p>“They will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth,” Musk said earlier this week.</p>
<p>After Musk heavily criticised the flagship spending bill — which eventually passed Congress and was signed into law — Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921414">threatened</a> to deport the tech tycoon and strip federal funds from his businesses.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to take a look,” the president told reporters when asked if he would consider deporting Musk, who was born in South Africa and has held US citizenship since 2002.</p>
<p>On Friday, after posting the poll, Musk laid out a possible political battle plan to pick off vulnerable House and Senate seats and become “the deciding vote” on key legislation.</p>
<p>“One way to execute on this would be to laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts,” Musk posted on X.</p>
<p>All 435 US House seats are up for grabs every two years, while about one third of the Senate’s 100 members, who serve six-year terms, are elected every two years.</p>
<p>Some observers were quick to point out how third-party campaigns have historically split the vote — as businessman Ross Perot’s independent presidential run in 1992 did when it helped doom George H.W. Bush’s re-election bid, resulting in Democrat Bill Clinton’s victory.</p>
<p>“You are pulling a Ross Perot, and I don’t like it,” one X user wrote to Musk.</p></p>

            <p><p>• Deputy PM says PML-N won’t abandon PPP despite having better strength in parliament now<br />
• Interior minister dismisses reports about president’s removal, says two parties, army ‘on same page’<br />
• PPP leader claims party in no mood to join federal or Punjab cabinet</p>
<p>LAHORE: Two key federal ministers on Saturday dismissed speculations regarding the disintegration of the PML-N-PPP alliance, saying the two parties, and even the army were “on the same page”.</p>
<p>However, the enthusiasm regarding the coalition was a bit more diminished among PPP leaders who accepted having differences with the ruling party and also stressed the party has no desire to take ministries in the federal government.</p>
<p>While talking to the media in Lahore, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that the PML-N’s total seats in the National Assembly have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921643/ruling-coalition-given-two-thirds-majority-as-ecp-distributes-reserved-seats">increased</a> after the distribution of reserved seats in light of the Supreme Court’s order but the party was in no mood to shun PPP.</p>
<p>“The Bilawal-led party stood by the government during difficult times and we have instructions from Nawaz Sharif that in the times of stability, we must not abandon those who had supported us in challenging times.”</p>
<p>He said the PPP was a key ally of the federal government and would remain so. “We have an ideal working relationship. We [the PML-N] had formed the government with the help of the PPP,” he said while talking to reporters.</p>
<p>He acknowledged the critical support by PPP, without which the ruling coalition wouldn’t have come to power after the 2024 general elections.</p>
<p><strong>‘No change in top office’</strong></p>
<p>Also, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi during an interaction with the media in Sukkur said that there were no plans to remove President Asif Zardari and dismissed the reports about any such move.</p>
<p>He said the government, army, and the president were “fully aligned and on the same page”.</p>
<p>“Those who don’t want to see them united are spreading such rumours.”</p>
<p>Speculations about widening gap emerged as both parties, allies in the Centre, started jostling to strengthen their ranks by wooing disgruntled PTI leaders in Azad Jammu and Kashmir while the PTI leadership addressed pressers to declare that they would foil attempts to dislodge KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur amid political wrangling over reserved seats.</p>
<p>In AJK, the PML-N formally inducted a PTI defector into its parliamentary party, raising its strength in the 53-member Legislative Assembly to nine. Chaudhry Akmal Sargala, who was elected in 2021 from LA-37 (Jammu-IV), a Kashmiri refugees’ constituency in Punjab, announced his switch to PML-N on Friday.</p>
<p>Mr Sargala’s decision comes just days after the PPP pulled off a similar move, managing to break away four lawmakers elected on PTI tickets in 2021. These lawmakers included Ali Shan Soni, Shahida Sagheer, Chaudhry Rafique Nayyar and Javed Butt.</p>
<p>Following these inclusions, the strength of the PPP parliamentary party in AJK Assembly has risen to 17.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Earlier, speculations that the PPP might join the cabinet in Centre and Punjab started making rounds after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif claimed, “There is a growing possibility of an arrangement between the PML-N and PPP that will allow both parties to jointly pursue a national agenda.”</p>
<p>When Deputy PM Dar was asked about the move, he told reporters in Lahore that the PPP had not demanded any ministries from the PML-N.</p>
<p>While PPP, over the past year, publicly shunned the idea of joining the federal and provincial cabinets, some of its leaders proposed taking the ministries as all the party has supported the PML-N on every other matter.</p>
<p><strong>‘Take ministries or quit’</strong></p>
<p>Senate chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani, a PPP leader, also recently proposed to the party leadership that they either join the government or leave the coalition and go to the public.</p>
<p>Some party leaders believe that after 17 months of robust support for the PML-N in the Centre, the time has now arrived for the PPP to consider whether it should take ministries in both the federal and Punjab governments.</p>
<p>One issue where PPP leaders think the party went above and beyond its role as a “silent coalition partner” to support the government was in the aftermath of the conflict with India.</p>
<p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911700">travelled</a> to different countries “playing the role of a foreign minister” to fight Pakistan’s case against India in the world, a PPP leader from Punjab told <em>Dawn</em> on Saturday.</p>
<p>The PPP called Foreign Minister Dar’s portfolio “ceremonious” and added that it would be better if his party joined the government and Mr Bhutto-Zardari became the foreign minister officially.</p>
<p>Amid this jostling, Mr Dar said the PML-N would work with all parties, including those in the opposition.</p>
<p><strong>‘Wishful thinking’</strong></p>
<p>However, he ruled out any meeting between PML-N president Nawaz Sharif and PTI patron-in-chief Imran Khan at Adiala Jail in the coming days, calling it “wishful thinking”.</p>
<p>“We don’t need to go to someone … However, [with regard to Imran Khan], the law will take its own course.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PPP Secretary General Humayun Khan said his party had been offered ministries by the PML-N in the Centre and Punjab, but it was not interested in joining the cabinets.</p>
<p>“The PML-N has offered cabinet positions to us, but the party is not interested in joining the cabinet as it has reservations on some issues,” said Mr Khan</p>
<p>He said the two parties have “different ideologies and stances” on various issues.</p>
