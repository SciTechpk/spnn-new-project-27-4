                <h2>CM Murad notes faint tremors ‚Äògood thing‚Äô as seismic activity continues in Karachi</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Tuesday said low-intensity tremors helped prevent major earthquakes as he attempted to allay <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915165/sindh-ig-says-78-of-213-escaped-prisoners-from-karachis-malir-jail-recaptured">panic</a> caused by the recent seismic activity that continued for the third day in Karachi.</p>
<p>The metropolis continued to witness faint tremors today, taking the tally since Sunday to 20, according to data provided by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD). Experts have previously <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say">pointed out</a> that such minor seismic activities ‚Äúpreempt‚Äù high-intensity earthquakes by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have also studied engineering [‚Ä¶] these (low-scale tremors) are a good thing. The earth is releasing its energy,‚Äù CM Shah said, responding to reporters‚Äô queries about yesterday‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915165/sindh-ig-says-78-of-213-escaped-prisoners-from-karachis-malir-jail-recaptured">jail break incident</a> in Karachi.</p>
<p>He explained that if the earth releases its seismic energy altogether, it could result in a major earthquake. ‚ÄúBut if it releases in bits, then it is better ‚Äî nothing is actually better ‚Äî but saves us from a big disaster,‚Äù Murad added.</p>
<p>The most recent tremor occurred at 11:52am and measured 2.0 on the Richter scale, with its <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/WKp4SfRW8Va3WHG36" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">epicentre</a> located 23 kilometres east of Malir, according to the PMD‚Äôs data.</p>
<p>Since Sunday ‚Äî when the series of minor quakes <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914834/karachi-experiences-36-magnitude-quake-with-quaidabad-as-epicentre">began</a> ‚Äî the total of tremors recorded near <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/tWkP5ThpLy3m5iDY6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Malir</a> is nine, five near the Defence Housing Authority, three near <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/f3E8rzVKFY8BwcbR6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quaidabad</a>, along with one each near <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/9jxYCPXSRymYrGTa7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gadap Town</a>, <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rocRpWYWyMR7GGUd9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Korangi</a> and <a class="link--external" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/2Us67F7ygbKS7aAT9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DHA City</a> on the outskirts of Karachi.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914834/karachi-experiences-36-magnitude-quake-with-quaidabad-as-epicentre">3.6-magnitude jolt</a> from Sunday evening was the most significant, while the lowest measured was of 2.0 magnitude from today morning.</p>
<p>Karachi Chief Meteorologist Amir Hyder Laghari <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915067">pointed out</a> yesterday that there was a historical fault line which has become activated, causing frequent earthquakes in the city.</p>
<p>He said the fault is releasing its seismic energy, and when it‚Äôs spent, the tremors‚Äô magnitude will reduce. Laghari added he expected the small-scale jolts to end within a week.</p>
<p>Murad‚Äôs remarks today echoed opinions voiced by Laghari and other experts, who have said that the chances of a major quake in Karachi are low.</p>
<p>Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates ‚Äî the Arabian, Eurasian and Indian ‚Äî <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say#:~:text=Tectonic%20positioning">according to</a> geological engineer Muhammad Rehan, creating five seismic zones within the country.</p>
<p>Dr Imran Ahmed Khan of Karachi University‚Äôs Department of Geography said an imbalance between the Indian, Eurasian and Arabian plates may be causing the tremors in the city. He added that the quakes will likely stop when a balance between the plates has been achieved.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Dr Adnan Khan, associate professor at the KU‚Äôs Department of Geology, noted that a huge earthquake was unlikely in Karachi as the city was situated far from active plate boundaries.</p>
<p>‚ÄúKarachi lies on what‚Äôs called a ‚Äòpassive margin‚Äô, so the chances of a big earthquake happening there are low. Small earthquakes do happen sometimes, usually between 3 and 4 on the Richter scale, but they are not dangerous,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Dr Imran explained that the Indian tectonic plate is moving upward by about 4 to 5 centimetres every year in the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Eurasian plate is pushing against it. As these two plates press against each other, they build up pressure, and when the pressure becomes too much, it rebounds and is released as energy, causing earthquakes.</p>
<p>The country had witnessed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893511/slew-of-small-tremors-prevent-major-quakes-experts-say">around 20</a> low-intensity earthquakes in the first half of February ‚Äî an average of more than one tremor each day.</p>
<p>In April, jolts were felt in parts of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905258">Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab</a> ‚Äî including Peshawar, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore ‚Äî <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903840">twice</a> that month.</p></p>

                <h2>ADB approves $800m to boost Pakistan‚Äôs public finance</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved $800 million programme to strengthen fiscal sustainability and improve public financial management in Pakistan, according to a statement issued by the Philippines-based lender.</p>
<p>The statement read that subprogramme 2 of the ‚ÄúImproved Resource Mobilisation and Utilisation Reform Programme‚Äù includes a policy-based loan of $300m, and ADB‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst ever policy-based guarantee‚Äù of up to $500m, which is expected to mobilise financing of up to $1 billion from commercial banks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan has made significant progress in improving <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903106">macroeconomic</a> conditions,‚Äù said ADB country director for Pakistan, Emma Fan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis programme backs the government‚Äôs commitment to further policy and institutional reforms that will strengthen public finances and promote sustainable growth.‚Äù</p>
<p>The programme supports far-reaching reforms to improve <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912734">tax policy</a>, administration, and compliance, while enhancing public expenditure and cash management.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt also promotes digitalisation, investment facilitation, and private sector development. These measures aim to reduce Pakistan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911133">fiscal deficit</a> and public debt, while creating space for social and development spending,‚Äù the Manila-headquartered institution said.</p>
<p>The programme is underpinned by a comprehensive support package ‚Äîincluding technical assistance and close coordination with development partners ‚Äî designed to help Pakistan build long-term fiscal resilience and stability, it added.</p>
<p>Khurram Schehzad, adviser to the finance minister, confirmed that the financial institution has approved the programme. ‚ÄúDiplomacy led by Economic Affairs &amp; Ministry of Finance secures majority support at ADB Board,‚Äù he said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/kschehzad/status/1929815577738027202" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X.¬∂
